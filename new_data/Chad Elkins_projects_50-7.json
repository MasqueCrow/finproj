Not with words, but with the grandiose knockers that adorn them. In Spanish colonial times, the knockers announced your occupation and your social status. Lions, lizards, sea creatures, and hands proclaimed the homes' occupants as Soldiers, Nobles, Fishermen, and the Clergy. The beautiful Door cards depict some of the most recognizable historic aldabas, brought to life through the art of Colombian artistJuan Vargas.\nAldabas is a puzzly tableau-builder in which you seek to fill your neighborhood with the most influential citizens. On each turn, you'll take actions to build your neighborhood or increase your wealth. Clever placement will unlock bonuses, but only if you build up your influence with the different professions wisely\u2026 it\u2019s not enough to merely win over a profession, you must also satisfy its conditions well, to really reap the rewards it has to offer! Each profession has different priorities, so make sure that you keep an eye on how to score best from the ones that you favor!\nThe Aldabas campaign will not have any Stretch Goals. The game will be produced at high quality from the start, and the game system is so tightly designed that added content of the sort that Kickstarter campaigns usually feature (new characters, scenarios, etc) are not really suitable. Aldabas stands strong as a finished project without the need to 'stretch' into anything beyond what we are presenting here.\nThere are a few Kickstarter Enhancements that will make the Kickstarter Edition of Aldabas more deluxe than the (still gorgeous) version that will go to retail. Scroll down below the Game Elements to see what is special in the Kickstarter Edition!\nGame play is simple. On your turn you will take two of the three available actions (either two different actions, or the same one twice):\n1) Gain two Coins. Take two coins from the supply into your purse.\nRunning low on cash? Having available currency is key to your long term plans.\n2) Buy a Door. There are five cards available for you to choose in the dock. The first two are free, then the remaining three increase in cost from one to three coins. Pick a card, pay its cost, and take it to hand.\nNew people come to Cartagena every day, and you must entice them to your neighborhood from the dock!\n3) Play a Door card to your block. You must follow the placement rules: No empty block spaces may be below or to the left of the new Door, and a Door can't go beside or above another Door of the same color.\nWhen you add a Door to your block, you can activate the Power of the new door, and the powers of the doors that are right next to it.\nHere we see the placed door gaining you three Coins from the supply, the red door to the left allows you to place a Coin from your supply onto a Door (increasing your influence there), and the Blue door below has an Ongoing Ability which doesn't activate right now.\nThe game will end in one of three ways:\nOne player completes their tableau (four cards wide by three cards high)\nThe coins in the supply run out\nThe deck is depleted and the dock cannot be completely filled\nThe triggering player finishes their turn, every other player gets one more turn, then the game ends and scoring begins. Coins in your vault are worth 2 points each. Some Doors award points directly. Having the most Influence overall will get you a reward. But the most important way to earn points is from the Professions. Each Profession rewards the player with the most Influence over it; you will resolve them one at a time. If you have the most Influence over a Profession, you'll benefit from its unique scoring method; second place gets a weaker version of the benefit.\nIn this example, you have the most Influence on Soldiers, so you win that category. The Soldier scoring condition says that you earn 3 points for each Noble card in your block; you have two Nobles, so you score 6 points!\nIf you are a more visual learner, check out this comprehensive How to Play video by Paul Marchbanks of The Dicey Review!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery campaign comes with its own challenges. We are confident that you will get a game that you\u2019ll love to play AND proudly display on your game shelf.\n\nThe art and mechanics for Aldabas are complete, so once this campaign ends, we'll be ready to submit print files.\n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition. This can happen for various reasons such as manufacturing issues, freight delays, and even importing the games to the various regions of the world. Although we have budgeted a year to bring Aldabas to your doorstep, delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore this timeline is only an estimate. We are working to do everything we can to meet our goal of getting Aldabas to you by Apr 2022.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation. We have worked with many of these partners before, so we are optimistic that everything will go as planned. We have full faith that your games will be delivered to you safe and in a timely fashion.\n\nA note on our track record:\n\nSuccessful and timely fulfillment of 6 projects over 4 years including the following games: Unreal Estate, Pocket Ops, The Artemis Project, Endeavor: Age of Sail, Endangered, Endeavor: Age of Expansion. (Gorinto, Endangered: New Species, and The Belgian Beers Race are underway.)\n\nOUR REFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge in full within 10 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including all fees. After that period, we will also refund your pledge, no questions asked, minus 15% cancellation fee, which represents all of the fees associated with the Kickstarter, our pledge manager, payment processing, and our work. This project is in USD and refunds will also be processed in USD, excluding applicable fees. No reward pledges will not be refunded. If you do not complete the pledge manager by our required deadline, you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. The pledge manager will be open for sufficient time, and multiple reminders will be sent.\n\nWe want you to be happy! We promise to keep you in the loop every step of the way. If you have any questions, send us a direct message, email us at marc@grandgamersguild.com, or simply comment on the campaign.

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

The pledge manager will be open for sufficient time to complete it, and we will send several reminders as well. \nYou are new to Kickstarter and don't really know how it works? No worries, here is how you can participate and support our project:\n Create a Kickstarter account. It only takes a few clicks. \n Choose 1 of 3 pledge levels. The 3 pledge levels differentiate in the number of games you will receive and the price you will pay. See more under \"pledges\".\nIf we reach or exceed our funding goal at the end of our campaign, your credit card will be charged according to the pledge you have chosen. If we do not reach our goal, you will not be charged.\nSoon after the campaign ends we will reach out to you via email, so you can enter your shipping address, select the languages for your games and pay for shipping costs. The final shipping cost will be calculated then and may slightly vary from the estimate you see here.\nAs soon as we know how many games we need to produce for each language we will kick off production and will get the games in your hands as fast as we can. \nIf you want to sell Hidden Leader in your store you can check out this page and find the right contact person from the list of our publishing partners. During the Kickstarter campaign we don't offer any specific retailer pledges or deals.

Thanks for being here.\n\nKickstarter is not an online shop. Therefore, we want to make you aware of the inherent risks of crowdfunding. It is our goal to provide you with the best game possible and to create a satisfying product for you and us. Still, making a board game is a complex and time consuming task and especially when financing things over Kickstarter there is never a 100% certainty that all will turn out as we envision it right now. Therefore minor changes can happen until the game arrives at your door. Especially in these uncertain times we cannot guarantee that no delays will happen along the delivery line, but we promise to never compromise on quality.\n\nBy supporting us on Kickstarter you support the idea of the game and its artwork and we promise to reward you with a fun game. You can track our changes and work in progress by following us on Twitter or other social media sites and by having a look at our blog. We will always keep you up to date about any decisions or changes along the way and are always glad to hear your feedback.\n\nWe are well prepared for providing you with a game that you will love, for three reasons:\n\n1) We have finished all of our artwork already and secured all the rights for it. The game will come with the artwork you can see all over social media already. Only small changes in the visual design might happen. \n2) We have set our time tables well. We did extensive research and used our product management experience to estimate this process well. In the worst case scenario, we will rather delay the delivery before compromising on your game experience.\n3) Our manufacturer has an established track record in the board game industry and we carefully evaluate the quality of our prototypes. Also we are working with fulfillment companies and experiences localisation partners to ensure that they can handle the campaign easily.\n\nWe thank you for all your support.

We will make every effort to reduce and where possible eliminate or absorb your VAT and other tariffs while abiding by local government regulations and customs.\nWhat does it mean that TRANSMISSIONS is EXCLUSIVE to KICKSTARTER?\nTransmissions will likely never see retail, so everything you see here is currently exclusive to Kickstarter. In other words, we can make no guarantees this game will appear anywhere else for sale. Why? Because it's crowded out there! We currently have no distributors who will get the game to retailers. So if you don't back it here, you may not see it anywhere. Although we do hope at least a few brave retailers will back us for their store, and there may be some copies left after the campaign is over, there are no guarantees.

He also likes to make pictures of robots.\nTransmissions is a series of illustrations which attempt to examine feelings and emotion that might be difficult to express in other ways. What began in 2006 with a single painting has grown into a long-running personal project which now comprises over 200 images, published across seven volumes of Transmissions art books.

If this is your first Meeple Source Kickstarter project, welcome! And if it isn't, welcome back!\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter project, so it really means something when we say that this project includes the most exciting variety of game upgrades to date. We hope that you will pull up a chair, stay a while, and take this journey with us.\nThis is expected to be our only Kickstarter project in 2021, so we are giving you everything we've got! We have new upgrades for popular series like Scythe, Wingspan, and The West Kingdom Trilogy. We're adding beautiful pieces to our line of upgrades for Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Concordia, Caverna, Agricola, and Grand Austria Hotel. Hot new games are definitely represented here as well, with sets designed especially for Lost Ruins of Arnak, Obsession, Darwin's Journey, Creature Comforts, Hallertau, Bonfire, New York Zoo, Dominant Species: Marine, Tekhenu, and Tawantinsuyu. And that's not all! Isle of Cats, Taverns of Tiefenthal, Fields of Arle, Carpe Diem, Keyper, Keyflower: The Farmers, and Key Market, Dice Settlers, A Feast for Odin, Cat Lady, Clans of Caledonia, Wendake, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, Reykholt, and Underwater Cities are all shown some massive love in this project!\nWith so many game upgrades offered in this project (and likely a few more to come along the way), we are offering some of our pledge levels in a different way than we have in the past. We are calling these first few upgrades \"Featured Pledge Levels\", and you can pledge for them by simply browsing the list of Kickstarter pledge levels and selecting it, just as you normally would with any Kickstarter project. If you scroll down further, you will get to the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which will be used for all of the other upgrades.\nAll of the other game upgrades, including partial sets (when shown as a project option), are being combined in the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which shows a cost of $1. You can/should still pledge for the combined amount for your desired game upgrades. Although different from the way we have done this in the past, we are hoping that a simplified format will make a project with as many options as this easier to navigate.\nIn Kickstarter, you will only choose one pledge level as your primary pledge, but it is certainly possible to pledge for multiple things here.  To do so, simply select one of the upgrades as your \"main pledge level\", then select \"add-ons\" for your other upgrade(s) you want as well. Additionally, there will be an intuitive process in BackerKit (the post-project order management and survey software we use) to handle the multiple upgrades and choices. You can take advantage of our flat-rate shipping offer by bundling an unlimited number of upgrades from this project with no additional shipping cost.\nThe popularity of flat-rate shipping cannot be understated, so that's what we're doing. The amount varies by country, but the shipping amount is fixed, no matter how many upgrades and add-ons you pledge for. The flat shipping rate within the United States is $7, and other countries have a flat rate of $9-$15.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties and/or fees owed at delivery, these are still your responsibility. This used to only rarely happen though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind. BUT, things are changing, at least in some countries. Read on...\nIf we are required to collect VAT for your order before the project ships, that cost will be collected in BackerKit (our chosen post-project management/fulfillment tool). This will almost certainly be necessary for UK backers (see more below), and likely EU backers as well. If at the point we need to collect the VAT for your shipment, you are unhappy with the amount or process, you will have the opportunity to cancel some or all of your pledge, but we will have to reduce the refund at that time by the amount of the non-refundable Kickstarter fees for your transaction. \n2021 has already seen huge changes in transit, tariffs, and international business. We are running this project in good faith, and will be transparent with what needs to happen to get you the fancy upgrades that you desire! :-) \nThere are also a number of countries that we are not able to ship to, due to known limitations and/or difficulty delivering successfully in the past. The list of countries that we CAN ship to are: United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other than the UK (see special circumstances below), if you don't live in one of these countries, pledging for this project will be difficult. Options that you may have are to combine your order with a friend who lives in a serviced country, or to use a US-based mail/package forwarding service. There are many out there, and some of our customers from around the world use them regularly. \nYou might be aware that we are not currently shipping to the UK on our website. We hope to change this soon, but Brexit-related changes to importing/exporting (at least for small companies such as ourselves) have proven maddening. Our distinct expectation is that it will be a thing of the past by the time we are fulfilling this project. Assuming so, we will have to collect the VAT for your pledge, and will file that on your behalf at that time (resulting in a seamless and fee-free delivery). But, if we are unable to accomplish this, we will refund 100% of your pledge (we will absorb the Kickstarter fees mentioned above, in this case). For a variety of reasons though, we would like you to make your pledge (no matter what it's for) as a $1 (+shipping) pledge in the \"UK Backers Only\" pledge level. We can sort everything else out with you individually in BackerKit afterward. We apologize for this admittedly wonky process, but our alternative was to exclude UK backers from the project, which we really didn't want to do.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Siblings Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions (in a non-COVID year!), you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for most of these upgrades is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our Wingspan birds, Raiders of the North Sea upgrades, Architects of the West Kingdom meeples, as well as a number of our other more recent upgrades! \nWe are also excited to offer a set of meeples by a guest artist for Darwin's Journey, Paolo Voto, who is the artist for the game itself!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with our a few of our most recent upgrades...\nWingspan: Oceania Bird Meeples\nNectar Tokens for Wingspan: Oceania\nPaladins of the West Kingdom Meeples\nRaiders of the North Sea Meeples\nResources for Raiders of the North Sea\nTomesaga/Overlord Meeples for Viscounts of the West Kingdom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for over nine years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 14 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. We quality-control every meeple individually by hand and ship all orders in-house, and we also use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you probably know that we are very straight-forward with regard to the progress of our projects, and will let you know if we encounter any delays. We did have an unfortunate technological hiccup with regard to Kickstarter emails/messages during the final phase of fulfillment of our last project, and can assure you that we will pay closer attention than ever, and won't have a lapse in response like we did at that time. \n\nWe believe that we have allotted enough time in the production and delivery schedule to account for the types of situations that could arise, but unexpected delays are still always possible. Our last few Kickstarter projects delivered early, and although this could occur again, we obviously can't promise that.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Meeple Source reserves the right to cancel any pledge, although we have never had to exercise this right in the past.\n\nAny VAT that Meeple Source is required to collect and remit on your behalf will be collected in BackerKit (the 3rd party pledge manager that we use) - it is not already built-in to the listed prices on Kickstarter that are applicable to all backers.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in BackerKit and the package is returned to us as undeliverable, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any selected add-ons.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, Meeple Source will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nIf you do not log in to BackerKit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. If you need more time to complete your BackerKit survey, you must contact us. Meeple Source reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into the BackerKit system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge for this project.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email meeplesource@gmail.com for further information.

Shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, which will allow us to reduce the cost to backers should we find a more cost-effective shipping partner in a backer's region. Our pledge manager will use the shipping address to calculate and charge the shipping costs for the rewards. We have worked to offset this cost as much as possible and are offering a shipping discount to all backers.\nShipping has changed dramatically and has become extremely challenging in the last year. We are working with Quartermaster Logistics, OTX Logistics and SimplyVAT to make this experience as painless as possible for both our backers and us.  We are new to several of the shipping processes that we are undertaking, and we sincerely appreciate your patience throughout this journey.\nWe will prepay applicable duty/customs-related Import VAT taxes. Based on our previous campaigns, we anticipate that backers in one of the above regions will not have any Import VAT fees associated with receiving the reward package (e.g. clearance, customs, etc.).  Backers outside of the above regions, may experience customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees.\nIn compliance with the UK and EU laws, Sales VAT will be collected in our pledge manager for UK and EU backers. Sales VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will appear as a separate line item in the pledge manager.  Some regions require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, this should be kept in mind as one plans while backing this project.\nIf you are interested in carrying Long Shot: The Dice Game in your store, please let us know by using the contact form at perplext.com, found HERE.\n\n\\", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nPerplext, LLC is a game publishing company established in 2001 and 'Long Shot: The Dice Game' is Perplext's fourth KickStarter project.\n\nWe have carefully selected and developed this project to ensure that we are bringing the best gaming experience possible to the hobby. Though you are taking a risk by pledging, our commitment to backers, the product, and the game industry as a whole, is our outright full-time focus. That being said, images used for this Kickstarter, card counts, components, horse names, packaging and rules may be subject to change. \n\nWe have had very few issues with delivery timelines and product quality on previous projects. The estimated delivery date of 'Long Shot: The Dice Game' is February, 2022, however this is only an estimate. Delays outside of our control may occur due to production, manufacturing, shipping, and/or customs. The nature and logistics of international shipping may result in backers from different regions of the world receiving their rewards sooner than others. We appreciate your support and thank you sincerely for patience in advance of any potential snags in fulfillment. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this project, individuals agree to conduct all public interactions with our project, team and other backers, via Kickstarter, in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the ejection of the backer from the campaign and the cancellation of the corresponding pledge (with a full refund). Perplext reserves the right at any time and for any reason to cancel a pledge (with a full refund). \n\nBy pledging for a reward, the backer acknowledges that the final components and content are subject to change .If for any reason Perplext cannot fulfill a part of an order, we will provide a pro-rated refund for that portion of the reward. If a backer does not confirm the pledge in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of our email notification to \u2018confirm your pledge\u2019, the backer agrees that Perplext has fulfilled its obligation in full for payment or donations received. At our discretion, Perplext may refund the backer or ship the reward if contact is made to confirm the pledge outside the 8-week window.\n\nWe make every effort to ensure that rewards are shipped safely. Minor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. If a backer believes a reward has sustained more than minor cosmetic damage, immediately contact Perplext by sending images and informational context to info@perplext.com. We ask that backers in this scenario keep all packaging, including outer cartons, for future inspection. Perplext maintains sole discretion in determining \u201cmore than minor cosmetic damage.\u201d .\n\nIf Perplext ships to the address provided via our Pledge Manager and the package is returned as undeliverable, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the reward again to an updated address. If it is delivered to that address and the backer is unable to receive it, is no longer the occupant of the address, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the package to the updated address. If the package is lost or stolen after delivery, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the order again. Should the package be held in customs or by a government agency, the backer may be required to contact the agency directly for the package\u2019s release, as Perplext\u2019s ability to assist may be limited. \n\nPlease refrain from pledging if you do not accept these terms.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time.

As for Pendulum, we have more information on our website.

The flat shipping rate within the United States is only $6, and other countries have a flat rate of $8-$16.\n If you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level as you normally would, and add the amount of the additional set(s) to the total amount pledged. It's that easy!\n We don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\n All orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL.

We first discovered Dollars to Donuts during a company summit in Washington State. Shawn & Molly from Flatout came down to visit us and show off their games in development. From the moment we first played this charming game, we knew we had to publish it. \nHere we are almost exactly 2 years later, with the game fully developed and delightfully illustrated by Dylan Mangini. We're this close to having the game in our hands, and all we need is your help deciding how much awesome to pack in the box! \nDollars to Donuts is already a complete game. However, we've come up with a bunch of things we'd love to do with it that are typically beyond the reach of a traditional retail release - including some pie in the sky stuff that we just might be able to pull off, but only with your help.\nWe're offering Dollars to Donuts at a significant discount from the final retail price. Especially if we unlock most or all of the stretch goals we have planned, the value you'll see in the box for just $29 is outstanding. \nBackers are also guaranteed to receive their copies before anyone else. The only copies you'll see in stores or conventions before you receive yours will be offered by retailers who back this campaign - because they're backers, too (see below).\nBeyond that are the practical effects of every dollar pledged to this campaign. We've made sure every milestone in this campaign improves the final product you'll receive, and that every improvement is as significant as it can possibly be. You can find a short list of the first couple upgrades in the Stretch Goals section below, but in the meantime we wanted to offer you another way to tangibly improve the game even before we actually fund...\nWe encourage retailers to consider the $50 Dollars to Donuts Retailer pledge level. That tier includes 3 copies of the game, which is discounted even further than the already discounted backer price of $29 per copy. You may of course add multiple sets of 3 copies, each for an additional $50. \nWe love our brick & mortar partners across the world and we want you to benefit just as much as everyone else, so we are including everything we offer to any backer in this campaign to you at exactly the same time and in exactly the same quantities. That's important, so let's say it again...\nYou automatically earn the same stretch & social goal rewards as everyone else. \nWe know it's a burden for retailers to tie up funds for the longer period required for a Kickstarter campaign, so we promise that all retail backers will be included in the first shipping wave. \nWe also want to remind you that all items offered in this campaign are entirely ready for production right now. \nThank you shop owners and operators everywhere for supporting us for over 15 years!

To thank our followers for helping us to make some fun board games over the last six years, we have lowered the pledge price for this game as low as it can go. We have subsidised shipping costs as much as we can. We don't want you to miss out on pledging for Whale Riders, because we aren't sure how many copies will make it to retail.\nWhale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from famed game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players will race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible, to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasures, or will you make your money slowly along the way?\nEach player has two actions per turn, but a lot they will want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game will end and the player with the most pearls will win!\nEach copy of Whale Riders will be carefully planned, prepared and packed. Here is a list of all you will receive. Oh! And please see the Stretch Goals section below for more info on how these components may be further improved and expanded during our campaign...\nThere are a few different pledge levels for our campaign. In summary, this is what you will receive at each level...\nYou will be able to choose to receive your game in English/French or Spanish in the Pledge Manager.\nRetailers: Before selecting the retailer-only pledge level, please contact us through this link: https://support.murano-alliance.com/retailers to discuss your particular enquiry. Proof of eligibility will be collected via a retailer survey upon completion of the campaign and will need to be submitted before receiving and finalising your pledge manager. Retailers will be able to order a number of copies of each title offered during this campaign.\nWhale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players. It has a classic feel - similar to many of (famed game designer) Knizia\u2019s great designs - but also feels new, sleek and (of course) fun!\n\u2192 Watch Stella and Tarrant form Meeple University teach you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nAs well as the board game Whale Riders, we are offering the small card game Whale Riders: The Card Game to backers during this campaign for a low price! Unlike its big sister, The Card Game is not planned to be sold at retail. Copies will only be made available through this (and perhaps a future KS) campaign, and directly through our online store or at a convention. We hope you may consider backing for both games at our ALL ABOARD pledge level.\nWhale Riders: The Card Game, 2-4 players will sail alongside each other to buy goods along the Ice Coast. What is on offer at the ports will vary in quantity. Sometimes you will be working together with others only to become competitors again when a better proposition comes along. This is a re-implementation of Reiner Knizia's previously released card game, Trendy.\nJust like the Whale Riders board game, the card game is also designed by Reiner Knizia and illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, but it is a much smaller game that plays totally different to the board game\u2026\n\u2192 Watch David from Grail Games (and friends) show you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nWith your help, we can make Whale Riders even better!

And, to reduce taxes and fees, games will ship to backers from within the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia*!\n*Australian and NZ backers have the option of paying extra to receive their copies of the game earlier - posted directly from China (and not from within Australia 1-2 months later). If you would like to take this offer, back at the regular shipping level now, and we will give you the option to pay extra in our pledge manager after the campaign. (Note that the 6-pack is not available for express shipping as the package will be overweight).\nBy supporting Whale Riders on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us to produce the game(s) in the first place, but if you back now, you will also receive them:\nat a cheaper than MSRP price,\nwith Whale Riders: The Card Game (if you wish), also heavily discounted and only available through Kickstarter and directly through Grail Games,\nearlier than anyone else will get the games, and,\nwe will be providing copies of some other titles to backers of this campaign at a reduced price as a thank you to you (Yellow & Yangtze and others via our post-campaign pledge manager)!\nBut that's not all\u2026\nThe Whale Riders titles were designed by well-known designer Reiner Knizia (of Lost Cities, Pickomino, Medici, Yellow & Yangtze fame, and much much more). He knows how to make a small game fire on all cylinders!\nThe Whale Riders titles are easy to learn games that are approachable and can be played by almost anyone.\nThe production files are ready to be uploaded to the printer right after the campaign is successfully funded. We will do all we can to deliver on time!\nThe games are full of beautiful illustrations by fan-favourite illustrator Vincent Dutrait.\nCountless hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience.\nWe are committed to fulfilling all Kickstarter pledges before they are available at retail. And on that point: We appreciate the support of game stores and see them as an essential part of our hobby. However, in today's crowded marketplace, our titles are becoming harder and harder to find by customers. Whale Riders will appear in stores, but at this stage, we don't believe it will be widely available. Your best bet is to back now (and at our super-low price - MSRP will be $30USD+) should you want to be sure of owning the game.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nDesigner - Reiner Knizia\nDr. Reiner Knizia is one of the world\u2019s most successful and prolific game designers. More than 600 of his games and books have been published worldwide in over 50 languages and have won him numerous international awards.\n\nArtist - Vincent Dutrait\nVincent Dutrait is currently one of the most highly regarded illustrators of board and card games in the world.

We focus on reprints, and producing English language versions of great games from Asia and Europe.

However, it would not have been possible without the support of 13 of your favorite publishers who partnered with me to see their logo, as well as their most popular games turned into handmade component mosaics. Whether you want to brighten up your kitchen, geek up your office so you can have your co-workers ask you about board games, or spruce up your game room - this is the perfect calendar for you. \nEvery image I create takes between 3 to 8 hours to assemble. Sometimes I use a reference image to help me with proportions, but I also like to go with the flow for some creations. I begin the process by choosing the colors I need from the game boxes I know contain the right pieces. Once I have the correct components, I plan out where each part will go. As I carefully lay the pieces I am constantly moving them into just the right place! I use a pencil to move pieces in tight areas because it helps with precision. Photographing each image takes almost an hour. Depending on which pieces I have used for the mosaic, the angle of the lighting needs to be adjusted. There is a lot of trial and error when taking the shots, and climbing up a chair over top of my gaming table is time consuming! \nPLAY\n\n\nEvery month has a component mosaic of a well-known board game as the main image, as well as a mosaic of that publisher's logo.\nThere is a write up about the publisher, including their website so you can check out their games.\nThe calendar includes a section to write the games you played during the month.\nAt the end of the calendar, you will find a 10x10 challenge page!\n\n\nPLAY\n\nYou asked for prints, coasters and magnets; so here is your chance!

Daryl Andrews, Rob Byers and Steve Robertson, thank you for lending me games for components I needed but did not have. Helaina Cappel(Burnt Island Games), thank you for you help with the campaign.

In 2019, we brought Fire Tower to life with the support of an amazing community of nearly 1700 backers. Now, we are back on Kickstarter for a second printing and to introduce the Rising Flames Expansion to add to the core game.    \nFire Tower is a fast-paced, tactical pattern-laying game that takes 15-30 minutes to play. You must protect your lookout tower from a rapidly spreading forest fire. Dispatch smokejumpers and fire engines to combat the blaze and construct firebreaks to fortify your tower.\nBut there is a twist! In Fire Tower, you also take on the role of nature. Harness the power of the wind to push the blaze towards your opponents and unleash an arsenal of fire cards to take down their towers before they can reach yours. \nIn the Rising Flames Expansion, rapid crown fires, heavy winds, and tumultuous weather threaten the forest. Defend your tower with a powerful new deck and a flock of legendary firehawks. Beware the growing influence of the Shadow of the Wood, as destroyed towers now have a host of new abilities to claim a surprise victory. The Rising Flames Expansion adds solo and fifth player mode, along with new variants of play and a flock of custom meeples. \nThe second edition of Fire Tower includes all unlocked stretch goals and the same high-quality components as the first edition, Kickstarted in 2018. \n* Enhanced by an unlocked stretch goal (see below for details)\nThe standard expansion will fit into the base game and is made with high-quality components, like 310 gsm blue core cards with a linen finish. It comes with all the same content as the deluxe expansion. See below for the new components and upgrades that are included in the deluxe expansion.  \n* Enhanced by an unlocked stretch goal (see below for details)\nThe deluxe expansion will fit into the base game and includes everything in the standard expansion as well as an acrylic eternal flame centerpiece and cloth bag for your components. The deluxe also includes upgrades, such as screen-printed hawk meeples, a custom engraved Shadow Die, and custom lightning tokens. All cards are 310gsm blue core with a linen finish. \n Fan us on Board Game Geek (101/100) Unlocked! \n Like us on Facebook (1004/1000) Unlocked! \n Share on Facebook (310/300) Unlocked! \n Follow us on Instagram (1000/1000) Unlocked! \n Subscribe to our Mailing List \n Follow us on Twitter \nBefore learning the expansion, you have to learn the base game.

We worked tirelessly on Fire Tower to create a high quality, beautiful and fun game, and to lay the groundwork for a business. Our first Kickstarter was invaluable in helping us do that. Fire Tower was finished, manufactured, and fulfilled within eight months and all of our backers received the game by the estimated delivery date. \nWe've shown Fire Tower at nearly 30 conventions and have playtested Rising Flames with over 1,000 gamers. The expansion is a thrilling new addition to the world of Fire Tower that deepens the theme and mechanics of the game, while at the same time staying true to the original experience. We've listened to your advice, and have fine-tuned Rising Flames to be a game we are sure you'll love. \nPlaying the expansion at PAX South\nYour support is the only way we can make Rising Flames a reality!\nWe are offering Fire Tower, the Rising Flames expansion, and our mini-expansions at a discounted rate for the duration of this Kickstarter. After the campaign is over, the price will go up.\nYour pledge will help us reach stretch goals that will enhance the game even further, making the game better for everyone!\nDesigned by Firescale Studio\nYou get to fight the fire. You get to BE the fire. You even control a flock of arsonist hawks. We are the only purely competitive game about fighting forest fires that we know of (let us know if you find another one). And if that's not enough, here are few other points we think are pretty neat:\n The artwork. If you're familiar with Kevin Ruelle's vibrant watercolors, you already know that we lucked out having him as our artist. We\u2019re excited to unveil new paintings and designs with his unique style in our expansion. Check out some of his other work here.\n Easy to learn. Fire Tower takes about 5 minutes to learn and Rising Flames takes just a few minutes more. Need proof? Check out our How To Play videos above.\n Easy to set up. \"Let's play Fire Tower,\" you say. You'll be set up and playing in just a couple minutes. Time it and let us know.\n Made for visual learners. We hate reading the fine print, which is why we have simple graphics on each card to clue you into the rules, saving new players from having to constantly refer to the rule book.\n The components.

The fact that Kickstarter provides an avenue for designers to print their product is a dream come true.

Kickstarter will ensure that we are able to do that. \nPhoto by Roque Nonini\nIf this is your first Kickstarter and you haven't backed before, follow these simple steps:\n1.

So it's no surprise that the construction of the station was riddled with problems. Funding cuts, shifting geopolitical climates, engineering setbacks - these were all just part of the job.

This spacewalk was supposed to be the final step, but a couple of faulty power cables forced the astronauts to abort. Of the six cables needed, two would not fully attach to the facility.

The jungle ecosystem is full of symbiosis, and players must grow tall trees and lush jungle plants to attract the most diverse wildlife. By carefully selecting what grows in your forest you can create the ideal balance of flora and fauna and give rise to a thriving ecosystem.  \n*Solo and 3-4 player variants unlocked! \nSee below for our full plan to make Canopy as environmentally friendly as possible.\nCanopy is played over three Seasons. Each Season, players endeavor to create a successful rainforest by collecting Plants, Trees, Wildlife and Weather cards.\nGather plants in specific sets to maximize their points. Grow tall and numerous trees to win valuable bonuses. Attract a diverse array of wildlife to help you manage and grow your forest with unique abilities. Beware - as there are threats to the forest as well and the risk of fire, disease and drought is ever-present.\nDesigned by Tim Eisner and beautifully illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, Canopy is designed to play quickly and appeal to a wide range of players. It offers push-your-luck drafting, strategic set collection, meaningful choices and invites players to create their own vibrant rainforest tableau. \n*All components are prototype and may change during final printing.\n(Digital Mock-up. Actual puzzle will be even more beautiful)\nThe Canopy puzzle add-on comes in a separate box and costs $18 plus shipping.  We've just added two new pledge tiers (Retail + Puzzle and Deluxe + Puzzle). If you have already pledged you can switch to one of these tiers or add this to your pledge by clicking on the manage pledge option and increase your pledge by $18. Shipping costs are listed in the Shipping section below. \n Read the full Geekdad review here: https://bit.ly/2YSzWLy\n German Language video preview from Brettspielhero here:  https://bit.ly/2YqMLOi\n  Follow this link to read the full Gaming with Sidekicks review: https://bit.ly/3fMvgxO\n  Read the full One Board Family review here: https://bit.ly/2VpL8yH\n Here at Weird City Games, we love making board games and we love nature. In recent years we have become increasingly concerned about the effects of climate change on the natural world, and with our own impacts through manufacturing games. When the idea of Canopy came to us, we immediately saw it as an opportunity to work towards making our board games in a more sustainable manner, and working to offset negative impacts. \nWhile we are a small company, we feel it is important to bring our desire for change into our love of making games. We are learning as we go and doing what is feasible for this first project. We see this as the first step of many to making our games in the most sustainable manner possible. \nWe hope that highlighting the unique and wondrous species that live within the rainforest will help connect people to this essential part of our environment. And hopefully, it will spark meaningful conversations and a desire to make sure we all do what we can to protect these wondrously diverse forests.\nSteps we are taking to make the game sustainable include:\nFor each game we sell through Kickstarter we will be planting one tree in partnership with Tree Sisters, a fantastic non-profit based in the UK focused on tropical reforestation and the empowerment of women. \nProducing the game without any plastic. The plastic wrap on cards and the game box will be replaced with paper bands or small stickers. Ziploc bags will be replaced with sturdy paper envelopes.\nAll wood used in the game will come from FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified materials. \nAll chipboard components used in the game will come from post-consumer waste. \nKeeping the box size small to limit resources used in freight and domestic shipping.\nThank you for joining us and contributing to our goal of a sustainable future!\n Canopy is played over 3 Seasons. During each Season you will take turns selecting which cards to add to your rainforest from 3 New Growth piles. \nNew Growth: Each turn you will select cards from one New Growth pile. Each time you look at a pile you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face-down, adding 1 additional card. As the piles grow you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most. But choose carefully, as the jungle also contains threats in the form of fire, disease, and drought.\nGrow Your Forest: During each Season you will add cards to your rainforest. Carefully select an ideal balance of Trees, Weather, Wildlife, and Plants to grow a thriving ecosystem. At the end of each Season, you will discard all Plants, Weather, and Threat cards, leaving Trees and Wildlife to continue to grow.\nScore Sets: At the end of each Season you will gain points for your rainforest. Each card type offers a different way to score. Focus on attracting diverse Wildlife, building unique sets of Plants, growing the Tallest Trees, or creating ideal Weather patterns. \nRead the current Canopy Rulebook here.\nCanopy is a fully immersive and vibrant game that we are positive you will enjoy! The gameplay and components are already great, and we are confident it can become even better if you help us spread the word, rally the board gaming community, and exceed our basic funding goal.\nWe have unlocked all of the fantastic Stretch Goals planned to improve component quality and add additional content to Canopy! Thanks for helping us grow a mighty rainforest!\nThe cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. In the pledge manager, which will go out after the campaign finishes, you will be asked to fill out a backer survey and shipping will be charged at that time.\nBelow are the estimated shipping costs. We have incorporated a portion of the shipping costs into all pledges. (We do not expect prices to vary greatly, but those listed are estimates only and may fluctuate slightly.)\nWant Extra Copies: You may order multiple copies of the game and pay half of the shipping cost for each additional copy. (e.g. If you wanted two copies of the Canopy Deluxe game in Zone 2 you would pledge $58 for the games and estimated shipping would be $13.50.) \nWe have an estimated delivery date of June 2021, and we will be working diligently to get the game to all backers as early as possible.\nWe realize that shipping can be a great barrier  and we have done what we can to reduce that cost. We apologize for any difficulty this creates. We apologize that we DO NOT SHIP to: Afghanistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Burma, North Korea, Sudan.\n Eco-Friendly: For each game purchased through Kickstarter, we will plant one tree through our partnership with Tree Sisters.\n Get it First: Backers will receive Canopy before it is available at retail.\n Exclusive Version: Backers of the Deluxe level will receive the exclusive, deluxe version of the game which will not be sold through traditional retail. \n Awesome Stretch Goals: By pledging now you will help us unlock stretch goals to improve both the retail and deluxe versions of the game.\n Your Support is Essential: The game design and artwork are 95% complete and we need your help to make the game a reality.\n This project would not be possible without all of you, our wonderful backers. We seek to honor your vital contribution with our promise that backer copies of Canopy will be shipped out before Canopy is available for purchase from retailers or at conventions. You know what they say: the early Toucan gets the game...or something like that.\nOne of our favorite things about Kickstarter is that it can build and sustain community. We pledge to involve all of our backers in the creation of this project in as many meaningful ways as possible. This may include helping select new wildlife or plants to include in the game, suggesting new components, variants, rules editing, thematic advice, and more. We love your input and will do our best to incorporate as many of your ideas as we can.\nFurther, we pledge to keep you informed at every step along the way as our Kickstarter campaign unfolds. We value each of you and will ensure that you are fully satisfied with this project. Please feel free to contact us with any concerns, questions or ideas. Let's build this rainforest together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCanopy is the 5th Kickstarter campaign that we have managed and while we have learned a lot and are confident that we can deliver a successful project, we also know that unexpected things happen.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber. You can learn more about Tiny Epic Pirates by engaging with us in the comments, watching the videos below, or by downloading the rulebook below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals\nIncludes 7 Plastic Ship Minis!\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Pirates, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe components shown below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Crimson Silver Mini Expansion\nThe Crimson Silver Mini Expansion introduces new Floating Fortresses and Silver as a new resource!\nPlayers are able to visit the Floating Fortresses as they move around the board and perform upgraded versions of Trade, Plunder, and Crew Up. Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nIn Tiny Epic Pirates: Curse of Amdiak, rumors of the unthinkable are spreading quickly around the islands. Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates. It will share the same width and height as well. Making them great for storing side by side!\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion is available in the 'All-In Deluxe' reward tier or as an add-on in the pledge manager service after the project.\nAdditional Add-Ons \nDownload the prototype rulebook below! These are prototype rules and have not been edited for final production. This is not an exact reflection of the final rulebook.\nClick to download.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included!\nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer. If the project does very well, they will run out.\nPlease share this project with as many people as possible to help us achieve these goals and thank you for all the support!\nHere are the 20 stretch goals we've unlocked for this project! \nSolo Playthrough\n 2 Player Playthrough\n2 Player Playthrough with Crimson Silver \n2 Player Playthrough with Curse of Amdiak and Crimson Silver\n3 Player Playthrough\nFind out more about Tiny Epic Pirates and join the conversation HERE on BGG.\nBelow are previews of the game (in prototype form). These videos include content that are stretch goals and may not be unlocked yet.\nCheck out the videos to see what people are saying about the game.\n\"I like the tension between assigning your deckhands to the action spaces and using them to skip actions. \" - Jonathan H. Liu, Geek Dad.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Thus it seemed absolutely fitting early in development that our game be planned from the beginning using innovative ways in mind to save our own planet Earth. \n\nThe game manual will be delivered on a reusable USB drive instead of paper printed elements. Our goal is to save trees, reduce water contamination during the paper making process, and help protect the environment.\n\nGame manuals are usually not often used after players learn a game. Instead they are saved as out-of-date reference material unable to resolve errata and update themselves with new information. In the modern online age of always on devices, continuously updated PDFs and the use of efficient virtual data, paper is easily replaced when planned for properly. This provides for only the players that wish to print files an easy, digitally formatted and local method to do so if they wish. As such, sustainable actions to reduce paper waste, toxic chemicals, and ultimately less landfill refuse, was a goal of this project from the very beginning.\n\nAdditionally, our box and packaging were designed specifically for the items inside. As such, there are no fillers or extra cardboard spacers used in our project. We fit nearly 12 pounds of gaming material into our modest 12.5\"x12.5\"x6\" box perfectly, eliminating the need for extra wasteful materials.\nSustainable materials\nAll of our extensive unit prototyping was produced using bio-degradable \"green-plastics\" derived from corn. Our prototyping plastics offered a stable shelf life, without degrading or disintegrating, but remains biodegradable... a thankful position with the level of refinement each playing piece went through during development. \n\nWhile fully stable \"on the shelf\" for over 100 years, our prototyped plastics will begin to breakdown into simply carbon dioxide and water when exposed to heat and humidity for 60-90 days. Additionally, if burned, there are no toxic fumes are emitted when our plastics are incinerated.\n\nWe will work during general production to achieve a low impact solution on the injection molded elements as well.\nSomething else\nDuring the promotion of our Kickstarter campaign internationally, every email collected for our mailing list was met with a matched donation to \"The Planetary Society\" found online at www.planetary.org \n\nAs a game about space and planets, it seems more than fitting to support the cause of protecting our own planet Earth by aligning with The Planetary Society during our promotional phases.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "\"A Civilian\" - Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "As a civilian, this pledge level provides early, granted access to the pledge manager after the campaign closes.\nNote: With the World's situation currently, UPON FUNDNG, the pledge manager will remain open for an extended period of time allowing backers who may wish to increase their pledge thereafter the opportunity to do so and receive a \u201cFirst Edition\u201d game.\nWe are all in this together.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["98 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 149 or more", "title": "\"OverBattle\" Box Set - First Edition", "descp": "Kickstarter Exclusive - First Edition\n\"OverBattle: The All War\" Boxed Set including all unlocked stretch goals.\nFor this Kickstarter Exclusive, the box will be labeled, \"First Edition\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers", "Limited (1 left of 43)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 149 or more", "title": "\"OverBattle\" Box Set - First Edition", "descp": "Kickstarter Exclusive - First Edition\n\"OverBattle: The All War\" Boxed Set including all unlocked stretch goals.\nFor this Kickstarter Exclusive, the box will be labeled, \"First Edition\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["190 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "\"A Civilian\" - Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "As a civilian, this pledge level provides early, granted access to the pledge manager after the campaign closes.\nNote: With the World's situation currently, UPON FUNDNG, the pledge manager will remain open for an extended period of time allowing backers who may wish to increase their pledge thereafter the opportunity to do so and receive a \u201cFirst Edition\u201d game.\nWe are all in this together.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "17 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Update on Shipping, Freight and more!", "update_content": "We'll start as we always do, with our sincerest thanks to the OverBattle backers and Syther Gaming supporters!\nHello everyone. from the beginning I've been dedicated to an update at least every 30 days or sooner.

Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

For each shirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $70 AUD.\nIf you'd like to add on more skirts to your pledge, please make sure you're backing at the Skirt Pledge or the Shirt and Skirt Pledge level. For each skirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $100 AUD. \nTo quickly figure out which level you should back, and the total amount, please use our pledge calculator below! \nIf you're still not sure how to pledge, feel free to message us and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. \nThe size charts below will help you find your perfect fit! The best way to ensure we have your size is to find and measure a similar garment that you already own. You can also use the US and UK size equivalents as a guide, but we recommend measuring as well since sizing can be so variable between brands.\nPlease note that all of the measurements in the charts refer to the size of the garment, not your body measurements. We explain how to use them underneath each chart.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your skirt size, you'll need to get your waist measurement! Use a soft tape measure and measure around the smallest part of your waist (above your belly button and below your ribs). For a more detailed explanation of how to measure yourself, please see this link.\nThe back waistband of the skirt has elastic, and can stretch up to 10cm / 4\".\nIf you prefer a snug fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the high end of the waist measurement range (For example, a size 14 for an 87cm waist). This means the elastic will be more stretched when you wear it, and will feel firmer.\nIf you prefer a looser fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the low end of the range (For example, a size 20 for a 97cm waist). This means the elastic will be more relaxed on you.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your shirt size, we recommend measuring a similar button-up shirt you already own and feel comfortable in. Our shirts are semi-fitted, so make sure the shirt you're measuring isn't loose or baggy around the chest and waist.\nTo find your shirt's chest measurement, lay it flat on a hard surface and measure across the front from one underarm seam to the other. Please watch this video for a thorough guide of how to do this.\nOnce you have your shirt's chest measurement, round up to the next size in the size chart that will fit you. For example, for a 56cm chest you would size up to a M.\nYou can also take your shirt's shoulder width and length measurements, if you'd like to make sure that the size you've selected will fit. The videos linked below explain in detail how to do this:\nFinding your shirt's shoulder width\nFinding your shirt's length\nAll shipping will be handled in the pledge manager after the campaign is completed. You will be charged separately from your pledge on Kickstarter! \nThe chart below is an estimate of the shipping costs, based on your pledge level and your country.

We will do our best to get you a shipping estimate. You can message us through Kickstarter, or send an email to hello@ludocherry.com, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\nIf you are adding items onto your pledge, each additional shirt will add ~$3-6 shipping and each additional skirt will add ~$5-8 shipping.\nIf you are planning on ordering a large number of items and would like a more accurate estimate, please get in touch with us!\nIf you're a retailer interested in stocking LudoCherry in your store, or getting our clothing for your staff to wear to work, please get in touch with us!\nYou can email us at retail@ludocherry.com, or message us on Kickstarter.\n There are a few reasons! \nThe first is that Kickstarter allows us to raise the funds we need to actually make LudoCherry a reality. We\u2019ve already invested a large amount of our personal savings into developing our business, our fabric designs, and our clothing, but the amount of money required for a production run is beyond our reach. With your support, we'll be able to raise the money we need for the production run.\nKickstarter also allows us to solve many of the issues that traditional clothing brands face. Companies often create their clothes in limited size ranges and colours, to prevent profit loss on variations that don't sell. By using Kickstarter, and knowing in advance what our backers will be ordering, we\u2019re able to create a much more inclusive range. We'll be able to order more of the sizes and fabrics that are the most in demand, and reduce our loss on the less popular variations - meaning we can afford to create a wide range of sizes and fabrics for you to wear! \nFinally, Kickstarter allows us to interact directly with our community, and take your feedback and ideas on board. We want you to be as excited to wear LudoCherry as we are, so we want to use Kickstarter as a chance to talk with you about what we're doing well and what we could be doing better.\nFinally we'd like to extend a special thanks to some people who helped us make LudoCherry the best it can be.\nTo James Mathe, Jamey Stegmaier, Daniel Zayas, and Martyn Poole - Thank you for your contributions to the crowdfunding community, and for always being willing to give advice.\nTo Ted and Toni - Thank you for seeing my passion for the industry, and for all your support.\nTo Neil Thomson and the Albury Game Club - All of this is your fault.\nTo my parents - Thank you for always supporting me, even when I gave up politics for game design.\n -Phoebe", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter as a company, we both have years of experience working within the board game industry. Phoebe has worked on 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns through her position as Bezier Games' Social Media Manager (raising a total of over $2.5 million USD).\n\nMark has worked in film for 6 years as a Producer and Assistant Director. As a result, he is experienced in managing logistics for large scale and complex projects, as well as meeting production deadlines. \n\nWe are confident that our combined experience will allow us to finalise and deliver a high quality project. All of our art is completed, and we have a manufacturer ready to start production after our campaign.\n\nIn the event that we receive samples back from the manufacturer that are not up to our standards, we may need to make alterations to the garment design or work with them to ensure a higher quality. However, we have built in sufficient time to our estimated delivery date to allow for this.\n\nAs a smaller company, it is also possible for us to be pushed back in the production queue for the manufacturer to prioritise larger brands.\n\nFinally, the ongoing coronavirus crisis in China has the potential to cause delays to our production and shipping. Currently it appears that factories are reopening, but we are not able to tell how the situation will evolve.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clothes are designed to be high quality statement pieces that will last in your wardrobe for years to come.

It also requires that manufacturers limit potentially toxic ingredients in their dyes and manufacturing processes, and that they have processes in place to limit and treat waste water. Our manufacturer ensures that the water used in the dying process is still clean enough to be recycled for irrigation and other purposes.\n\nThe GOTS social criteria requires safe and hygienic working conditions for employees, the payment of living wages, regular and fair working hours, and the right for workers to unionise. It also prohibits child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and harsh or inhumane treatment.\n\nMore about the GOTS certification here: https://www.global-standard.org/the-standard/general-description.html", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "Thank you for your support!\nYou will have access to the pledge manager after the campaign.\nPlease note that any items added in the pledge manager through this level will not receive the Kickstarter discount.\nShirts will cost ~$85 AUD / $55 USD\nSkirts will cost ~$115 AUD / $75 USD\nINCLUDES:\nPledge manager access", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}], "stat": ["102 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 70 or more", "title": "Shirt Pledge (~$45 USD)", "descp": "**~$45 USD**\nOnly want shirts?

Four new mint making companies have noticed the profit potential of Mintopia City and have moved in, in an attempt to dominate the market and make all of the money. Players will take the role of one of four mint making companies and assert their influence over various locations in Mintopia City to secure their loyalties and earn the market share.\nMint Control is designed to provide a small footprint introduction experience to the Area Control and Action Selection genres of gaming that is fun and rewarding for new and seasoned gamers alike.\nSet Up\nShuffle the Location Cards, and randomly add Locations to the game area until there are at least 5 Influence Token spaces per player.\n                            (10 for 2 players, 15 for 3 players and 20 for 4 players.)\nPut the remaining Location cards to the side, they will not be used in this game. Place the 5 Action tiles near the Location cards, this is the Selection Pool.\nPlace the Mint Tokens near the Location Cards. This forms the Mint Supply, each player then takes 2 Mints from the Supply as their starting currency.\nEach player selects a color and takes the 5 Influence Tokens for that color.\nThe player with the freshest breath starts the game with the Starting Player Token.\nGameplay\nEach round, the starting player will select one of the available Action tiles and place it in front of them. They will then perform that Action, followed by the Perk in its entirety.\nThen in clockwise order around the table, each other player will perform that same Action (but not the perk) until each player has had the option to perform the Action if able.\nAfter every player has had the option to perform the action chosen by the starting player, the next player in clockwise order will choose one of the remaining available Action Tiles. This process continues until each player has selected one Action tile.\nAfter the final Action has been fully processed, if there are not enough remaining Action tiles for each player to choose from the remaining cards, return all of the chosen Action tiles to the selection pool, so that all Action tiles are available in the next round.\nFinally, the Starting Player token passes to the next player in clockwise order, and a new round begins.\nAction Tiles\nWhen an action is selected by a player, that player performs both the Action and Perk. Then clockwise around the table each other player performs only the Action.\nInfluence\nThe Influence Action allows players to pay Mints to add an Influence Token to an open Influence space. The Perk for selecting this Action reduces the cost to Influence a Location by 1, to a minimum of 0.\nEarn\nThe Earn Action gives players Mints to spend on future turns. The Perk for selecting this Action is to gain an additional Mint.\nPresence\nThe Presence Action grants each player the Presence bonus for each Location where they have Influence. The Perk for this Action is gain the eviction bonus from a Location that the player controls.\nOust\nThe Oust Action gains each player one Mint, similar to Earn. However, the perk for Oust is to spend 1 Mint to remove any 1 Influence Token from a Location. Then an additional 3 Mints can be spent to remove a second Influence token from a Location. The second token has no additional restrictions, it can be on the same or a different Location, and the same or a different player.\nScavenge\nThe Scavenge Action does not provide an Action for all players, only the player that selected it. That player can choose to gain 1 Mint from the Supply, or steal 1 Mint from another player.\nWin/Lose Conditions \nThe game ends at the end of the Action in which at least one player has all 5 of their influence tokens on Locations.\nPlayers gain points for each Location they control. The player with the most points, wins!\nIn the event of a tie, the player with the most Mints left over wins.\nThen, the tied player that has the most Influence placed on locations wins.\nThen, the tied player whose age is closest to 42 wins.\nPLAYTHROUGH\nYou are my biggest advocates and I need you to shout from the rooftops so this project can succeed the best it can.

If you're a retailer, please email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThe Mint Series was born of the 2017 BoardGameGeek Mint Tin Challenge where designer Justin Blaske submitted Mint Works, the Minty Fresh Worker Placement Game. Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded on Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product, selling over 30,000 copies -- and it's still reprinting! His second design, Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in the first hour, raising almost $200,000, and expanding into the French market. Most recently, Mint Cooperative funded over $100,000 and gained partners around the world: the Mint Series has fresh new versions in French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.\nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series. Our vision is to make singular modern board game mechanisms approachable by designing games that are simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time.\nThe Mint Series follows the narrative of Mort, introduced in the first game. After much success launching his mint-making company, Mort branched out and provided mints to surrounding towns and regions. Unfortunately, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis  grew jealous of his success, and the Mint Cooperative was launched to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. With peace restored and the villains defeated, Mort now finds himself threatened by other mint magnates trying to steal his success!  It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression, and it is thrilling to continue the saga in this exciting title.\nQuackalope's storytelling expertly explains how the world of Mintopia unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series, we've learned a lot about the game making process, from start to finish.

Players will venture out on to the open waters of the Pacific, haul in fresh fish (represented as polyominoes), and carefully pack the fish into an ice chest (ideally around the crabs and ice cubes already present). Once the player feels comfortable with the amount of fish in their ice chest, they head to the market to fulfill contracts to outsell their competition and build their reputation up with the local canneries. \nDesigned by the team Flatout Games (designers of Point Salad and publisher of Calico) and with stunning art by Beth Sobel, Public Market is a wonderful mix of bidding, tile placement, set collection, and engine building. Jump aboard your vessel and head out on the cool crisp waters to find your adventure.\n\n 1.5MM thick neoprene \nMade for 1 to 5 players\nStunning Beth Sobel art\n 5th player Expansion - all components needed to add a 5th player\nShallow Water Expansion/Module - added gameplay and components\nSolo Edition - all components add for the solo play of Public Market!\nClick for Written Review\nClick the picture for the link, they talk about the game at 1:43\n Solo Overview\nIn Public Market, players will take fishing actions to draft fish tiles to place into their ice chest with a goal of selling your haul to local restaurants and to public companies. When at the market, players will have a chance to score by fulfilling public contracts or delivering fish to small local restaurants to gain bonuses.\nThe game is played over a series of rounds based on the number of fish tiles in the Ocean Bag. Players will open the round by bidding for turn order. Once bidding is complete, players will take one of two actions. Players will either go Fishing or go to the Market.\n Bidding\n\nEach round players will spend money to bid. There are 5 locations for bidding. There are no lockouts and you can bid to the same location as another player, however, if you go there after they do you must pay them a $1 fee if you wish to jump in front of them. Otherwise, you would pay the normal amount and you would go after they do in turn order.\n The Scrap Fish tile must be placed by the end of your turn. Below is the market board and this is where you will place your player token to control the turn order and action selection.\n FISHING\nPlayers will Fish a tile from the Ocean Grid in Turn Order. Players will fish under the Boat and place the tile they drafted plus the scrap they got from the Bidding action.\nIce Chest\n Once the player has placed the Scrap tile and the Fish tile into their Ice Chest they will need to adjust the Catch Tracker so so the current level of each type of fish in their Ice Chest.\nMARKET\nWhen players go to market they will sell the fish they have to fulfill Public Contracts or complete smaller orders for local restaurants called Today's Catch! When these contracts or orders are completed the player will be able to score and gain special bonuses.\nContract Cards\nToday's Catch Blue\n Today's Catch Red\n After you are all done completing Public Contracts and Today's Catch Cards you will sell off remaining fish at Market Value and check to see if you have completed the Crab Bonus by surrounding the Crab icon in the Ice Chest. The Market value of the fish is shown at the bottom of the Player Board.\nThe final step is to check the bonus payout by looking at the columns and rows on in your Ice Chest. players receive a payout of $3 dollars for each completed row OR Column. The player will need to choose the columns or the rows whichever gives them a higher payout. The player will return scraps, discard the fish tiles, and get a new Ice Chest.\nREPOPULATE\nAfter each player has taken their action, players will Repopulate the Ocean Grid with fish tiles from the Ocean Bag. When the bag is empty it triggers the end of the game. The number of tiles in the bag is based on the player count.\nNAVIGATION\nAt the end of the round, the last person to take their action will set the boat for the next round. This will tell all players which tiles will be available in the fish phase.\nShallow Waters Module\nArt not final\n\n\nArt not final.\nArt Not Final!\nArt not final\n Like many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room for us to add in features and items through stretch goals.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. This means we are paying the cost for the VAT or Value Added Tax for you. The following is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to  Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Due to that, we will not ship to these areas.\n\n\n\nPlease note - if you have not confirmed and completed your pledge through Pledge Manager within six months of the start of fulfillment, you may be subject to additional charges as shipping rates can change. Also, your games would be shipped outside of our original shipment and you may be responsible for additional taxes. Limited items may no longer be available after that time.\nTalon Strikes works hard to ship all games to all backers! please note that we will ship to the current address on file.

During that time, IDW Games has successfully Kickstarted and fulfilled 9 campaigns.

Lonesome, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park by Vincent Roche. Pledge any reward tier to receive at least 1 print at random or pledge at the Lodge and Switchback tiers to receive all 3!\nEnamel Pin\nThere's always room for one more pin on the old backpack or denim jacket. We've taken the enamel First Hiker Token from the base game of PARKS and turned it into a Kickstarter Exclusive enamel pin just for you. If you don't want a pin, we've got you covered! In the pledge manager you can choose to receive a discount on Space Park, Control, or Campy Creatures instead.\nMemories Boxed Set\nIf you're all in on PARKS Memories, we want to give you a special way to display your love of PARKS. All backers in the Glamping, Lodge, and Switchback tiers, which include all 3 sets of PARKS Memories, will receive in a Kickstarter Exclusive boxed set. This will ONLY be available to campaign backers during the kickstarter and for a short time in the pledge manager. You'll get the same compact feel of PARKS Memories, but printed with embossing and wood grain designs on the outside. \nFlat Rate Shipping: You will only be charged the applicable rate above no matter how much you order. So, find (or make) some friends that want to split the cost of shipping with you! Once the campaign is completed, you will be given the opportunity to add additional copies of PARKS, Nightfall, and Memories to your order without increasing the cost of shipping.\nUS Sales Tax: US residents, we will be collecting sales tax in the pledge manager for some states. We are still in the process of determining the states that will require us to collect taxes (each sate as different requirements), but we will clearly identify taxes in the pledge manger on the order summary page.\nEvery time I bring PARKS to the table, however, a new sort of gaming environment emerges. People admire the art. They reminisce about their own National Park trips and share travel tips. They play with the resource tokens between turns.\nOur family loves to enjoy nature and PARKS is a game that is dripping with this theme...PARKS plays remarkably smooth and the trail is different each time because of the variable setup of the trail tiles.\nPARKS is a game that will have a place on our shelf for years to come.\nThe disparate elements combine into an engrossing play that can nonetheless work with a broad array of players. Gorgeous components and accessible gameplay make this a rewarding competition about enjoying the best idea America ever had.       \nKeymaster Games publishes board games with captivating experiences and elegant designs. Our games are meant to be easily played with the friends and family around you in the hopes of creating deeper connections and fun memories.\nThe Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series is a celebration of our National Parks. The strength of the series comes from an eclectic mix of artists and the unique beauty of each park. Our goal is to get poster fans into the parks and parks fans into posters. The full series is currently being archived by The Library of Congress.\nArtists included across PARKS and Memories:\nMarc Aspinall // Oliver Barrett // Jonathan Bartlett // Kristen Boydstun // Brave the Woods // Daniel Danger // Owen Davey // Nicolas Delort // Sophie Diao // DKNG // Johnny Dombrowski // David Doran // Laurent Durieux // Kilian Eng // Cristian Eres // Benjamin Flouw // Ft.

The following is meant to set expectations as it relates to this project and Kickstarter's terms of use. It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories in retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete.\n\nKickstarter Video Credits:\nVideo Production: Brian Davis\nVideo Music: Oh, Jeremiah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you are reading this, then you are seriously considering our project. Thank you! We are very confident that we will deliver an incredible experience. We have successfully completed six campaigns and learn more with each one. The games will be ready to go to pre-production before Q2 and from there, barring acts of God, we will be able to hit our September fulfillment date.\n\nOur biggest challenges are not specific to our operations, but rather the global political climate, specifically trade to and from China, Cornoavirus, UK Trade Deals, and global economic recessions.

It's a simplified, streamlined version of The Networks with interesting tactical decisions and excellent strategic depth that plays in about 30-45 minutes. It's an easy game to learn, and you don't need to know how to play The Networks in order to play The Rival Networks. \nIn this game, you and your opponent are TV network executives trying to score the most Viewers over 3 Seasons. On your turn, you'll take one of the 3 available Show Cards, one of the 3 available Star Cards, and one of the 3 available Ad Cards. \nShows go onto one of your time slots, giving you Ratings Points and Viewers there. Stars go on Shows, adding to that time slot's Ratings Points. You'll spend your Ads to buy powerful Network Cards that give you various abilities.\nYou'll also score a bonus if you ever get at least 3 Shows of the same Genre during the game. And you can score bonus Viewers at the end of each Season by leading in the most Time Slots, and by achieving certain Awards.\nThe player with the most Viewers at the end of the game wins!\nThe Rival Networks is a 2-player card-drafting, tableau-building board game where you and your opponent go head-to-head running your own TV networks. \nEach turn, you will develop a TV Show and sign a Star and an Ad. Shows and Stars will go on one of your three time slots, giving you Ratings Points and Viewers.\nThose Viewers are important; they're how you win the game. Each player will get a lovely 3D punchboard house to hold their Viewer tokens! \nYou can spend Ads to gain valuable Network Cards for special powers, but the value of your Ads can change from one turn to the next, so you'll want to spend them at the right time! \nAt the end of each Season, the player leading in more time slots gets bonus Viewers. You'll also gain Viewers or Stars by winning Awards.\nAt the end of 3 Seasons, you'll lift your houses and count your Viewers. The player with the most Viewers wins!\nHere's a playthrough of the game. (Note that the components used in this video were from the old prototype design we used to test the game. The final game will look more like the images on this page!)  \nHere is the current beta version of the rulebook.\nWant to try the game? Here is the current PNP beta testing kit. Or, try it on Tabletop Simulator (adapted by @MeadyOkerGamer).  \nIf you already own The Networks, you might be wondering what's different about The Rival Networks.\nFirst, the obvious: The Rival Networks plays 2 players and only 2 players. \nThe Rival Networks offers a much more streamlined experience than the original Networks game. Instead of choosing between a Show, a Star, an Ad, and so on, in this game, you get a Show, Star, and Ad every turn. What makes things interesting is how you use them.\nThere is now no limit to the number of Stars you can put on a single Show. However, you may only attach Stars to a single Show each turn, and the Stars you attach must have the icon of the Show you're attaching them to.\nThere is no aging mechanism in The Rival Networks. Instead, Shows available in a new Season are always more powerful than in the previous Season, so it's often (but not always) a good move to replace an older Show.\nIn the base Networks game, you don't really care how many Viewers you get in a time slot relative to your opponents. That's to keep the gameplay fast and complexity low. \nBut in The Rival Networks, it's very important to know when you're leading in any of the time slots. At the end of each Season, the player who leads in more time slots scores bonus Viewers. \nIn The Rival Networks, Shows and Stars will give you Ratings Points, which you'll track on that time slot's card. Each time slot's Ratings Point track has a Viewer icon at various points. When you pass one of these icons, you'll score a Viewer.\nThe Rival Networks also has Awards that offer bonus Viewers and Stars to players who meet certain conditions at the end of each Season.\nThere are no money tokens in The Rival Networks. There is money printed on the Ad Cards, but their value will change based on conditions in the game. Ads never go on Shows; they're only used to buy Network Cards. Network Cards now cost varying amounts of money, so it's up to you to maximize the value of your Ads and cash them in for the most powerful Network Cards. \nThe Rival Networks, like the original Networks game, gives you a Genre Bonus when you reach 3 shows of the same Genre, anywhere in your Network (lineup plus reruns). But in The Rival Networks, each Genre gives its own bonus. Which Genres you specialize in will change the way you play the game!\nCheck out Eric's full review here.\nWatch this space for some third-party playthrough videos, coming soon! \nIf you're a card-sleever, you'll be happy to know that all card sizes are standard, and that we plan to have all cards fit into the box sleeved.\nThe Show Cards and Awards Cards will be standard poker-sized cards (63 x 88 mm).\nThe Time Slot Cards will be standard tarot-sized cards (70 x 120 mm).\nThe Star, Ad, and Network Cards will be standard Euro mini-sized cards (44 x 67 mm).   \nKickstarter will automatically add shipping fees to your pledge, based on your location. See Shipping below for more information.  \nNote: All submissions at pledge levels $150 and up are subject to approval by Formal Ferret Games. I'll establish a submission deadline at the end of the campaign; please have your submission by the deadline, or your submission may not make it into the game. Please do not submit the name or logo of an actual product or service.  \nAll graphic design you see in these images is subject to change!  \nThis module will come in your copy of the game, as well as the retail version of the game!\nThese cards are just a mockup that we've been using for playtesting. Final art coming soon!\nThe 5 Time Slot Cards will not be tarot-sized cards; instead, they'll be pieces of punchboard! \nWe'll also replace the plastic tokens with full-art punchboard Viewer tokens, which will look much nicer.\nThese upgrades will be available in the retail version of the game. \nThe Documentaries and Game Shows module will only work with Rival Networks. It will consist of 8 new Shows - 4 Documentaries and 4 Game Shows - with new art and different Genre Bonuses than the other Shows. This module will not come with retail versions of the game, but it will be available online and at conventions after the game comes out.\nAlso, you will be able to add the On the Air expansion to your order when the BackerKit opens! This is a mini-expansion for the original Networks game, consisting of all the stretch goals from the very first Networks Kickstarter campaign. More Shows, more Stars, more Ads, more Network Cards!\nThese wood remotes will look similar to the wood remotes that come in the Fancy Bits add-on for The Networks base game. They will be a little smaller, though. \nThe remotes will not come with retail versions of the game, but it will be available online and at conventions after the game comes out.\nAlso, you will be able to add the Telly Time expansion to your order when the BackerKit opens! This mini-expansion for the original Networks game adds shows with a decidedly British flavor, as well as a new way to score Genre Bonuses.\nWant to pick up the original Networks game and some of its expansions as part of the campaign? No problem!\nThese add-ons will become available after the campaign is complete, through our pledge manager BackerKit. You don't have to put the money in your Kickstarter pledge if you don't want to.\nNote: The Networks and its Executives expansion are available at most retail stores, physical or online! If you order this as an add-on, you won't get it until the shipping date (currently estimated as December 2020). If you buy it from a store now, you can play it right away. The choice is up to you!\nThe replacement Network Cards were cards that I tweaked slightly for the Fourth Printing in 2018. The existing cards weren't broken, but these fixes make their effects more consistent with the effects in the rest of the deck. You can read about these tweaks here.\nThe replacement Network Cards are only useful if you have a copy of the base Networks game older than the Fourth Printing. You can tell by flipping your copy of the game over and looking at the bottom-right corner of the box bottom. If it says \"Fourth Printing,\" you don't need them; you already have them in your game!\nIf you're a retailer, you'll be able to order copies of the game for your store within BackerKit. This way, we will only charge your card when we get close to shipping. Retailer pledges will come with all unlocked stretch goals.\nIf you're interested in a retailer pledge, we suggest backing for at least $1 so you can follow along with the campaign, and be informed when retailer pledges become available! \nKickstarter will add a shipping charge to your pledge based on your location. We've tried to keep these costs as low as possible! You will not be charged any additional fees in BackerKit unless you choose any add-ons.  \nWe have fulfillment centers in the US, Canada, China, Australia, and the UK.\nWe have historically shipped EU rewards from the UK. For this campaign, it's possible we may ship EU rewards from the EU, and UK rewards from the UK. We'll make this decision as we get closer to shipping, based on current events. \nCampaign video\nWritten and edited by Gil Hova.\nAnimation by Gil Hova, with some help from Ben Shulman, based on illustrations from Travis Kinchy.\nVoices: Ethan Hova, EmJ Nelson, and Carrie Margulies.\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Ominous\", \"Blue Ska\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nPlaythrough video\nCamera, lights, and production sound by Orion McClelland.\nEditing by Gil Hova.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo Kickstarter project is without risk, especially something with as complex a logistical chain as a board game! My job as creator is to minimize these risks as best I can. \n\nBut I have 5 years of experience as a Kickstarter creator and games publisher. I've built up a reliable infrastructure to manufacture and deliver games. To date, I have successfully funded six campaigns. Five of them have been delivered, and the sixth one is on its way from the factory as I write this, due to deliver to backers in March.\n\nThe biggest risk we face are production delays. I have an excellent relationship with my manufacturer, Panda Games Manufacturing. We have a good record of making games with no significant errors.\n\nThe illustrations and graphic design for the game are almost complete; the only remaining illustrations as of the time this campaign launches are for the premium pledge levels, which we will finish when the campaign ends. We also need to handle graphic design for the rulebook, a task that I usually leave until after the Kickstarter is complete.\n\nI always plan around delays. It's great when a project sails through with no issues. But if I have a choice between delaying a game or releasing it with significant flaws, I will, whenever possible, delay the game and make sure you get a game that is the best possible game I can make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "VIEWER: One copy of The Rival Networks", "descp": "Receive one copy of The Rival Networks 2-player game!

The design is complete, with 2 years of development and playtesting behind it. Miniature sculpts and artwork are ready. During this campaign there will be no rule-changing expansions and stretch goals. We are offering a great product at a great price and a short fulfillment period. There is no hidden agenda. We are offering a great and simple deal: short campaign, instant production, swift delivery!\nThe games are produced in the EU, in keeping with the proven high standards of PHALANX. If you back us on Kickstarter, you will receive your copy several weeks before the game reaches any retail outlets! Our goal is to produce Martin Wallace\u2019s Rocketmen within 180 days of reaching our funding goal. Kickstarter backers will have their copies delivered no later than October 2020.\nPlease note that the graphic materials presented here are not yet final and may be changed. The photos are of handmade prototypes of the game. The final production quality will be much, much higher.\nRocket-fast Shipping\nYou will be asked to pay the shipping cost in the Pledge Manager after the campaign. At that time, you will be able to add extra copies of the game and items from our add-on list. Additional items may increase shipping costs. PHALANX is responsible for shipping the English, German and Polish editions of the game. The games will be shipped from the EU using FedEx air freight, so the delivery date will be close to the production date.\nThe estimated shipping cost (regardless of the Pledge level) is: USA \u00a315 to most states, \u00a330 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Canada \u00a320. EU \u00a312 to most countries (Poland - free). Other European countries \u00a315 - \u00a330. Asia \u00a330, Australia \u00a325, New Zealand \u00a325, Oceania \u00a335, Latin America \u00a335, Africa \u00a335. \nYou can multiply the chosen Pledge to get significant savings on shipping costs. For example, the cost of shipping to most EU countries will be \u00a312 for a single game and \u00a320-36 for 2-4 games, if shipped to the same address.

Players will take the role of scientist naturalists on the HMS Beagle as it journeys through the Galapagos Islands. On each player\u2019s turn, they may either research the surrounding species in their habitats or discover the natural history of a new species.\nTo Research: a player will place two of their observation cubes on different species found among the islands. These observations contribute to their understanding of how the species relate to their habitats.\nTo Discover: a player must spend observation cubes in play to place a new species tile on an adjacent spot on the board.  The previously observed species help the scientist understand the new one.  The discovering player will receive victory points and the community of scientists gain new research possibilities.\nThe players\u2019 discoveries will also grant them cards that provide extra abilities or scoring opportunities, as they gain help from the crew of the Beagle or their array of naturalist tools on board.\n\nEach newly discovered species causes the Beagle to leave one island for another. The Beagle\u2019s progress will trigger scoring opportunities and, eventually, the end of the game.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, and Australia.

Check out the Videos section further down the page! \n\n\nThe new Museum campaign offers several pledge levels. The pledge you should choose will depend on whether you already have Museum (whether you backed the first campaign or purchased it in retail), or if you live somewhere in the world where Museum is not available yet! If you would simply like to pick and choose individual items without opting for a full pledge level you can do that too, so there\u2019s something for everyone!\nTo decide which pledge level you need, simply choose which of the statements below applies to you, then choose the option you would like!\nI'M FROM THE USA, CANADA, FRANCE, UK, BELGIUM, SWITZERLAND\nEven though this is a \u201creprint\u201d campaign, we\u2019ve decided to do things a little bit differently.\nIn order to support our distribution partners and stores, backers from countries where the game is distributed will not be able to acquire any of the retail content during the campaign. We will not be selling the Core Game or any of the expansions available in retail (The Black Market, The Archaeologists, The People\u2019s Choice, or The World\u2019s Fair).\nThis ensures that our KS will not be detrimental to all those that help us continue to make Museum a success months after its release.\nSo, if you live in the USA, Canada, England, France, Luxembourg or Switzerland and you don\u2019t have Museum yet, we ask that you go out and purchase the core game and expansions from your FLGS! Just walk in and if they don\u2019t have any copies in stock they can order them for you from their distributor.\nYou can also purchase Museum easily through one of these online stores:\nUSA - Miniature Market \n Canada - 401 Games \nFrance/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland - Philibert \n UK - Gameslore \nYou may, of course, purchase anything you like from this campaign to complete your collection.

We have however done  our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has  concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nWe are aiming to deliver Kickstarter content (old and new) by November 2020. This may seem like a long time as a lot of the game is already available, However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd  rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nAny retail content will be shipped with the Kickstarter content. \n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.\nThe chart below shows the maximum estimated cost of  shipping the game to your region. This is barring any unforeseen  circumstances outside of our control. Exact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase and but we hope to be able to provide you  with prices lower than what is indicated here.\nFor the purchase of a small component \"a la carte\" Shipping costs should start around:\nGroup 1 \u2013 6.5\u20ac\nGroup 2 \u2013 7\u20ac\nGroup 3 \u2013 8\u20ac\nRoW \u2013 9\u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. This is HGG's seventh project so we are very familiar with the running and fulfilment of a KS project as well as where to look for any potential pitfalls. We currently have three other ongoing Kickstarter projects: Titan, Dominations and Rallyman: GT. Titan is currently in pre-production. Dominations and Rallyman: GT are currently being shipped to distribution centres with fulfillment beginning not long after this campaign ends. We are active on all three pages, providing regular updates, answering questions and generally keeping our backers informed at each stage of the project.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating a November 2020 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to deliver before this date and/or ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nWe always welcome feedback and constructive criticism of our projects and games. However, we will not tolerate the abuse or harassment of HGG, it's staff or other participants of this Kickstarter. HGG reserves the right to refund and remove any person found in violation of these standards.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "A la Carte US/CAN/ENG/FR", "descp": "I AM from: - USA - Canada - England - France - Belgium - Switzerland\nAnd want KS exclusive content from this campaign and the previous one.

It has experienced delay after delay in development, asset design, pre-production, and production. We are working daily to get this large game completed and out to backers, and ultimately into the marketplace, as soon as possible.\n\nThis project took 0% of the workload away from Sweet Mess. What is needing to be done for Sweet Mess is being done. Montana: Heritage Edition is a complete game and has already been manufactured and released. This means that the factory has the production for this game already and needs nothing else for its production. Goldrush and Longhorns are also complete and has been produced by our partners, White Goblin Games, and their factory files will be shared with us and the factory, making this project a quick turnaround.\n\nWe hope you do not judge this project, White Goblin Games, or Big Kid Games, on the delay of Sweet Mess. It is an untimely delay that we are facing, but be assured that, in the end, a well-designed and well-produced game will be the result.\n\nTerritorial License:\n\nThis is a licensed game from White Goblin Games and Big Kid Games are only able to accept pledges from supporters in the territories of our agreement - US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Big Kid Games cannot accept pledges outside of these countries. The Montana game line can be acquired through White Goblin Games and their partners in other regions of the world. Please visit www.whitegoblingames.com and contact them directly for any such questions regarding sales in other regions.\n\nMontana: Goldrush and Montana: Longhorns are completed products that are released in Europe and other regions of the world (Longhorns pending). The expansions are complete and ready to print, with needing only minimal factory preparation and setup. We expect to have these expansions print-ready in short order.\n\nMontana: Heritage Edition is a released game in the territories listed above, with a retail version available in stores now, although quantities are limited. This campaign serves the purpose of reprinting the Kickstarter version of the game, as well as additional retail units, along with the expansions and additional content for the game. Montana: Heritage Edition's initial printing included a small batch error of misprints of punchboard 7. We will take steps with LongPack Games to ensure that misprint chances are minimized, if not eliminated.\n\nFulfillment & Shipping:\n\nBig Kid Games have learned valuable lessons in manufacturing, delays, and expected timelines. We believe that our conservative preparation, printing, and fulfillment timetable for the Montana line is accurate. Of course, it is not impossible for delays to occur from uncontrollable sources and/or circumstances.\n\nQuartermaster Logistics will be fulfilling and shipping your rewards. QML's partners in Canada and Australia will handle the shipping to those regions. The 'Shipping Chart' above depicts estimated costs only. Actual shipping costs, per weight, will be assessed and collected within CrowdOx after the campaign. There is no shipping collected within this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPledge Management:\n\nWe partner with CrowdOx to collect and manage shipping information, as well as collect any additional funds for add-ons, late pledges, and pre-orders. All information collected is private, protected, and not shared. We will be opening CrowdOx for backer management, adjustments, and orders the week after the campaign ends.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the closing of the CrowdOx pledge manager. If the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount refunded. This is corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since those will not be refunded to us after that point. At that point, the refund will be completed via PayPal instead of the credit card you used through Kickstarter or CrowdOx.\n\nTerms & Conditions:\n\nYou agree that it is your responsibility to submit to us your information for the purposes of shipping your rewards.

Place dice on spots on the board or on the Leader cards to gather resources, settle the islands, attract Nomads to your culture, trade with the islanders, or use other asymmetrical actions provided by Nomads.\nA variety of available actions\nGathering resources is key to victory, you'll use them to trade, recruit nomads, settle the islands and even convert them directly to victory points.\nHarvest valuable resources\nNomads will bring new skills to your culture, and unlock new victory conditions, making every game of Tungaru unique \nNomads strengthen your culture\nYou have limited space for Nomads in your community so deciding which abilities to keep can be a tough choice.  \nNomads provide a variety of abilities including resource production, dice manipulation, the ability to convert resources to victory points and other special once-per-game abilities.  \nLeader cards that were played this round are passed clockwise, giving each player a different set of leaders, and a new round begins.  \nWe will be using Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter has ended to manage add-ons and shipping. \nIf you want to add any of the add-ons below to your pledge, please do so in the Pledge Manager\nYou can pledge at the \u00a31 level now to gain access to the pledge manager!\n Please note, we will be using Pledge Manager to manage add-ons so please do not add the funds to your pledge yet. This will be managed in the pledge manager.\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n November: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n December: Submit Files to manufacturer\n January & March: Manufacturing (break in February for Chinese new year)\n April: Shipping from China to the UK begins\n Late May: Arrives in ports\n Early June: Fulfilment commences\n July: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in August/September - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.\nTungaru is a work of fiction developed by a team from a variety of different cultures. \nOur intention has always been to create an outstanding game that draws inspiration from the early sea-faring cultures of small pacific islands (such as the Lapita), much of which remains a mystery to this day.\nWe have made an effort to be as culturally sensitive as possible, drawing inspiration from these cultures but making an effort not misrepresent or cause offence.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always with our campaigns, we cannot prevent \"god-like\" failures such as thunderstorm, hurricanes etc.\n\nWe can promise you though that we will do everything in our power to keep everyone updated as well as stick to the original plan as possible.\n\nYou can rest assured that since this is our 12th campaign, that we are a capable and knowledgeable company.

This has allowed for a lucrative industry: Dino Ranching! \nIndependent ranchers have begun farming dinosaurs to sell to the highest bidders for use in their high thrill theme parks. \nYou are one of those ranchers. Do you have what it takes to out ranch your opponents and operate the most successful dinosaur farm!?\nTiny Epic Dinosaurs is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of dinosaur ranching, worker-placement and resource management. It features classic euro game mechanics with unique twists that portray the dangers of farming these prehistoric beasts.\nIn Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players control a team of ranchers and will be acquiring, breeding and selling dinosaurs. The game is played over 6 rounds. With each round consisting of several short phases.\nIn phase one, players will harvest the resources from their farm that are not being consumed by their dinosaurs.\nIn phase two, players will put their ranchers to work. This phase has ranchers wrangling and buying new dinosaurs to farm, improving their farm\u2019s security and supplies, vying for high dollar contracts, and researching technologies and unique dinosaur breeds. These unique dinosaur breeds introduce a large variety of special benefits players can utilize to separate themselves from their competition.\nIn phase three, ranchers return to finish their day\u2019s work at the farm.\nIn phase four, players arrange their ranch, making sure their ranch is suitable for the types and quantities of dinosaurs they have.\nPhase five is the feeding phase, and every dinosaur MUST be fed. Dinosaurs that don\u2019t eat will escape, posing a grave threat to your enclosures\u2019 security and your other dinosaurs.\nPhase six is for breeding. For each pair of matching dinosaurs you have properly enclosed, you\u2019ll welcome a new dinosaur to your farm!\nAt the end of the game, players will receive victory points for each dinosaur they have, public and private contracts they acquired and for their research developments. The player with the most victory points, wins the game.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Laboratory Mini Expansion\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion introduces certain rewards to players during play, like extra dinosaurs, resources, or research cards. To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats. \nDuring setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included!\nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Points are earned by visiting different parts of the city, but the various ways of earning them are only unlocked by crossing the city\u2019s seven bridges. The player who tallies the most points at the end of five rounds wins!\nSEVEN BRIDGES stands out from other roll-and-write games because it includes a map of a real-world city created by a professional cartographer!\nBOX AND SHEET SIZE COMPARISON \nThe above graphic shows the size of the Seven Bridges box and sheets compared with other popular roll-and-write games.\nHOW TO PLAY\nDownload the rulebook (PDF)\nYou perform two kinds of drafting in Seven Bridges: dice drafting and map drafting. First you draft (choose) a die, then you draft (draw) its lines onto your map!\nVISITING LANDMARKS\nIn addition to the aforementioned seven bridges, there are eleven landmarks on the map. Whenever you identify a landmark \u2013 by drawing a line that passes in front of its letter \u2013 you get to select a bonus from either the IMMEDIATE USE or RESERVED USE column to the left of the map.\nSCORING\nThere are seven different ways to score points, one for each item in the map\u2019s legend.\n1) Street; footpath - If you drew any closed loops on your map, find the one that will score you the most points: multiply the number of corners (right angles) that it has by the number of bridges that it crosses.\n2) Bridge; river - For each bridge that you completely cross, fill in one segment in the bridges crossed scale bar and score the indicated value.\n3) Landmark - For each landmark that you visit, fill in one segment in the landmarks visited scale bar and score the indicated value.\n4) Building - Color in all the buildings that you saw, scoring one point for each.\n5) Trees - Color in all the trees that you passed in front of, and score one point for each.\n6) Grid squares - Look for all the places where you drew lines to the edge of the map, and sum the value of the coordinates written beside them.\n7) Drafting - Sum the value of all of the bonuses that you used in both the IMMEDIATE USE and RESERVED USE columns.\nTOTAL SCORE\nFor each of the seven bridges that you were able to cross, you earn the points from one of the seven items in the map legend. For example, if you crossed five bridges, you score the five highest values and ignore the two lowest.\nOur player was able to cross six of the seven bridges on the map. Excluding their lowest scoring legend item, their total score was a very respectable 208 points!\nSOLO MODE\nWith nine difficulty levels, the solo player version of SEVEN BRIDGES is an entertaining challenge that is often won or lost on the last turn! The rules are exactly the same as a two-player game, except now you will be competing against an AI opponent named Euler, and he will score points for all the parts of K\u00f6nigsberg that you don't visit!\nAt the end of five rounds, calculate your total score exactly as you would in a multiplayer game. Then calculate Euler\u2019s score:\n1) Street; footpath \u2013 Euler scores 0 points; he doesn\u2019t make any closed loops.\n2) Bridge; river \u2013 Euler crosses all the bridges that you did not. Determine his score using the bridges crossed scale bar: if he had to cross two of the seven bridges, he would score 4 points.\n3) Landmark \u2013 Euler visits all the landmarks that you did not. Determine his score using the landmarks visited scale bar: if he had to visit four of the eleven landmarks, he would score 10 points.\n4) Building \u2013 Euler passes by all the buildings that you did not. There are exactly 100 buildings on the map: if you passed by 55 buildings, Euler would score 45 points.\n5) Trees \u2013 Euler passes by all of the trees that you did not. There are exactly 100 trees on the map as well: if you only saw 30 trees, Euler would score 70 points.\n6) Grid squares \u2013 Euler visits all the edges of the map that you did not. There are 80 points available: if you scored 35, Euler would score 45.\n7) Drafting \u2013 Euler earns all the drafting bonuses that you did not. There are 40 points available: if you scored 20 points, Euler would also score 20 points.\nEuler\u2019s total score is the sum of items two through seven, regardless of how many bridges you crossed!\nIf our player had been competing against Euler in a solo game, they would have eked out a win by just two points, 208 to 206!\n SOLO GAME PLAY REVIEW\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nA prototype spotted in the wild!

We developed the amazing solution below!\nSprinkle the fossils and rock hammers in evenly.\nPut the lid on and shake gently. Slide the site map in and take the lid off.\nAdd the terrain tiles onto the site map.\nUse the blocker to help slide the site map out from under the tiles, and you're done!\nIn Fossilis you spend plaster to find and extract dinosaur fossils from the unique 3D dig site, actually using tweezers to pick the bone you want from its hiding spot. Store the bone or add it to a dino display you're preparing in your lab!\n Each turn, you have three energy points to spend moving around the site, collecting plaster, digging through layers of terrain, and extracting fossils. \n As you remove Terrain tiles from the board, you claim the tile for the precious fragments (eggshells, footprints, and amber) found on them. They can be used to buy helpful Tools or Supplies. \n Sometimes you'll find lost rock hammers in the dirt... return them to the display to learn game-changing skills as a reward! \n You can claim a dinosaur to your lab as long as you have at least one of its required bones. Your lab can only hold one dinosaur at a time, so you must score your dinosaur before taking another.  \n The plaster pool works as a timer for the game. Each time it's exhausted, an Event takes place that may have positive or negative effects on the game. Once the last pool runs out, game end is trigged. You earn points for the Tools and Supplies you've claimed and the different sets of dinosaurs you've collected throughout the game.  \n Ready to dig in deep?

We also offer an unconditional money-back guarantee on all Kickstarter pledges. So if you love Wingspan as much as we do, we would love your support for this beautiful new upgrade!\nIf you don't already have our other upgrades for the Wingspan base game, those are available as add-ons for this project as well! \nThese wooden Bird Meeples replace the action/scoring cubes from the game. As a 5-player game, you would only need 5 bird types, however some people get more to have more choices, or because they simply couldn't decide which birds to leave out!\nAt this point, the art should be considered final, as we have already put this first print run of these new birds into production. This will allow us to deliver the project as soon as possible! \nThe North American bird meeples from the base game!\nThe simplicity of this project will allow us to offer flat-rate shipping for all backers worldwide. Regardless of pledge size or shipping location, shipping is only $5!\nIf you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level as you normally would, and add the amount of the additional set(s) to the total amount pledged. It's that easy!\nSince we were able to double our project goal in the first day (thank you!!), we've decided to go all-out and offer our \"dream project\" - which is 10 European birds and a new start player token. This matches what we did for the North American birds, and we are so pleased to be able to offer this many options for the European expansion as well!\nAdditionally, we have added a new bird to the North American set - the Atlantic Puffin - as it was highly requested for the European set. The bird is found on both continents, but the card is from the base game of Wingspan. Doing it this way allowed us to not disappoint any backers that voted on whether they wanted the Griffon Vulture, the Little Owl, or both (in place of the Turtle Dove) to be the 10th European bird.\nThat being said, there won't be any more stretch goals. We appreciate your support for this project, and have actually put the first print run of these pieces into production already.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and this really fantastic game upgrade. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally.\nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties owed at delivery, this is still your responsibility. This only rarely happens though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions, you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for these bird meeples is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our North American birds, as well as a number of our more recent upgrades!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with the set that is similar in this Wingspan upgrade, our painted North American bird meeples for the base game (also available as an add-on to this project)...\nNorth American Birds for Wingspan\n\nDinosaur Island meeples!\nUpgrades for Scythe (and expansions!)\nTropical Fish Meeples for Oceans (North Star Games)\nViticulture and Tuscany Meeples!\nCharterstone Meeples!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for about eight years now, and other painted components longer than that.

Players will choose a personal design to follow, while trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats! \nCalico comes with many different cat and pattern goals to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are thousands of unique puzzles!\n\n  + Kickstarter Promo Cats \nKickstarter backers of Calico will also receive a special double-sided promo cat scoring tile and four additional cat tokens FREE! These cats add 'largest pattern group' and 'longest pattern line' scoring options, giving you more ways to play! After the Kickstarter campaign, these cards will not be included with the game.\nCheck out this How-to-play video by Bebo of Be Bold Games!\nLearn all about Calico with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCalico can be played solo! The solo game elegantly simulates a 2-player experience by turning the tile market into a conveyor-belt. Players will need to make difficult decisions about which tiles to take, as each turn brings changes to the market. The solo mode is simple to learn and does not involve any of the complexity of upkeep of an AI player - just you and a relaxing game of interesting puzzly choices as you sew your quilt! \n Family Mode\nCalico also has a family mode! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you simply flip over the design goal tiles and only play for cat and color points! It's a super accessible option that anyone can dive into, but still provides plenty of strategy!\n We believe Calico is has such a fantastic mix of approachability and strategic depth, that we decided to put a team together to make it a reality! The rules are simple, and the mechanisms of drafting and tile placement are accessible to a very wide audience. Anyone can perform the basic actions and have a great time trying to puzzle out what their next move will be.\nThe sense of accomplishment of putting together a beautiful quilt will satisfy gamers of all types. Although it is a perfect gateway experience for new gamers, more advanced strategy game players will be right at home with the variable design goals, which make the challenge and reward of each new game extremely satisfying.\n We know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Calico is the perfect game to do just that!\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have retail distribution to get Calico to a wider audience - this means this is your first and best chance to get the game. \nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support.\nThe pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value as our way of saying thank you for your early support. You are all so important the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without each and every one of you, and we very much recognize and appreciate that! We also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. This is going to be a lot of fun!\nWe are focused on you - please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve the backer experience, and we will do our very best!\nRetailers\nCertified retailers interested in backing can email us through our website: https://www.flatout.games/contact. Please use the subject line: CALICO RETAILER when reaching out to us. We would love to connect with you and offer you an opportunity to carry our game. We do not have a pledge level for retailers, but we will offer reduced prices on bulk orders to certified brick-and-mortar retailers.\nRahdo Runs Through Calico!\nTom and Marty from Slickerdrips play Calico!  \nWe have put a lot of time and effort into the design and development of Calico. We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is as good as it can be, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that will simply not be possible without a larger initial print run. As our funding numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and adding fun bonuses along the way!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the components \u2018fully stitched\u2019!    \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Preview!\nCheck out Slickerdrips' First Impressions!\n Check out Plumpy Thimble's Review!\nCheck out The Game Shelf's Preview here!\nCheck out Meeple Mountain's Review here!\nCheck out Draft Mechanic's Podcast Feature here!\nCheck out Open Seat Gaming's Review here!\nCheck out Steph's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out BJ's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out Purple Phoenix's Review here!\nCheck out What's Eric Playing's Preview here!\n Check out Variable Player Power Podcast Episode 1 featuring Calico!\nCheck out Geek Dad's Review here!\nCheck out Off Shelf's Origins article here!\n Check out Inquisitive Meeple's Review here! \n\n Check out Geek Craft's Review here! \nWe know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. You can read more about shipping in Update #6.\nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please contact us.\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the Cardboard Edison and LUCI award finalist Point Salad (available now from AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2020 from Crafty Games).\n What's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. Our approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This CoLab publication of Calico is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's meet the CoLab members!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Calico! You can check out her work here!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.  \n\nAnd, finally, YOU! \nThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about Calico! We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our first crowdfunding campaign, we have done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful.

In addition, we have members of our CoLab team who have been involved with successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

Hand management, careful use of your actions, and teamwork are the key to weathering the Solar Storm.\nRepair different areas of the ship and divert power back to the Energy Core, all whilst the ship continues to take damage from the Solar Storm. Succeed and you'll live. Fail, and you'll all perish in the scorching abyss.\n Upgrade to the deluxe edition! \nReplace your meeples with even bigger and better ones. Each meeple is its own unique shape and is at least 8mm larger!\nGet the 8 room cards mini expansion for even more variability. With each new room having its own unique power, the extra rooms in this expansion greatly increase the number of variations for the modular setup.\nAll stretch goals unlocked!\nWe have now reached the \u00a355k needed to unlock the final stretch goal. This means that each meeple in the deluxe version will now have a unique print on it!\n Small box. Big cooperative game! \nSolar Storm comes in a handy size box and gives you lots of interesting decisions to make. High levels of strategy and low levels of luck to the game mean that your decisions are what make a difference between success and failure. Solar Storm really packs a punch, leaving you wanting to play over and over again!\n4 variable difficulty levels \nYou choose how hard you want the game to be. Rookies will swelter on Easy mode. Seasoned Officers can try their hand at Normal and Hard modes. Only the hardened veterans among you will even think about attempting Solar Storm on Realism mode. \nA cooperative hand management game! \nSolar Storm is easy to learn but hard to master. Work together under the pressure of impending doom. Decide if it is more important to spend your resources repairing the ship to keep you alive a little longer, or push your luck to collect the right resources to divert power back to a damaged Energy Core.\n Asymmetric powers in every room on board. \nEach room on board your ship has a unique power. Any player can use the power in their current location. There are 8 unique powers, including sending repair mechs to fix another location, bringing shields online to protect the ship, and recycling old resources to use again. Upgrade to the deluxe version and unlock 8 more abilities to chose from!\nA modular setup for high replayability!\nEvery time you play Solar Storm you will have a different ship layout to save from burning peril. At the start of each game you'll randomly place the rooms to create a new ship, meaning there are hundreds of unique combinations. The extra rooms in the deluxe version increase this variety even more!\nNo two games are ever the same\nThe ship gets damaged at the start of the game and at the end of every player's turn. Damage is randomised by a deck of cards meaning that, along with the modular ship layout, no two games are ever the same. \nSolo mode... You call all the shots!\nSo you can see a ship caught in a Solar Storm from afar, eh? Not a problem! Take on the Solar Storm by commanding the crew from your comms hub. You will control 3 crew members and direct them in what to do. The solo mode is distinctively different from the cooperative game, but comes with the same burning tension. Read more about the Solo mode below...\nSmall box, big cooperative experience!\nHow to win:\nYour objective is to divert the power from 8 areas of the ship using your resources, to the damaged Energy Core in order to escape the Solar Storm. \nHow to lose:\nThe ship will take damage throughout the game. If you run out of resources to fix the ship or If just one area of the ship takes too much damage, then the ship will blow up and you and your crew are consumed by the solar storm.\nGameplay:\nPhase 1: Take 3 Actions\nThe current player will take 3 actions. They can:\nIf you've managed to divert power from each of the rooms, get back to the Energy Core  and activate it to escape the Solar Storm and immediately win the game!\nPhase 2: Take Resources\nThe first player will then draw 1 visible resource, or 2 random resources. \nPhase 3: Damage the Ship\nFinally, the first player will draw a damage card to see which area(s) of the ship get hit by the Solar Storm. \nIf you have not lost the game at this stage then play moves on clockwise to the next player.\nDesigned by Jason Broad.\nIn the solo mode you play a communications officer, directing 3 members of the crew on board and controlling their communal supply of resources. \nThe tension of the game intensifies as you have a lot of resources but not much time to use them. Use them quickly and efficiently to avoid losing them.\nWhat makes this Solo mode great?\n The same great game - The solo mode plays on the strengths of the core game but adds a new shared hand dynamic.\n Shared hand dynamic - You'll need to use the resources quickly before you run out of space, but you'll still need to be efficient to get your team off the ship alive.\n Designed by solo gamers, for solo gamers - we decided early on that we wanted a solo mode for Solar Storm, but we also recognised we needed to outsource this part of the game to a real expert. Jason, our solo mode designer, has played over 65 different solo modes with 300+ plays (and those are only the ones that he's recorded). His knowledge of what solo gamers want shines through in the solo mode for Solar Storm.\nPlay the game the same way you would a multiplayer game with the following changes:\nUse the reference cards and the fourth meeple to indicate which meeple is now active. \nYou only have ONE hand of cards for ALL 3 meeples. This means that your meeples are sharing the resources. \nInstead of trading with other players, you now trade with the supply train.\nAny actions tokens that are gained are to be placed on the reference card of the meeple that they belong to. Only this meeple can use said action tokens on their turn. \nThe same goes for any protection cards that are acquired.\nClick here to read The Game Shelf's written review\nClick here to read Meeple Gamers' written review\nClick here to read We're Not Wizards' written review\nUK & US backers: add a second copy of Solar Storm for just \u00a317/$21 for the base game and \u00a322/$27 for the deluxe game.\nEverywhere else: add a second copy of Solar Storm for just \u00a319/$23 for the base game and \u00a324/$29 for the deluxe game - we will send your second copy with FREE shipping!\nPlease note that retailers who back the campaign directly will be treated as kickstarter backers. Therefore, some retailers may sell the deluxe edition. We will also stock some ourselves to sell at conventions.\nDue to popular demand, we are now offering the playmat that you have seen in some of the review videos!\nPlaymats will cost \u00a312/$15\nShipping for this will be free for the UK ONLY.\nEvery other country will be charged \u00a33/$4\nplease use our pledge manager when it opens to add this to your order.\nWe are offering fantastic rates for retailers.

If you want to receive updates on the Solar Storm campaign, back the Observer pledge level.\nWe will be absorbing ALL shipping costs to backers within the UK and US. That's right, this means UK and US shipping is absolutely FREE! \nWe will also be subsidising EVERY other countries postage, making shipping as affordable as possible. The above shipping cost are an outline set in each region's own currency (ROW in USD). These have been based roughly on the exchange rate at the time and could be slightly higher or lower after the campaign. All being well, the difference should be a matter of pennies. For those regions that are paying for shipping please note that this will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\nAll of the games will be shipped from our friends at Alley Cat Games within the UK.\nUnfortunately, due to previous issues ACG do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE and Saudi Arabia). \nAt the moment the UK is still in the EU and the customs union. We have treated our shipping as if this will be the case when it comes to sending you your games. This is because no one really knows what is going to happen if/when Brexit takes place. However, we will be transparent about our plans in the event that Brexit does take place.\nUK\nWe will be fulfilling shipping from within the UK. Therefore, if you have a UK mailing address then you will not be charged any custom fees, regardless of what happens with Brexit.\nThe rest of the EU\nFor every other country that is in the EU, if the UK does leave the customs union, we will do what we can to avoid customs fees. However, if you do get charged customs fees, we will 100% reimburse you. This is our Brexit guarantee.\nPLEASE NOTE: This timeline is a prediction based on several factors and could change. However, rest assure that we will keep you informed at every stage and let you know if there are any changes.\nAlso, our solo mode designer, Jason Broad.

To win, level up your campers to the highest rank (Badger). Along the way, you will need to collect Achievement Patches, which will give your campers special abilities and allow them to level and win the game.\nCamp Pinetop offers endless variations of game play with 32 map cards in the base game. This offers hundreds of different map configurations ensuring that each game will have a different and exciting route to victory! \n\nCamp Pinetop was voted Best Family Game of the 2019 Boston Fig Fest out of over 40 games!

Plus this gives more room for us to add in features and items through stretch goals.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. The following is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 2kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose. This is why we provide a window of estimate.\nUSA: $6-$10 to most states. ($13 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$14 to most cities.\nASIA: $10-15 to China and Hong Kong. $18 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimated cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $12-$16 to Australia. $18 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $12-$16 to most countries. $18 to Norway, Finland, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.

Years of pollution has tarnished the landscape and the world\u2019s supplies of natural resources have dwindled to abysmal levels.The use of electric vehicles, solar technologies and other energy saving solutions have slowed the problem. Though, the long-term abuse on the planet by previous generations has been hard to reverse. Most Earthlings seem to have given up hope. The demise of a once great planet is in sight - and there seems to be nothing anyone can do about it. However, a group of optimistic explorers are taking a trek to Mars, which some believe may turn around their fate. \nIn search of knowledge these explorers hope that understanding the demise of alien populations can assist them with preventing or at least slowing down the rapid deterioration of the Earth. They\u2019ll need to replicate martian technologies, translate their languages and avoid gaining too much radiation along the way in order to end up with the most prestige and save the Earth as they know it.\n  In Ruins of Mars players are playing as explorers who are looking to decipher martian languages, learn and replicate their technologies, gain hourglasses necessary to perform certain abilities and ultimately gain prestige to win the game.     \nLanguage Track, Player Board and Hourglasses\nPlayers will place their rover at one of the five locations on the board and take their desired action, as well as any wrench bonus action a space may have. The exact benefits of their action will be based on the action tiles below the space.    \nCenter board and Action Tiles\n  The action tiles will shift every turn in a Mancala'esque fashion around the board. The tiles at the active site (wherever the rover is located) will be shuffled and randomly placed around the board starting with the active site and moving right until there are no tiles left (the board wraps around for allocation purposes).   \nAction Tiles Being Shuffled\n Players will have to balance their time. Replicating more advanced martian technologies requires a greater understanding of the martian languages. A player's character and some of their technology cards will also require hourglass tokens to activate their abilities and aid the player in their pursuit. \nDo you have what it takes to explore, uncover, and learn the Ruins of Mars?  \nIf you'd like to read the complete rules, download it below.  \n>>> Click to download <<<\nWe're activating a few social goals.

Sit back and watch this astounding review from the Hairy Game Lords \u2013 we guarantee that you will want a copy of Seven Bridges by the end of it!\nWELCOME TO K\u00d6NIGSBERG!\nSEVEN BRIDGES is a \u201croll-and-write\u201d dice drafting game in which you will explore the historic city of K\u00f6nigsberg, coloring in the streets you have seen on your map. Points are earned by visiting different parts of the city, but the various ways of earning them are only unlocked by crossing the city\u2019s seven bridges. The player who tallies the most points at the end of five rounds wins!\nSEVEN BRIDGES stands out from other roll-and-write games because it includes a map of a real-world city created by a professional cartographer! The elements of the game have been creatively superimposed as a red overprint layer, a technique once used to update or re-purpose outdated maps. \nBOX AND SHEET SIZE COMPARISON\nThe above graphic shows the size of the Seven Bridges box and sheets compared with other popular roll-and-write games. The dimensions of the box will be approximately 9\" x 9\" to accommodate the size of the manual and the PVC insert.\nHOW TO PLAY\nYou perform two kinds of drafting in this game: dice drafting and map drafting. First you draft (choose) a die, then you draft (draw) its lines onto your map!\nVISITING LANDMARKS  \nIn addition to the aforementioned seven bridges, there are eleven landmarks on the map. Whenever you identify a landmark \u2013 by drawing a line that passes in front of its letter \u2013 you get to select a bonus from either the IMMEDIATE USE or RESERVED USE column to the left of the map.\nDownload the rulebook (PDF)\nSCORING\nThere are seven different ways to score points, one for each item in the map\u2019s legend.\n1) Street; footpath - If you drew any closed loops on your map, find the one that will score you the most points: multiply the number of corners (right angles) that it has by the number of bridges that it crosses.\n2) Bridge; river - For each bridge that you completely cross, fill in one segment in the bridges crossed scale bar and score the indicated value.\n3) Landmark - For each landmark that you visit, fill in one segment in the landmarks visited scale bar and score the indicated value.\n4) Building - Color in all the buildings that you saw, scoring one point for each.\n5) Trees - Color in all the trees that you passed in front of, and score one point for each. \n6) Grid squares - Look for all the places where you drew lines to the edge of the map, and sum the value of the coordinates written beside them.\n7) Drafting - Sum the value of all of the bonuses that you used in both the IMMEDIATE USE and RESERVED USE columns.  \nTotal Score\nFor each of the seven bridges that you were able to cross, you earn the points from one of the seven items in the map legend. For example, if you crossed five bridges, you score the five highest values and ignore the two lowest.\nOur player was able to cross six of the seven bridges on the map. Excluding their lowest scoring legend item, their total score was a very respectable 208 points!\nSOLO MODE\nWith nine difficulty levels, the solo player version of SEVEN BRIDGES is an entertaining challenge that is often won or lost on the last turn! The rules are exactly the same as a two-player game, except now you will be competing against an AI opponent named Euler, and he will score points for all the parts of K\u00f6nigsberg that you don't visit!\nAt the end of five rounds, calculate your total score exactly as you would in a multiplayer game. Then calculate Euler\u2019s score:\n1) Street; footpath \u2013 Euler scores 0 points; he doesn\u2019t make any closed loops.\n2) Bridge; river \u2013 Euler crosses all the bridges that you did not. Determine his score using the bridges crossed scale bar: if he had to cross two of the seven bridges, he would score 4 points.\n3) Landmark \u2013 Euler visits all the landmarks that you did not. Determine his score using the landmarks visited scale bar: if he had to visit four of the eleven landmarks, he would score 10 points. \n4) Building \u2013 Euler passes by all the buildings that you did not. There are exactly 100 buildings on the map: if you passed by 55 buildings, Euler would score 45 points.\n5) Trees \u2013 Euler passes by all of the trees that you did not. There are exactly 100 trees on the map as well: if you only saw 30 trees, Euler would score 70 points.\n6) Grid squares \u2013 Euler visits all the edges of the map that you did not. There are 80 points available: if you scored 35, Euler would score 45.\n7) Drafting \u2013 Euler earns all the drafting bonuses that you did not. There are 40 points available: if you scored 20 points, Euler would also score 20 points.\nEuler\u2019s total score is the sum of items two through seven, regardless of how many bridges you crossed!\nIf our player had been competing against Euler in a solo game, they would have eked out a win by just two points, 208 to 206!\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nA prototype spotted in the wild! * Final product will be slightly different. For example the eraser will be white.\n Game box - approximately 9\" x 9\" x 2\"  / 1.5mm thickness / linen finish\n Player map/score pad - 200 sheets / 100 dual-sided sheets (2 pads)  / approximately 8.2\" x 5.5\"\n 6 colored pencils - natural wood body / rounded and smooth to the touch / 6 different colors (black, red, yellow, green, brown, blue) / golf-size\n 6 wooden dice - custom engraved / ~19mm squared with rounded bevel on edges (the dice we will be using in the game are actually more similar to the dice seen in Roll Through the Ages). \n Rulebook - glossy, full-sized rulebook / saddle stitched\n Plastic PVC insert \nModel of insert with simulated paper pad, pencils, eraser and dice.\nModel of insert without components inside. A well will set at the bottom to hold pencils & eraser. The pad will sit on top with finger cutouts.

Our campaign is fairly straight forward however, that can always change. \nABOUT THE MAP\nThe game\u2019s map was inspired by the beautiful, highly-detailed map of K\u00f6nigsberg produced by renowned German cartographer Johann Homann (1664 \u2013 1724) for his Grand Atlas of all the World, which shows the city as it was when Euler resolved the Seven Bridges problem. \nThe bridges and landmarks labeled on the game\u2019s map are:\nCREDITS\nABOUT PUZZLING PIXEL GAMES:\nPuzzling Pixel Games is an independent publisher based out of Lewiston, NY.

We know that there are always things to learn from others. That being said, from the publisher's perspective, we've been here before. We've created campaigns that were successful and ones that were not. Our first campaign was successful. \n\nOur first campaign delivered rewards before the estimated target date.

Ron's detailed and meticulous nature ensures that all his i's are dotted and t's are crossed. \n\nWe also want to raise the possibility of potential component changes. This is a disclaimer that some minor variations in components are possible. This should be minimal, if at all. On that note, we are also having product testing done to we can have the game marketed to people as young as 10. We are not concerned that there will be any issues in this regard but we are putting a disclaimer here as well, if something on that front arises, we would have to bump the minimum age up to 13 or 14. For most of you that are old enough to back a Kickstarter, this is not a problem, but we did want to mention this.\n\nOf course with anything in life, there is risk. There's risks we can plan for, such as government tariffs and risks that sneak up on us.

We decided to stick it out until the end, hoping that the final 48 hours would show a significant increase in backers. Although the last two days of the campaign have been our best since launch, we\u2019re going to come up short of the funding goal.\n\nAnd to answer your burning question: Yes, Seven Bridges will be relaunching. Seven Bridges deserves to be published \u2013 gamers and reviewers have been telling us this ever since Origins 2019.\n\n\n\nThe most important lesson that we\u2019ve learned from this campaign is that the expected price of a roll-and-write game has a limit. Many potential backers felt that Seven Bridges exceeded that price, despite its size, weight and components.\n\nBut we also learned that Seven Bridges has a very loyal and supportive group of people who will be with us on Day 1 of our relaunch! So please join us over at the Seven Bridges page on Facebook () and become part of our growing community! We'll be providing updates on the Facebook page leading into the campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving anticipated the possibility of not funding this time around, Puzzling Pixel Games has already started the process of getting a new estimate based on what our backers and potential backers have told us. We\u2019ll be reducing the box\u2019s dimensions and redesigning the manual to match the game\u2019s largest component (the map pad), which will reduce both production and shipping costs. We will also be using a pledge manager in the next campaign, meaning a drastic reduction in the funding goal.\n\nThese changes should result in a very successful relaunch. As many of you are aware, a strong first day is paramount to a successful crowdfunding campaign. We hope that you will join us on Tuesday, October 29th at 10:00 EST, which is the tentatively-scheduled date and time for our relaunch of Seven Bridges.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMike Schroeder, Puzzling Pixel Games\nRon Halliday, Designer of Seven Bridges"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Extra Games for $32 Each (and Map Progress)", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

Each player is affected by the specific weather of the season they are in, and the weather for the coming seasons is a secret until someone Prepares for Season and moves forward to reveal it!\nAt the end of Preparing for Season, players will claim one of the map tiles on the path before them. Three of these map tiles will be collected in total over the course of the game, creating an Expedition that you may send your Traveler on at the very end of the game. Players will have to carefully pack their supplies in order to complete their Expedition, potentially scoring a substantial amount of points for doing so.\nAfter claiming a map tile, players will draw the top three Discovery cards of the area they are exploring, then place these cards faceup along the bottom of the Mountain board. These unique cards represent exciting discoveries you have made along your journeys. You may find a trail to explore, one of the friendly mountain folk to assist you in your journeys, or perhaps even one of the fabled Big Critters that your worker can ride on! You will get to keep only one of these cards from each of the three areas you explore, so you must choose wisely!\nSpirecrest is an expansive and challenging new expansion, sure to surprise and delight even the most seasoned of Everdell players. Get ready for adventure!\nand here for the Spirecrest Collector's Edition Rulesheet!\nHow to Play - Bellfaire\nThis expansion adds a number of new modules to the game, including unique player powers for each type of critter in Everdell, rules for 5-6 players, and a new board to optionally use in place of the 3D Ever Tree.\nPlayer Powers\nEach of the 15 unique types of critter meeples in the world of Everdell now also has a unique power you may use. These powers have been thoroughly playtested and balanced, and designed to offer an intriguing and unique twist to every game you play. Have fun exploring them all to find your favorite!\n5-6 players\nMany people have requested that we add official support for 5 players, and we\u2019ve gone beyond that to include rules for up to 6 players. By utilizing a clever Market system and a specific rule of removing one of the workers each player obtains, the game time for these higher player counts is close to what a standard 4-player game would be.\nBellfaire Board\nThe Bellfaire board connects to the upper half of the main board, and may be used as an alternative to the 3D Ever Tree, which is helpful for higher player counts. This board also adds optional new gameplay elements, including a revolving Market location, and endgame Garland awards.\nPlayer Boards\nThere are six unique and beautifully illustrated player boards that can be used to hold resources, meeples, and point tokens. Each board shows a different corner of the world of Everdell\u2014there's a suitable home for any and all critters! Choose your favorite!\nBellfaire is a modular expansion packed with exciting new content to experience and explore!\n What People Are Saying\n\"Everdell is a gorgeous game, with extremely high production value and its expansions are no different. Both Bellfaire and Spirecrest look lovely and integrate nicely with the base game.\" \u2014 Casual Game Revolution\n\"I\u2019m absolutely crazy about the added engine building that Spirecraft adds to Everdell, and the Bellfaire modules (especially the asymmetric critter powers) add marvelous variability and fun ways to mix up the game... This is an hour one backing for me.\u201d \u2014 Tim, playtester\n\"The Spirecrest expansion adds a new level of excitement and adventure to the amazing world of Everdell. Spirecrest takes the great game of Everdell to new heights.\" \u2014 Karl, playtester\n\"Spirecrest is not for the faint of heart. It is challenging and so thematic and immersive that you feel invested in your little critters.\" \u2014Alex, playtester\n\"Bellfaire preserves its unique theme and introduces a trading mechanism done right.\" \u2014Amy, playtester\n\"Spirecrest is the most thematic exploration I have experienced, and Bellfaire proves trading can be thematic and strategic.\" \u2014 Chrissy, playtester\n\"The way the Big Critters integrate in Everdell both mechanically and physically is just amazing. Big Critters and the player powers bring a much welcome asymmetry to the world of Everdell.\" \u2014 Max, playtester\nPost-Campaign\nShipping will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign. We have tried to use local shipping depots wherever possible to make your shipping costs as affordable as we can. Please note that we are absorbing some of the shipping and handling cost to help keep these costs reasonable.\nShipping\n*Due to high levels of instability in the local postal systems in the listed countries, we are unable to reship lost packages at no cost. We will provide confirmation of shipment and if you require a reshipment to one of these countries, there will be a charge for the additional shipping of a replacement package.\nNot sure where your country fits in? Just send us a message and ask! For the purposes of determining your shipping costs, backers in Norway and Switzerland will use the EU costs, and backers in Hong Kong will use the Asia costs. \nWe highly recommend forming a group pledge with friends or your local gaming group to save on shipping costs! Shipping for multiple copies will be charged in the PledgeManager.\nTax & Customs\nAfter this campaign ends, you may be charged additional taxes or customs fees based on your region. What's the reason for this? Unfortunately, due to crackdowns against tax fraud, many countries are implementing stricter foreign customs laws.\nHere in the US, we have new laws regarding sales tax due to South Dakota v. Wayfair. To read more about that case, click here.\nWe are registered to collect VAT in the UK and Germany, so we charge VAT based on these countries where we have nexus. If you're interested in more details on VAT collection, here's a handy FAQ and some more detailed articles from the agency that handles our reporting, SimplyVAT: FAQs and Essential Resources.\nRead on below to hear how your region may be affected.\nUnited States\nBackers in the United States will be charged state sales tax. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. Some states charge tax on shipping as well as the product itself.\nCanada\nCanadian backers will be charged a 5% tax due to HST, and may receive an additional tax depending on your secondary tax range which varies by province. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. The tax is charged on the total purchase price, including shipping. Shipping and HST will be charged separately for the purposes of customs reporting so you are not double-billed for HST.\nEuropean Union (including UK)\nEU backers will be charged VAT, which is 19-20% depending on your country. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. The tax is charged on the total purchase price, including shipping. Shipping and VAT will be charged separately for the purposes of customs reporting so you are not double-billed for VAT.\nAustralia\nAustralian backers will be charged a flat 10% tax rate due to GST. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. The tax is charged on the total purchase price, including shipping. Shipping and GST will be charged separately for the purposes of customs reporting so you are not double-billed for GST.\nBelow are the tax rates that we will be collecting, broken down by country, state, and province:\nAs tax rates are often in flux, your final tax rate may have changed slightly by the time the pledge manager launches, but these should be very close estimates.\nFAQs\nI backed a previous Starling Games campaign and you didn't do this, why are you doing it now?\nThese changes are due to new laws and restrictions that have been implemented for 2019.\nAre you making any extra money on these taxes?\nAbsolutely not. We are charging you only what your local government is charging us to get your games to you.\nHow do I know you have the right information?\nWe've spent months researching what these changes would mean for us as a company and for you as our customers. We've gone to great lengths to consult numerous tax professionals and agencies, both in the US and abroad, to ensure that we are customs compliant.\nI just backed another campaign and I didn't have to do this, what gives?\nThe truth is they may be committing tax/customs fraud (probably unknowingly), and we really don't want to do that! Not only is it illegal but we'd also risk getting our shipments seized, which means no one gets their games.\nWill I have to pay additional fees to receive my package?\nIf you live in one of the regions above, no you won't, since you're essentially pre-paying those fees. If you're outside the regions listed above, then you may owe additional taxes depending on your region.\nCredits\nExpansion Design: James A.

Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product selling over 30,000 copies and still reprinting. Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in Hour 1, raising almost $200,000 and expanded to the French market. \nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series where we make a singular modern board game mechanism approachable by being simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time. \nWe have continued the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has branched out and provided mints to more than just the local neighborhoods. Now, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis have begun lurking, and the Mint Cooperative has come to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression. \nWhat could be next?\nWatch this to hear how the world of Mintopia has unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.\nLet's look back at Mort's debut and then his adventure into the world of supply and demand!\nGame On Tabletop French Campaign by Lucky Duck Games\nWe are very excited to be able to bring Mint Works, Mint Delivery, and Mint Cooperative to the French market through our localization partnership with Lucky Duck Games. They have a concurrent campaign through the Game On Tabletop crowdfunding platform and we have combined our efforts to unlock Stretch Goals together! Unfortunately campaign add-ons are unavailable in French at this time.\nShort, sweet & simple:\nUSA....$5\nInt'l....$8\n**These shipping prices are good for up to three tins total (three copies of Mint Cooperative, Mint Works, Mint Delivery or any combination of the three). If you are looking to ship more than three tins, you will receive a shipping total in the post-campaign manager, but if you need to estimate, use these numbers per three tins ($10 for 6, $15 for 9, and so on) - most likely it will be less than that, but it gives you an estimate!**\nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Brazil, Russia, Mexico, South America, South Africa or the Middle East due to high postage prices, lengthy delivery times, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company. We offer our Print n Play free because we believe in the inclusive nature of hobby gaming, and hope that if we are unable to ship to your location, you can still play the game!\nWe are working with warehouses globally to bring customs-friendly shipping to all major markets. With the low price of our games, the mailing should be well under the threshold for most fees, but there are always cases where that is a concern so we are doing our best to make shipping super affordable for everyone!\nWe plan to ship in 3 waves. The first will be to those who fill out their survey by our announced cut off date (which will be in an update). Wave 2 will follow shortly after, with a final Wave after that. Those who do not fill in their surveys by the Wave 1 cutoff may be subject to VAT and shipping fees, if incurred, outside the USA. \nWe would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Cooperative, as well as Mint Works & Mint Delivery before the games make their way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series now, we feel like we have learned a lot about the process from start to finish.

This game was followed by Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire in 2017, which is a roll-and-write adaptation of the original game. The original Cosmic Run was  completely redesigned with new rules, upgraded components, and new mechanisms in 2018 and released as Cosmic Run: Regeneration.\nWith the exception of the original Cosmic Run, all items from the Cosmic Run universe are available during this campaign, though some in limited quantities.\nCosmic Run: Express is a standalone card game for 1-2 players that plays in about 10-15 minutes.  Coming in a small pack and containing only 25 cards, the game is highly portable. Given its short length, it's a perfect game when you've got a few minutes to spare and you're looking for a brief Dr Finn's gaming experience, i.e., a streamlined and easy to play game filled with interesting little decision points.  \nCOMPETITIVE GAME\nThe object of the competitive game is to be the first player to reach the 3 planets.  At the game's start, the 3 planet cards are placed between the players in a row.  Each player places a \"tracking\" card next to each planet and turns it to 0, representing no progress toward the planet.  \nAs players move toward a planet (i.e., score points for that planet), they turn their tracking card up, for example, from 0 to 1.  The tracking cards show 0 to 5 on the front side and 6 to 11 on the other side.  A player reaches the planet by scoring 12 movement points.   \nThe deck of ship cards (to the right), has 16 unique cards, numbered 1 to 4 in 4 different suits.  Six cards are dealt to each player and they choose 2 to pass to the opponent. Then, they can discard 1 card to draw a new one.  \nWith these 6 cards, players will simultaneously them, one at a time, until they've each played 2 cards at each planet.  \nPlayers can score movement points during the placing of cards (if the card's symbol matches the symbol on the top of the tracking card) and can score points due to certain relationships of the cards played. For example, the cards have an arrow in the upper left and if the arrow color matches the card color(s) in next column, the player can score movement points.  \nFurthermore, players also compete against each for points other by comparing the 2-card hands at each planet, using familiar poker-like ranks to determine the winner.  The winner at each planet scores 2 movement points.\nThe game is quick and engaging, given the simultaneous play.  As is typical with many Dr Finn's Games, it has a lot more going on than first appears.  \nDOWNLOAD RULES\nRULES OVERVIEW\nThe object of the solo game is to reach all 3 planets in 4 rounds or fewer.  In the game, the player is competing against an imaginary opponent whose 2-cards hand at each planet is constructed through a push-your-luck mechanic.  The rules are quite simple; the player flips 1 card at a time and decides to keep the card for himself or to give it to the opponent.  If the player keeps the first card, the opponent gets the second (and vice versa). \nThe cards are played in planet order, 1 card for the player and 1 card for the opponent at planet 1, then planet 2, then planet 3.  This is repeated until 12 cards are played, 2 on each side of each planet.  \nThe player scores points in the same ways as in the base game, but is now competing agains the dummy hands that resulted.\nSOLO RULES OVERVIEW\nThe Rapid Fire Mission Pack is a 12-card  (10 game cards + 2 instruction cards) expansion to Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire and can only be played with the base game.  The pack adds an interesting and competitive twist to this interesting roll-and-write game from Dr. Finn's.  \nEach of the 10 cards is double-sided, with an in-game \"mission\" on one side and a \"bonus\" on the other side. At the start of the game, 5 mission cards are randomly selected and placed \"mission\" side up. The other five cards are randomly paired with the previously placed cards, but with \"bonus\" side up.\nThe first player to accomplish a mission takes the bonus card assigned to it, which gives not only an immediate power, but also a recurring power whenever the player takes the die specified by the bonus card.\nWith this expansion, players not only race to the planets, but compete to complete the various missions.  Since there 10 different different fronts and backs to the cards, the randomized setup results in much variety and re-playability.\nRULES OVERVIEW VIDEO\nThe Regeneration Planet Pack is a 6-card accessory for Cosmic Run: Regeneration. This pack of cards is used to indicate when a planet has been discovered or destroyed.  It adds no changes to the rules and does not affect the game play. The cards, however, offer a cool little touch to the game by visually representing a planet's status. The card below is for Planet 6. If someone reaches the planet, you place the card with the discovery side showing (left). If destroyed, flip the card over to the other side.\nPlanet #6 discovered and destroyed\nVIDEO DESCRIPTION\n\n\nCLARIFICATION ON DIFFERENT GAME VERSIONS\n Cosmic Run: Regeneration Basic  is the Kickstarter basic version that includes the 6-card Allies expansion pack.  The only difference between the retail and the Kickstarter basic is the Allies expansion pack. \n Cosmic Run: Regeneration Deluxe  is the Kickstarter deluxe version that replaces the block-shaped ship tokens with tokens shaped like ships (see image below).  It also includes the 6-card Allies expansion pack.\n Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire is the retail version. However, if you back for a copy of  Rapid Fire, you will receive the Tech Tools pack separately, which is the promo pack from the original Kickstarter for Rapid Fire.\nComparison of ships in deluxe (left) and basic (right) versions of Cosmic Run: Regeneration\n\nIf you would like to add Cosmic Run: Express and/or any of the promotional packs to your level, please follow these steps:\n1. Choose the items you would like to add.\n2. Calculate the additional cost (below).\n3. Increase the amount of your pledge by the additional cost.\n4. After the campaign has ended, inform Dr Finn of your add-ons through the survey.\nCOSTS\nRegeneration Planet Pack: $3 (+ $1 shipping in U.S. / $2 all others)\nRapid Fire Promo Pack: $5 (+ $1 shipping in U.S. / $2 all others)\nCosmic Run: Express: $8 (+ $2 shipping in U.S. / $3 all others)\nNote: Additional shipping costs are necessary because packs are sent separately from games and requires additional packaging labor.\nIf you would like to add GAMES (not packs) to your pledge level, you will be able to do so after the campaign, through Dr Finn's website. More information will be provided in an update.\nCosmic Run: Express, Rapid Fire Mission Pack, and the Planet Pack will be sent by United States Postal Service first class mail after they are manufactured (hopefully, by December).\nOther games will be shipped separately from Amazon by late September, though some may come by USPS directly from me.  If you back for multiple items, do not be surprised if they come at different times.\nFor those outside the U.S., the cards will likely come in sets of 12-15 cards, so the cards of Cosmic Run: Express will be sent out divided in two separate envelopes.  The base games are not available to international backers through this campaign (see below).\nFor those outside the U.S., I apologize for not being able to offer you the combo levels that include Regeneration and Rapid Fire.  If my business continues to grow, my games will be distributed worldwide and you'll be able to pick them up for very reasonable prices.  So, if you'd like to help me get my games sold near you and also be able to get the special Kickstarter promo packs, you can pledge for $1 now and purchase a pack later.  \nPlease believe me when I say that I have tried all sorts of methods of international shipping and distribution, but my efforts resulted in financial losses and way too much time spent.  If you live outside the U.S. and like my games, I think the end result will be good for you -- you'll be able to buy one of my games through a retailer near you.\nThat said, you may be able to purchase any of these games from Amazon US and, for some of you, they ship to your country.\nLink to Amazon US for Cosmic Run: Regeneration \nLink to Amazon US for Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire\nFor those of you who have backed Dr Finn's Games in the past, you know that I have been trying all sorts of things to make my games and campaigns more appealing to a greater audience in Kickstarter. \nI've had 20 successful Kickstarter campaigns and am thankful for all the backers who made that possible. However, I've yet to have a huge breakout campaign and I've spent numerous years implementing ideas believed to promote increased success: duty-free shipping, Facebook and BGG ads, BGG contests, well-planned stretch goals, upgraded components, and the list goes on.  \nAt this point, I no longer wish to compete on Kickstarter.  By this, I mean I am not going to be guided by the kinds of expectations that are now prevalent on the platform, such as unique and upgraded components (such as metal coins or minis), elaborate videos, highly refined and detailed Kickstarter pages, and the like.\nI am not saying these things are bad.  I am simply saying that they are not what I am trying to do and I know this will turn off a large number of backers who want to back specifically to get these kinds of things.  And that's ok.\nWhat I am going to do is focus on making the kinds of games I make: shorter, filler-like games that make you think, have good artwork, and are made of quality materials.  And, if you look at reviews of my games, you'll find that they are fun.\nIn short, I am not promising you any flash or claim to be providing a one-of-a-kind gaming experience.  I am offering you fun games and packs that, if they live up to the Dr Finn's brand, will be something you and your friends will enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPRODUCTION RISKS \nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the packs will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threat in this regard concerns quality control over the manufacturing. A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced good results on projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nIf you receive any rewards that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the item arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS \nRefunds are not usually given, unless there is a failure to deliver the games you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Of course, unexpected things happen and there is chance that the game will not be shipped on time. I will keep you updated if the unexpected happens.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a shipment is returned, it is your responsibility to pay for the re-shipment.\n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the shipping section above.\n\nUPDATES \nAfter this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects.

The Rook, never one to shy away from the precarious, has decided to take down a string of casinos. But this is no office job - tougher safes, tightened security - and perhaps worst of all, you'll be working during the day!  The team will have to dress-up (or dress-down) to go unnoticed in the casino crowds.  You'll need to avoid making a commotion or taking too much heat before cracking the safe and escaping through whatever insane plan the Rook has dreamed up. \nThe original Burgle Bros was Kickstarted back in 2015 and since has become a sleeper hit in the boardgame world, winning various awards and multiple glowing reviews.  It even snuck past the guards to make it to the top 200 games on BoardGameGeek! The game have even been converted to a top-rated app, available on iOS, Android and Steam.\n Burgle Bros 2 is a 1-4 player cooperative game that plays in 60 min.\n Burgle Bros 2: The Casino Capers is not an expansion - it's a whole new game with all new ways to run a successful heist. While you'll still need to work together to explore the building and avoid getting caught, nearly every aspect of Burgle Bros has been reinvented for an even more exciting caper.\n Gear - Each players now has their own unique kit of tools that can be used during ANY player's turn.  You're no longer forced to wait until your turn before you can jump in and save the day, adding a whole new level of coordinated plays.\n New Rooms - The Pool, Blackjack table, Buffet, Dance Floor - casino rooms are a new mix of crazy and challenging effects that will keep you on your toes.\n Hidden Perks & Pitfalls - Chips are placed on rooms throughout the casino for additional one-time effects - some of them reward bold moves, and others punish them!\n Doors - In addition to walls, locked doors block your path on the casino floor.  The team can crack doors easy - the real question is, should you leave them open? \n Hunt Mode - No more moving slowly and cautiously during the heist.  Take too long and the bouncers will start hunting you. \n Finales - Cracking the safe is only step one. Now each games concludes with a big twist ending. What will the team have to do to make it out with a grand piano slowing you down, or with the swat team on your tail?\n Unlock New Content - Each time you complete a Finale, open the next sealed scenario, filled with new challenges, and new tools to get the job done.\nThis list is just scratching the surface. Check out the draft rulebook here to see what else we've got planned.\n\"The new take on player powers is fun and adds depth to the gameplay.\u201d - John D. \n\"Burgle 2 felt thematic to the point that I was picturing our group's hijinks playing out as we brushed past tattletale cashiers and delicious buffets.\" -  Luke Agee \n \"Burgle Bros 2 continues on the fantastic trajectory of the original - delivering tense cooperative gameplay that will leave your team on the edge of their seats.

While the early years of park expansion proved fruitful, the market quickly grew oversaturated and public interest waned. \nEnter tech super giant, IntelliGen Designs,  partnering with DinoGenics IOM to bring prehistoric aquatic life forms back from extinction. IntelliGen Designs promises that the species made available from this partnership will be extremely profitable for local industries\u2026\nControlled Chaos opens the door for new combos and park types that reward playing creatively.  Double wide facilities offer game-changing abilities and open the doors for exciting new strategies while specialists enable endgame scoring bonuses that allow a player to focus on and exploit a particular strength of their park.\nUse Specialists to empower your other facilities and create combos for bonus points.\nFor example, the above park is equipped with an Arcade that generates points for non-paired visitors.  Throughout the game that might happen on its own, but why take chances when you could hire a Promotions Agent Specialist and keep your park filled with frequent trips to the Time Share?\nNew dinosaur traits open up new gameplay styles. Cheap dinosaurs like Gallimimus and Mutants make excellent food sources for a Mosasaur.\nBoth the Mosasaur and the Spinosaurus have dinosaur eating tendencies. While this might be a deterrent in the early game, you could always try building a food farm from less desirable dinosaurs.\nWhile focusing heavily on aquatic species can be a great source of late game points you need to be careful! This park will cost you 4 goats every round!\nNew facilities like the Aquarium Hub reward spatial awareness and preplanning your dinosaur park layout. The therizinosaurus shown here also functions as an upgradeable dinosaur. While respectable in his own right, if you give him space to roam, he will easily contest a T-Rex in pure point value.\nMix DNA cards with Refined DNA to make dinosaurs without needing a complete set.\nControlled Chaos also introduces a new resource type in the form on Refined DNA. Players can now pay IntelliGen Designs to refine a DNA card into Refined DNA, a resource capable of filling part of the genetic recipe for any dinosaur species. \nIn 2056, a breakthrough in genetic reconstitution allowed a small medical research institute in South American to recreate once extinct lifeforms from preserved genetic material. In hopes of attracting new benefactors through name recognition, the institute rebranded itself as DinoGenics IOM.\nIndustry leaders from around the world flocked to the nation in hopes of building the first successful dinosaur park. Unfortunately, the early days of the DinoGenics collaboration proved unfruitful. Tourists did not want true to life dinosaurs; they wanted the great beasts and monsters that had wowed cinemas and popular culture for generations. With the promise of ever-increasing revenue, DinoGenics gave into demands and engineered the dinosaurs the world wanted.  \nDinoGenics is a competitive, highly thematic game for one to five players, in which each player attempts to build and run their own successful dinosaur park. \nDuring a game of DinoGenics, players assume the roles of multi-billion dollar corporations competing to build the most successful dinosaur park. Each player owns a private island and takes turns deploying workers to the mainland where they collect resources to enhance their individual parks. At the end of seven rounds (Seasons), the park with the most victory points is deemed the winner.\nA park should have a good balance between dinosaurs and facilities to attract visitors.\nEach player has a personal park island board where they will place dinosaurs, fences, and park facilities. As the rounds of the game play out, players will have the freedom to build up their own park as they see fit. Each player will need to develop their own strategy by developing combos of dinosaurs and park facilities that complement each other. \nMutants are an easy to maintain alternative to normal dinosaurs.\nIf all else fails, players can attempt to tip the balance in their favor by employing less traditional methods. Growing mutant dinosaurs is a viable shortcut on the road to a successful dinosaur park. While not as popular as the more recognizable species, mutants still bring in victory points and if utilized correctly, can easily compete with a more reputable park.\nManipulation cards offer powerful abilities for park managers who are willing to take morally questionable actions.\nOf course, once you start down the path of loosened ethics, you may be tempted by darker options. Manipulation Cards offer powerful one time use abilities that will often give you a leg up on the competition at the price of scandals\u2026or the ire of your opponents.\nBetween the first and second printing we have completely overhauled the formatting of our rulebook. You can download a PDF of the new rulebook below.  \nAdditionally, if you are already familiar with DinoGenics, you can download the pre-release Controlled Chaos rulebook below. \nStill undecided?  You can try the game out for yourself right now on Tabletop Simulator! Follow the link below to download the mod and give it a shot!\nDinoGenics comes with all meeples necessary to play the game but we have a couple optional add-ons to enhance your gameplay experience.  If you would like to buy one of these items, you can add its price onto your current pledge level.  Alternatively, you will have the chance to add them onto your pledge after the Kickstarter campaign ends when the pledge manager opens up.\nAll shipping charges will be processed after the Kickstarter ends, once the game is manufactured and ready to go out to backers.  We are doing everything we can to keep shipping costs reasonable, but DinoGenics is a heavy game and weighs roughly 4 kg (almost 9 pounds). \nThe chart below shows what the shipping charges would be if the game were mailed out today and in US dollars.\nPlease note that adding most add-ons onto a pledge level will have a relatively small impact on shipping rates.  As such, we recommend only picking the Upgrade Kit tier if that is the only item you want from this Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDinoGenics first arrived on Kickstarter back in 2017 and has since made its way into the hands of over 3,000 people. Controlled Chaos represents our first new product since our original Kickstarter launch and includes a lot of new gameplay elements and systems that are both daunting and exciting to bring to backers.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges from our original release and carries over to Controlled Chaos, is that DinoGenics is filled with deluxe components and comes with a hefty manufacturing price. This means that most publishers will not go near it as it is not profitable at retailer scale. That said, we are very proud of what we have created and are committed to delivering a quality production even if it does not arrive in many retail stores.\n\nAs it stands now, DinoGenics is ready for manufacturing and Controlled Chaos should be entering the proofing stage of production later this month. After being very pleased with the results of our first Kickstarter, we are once again returning to Panda Games Manufacturing. We expect manufacturing will begin no later than September of this year. That means that manufacturing will likely wrap up late December and that shipping should commence as early as February of 2020.\n\nOn the matter of shipping, this is one of our greatest concerns right now. We are launching this Kickstarter at a time when tariffs are a matter of contention in the US and Brexit is very much still on the minds of those in the UK. While we are optimistic that neither of these issues will result in a major disruption of this Kickstarter, we cannot ignore the possibility that they affect it in some way.\n\nRepeating what we said in our first Kickstarter, we are still realistic about potential delays and believe in complete transparency. If unforeseen delays occur, we are determined to keep our backers informed every step of the way. With your help, we intend to produce a quality product that we hope will satisfy our backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Park Visitor", "descp": "Follow along and receive project updates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["662 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Retailer", "descp": "Retailers that would like to purchase 10 or more copies of DinoGenics should back at this level.

We live in Frederick, MD and are active in the thriving gaming community here. \nCarroll County Cake Swap developed out of the influence of supportive friends and family. Starting as an abstract concept at the Frederick Game Development Meetup, it quickly evolved into a game about cakes, and eventually a friendly competition reminiscent of the rolling green hills and local farm show of nearby Carroll County. \nSpecial thanks to Frederick Game Development Meetup, the Frederick Board Gamers, Brainstorm Comics & Gaming, Break My Game, AnnaMaria Jackson-Phelps and all the other content media purveyors who have provided insights, feedback and encouragement, my family, and the incredible Becky Baldwin, without whose help I would not have been able to make any of this happen.\nThanks also to the Cake Ambassadors whose generous pledges made the Carroll County Cake Swap - Print and Play (2018) a success!\nBecky Baldwin\nEd & Naomi Sensenig\nJohn and Jamie\nKabrina\nMatt \"Prime\"\nMiss Mila Schmidt\nPatrick \"and don't call me Surely\" Fitzgerald\nRuth Sensenig\nSasha Crum\nSteve", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAbout a year ago, I launched the \"Print-and-Play\" Kickstarter campaign for Carroll County Cake Swap, and got enough support to start promotion for the game. Since then, I manufactured a small print run and have been selling copies at conventions and playing lots and lots of games with fantastic people who have continued to provide feedback. While the rules of the game have not changed, the past year has allowed me to tweak some graphic elements to clarify iconography and provide more thorough explanations in the rule book. That means that the version you'll get has already had the kinks worked out and is in superior shape!\n\nWhile there are risks in moving from a small print run to a larger print run, such as increased time for shipping, I am using trusted companies in the business for manufacturing and fulfillment, and planning for a comfortable timeline to mitigate chances of delays.\n\nYour financial support provides the capital I need to place a large order. However, I have already put much of my own money into the development and promotion of the game, and am prepared to cover unexpected upfront costs that might arise (such as tariffs or changes in shipping costs).\n\nAbove all, I believe in the importance of good communication and will keep you informed of progress along the way.

Size perfectly for board game boxes and padded to protect them.\nA weekly calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nImportant: Because of the color mix being ordered, people who back for a gray bag from this point forward might not get their gray bag in October instead of September.\nAttention Canadian Backers: I messed up your shipping price. The best solution is to use the \"Make a pledge without a reward\" above the reward levels. It let's you type in any dollar amount you want. We will manually make sure it gets mapped to the right reward after the campaign.\nGrocery bags, rubber totes, or balancing a big stack of games are fine. But having a bag that is built for the purpose of carrying games is nicer.\nI was honestly skeptical at first. Then I started using one. The shape is a perfect fit for common games. It is big enough to hold all the games you want to take. Padded and supported so your games aren't damaged in transport.\nDifferent situations call for carrying your bag differently. The shoulder strap is removable, and the backpack straps hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nThis isn't the first board game bag we have made and sold. We sold thousands and thousands of the previous version. We've used them ourselves. We've heard from customers. We've watched people use them at conventions.\nBased on all that, there were a few things we thought we could improve.\nThe v1 bags were designed plenty strong enough to hold standard games. But we heard reports of problems if the bag was full of really heavy games (like Dominion with several expansions) or if a lot of force was put on the handle or straps (like if you swing the bag onto your back).\nWe decided not to mess around with this one. We analyzed how the v1 bag failed when it was overloaded. Then we made changes to DOUBLE the weight capacity based on the factory's real life testing. \nSo we added more/better stitching at key weight bearing points. And improved the support strapping so that your lift force is transferred to the bottom of the bag instead of tugging on the top and sides.\nThis new bag is designed to lay flat so that games like Scythe and Gloomhaven can fit without being turned on end.\nThe lay flat design, in addition to some extra internal support, means that the small games lay in place better and the bag will hold its shape, even if you aren't bringing enough games to fill it.\nMany of you said that several people in your game group have a BoardGameTables.com bag. And at conventions, oh my! A million people all with the same bag. So, we added a little name tag holder on the back of the bag. Not the biggest feature ever, but a helpful one.\n\nWant to class it up just a bit? The Heathered Blue bag is stronger (higher weight limit, and will take more abuse for longer). And the fabric just feels ... well ... nicer.\nBoth bags get the job done. They are the same size. The blue one is just a bit nicer and stronger.\nWeight limits based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games, not situations where life or limb may be in jeopardy. Weight limits may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nUse it as a planner, desk calendar, or hang it on the wall. 53 stunning photos.\n\nNo one's going to make you do them. Don't worry if it isn't your thing. \nHave some ideas for challenges we should use for the other weeks? We have enough to fill the calendar, but we're on the lookout for some better ones. Post them in the comments.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with a link) in the comments section. We will choose some photos from the comments to include (assuming the photographer is on board).\n\n\nIf we are using someone's work, they should get paid. We will get permission from all photographers before using their photo. All photographers get a free calendar. And all photographers are paid a royalty based on a percentage of sales of the calendar.\nThe photos will say the name of the game and the photographer's name.\nThe more people who buy a calendar, the more money the photographers will make. Thank you for your support.\n\n Shipping prices for Canada and EU account for the fact that we have to pay VAT/GST upon import. You will not owe any duty on your purchase. Shipments to non-EU Europe and \"Everywhere Else\" will ship with a commercial invoice and you will be responsible for any duty/taxes.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required solid wood table called The Jasper, and a line of quick, but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. I am an optimistic gamer. Better bring my copy of Die Macher, just in case. The IKEA bag is ok, but a properly sized and padded board game bag is way better.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011. It was a hobby, not a business. I sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and in a way, it planted a seed of things to come, starting a business that would serve the board gaming community. I'm excited to bring this thing full circle.\nIf this Kickstarter should get even bigger, we have arrangements in place with the factory to be able to handle an even larger order.\nWe will ship out the first 1400 bags based on backer number and the color mix we have available.\nWe will be selling board game bags at Gen Con, and we normally offer special convention pricing. We will ship the first 1400 before Gen Con, but the other bags will be shipping after Gen Con. There is also an outside chance we will have some calendars for sale at Gen Con. We want to be upfront with our plans.\nReviews of the version 1 bag. The new bag is better in many ways. All reviews are unpaid, but some reviewers received a free or discounted bag.\n \"I've used a few bags ... and I'm really really pleased with it\" \n\"The straps are very broad and easy to wear\"\n \"A good deal for the quality you get. ... They sure do make a pretty good gaming backpack.\" \n\"Just got a game bag from @BGTables  & OMG is it ever nice. It fits 7 full-size games in it, and it has backpack straps, and when you put it on it feels very comfortable. And it folds down real small too? If you like to bring lots of games to the party, it sure beats a paper bag.\" \n\"This bag from @BGTables is awesome. So much easier to lug stacks of games around.\"\nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund for any reason or even no reason at all.\nWhen you get your bag/calendar, will we refund 100% of your purchase if you don't think what you ordered lived up to what we promised. In this case, we will pay for return shipping.\nYes, you will have the option to purchase On Tour and QE in the pledge manager.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the lowest risk Kickstarter we have ever run.\n\nWe have a great relationship with a factory that has made over 10,000 bags for us in the past.

Along with Tussie Mussie, Seasons of Rice left a mark on the judges and many that have played the PNP since. \nIf you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy:\nWe're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists.\nWe release a new wallet game every month. This is game #53!\nOur wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nEach game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey.\nIf you want to know more about anything, including other games and rules questions, join an already-wonderful community at our Discord server: https://discord.gg/pf9DPqs\nA game takes place over two separate seasons (drafting phases): first the Wet Season, then the Dry Season.\nPlayers begin the game during the Wet Season with a hand of 7 paddy  cards. \nPlayers simultaneously select 2 cards from their hand: One to immediately place into their personal landscape and one to place into a communal row of cards called the Dry Season row. \nPlayers then exchange their hands and repeat until all cards have been placed.\nIn the Dry Season, players take turns selecting one card from the Dry Season row and immediately placing it into their landscape. When the Dry Season row is empty, the game is over.\nPlayers have an opportunity to score points during both seasons by fully enclosing their paddies with paths. They will score for the size of a closed paddy, scoring more if it contains houses, farmers, or buffaloes.\nA player-specific \u201cancestor,\u201d representing the guiding spirit of a revered forebear, will also award that player additional points for achieving certain conditions.\nStrategically, opportunities abound in the card-rich Wet Season, when all share in a plenitude of resources and hands overflow with possibilities. Players must still think ahead to the Dry Season, though, when options will rapidly dwindle as the Dry Season row runs out of cards. The deck is small and rounds are quick, but a sustainable plan for organically generating points is a must across the seasons.\nIn the end, the player with the most points wins and may proudly boast of having the most fertile rice paddies in the region!\nYou can download a low color print and play here: https://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/seasons-of-rice\n\"Overall, I quite enjoy Seasons of Rice! It\u2019s everything I like in a Button Shy game: major spatial component, variable scoring options, bright art, portability, decently easy to learn, and a fun theme. Honestly that\u2019s kind of what I generally like in a game regardless of  publisher.\" - What's Eric Playing\n\"Although the game plays fast, and components are minimal, the game  provides enough depth that the publisher definitely accomplished their goal with this game. An 18-card game with high re-playability, strategic choices, and that can be stored and played in almost any situation.\" - Everything Board Games\n\"It\u2019s basically dark wizardry that Button Shy consistently produces  interesting, strategic games that only contain eighteen cards and can  easily fit in a pants pocket. This game is no exception, and  furthermore, builds on some of their best designs with its take on  drafting and tableau building.\" - Cardboard Hoard, Punchboard Media \nAll rewards except the retailer level come with the free expansions (The Water Festival and Jasmine & Ginger), see below for more info on them. \nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Going forward, we're just going to give it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting TWO EXPANSIONS if you pledge here.\nThe Water Festival (4 cards) is a river that splits up the play area.\n\nThere is a river of four 2-sided cards that gets \u201crandomly\u201d laid. By random, they may be rotated and shuffled, but laid in such a way that they create a horizontal line between players. Play starts and continues as normal, but players will play off the river to start their landscape. Each section of the river has a feature and if players have a majority of that particular feature in the connected paddy at the end of each season, they will earn a scoring ability.  When playing with The Water Festival, the Wet Season has a set intermediate scoring. Before the Dry Season they\u2019re all flipped over and have a more randomized scoring for the end of the game.\nJasmine & Ginger (2 cards) will alter early game strategies.\nThe Jasmine Rice Contract is awarded to the player with the most points at the end of the Wet Season, while the Ginger Rice Contract is awarded to the other player. The player with lesser points will still draft the first card from the Dry Season. \nJasmine Rice Contract: Player immediately earn 9 points minus 1 for every farmer in their landscape.  \nGinger Rice Contract: During the Dry Season, earn +2 points for every paddy closed.\nWe have a lot of games in our collection. You can add-on any that are in stock using the below methods.\nThis is our Customer Support Wizard Matthew's collection of our first 42 games.

His love of board games stems from the fact that they bring people together, immerse them in stories, build camaraderie, and challenge one another. Since becoming a gamer, he has just started trying his hand at the design and illustrative side of it.\nDriven by curiosity, Jerome spends a lot of time exploring new places and activities. He finds empowerment and rejuvenation high above the canopies or deep below the sea of the Evergreen State. His enjoyment of outdoor adventures directly parallels his lifelong passion for creating art. Learning and honing a variety of artistic disciplines, his works range from traditional media to motion graphic and digital illustration.\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the  members back the projects).\nOur 2019 $5 packages include an episode of Chain Mail, a card and dice driven, asymmetric dungeon crawler for 1-4 players. Each episode comes with a postcard map, dual monster card, and a new quest. After multiple months you can randomize these and/or attempt  multiple quests in a campaign mode. \nIt also includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Tempus Quest pen and paper game where you use time instead of dice. The crew of the Tempus ship get into a new adventure each month. You can try out the  first Episode today right here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/tempus-quest-0-24629368\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. (For example, last month included an Anthelion expansion and a 3 card solo game, MechAge.)\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns. \nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon! \nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything is ready for this game.

Whenever recording a species, a player immediately takes one of 5 possible bonus actions that allow the player to set themselves up for future turns or alter the landscape. Players continue to take turns until The Rift Tile is revealed, making the portal to the new world unstable. Once The Rift begins, players add an additional phase to their turns, taking part in dismantling the landscape they have opened up for exploration. The game comes to a close as they race to complete their tasks and return home. When the game ends, players receive prestige points for their recorded species and bonuses are earned for specializing in specific sets of species. The Darwinaut with the most points will win the game and go down in history as a pioneer in this new age of discovery.\n Darwinauts is a game for 1-4 players, ages 13 and up and plays in 30-45 minutes.\n\nDarwinauts comes in our bigger box size 9.5\" x 7.25\" x 2\".

The Mechanics feel familiar enough that you understand it in an instant yet deep enough to make you want to explore more options during each play.\" -Dan Patriss, Geek All-Stars\n\nRichard Ham of Rahdo Runs Through takes a look right here: \nClick the logo below for a live play-through that Jason did with Infectious Play (Jonathan Gilmour and Ian Moss) :\nTantrum House shares their thoughts:\nEdo take a look here:\n\"Darwinauts has a little bit of the feel of other tile-laying games like Carcassone, but the \u201cremove explorers\u201d action to acquire resources is new. I like how it keeps the game clock ticking, and pushes everyone inevitably toward the end. The one thing it doesn\u2019t share with other tile-laying games is the way you can enjoy the map at the end of the game\u2014because, by the end, there\u2019s almost nothing left! If you like tile-laying games and far-out alien creatures, maybe you\u2019ll want to become a Darwinaut yourself.\" -Jonathan Liu, GeekDad\n\n\nListen to Draft Mechanic gush about Vincent's art here!\n\"The growth and collapse of the map in each game of Darwinauts makes every decision feel vital. It\u2019s a tight balance between efficiency and exploration enhanced by Dutrait\u2019s excellent artwork!\" -Draft Mechanic\n\"It\u2019s the perfect combination of tension and strategy.\" - Angelica, Married Meeples\n\nA video update from designer Chris Bryan about the journey to Darwinauts:\nAnd more to come...\nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Darwinauts that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components and adding content to make this cool game even cooler! We have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a peek at the first few stretch goals! We'll announce more funding thresholds as we get closer to funding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the First Edition Rules PDF RIGHT HERE!\nThe rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the updated graphic design.  \n\n                         UK and EU copies will be shipping from within the UK with VAT paid! (Currently seeking alternatives to UK shipping in case Brexit becomes an issue!)\nNote: International Backers outside of the UK and EU will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package.  \nWe have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the ever-changing rates of the US Postal Service. We must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe understand that shipping to our international friends can be cost prohibitive and that others have found creative ways to mitigate some of this cost. We have managed to work with a partner in the UK to ship our UK and EU packages to backers to help alleviate VAT charges. As a small company that mostly handles our own fulfillment, we simply pass our shipping cost on to our backers. In addition, it is our goal to continue to develop our network of awesome international partners that we have worked with to localize Darwinauts for game markets around the world. \nChris Bryan is a filmmaker and game designer. You might know him from the award winning web series he co-created, Board with Life. Or you might know him from the Golden Geek Award winning D&D Podcast, Board with Life: Adventures where he plays as a Tabaxi Fighter named Prince Smith Dith Rith the 5th, (the strongest boy alive.) His previous game designs include Lanterns Dice: Lights in the Sky, Favelas, and Dragonball Z: Perfect Cell. When he isn't writing bios about himself he enjoys camping, gardening, climbing, playing drums, and spending time with his wife, 2 cats, and tiny dog in Denton, Texas.   \nThe visual world of Darwinauts was brought to life by legendary artist, Vincent Dutrait (Elysium, Lewis and Clark, New York: 1901, Rise of Augustus) who painstakingly crafted the various species by hand.\nOver the last 20 years, Vincent Dutrait has become one of the most beloved illustrators in the board game industry. His body of work includes art direction, graphic design, and illustration in the game industry and in children's book publishing. Vincent currently lives with his family in South Korea. You can find out more about his amazing work here.\nGraphic design assistance is provided by SplatteredInk's Darryl T. Jones (Into the Black Forest, Dobbers: Quest for the Key, Freshwater Fly, and the upcoming Alwaysgreen Garden).\nGreen Couch Games was founded by Jason Kotarski to release great little games that make great big connections. Darwinauts will be their thirteenth release following Fidelitas, Best Treehouse Ever, JurassAttack!, Avalanche at Yeti Mountain, Wok on Fire, Rocky Road a la Mode, OutLawed!, Ladder 29, Before The Earth Explodes, Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun, Filler, and Into The Black Forest. You can check out our other games right here on our website!  \nJason is also a game designer and co-host of 20 Minutes of Filler and runs the 20 Minutes of Filler Facebook Group that seeks to create a larger platform for the best games that come in small packages. \nShare your Darwinauts love with these handy avatars:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy experience with our previous campaigns, Fidelitas, Best Treehouse Ever, JurassAttack!, Avalanche at Yeti Mountain, Wok on Fire, Rocky Road a la Mode, OutLawed!, Ladder 29, Before The Earth Explodes, Filler, Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun, and Into The Black Forest has provided a solid foundation for me to build on. I plan to avoid delays and common pitfalls by paying special attention to the following areas and building on previous experience:\n\nArt and Design. The art and design for the game is nearly complete so we'll be ready to print shortly after the close of the campaign. I always like to show you I mean business by paying for the art and design upfront!\n\nPlaytesting and Reviewing. Darwinauts has been tested by many different playtesters and even a bunch of game designers. I have sent a bunch of prototypes to a variety of reviewers. I want to earn your trust by providing you with a solid product that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by folks from varying backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nPast Experience. This is the thirteenth Kickstarter project I've run for Green Couch Games and I have helped with several other successful campaigns. Also, having spent many years working in retail and customer service, I understand the importance of treating backers with respect and following through with projects.\n\nOf course, there are always unexpected circumstances that pop up, but I PROMISE to communicate every step of the way and do my best to use creative problem solving meet the challenges head on.\n\nThank you so much for giving Green Couch Games a chance. As a small company, I truly can't do this without you. I will do my best to thank you by creating great little games that you love to play.\n\nSincerely, \nJason Kotarski, founder of Green Couch Games\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "Standard Explorer", "descp": "One (1) Copy of Darwinauts and all unlocked Stretch Goals.

One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes,  who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side  takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to  achieve their objectives.\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a mission which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game,  number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to  achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing  sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game.  The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards... everything the  heroes need to play a mission. The villain box contains the miniatures,  tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the  fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals you have unlocked during the first campaign.\n This pledge level allows you to pick and choose what you want, and then decide on your pledge level \u20ac total. A default pledge of \u20ac7 has been set, as this is almost the lowest value element of this campaign. Once you have made your selection and have totaled its\u2019 value, you can directly enter that total \u20ac amount as your pledge.\nFor example: All you want is the Suicide Squad add-on (26 \u20ac), Batman Inc add-on (26 \u20ac), White Rabbit (6.5\u20ac), Carmine Falcone (6.5 \u20ac), and Nobody (6.5 \u20ac) from the picking zone. A total of 71.5\u20ac\nSo, select the \u201cYour choice - Open pledge\u201d pledge level and enter that total amount of 71.5\u20ac, overwriting the minimum pledge amount and you are set.\nAdventure mode racked up 42 missions in season 1, is still supported with 9 NEW missions in season 2. And, some of the new season 2 characters can also be used in S1 core box adventure mode missions.\nFinally, all season 2 characters come with their own tile, opening up a wider Versus mode selection pool for the 10 NEW versus mode missions.\nWhy are there two prices?\nThere are two prices displayed on season 2 elements, the lesser one is exclusive to this KS campaign, and the other will be the price per item once the Monolith WebShop goes live.\nFYI - We anticipate that the Season 2 Batman product will be available on the Webstore several months after the Season 2  kickstarter has been delivered.\nRed Hood \u2013 thank you gift miniature\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN HOW TO GET RED HOOD\nIf your pledge includes ANY elements from season 2, then the Red Hood is yours - free.\nPledge during the \u201cLate pledge \u201cstage or \u201cNo reward\u201d pledge level and you can also pick him up as an add-on pledge within the pledge manager for \u20ac6.5.\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EXPANSION\n\nCLICK ON THE PICTURE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT BATMAN INC.

Our President - Travis R. Chance was a founder of Action Phase Games. He is an expert at Kickstarter, funding every game he brought to the platform, including Western Legends, Kodama, and Aeon's End. Our team has continued this record by successfully funding 9 games in 2018 and 3 already this year!\nThis board game is full of beautiful illustrations by Whitney Rader and graphical layout from Chris Byer.\nWe are committed to fulfilling all Kickstarter pledges all Kolossal Games titles before they are available at retail. Our backers will also enjoy the lowest possible price for this game, guaranteed. \nBy backing Papillon through this campaign, you will receive - at no extra cost - the Beyond the Meadow expansion. This Limited Quantity expansion will include tons of unlocked Stretch Goal content not in the wide release of Papillon. We have returned all of the exciting goals revealed in the previous campaign as goals for this as well. This Free Expansion is a great bonus for those who want to get in on early copies of this game!\nCountless hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience. \nThe utmost thought and care were taken with regard to the theme and source material for the game. As with all of Kolossal's releases, we strive to make games that are enjoyable, approachable, and non-exclusionary.\nWe believe friendly local gaming stores are important pillars of our community and will not sell to online discounters. You can read more here about our Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) Policy. \nRather than offer exclusives as stretch goals, Kolossal rewards our backers' support with limited edition content. Learn more about our Limited Quantities Policy here.  \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.

(Also includes a solo expansion by Mike Mullins - see below for more info.)\nFeaturing I-Split-You-Choose drafting, players draw 2 cards and offer one face-up and another face-down to their neighbor. The neighbor takes their choice and the active player receives the other. After everyone has 4 cards, face-down cards are revealed and everyone scores their collection. After 3 rounds the scores are totaled to determine a winner!\nIf you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy:\nWe're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists.\nWe release a new wallet game every month. This is game #52!\nOur wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nEach game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey.\nIf you want to know more about anything... games, rules questions, join an already wonderful community at our discord channel: https://discord.gg/pf9DPqs\nThe active player draws two cards and looks at them. They will need to offer both to their neighbor, except one will be face-up and the other will be face down. Their neighbor will choose one card and the active player receives the other, so the decision here is very important. \n\nOnce they decide which card to reveal, they place them onto the table. \nIt's fun to read the flavor text on the face-up card aloud when offering to your neighbor. \"We are happy friends\" should help influence their decision, right?\nThe neighbor must choose one to take based upon the information they have available in front of them. This is also a key decision. Will they take the face-up card or go for the unknown in the face-down card? These decisions get harder and harder as the game goes on as players can see what other players are collecting.\nOnce taken, the card's orientation is maintained, but if a face-down card was taken, the owner may now look at it to see what they received. \nThe active player keeps the other card, maintaining its orientation as well. \nCards are placed in order of receipt from left to right and must remain in that order for the round. \nAfter each player has 4 cards, the round ends and players move into the scoring phase of the game. \nThe Orchid can count as pink, giving a bonus point for the Pink Rose.\nFace-up cards are considered your Bouquet and remain in place. \nFace-down cards are considered your Keepsakes. Pull them closer to you, forming a second row but maintaining their order from left to right (and retaining the gaps formed between the Bouquet cards), and reveal them.  \nCards with abilities trigger in any order that you choose.\nUsing the Snapdragon's ability, I was able to move the Orchid from my bouquet row to my keepsake row. This gives me exactly two cards in the bouquet and an extra 2 points for the Peony.\nThen score your card abilities from left to right. Each Heart is worth 1 point as well. This example would have been an 8 point round. Not bad!\nPlayers then compare total scores. Play to 3 rounds. The winner is the player with the highest combined score from all 3 rounds.\nYou can check out a low color print and play here: https://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/tussie-mussie\nTussie Mussie impressed us from the start when it won the 2018 Gen Can't design contest. Since then, it's managed to capture hearts of the review community. Here's a taste of it:\n\"Tussie-Mussie creates more thoughtful decisions with its \"I cut, you choose\" style and 18 cards than some full-blown tabletop games with five-square-foot player boards and 108 miniatures. It does one thing (card drafting) but does it in a way that creates a light, enjoyable stress for both the cutter and chooser. It is a very good game mechanically.\" - http://www.everythingboardgames.com/2019/05/tussie-mussie-kickstarter-preview.html\n\"In terms of both play and form, Tussie Mussie is New York Slice/Piece o\u2019 Cake meets Love Letter.

We generally only sell playmats during the Kickstarter campaigns.

This is another level that's good to grab while on Kickstarter, as we dedicate a small portion of the print run to retail store sales. Grabbing them here will guarantee the availability. \nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Going forward, we're just going to give it away from the start.

Designed by Mike Mullins (Bottom of the 9th, Pentaquark) this expansion is full of the heart of the multiplayer game, but puts some nice new twists on it for the solo player. Turn Cards direct how cards must be dealt and how they must be taken, but it's up to you to decide which card will go to which player. Do you want to gain some information about that face-down card, or leave it and potentially give your opponent the lead?\nWant to see how it works? Matt Upton made a lovely walkthrough video:\nWe're also offering a reward level that includes a Solo Playmat. This is not required to play, but makes it look really nice. It's 24\" wide by 14\" tall and helps separate the areas of play as well as keep score. You will need 2 cubes or small tokens to track the scores of yourself and the AI opponent. \nWe have a lot of games in our collection. You can add-on any that are in stock using the below methods.\nThis is our Customer Support Wizard Matthew's collection of our first 42 games.

She designed Tussie Mussie for a Button Shy design contest last summer. It was several months later that her game Wingspan (just nominated for the  Kennerspiel des Jahres) burst onto the scene.\nBeth Sobel is a board game illustrator living in Bellingham, Washington with her husband and two cats.\nBeth has illustrated our very own Circle The Wagons, along with many other great games such as Viticulture, Wingspan, Arboretum, Between Two Cities and many more. \nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY  WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects).\nOur 2019 $5 packages include an episode of Chain Mail,  a card and dice driven, asymmetric dungeon crawler for 1-4 players.  Each episode comes with a postcard map, dual monster card, and a new quest. After multiple months you can randomize these and/or attempt multiple quests in a campaign mode. \nIt also includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Tempus Quest pen and paper game where you use time instead of dice. The crew of the Tempus ship get into a new adventure each month. You can try out the first Episode today right here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/tempus-quest-0-24629368\n\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. Next month is an Anthelion expansion and a 3 card solo game, MechAge. \nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).

The first player to earn a given Large Landmark token, Geisha bonus token, or Enclosure bonus token also gains the Toku card on top. \nToku cards are worth one journey point if kept until the end of the game or they may be spent for a one-time special use - such as free landmarks, changing torii gates, or discounts when using the different game characters. In some cases, that could mean being able to use the vendor or samurai for free! You can also use several Toku cards on the same turn for a big play. The Toku mini-expansion gives another incentive to be first to accomplish certain objectives and creates dynamic plays later in the game.\nThe Koi mini-expansion is a second expansion for advanced players, in which each player is dealt a set of action cards at the start of the game. \nKoi cards are worth one journey point if kept until the end of the game or they may be used as special actions for extra tokens, using multiple characters, etc. Players only get one of each action card, but they can use them whenever they want or in combination for huge turns. The Koi mini-expansion gives players extra flexibility and creates big scoring opportunities as the game progresses.\nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for The One Hundred Torii will also receive the Toku Mini-Expansion & The Koi Mini-Expansion for Free. These expansions will be available for sale separately on BGG, at Conventions, etc. Neither will be packaged within the base game. \n\nHow to Play - (English) \nLe Tuto Des R\u00e8gles (French)\n\nPreview part of a paid marketing package with BGS\n Rahdo Runs Through: The One Hundred Torii Rundown - \"This is a very sweet, charming, and a lovely, peaceful zen-like experience.\"\nClick for full review!\nTantrum House - The One Hundred Torii Preview - \"The One Hundred Torii is Awesome!

Get Me Off This Planet!\", \"The Siblings Trouble\", \"GemPacked Cards\", \"Heroes and Tricks\", \"Herbaceous\", \"Legendary Creatures\", \"Sunset Over Water\", Herbaceous Sprouts, and \"Heroes Welcome\" all successfully funded and shipped to backers. \"Skulk Hollow\" is in manufacturing and shipping to backers in September. We strive to run excellent Kickstarters and deliver fantastic products.\n\n\"The One Hundred Torii\" is well-tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete and the card art is final. Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how our planned Stretch Goals unfold.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 5 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

During that time he ran the company while also designing and publishing several premium board games, including Railroad Tycoon, Age of Mythology, Conquest of the Empire 2, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization, Attack!, and others. In 2007 under his private Tropical Games label, Glenn also designed and published Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery, which enjoyed great commercial and critical success.\nGlenn is currently President of Forbidden Games and has designed and published Victory and Glory: Napoleon, Railroad Rivals, Raccoon Tycoon, and Extraordinary Adventures: Pirates.\n\nART\nAnnie Stegg Gerard has a special love for the 18th century Rococo painters who have had a large influence on her own method. She finds inspiration in their imagination, and the dreamlike palette and lively brushwork that combine to create a wonderful atmosphere of enchantment. She believes that they sought to transport us to different worlds and fantastic places though their works. In her own work, known for its beautiful, enigmatic figures and lively creatures, Annie strives to depict this same transportive effect to the viewer. She and her husband live in Northern Georgia with their twin boys, dog, and two cats.\nGallery Gerard\nAnnie Stegg Illustration\nAnnie Stegg Fine Art (Facebook)\nAnnie Stegg Gerard (Instagram)\n\nGRAPHICS\nJacoby O'Connor is a freelance graphic designer living in the far western suburbs of Chicago. He first started working on board game projects 18 years ago while working for a small graphic design agency where his first project was Glenn Drover's American Civil War followed by War! Age of Imperialism, Railroad Tycoon, Age of Mythology, Conquest of the Empire 2, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization, Attack!, Napoleon in Europe, and others. Since then he has been the graphic designer on many other titles such as the North Star Games hits Wits & Wagers, Say Anything, and Evolution. His latest projects were Glenn's WarQuest and North Star's Blurble.\n\nPROJECT LEAD\nSean Brown has worked in the game industry for almost 13 years, half of them for Eagle Games as a salesmen, co-designer, graphic artist, marketing director, developer, and warehouse manager (many at the same time) and half of them for Mr. B. Games as the President. He has worked on Alien Uprising, Spurs, Realm of Heroes, Zothren Invasion, Posthuman, Days of Ire, Madness at Midnight, WarQuest, Liars Dice, Prospectus, Helionox, Hellenica, Panic, Aviation Tycoon, and Clockwork Kingdom as a designer, developer and/or graphic artist for Mr. B. Games as well as the following titles via graphic art, development or co-design work while at Eagle Games: Age of Steam, Age of Empires III, Attack Deluxe, Baltimore and Ohio, Brass, Defenders of the Realm and all of its expansions, Defenders Battlefields, Empires Builder Expansion, I'm the Boss TCG, Incan Gold, New England Railways, Pirate Dice, Railways of the World and all of its expansions, Roll through the Ages, Through the Ages, Tumblin' Dice, and Wizards Brew.\n\nDISTRIBUTION\nForbidden Games has distributor and warehousing relationships worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, China, Australia, Europe, and the UK.\n\nPUBLISHER\nForbidden Games is a (fairly) new board game developer/publisher founded by two veteran game designers and entrepreneurs: Jason Kapalka, a co-founder and chief game designer at PopCap, makers of video games such as Bejeweled, Peggle, and Plants vs. Zombies, and Glenn Drover, the founder of Eagle Games and designer of numerous board games including the tabletop versions of Railroad Tycoon and Age of Empires III.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign via our Pledge Manager. \nPLEASE SEE THE SHIPPING AND PLEDGE MANAGER SECTIONS FOR EST. SHIPPING.\nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Brazil, Russia, South Africa, South America, Mexico, or the Middle East due to high postage prices, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company. We continue to work with different fulfillment centers all over the world to ensure better and more affordable delivery each campaign but none will guarantee delivery to these countries.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Damage may occur during transit by the various shipping carriers used. We wish this was not the case, but it can happen. Shipping Carriers pass their fees along to us; we do not set high postage rates. We subsidize all shipping and handling costs from our profits to help lower these costs for you, our backers, because it is important to us to help spread the word about our project and help our games and our company grow. We are a small business that relies on shipping companies to fill our Kickstarter campaigns.  \nPLEASE email our Customer Service for any missing parts after you have your reward at simon{at symbol}forbidden.games - Our fulfillment CS is mrbgames.cs{at symbol}gmail.com if you have major issues with delivery/loss/damage that cannot be resolved with the carrier (i.e. always try your local post office first) and we will help assist you in resolving them. We will need your backer number, address and backer name in the email. \nCustoms \"Friendly?\" - Our shipping prices include customs and VAT. We will make the best shipping choices for your rewards. In addition to the U.S., we also ship parcels from warehouses in Europe, the UK, Canada, China, and Australia. This allows us to minimize customs paperwork for those in those regions/ nations. However, we reserve the right to ship parcels from the USA or China if quantities ordered outside the USA are not large enough to facilitate pallet shipments. We will let folks know via an update if we ship from the USA and offer invoices to help with customs if need be. \nThere are many advantages to using a Pledge Manager, such as late add-ons, the ability to change your address as much as you like until we lock them, and a more accurate cost for you, the backer, on delivery costs. We also plan to ship in 3 waves. The first will be to those who fill out their pledge managers by our announced cut off date. Wave 2 will follow shortly after, with a final Wave after that. \nIf for any reason you feel you have a missing item or damaged item, please email us at mrbgames.cs{at symbol}gmail.com with photos of damage, your backer number, backer name, and complete address and we will work to replace the missing or damaged items ASAP. Do not post in the comments or other forums as we may miss them or be delayed in replying.     \nThe following Terms are accepted by you, the backer, when you pledge, so we can ensure smooth delivery for all. Surveys not filled in after 2 months of final delivery (from the \"we are shipping\" update) or missing reward requests after 2 months of your game shipment will be treated as a no reward pledge. Please help us get you your rewards by emailing our CS with any issues you may have in a timely manner and filling in your survey in a timely manner! Watch for updates on all shipping statuses. All our major communications will be via Updates. Shipping costs listed above are just estimates and may change. Actual charges will be in our Pledge Manager tool and may differ from our estimates. \nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look and materials of the project, and hence the rewards, are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the possibility of a general release copy. We will always do our best to provide exactly what was pictured, but sometimes small details change or a card is removed and replaced with another, etc. The above campaign depicts our plan, but all plans can change at a factory level.

You'll reveal a unique and challenging landscape every single time the game is played which will require you to adjust your strategy as you go. Managing resources and battling the other explorers, it's a tense and explosive race to control the Shrines first!\nDon't see what you need? If you\u2019d like to purchase a copy of the KS Edition of the base game or the Thieves expansion only, head to playmonster.com where we have a few remaining copies from the second print run available while supplies last. These will ship immediately upon purchase.\nThe Island of El Dorado - Legend Edition includes every single upgrade that we could think of right from the start. We've pulled absolutely no punches and maxed out our components in every way possible, matching the quality of our previous campaigns from day one rather than using stretch goals to get back to where we\u2019ve already been. Still, we\u2019re always open to improvement and will consider every stretch goal idea you all post in the comments which doesn\u2019t shatter our timeline or budget. Honestly, this is the version of the game we'll be personally using and we want it to be flippin' awesome. Let\u2019s work together to make this thing absolutely insane.\n*Update*: We've heard some great ideas in the comment section already! Here is our list of backer-idea stretch goals! You can help improving the game by sharing this project with your family and friends! Click here to share on Facebook.\nThe Island of El Dorado is defined by the beautiful artwork which makes up its tiles, resources, and characters. Each gameplay element brings a new life and a new application to these 16th century masterpieces which were created by some of the most iconic and gifted painters in the history of visual art. Graciously opened to the public domain by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, we consider it an honor and a privilege to apply these works of indescribable beauty, mystery, and majesty to the narrative of The Island of El Dorado.\nThis is the ONLY time The Island of El Dorado Legend Edition will be available. While the base game, Thieves expansion, and a small box version of the Revenge expansion will be available in retail going forward, the only time you\u2019ll be able to secure a copy of the Legend Edition big box, game organizer trays, and the kickstarter exclusives from this and previous campaigns is RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.\nWe want you on this journey with us. The feedback we received before, during, and after the first two campaigns from our families, friends, and backers is a huge part of what made the El Dorado universe what it is. We want to hear your ideas, see your islands, and know both the things you love and the areas you think we could improve. Now more than ever, we need your feedback to make the Legend Edition big box the coolest thing any of us have ever seen.\nEl Dorado Games started with three friends just trying to make a game we could play together at game night. With the success of the first and second Kickstarters and overwhelming positive reviews, our new goal is to bring all the fun and excitement we\u2019ve had to friend groups around the world. We\u2019re thankful for every single one of you and we\u2019re excited you\u2019re on this rollercoaster with us!\nWe initially created The Island of El Dorado to be a strategy game that we could play with our friends and family who don\u2019t like strategy games. It was designed to be a tool to bring new people into the hobby; to be the kind of game you could play against your grandma (and she could beat you!). As the game and the community surrounding El Dorado grew, however, we\u2019ve incorporated new rule sets and modes of play that allow you to tailor the gaming experience to the preferences of your group; everything from a casual dice-chucking story to an asymmetric brain-burning strategy showdown!\nCasual Mode - For casual gamers. Thoughtfully incorporated elements of luck keep things balanced to the very end and allow players who may fall behind from inexperienced decision making to catch up - and win!\nHardcore Mode - For strategy veterans. Every action takes thought and could have lasting consequences as elements of luck are significantly reduced or removed altogether. It\u2019s you against them.

There is nothing in this project that is exclusive to pledging for this project. Each partner that makes Terraforming Mars will determine how they will distribute promos in their languages after the project ends.  \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the biggest and most strategic expansion for the best selling tile placement and card drafting game, Terraforming Mars.  The base game of Terraforming Mars is required to use this expansion.

This expansion adds a distinct, new level of play as players vie for control of the Terraforming Council, as well as plan for the Global Events.  This expansion will appeal to those who want to play a more expansive game of Terraforming Mars.\nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the 49th project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 48 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil was designed by the talented Jacob Fryxelius, and developed by the Fryxelius brothers of FryxGames. This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the fifth expansion that takes players back to Mars for the struggle to control and progress human society. \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $34 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just four easy steps: \n Step 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \n Step 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \n Step 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing!\n Step 4: Shortly after the projects ends on May 5th, we will send you a link to our pledge manager. This is where we will get your shipping information and which language versions of the game you would like to receive.\nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Stronghold Games on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more!  \nStronghold Games is excited to offer retailer packages on the English Language editions of Turmoil for Brick and Mortar stores. Many of our partners are also offering retailer packages for their language editions as well.\nFor more information, please email us at: retailers@indieboardsandcards.com or contact your local language partner directly.\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping and sales taxes are very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a discount on ALL shipping and taxes, but there is no free shipping. Shipping & Taxes charges will be added after Kickstarter ends, every backer will be responsible for paying these fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please see shipping & taxes chart below: \nFor the US, Canada, UK, EU, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and Korea we have included applicable taxes, your rewards will be sent Duty Free from within your region \u2013 there will not be any additional customs charge. Outside of the US, Canada, UK and the EU, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a pledge nor will we pay those fees. In case a package is returned or destroyed due to non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled. \nStronghold Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and all other countries not listed below.\nMINDOK has full responsibility for rewards sent to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nMaldito has full responsibility for rewards sent to Spain, Mexico, and Latin America except Brazil.\nIntrafin has full responsibility for rewards sent to France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Swizterland.\nGhenos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Italy.\nMeeple BR Jogos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Portugal and Brazil.\nReflexshop has full responsibility for rewards sent to Hungary.\nFryxGames has full responsibility for rewards sent to the EU countries not listed above & Norway.\nKorea Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Korea.\nArclight has full responsibility for rewards sent to Japan.\nSiam Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Thailand. \n MARS ATTACKS: (Pledge $34 or more) One copy of Terraforming Mars: Turmoil including all of the milestones from this campaign.

That means you\u2019ll be able to manage your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want after the project closes, along with during the campaign. We will post an update to notify backers when the pledge manager email is being sent out. At that time, you\u2019ll need to manage your pledge and enter your shipping address and complete your order. You will be able to select the language for your games in the pledge manager.\nOur plan is to have Terraforming Mars: Turmoil available at Essen. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out around the time of Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you want Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \nTurmoil and all the milestones will be available in Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Stronghold Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 49th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Terraforming Mars: Turmoil will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nStronghold Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and all other countries not listed below.\nMINDOK has full responsibility for rewards sent to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nMaldito has full responsibility for rewards sent to Spain, Mexico, and Latin America except Brazil.\nIntrafin has full responsibility for rewards sent to France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Swizterland.\nGhenos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Italy.\nBR Jugos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Portugal and Brazil.\nReflexshop has full responsibility for rewards sent to Hungary.\nFryxGames has full responsibility for rewards sent to the EU countries not listed above & Norway.\nKorea Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Korea.\nArclight has full responsibility for rewards sent to Japan.\nSiam Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Thailand.\n\nART ASSETS\nSome of the cards shown have not been finalized.

In Regeneration and Rapid Fire, you raced to find a new home.  You've finally discovered a habitable planet, but it lacks a consistent supply of energy resources, so you must establish mining colonies on a nearby planet, one rich with energy crystals but poor in human sustainability.  Develop your colonies by mining for energy crystals, building habitats for colonists, and constructing outposts and science stations.  The future of humanity depends on you!\nCosmic Run: Mining Colony combines a blind bidding mechanic to win resources (with an interesting twist for bidding in a solo game) with a Tetris-like tile building game.  For a short game, there are plenty of interesting decisions to make.\n * Rulebook is low resolution for ease of download.\n Get a fun game.  Dr. Finn consistently delivers on making fun and quick games that are easy to learn, yet require interesting and thoughtful decisions.  \n Free Kickstarter Exclusive Promo Pack.  Get the Missions Promo Pack .  This is a Kickstarter exclusive that is free for backers of this project.  It will not be available through retail and a limited number may be available only during future Kickstarter campaigns.\n Help bring the game into existence.  Dr. Finn's Games will not publish this game if the Kickstarter is unsuccessful.\n Help make the game better.  By helping to reach stretch goals, you are improving the quality of the base game. \n Price below MSRP.   Get the game for $5 off the MSRP.\n Bundle Deals. Get deals on other Dr Finn's Games, including early shipping of those games, for great prices.\n Support an Independent Game Publisher.  Dr. Finn's Games relies on successful Kickstarter campaigns to stay in business. So thanks for your support!\n\n KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE \nEvery backer receiving a copy of Cosmic Run: Mining Colony, will receive the \"mission promo pack\" as a Kickstarter exclusive bonus.   \"Kickstarter exclusive\" means it will be only available during Kickstarter campaigns and there will be a very limited supply of packs available during future Dr Finn's Kickstarter campaigns.\nThe pack adds an interesting twist to the game by providing players with in-game goals. Three random cards are used in each game and players earn a card (worth 1 victory point) by being the first person to meet the card's requirement.  One card, for example, sets the goal of having 3 colonists in the same row of their colony board.  Note: If using alternative scoring method, each card is worth 3 VPS.\n\n\nFor more info of how to play, watch the review videos.  If you are interested in the solo play, check out the final video below for a play through. \nExcavation Cards Artwork\n                     WHAT VERSIONS OF THE GAMES ARE OFFERED IN THE BUNDLES?\n Cosmic Run: Regeneration Basic  is the Kickstarter basic version that includes the 6-card Allies expansion pack.  \n Cosmic Run: Regeneration Deluxe  is the Kickstarter deluxe version that replaces the block-shaped ship tokens with tokens shaped like ships (see image below).  It also includes the 6-card Allies expansion pack.\n Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire is the retail version.  Add $5 to receive the 3-card Tech Tools promo pack.\nFor the Bonanza level, please read description in the rewards section to the right.  The games are all retail versions, unless otherwise indicated.  \nComparison of ships in deluxe (left) and basic (right) versions of Cosmic Run: Regeneration\n STRETCH GOALS ANNOUNCEMENT\nThe $35K and $40K stretch goals will be included if the funding goal is reached.\n\n**** For information about the solo version, see the final video below.****\n\nThanks to the Unfiltered Gamer for the seal of approval!\nThanks to Rahdo for providing his opinion of the game in the first video, followed by a full game play through in the following 2 videos.\nThanks to Forrest for this review.\nThanks to Frances and Anthony for their playthrough and  thoughts.\nThanks to Andrew and Jess from Gameosity for this overview and review.\nThanks to Edo for his overview and review.\nThanks to Kevin for his  overview of how the game is played.\nSOLO PLAY THROUGH BELOW.\nFind out more about the other two available games in the Cosmic Run series, Cosmic Run: Regeneration and Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire, by watching these videos.\nFOR BACKERS OUTSIDE THE U.S.\nThe $7 worldwide shipping price is only for shipping individual copies of Cosmic Run: Mining Colony.\nAll Cosmic Run: Mining Colony games will be shipped directly from China, so you may be charged import duties, which you are responsible for. \nThe declared value of the game will be $23 ($25 minus the approximately $2 fee charged by Kickstarter), since this is essentially the sale price.\nFor many countries, you are not charged duties for games under $25, but you should check your own countries' tariff thresholds if this is a concern for you.\nGames other than Cosmic Run: Mining Colony will ship directly from the U.S. and will also be subject to additional duties.\nFOR U.S. BACKERS\n Cosmic Run: Mining Colony will most likely ship from China.  As of now, there would be no additional duties, but laws might change.  If so, you would be responsible for any import duties, but I doubt there will be any since the tariff threshold is very high for the U.S.\nIt is possible that Cosmic Run: Mining Colony is shipped from within the U.S.  If this happens, it would mean that U.S. backers would receive the games about 5-6 weeks later.  \nOther games will ship from within the U.S. and much earlier than Cosmic Run: Mining Colony.  \nDr. Finn's Games has a limited supply of some older games that can be purchased as \"add ons\" for this campaign.  However, due to limitations of the Kickstarter system, a desire to keep simple pledge levels, and a limited supply of these games, add ons will be handled through Dr. Finn's Games website (as will be described in updates).  Any funds raised through this will be applied toward the attainment of stretch goals. \n***   Information will be provided in the updates about adding on more games ***\nDr. Finn's Games does not use a pledge manager.  Pledge managers cost additional money, so I avoid them to keep prices low.  Thus, if you would like additional items not offered in the pledge levels, stay tuned for more details in the updates and look in the campaign's F.A.Q.s. \nThanks to all my previous backers for their support and for all you new backers willing to give my game a chance in this highly competitive market.  Thanks also to all the reviewers for taking the time to review my games and give their thoughts.  And a special thanks to Gameosity (and their cats) for helping me with the main campaign video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease read carefully before backing this project.\n\nNO PLEDGE MANAGER \nDr. Finn will not be using a pledge manager for this campaign. All information will be collected through the Kickstarter surveys after the campaign and a system for payment for add-ons will be created through Dr. Finn's Games' website.\n\nDELIVERY AND GAME CONVENTIONS \nThe game is likely to be manufactured by October 2019 and delivered in November. In previous campaigns, Dr Finn understands that backers are the first people who should receive the games. However, Dr Finn may wish to show and sell the game at any major game conventions. Ideally, the game could be manufactured, shipped and delivered to all backers before any particular convention. Yet, if the timing is off, please understand that game conventions are a big expense for my small company and I may need to sell new releases as a means for paying for the convention. Up to this point, this has never been an issue and backers have always received the games first. I just want to mention it as a possibility.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS \nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the packs will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threats in this regard concern quality control over the manufacturing and delivery delays. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced great results on projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nIf you receive any rewards that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the item arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS \nRefunds are not given, unless there is a failure to deliver the games you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nLOW QUANTITY ALERT \nSome Dr. Finn's games are getting low in stock and it is not feasible to track add-on items during the campaign. It is possible (but unlikely) that there is not enough of a particular game to fulfill all rewards. If this happens, you will be refunded all expenses related to adding that item on.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Of course, unexpected things happen and there is chance that the game will not be shipped on time. I will keep you updated if the unexpected happens.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a shipment is returned, it is your responsibility to pay for the re-shipment.\n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the shipping section above.\n\nUPDATES \nAfter this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects. However, such updates will be infrequent.\n\nBy backing this project, you acknowledge and accept the risks and challenges just stated.\n\nThanks!

Our thanks to everyone who backed the campaign!\nBackers will receive an emailed link to the Pledge Manager in approximately 10 days (April 26th) or whenever Kickstarter completes the process of initial charges to Backers and we are able to import the data into the Pledge Manager system.\nIf you missed the Kickstarter we will have Late Pledges open for a very limited time window. There will be a button on this page to the right of the main campaign image that will take you to the Late Pledge system when it is open (also in about 10 days).\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com\nAlderac Entertainment Group (AEG) is proud to bring you the Kickstarter for Valley of the Kings Premium Edition. This version of Valley of the Kings consolidates the three previously released games in the line, upgrades the components, and adds new content.\nValley of the Kings is designed by Tom Cleaver. The first game in the series was released in 2014, Afterlife was released in 2015 and Last Rites was released in 2016.\nThis product is in a fast turnaround with our production facilities in China, and we intend to deliver these Rewards four months from now in August 2019. The retail release of Valley of the Kings Premium will be in October, and the suggested retail price for the retail release will be $65.\nBenefits to this Campaign: \nYou will get the product at a discount to the suggested retail price\nYou'll get it two months before the normal retail release\nTo ensure that we can fulfill the Rewards on this accelerated timeline there will be a limited two-week window for the Pledge Manager following the end of the campaign which will open as soon as Kickstarter has finalized its collection of payments and transmitted the funds raised in the campaign to us. We expect that the Pledge Manager will open in the first week of May. If you back this campaign you will be notified via email direct from AEG when the Pledge Manager is open.\nYou will be able to arrange payment for your Reward via PayPal on the Pledge Manager. You will also be able to order multiple copies of the game, with a consolidated shipping & handling cost.\nKey Features of this Campaign:\nOver 300 playable cards upgraded to tarot-sized linen-finish cards\nSupports 1-6 players\n350 AEG Premium Sleeves\n NEW: Pharaoh Cards for new starting powers\n NEW: Unique Cards with exciting new abilities\nDeluxe Box\nQualified Brick & Mortar Retail Stores please see the Kick It Here section below for details on the Kick It Here Reward. \nClick the Rulebook to download the PDF Rulebook (12MB).\nClick the Player's Guide to download the PDF Player's Guide (17MB).\nWhat is a \"Premium Card\"? For AEG, that means a super-sized (Tarot) card that gives the art and game text room to breathe, a card that looks amazing on the table, a card made with a linen finish, and printed on the highest quality card stock.\nWe have a lot of experience with Premium cards - we featured them in Love Letter Premium, Lovecraft Letter, and the cards in both Mystic Vale and Edge of Darkness are built to Tarot-size. We love the way they feel when you shuffle them, and hold them, and how they look on the table when you play!\nThis Kickstarter does not feature any stretch goals. Instead, all components will be fully upgraded from the launch of the campaign! Linen finish on the game cards, using high-quality black-core playing card stock, randomizers and dividers included, a custom-designed insert that will hold the components and all the cards when sleeved, and 350 AEG Premium tarot-sized sleeves included!\nThe starting player takes the first turn of the game; then play continues clockwise around the table. Players continue taking turns until the end of the game.\nTaking a Turn\nDuring your turn you must follow these four steps in order:\nPlay Cards\nEach card in your hand can be played for only one of these purposes:\nBuy a card from the base of the pyramid.\nExecute the action listed on the card.\nEntomb the card (once per turn).\nYou may buy cards, execute actions, and entomb a card in any order you wish during your turn.\nIf you are playing with pharaoh cards, you may execute your pharaoh power once during your turn.\nDiscard\nWhen you have played all the cards you chose to play, discard all of your cards in play and all cards remaining in your hand. Cards may be discarded in any order you wish. All cards go to your personal discard pile \u2013 not the boneyard.\nRebuild Pyramid\nIf you have made no changes whatsoever to the pyramid during your turn, sacrifice any card in the pyramid by putting the selected card on top of the boneyard. The pyramid will then crumble as normal. Regardless of whether or not you changed the pyramid, replace cards removed from the pyramid with cards from the stock. Draw cards one at a time and fill the empty spaces in the pyramid, starting from the base up.\nDraw New Hand\nDraw a new hand of 5 cards. If at any time you are required to draw a card and your draw deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.\nAfter you have completed each step, the next player clockwise around the table takes their turn.\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nTHIS PRODUCT IS SLATED FOR A SHORT DELIVERY WINDOW!\nOur plan is to have these Rewards delivered in four months in August 2019 for backers of the Kickstarter. The product is ready to begin production at our facilities in China, and once we have closed the Kickstarter we'll be on a very fast timeline for delivery!\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in the UK, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Valley of the Kings Premium:\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Valley of the Kings Premium at 7lbs/3kg.\nUSA:$15\nCANADA: $22\nUK: $18\nEUROPE: $12 to Germany. $20 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein\nLATIN AMERICA: $49 to most countries. \nASIA: $13 to China and Hong Kong. $26 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $22 to Australia. $28 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $49\nKeep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise.\nAll cost estimates are in US Dollars.\nWe expect to use Aetherworks for fulfillment in Australia for this campaign.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nThe Kick It Here program is open to brick & mortar retail stores who generate a meaningful percentage of their sales from tabletop games. Kick It Here products may not be resold on the internet. AEG reserves the right to disqualify any backer from this promotion at its sole discretion.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to - stores will pay actual Shipping & Handling for delivery just like regular backers. We expect the cost to be around $30-$50 for Chinese, US and EU stores. We will have exact pricing in the Pledge Manager.\nFor this campaign because of the accelerated timeline we are not going to solicit stores to participate via our email system but will instead use Kickstarter directly - you have to back this project at the Kick It Here Reward level to get the Kick It Here pricing and delivery. \nIf you select the $51 Kick It Here Reward level you will be eligible to make the full $150 purchase for 6 units of Valley of the Kings Premium in the Pledge Manager. The $51 you pay on Kickstarter will automatically be credited to your account as a pre-payment.\nPlease Note: If you do not qualify as a brick & mortar retail store, or you fail to complete your order in the Pledge Manager, AEG can only refund you 92% of the amount you pledge. The other 8% is lost to unrecoverable Kickstarter fees.\nKick It Here orders will ship at the same time as the other Kickstarter Rewards and you will have this product approximately 2 months before the normal retail release date.\nAEG would like to thank the following professionals who helped assemble this Kickstarter:\nTom Cleaver, original designer of Valley of the Kings \nJohn Goodenough, development lead for Valley of the Kings Premium Edition \nMatt Paquette, graphic design for campaign elements\nErick Santz, producer for animated game segment in the campaign video\n Christian H.

To remain a Backer in good standing, please select a Reward of $50 or more.\n\nAll images used in this Kickstarter are subject to change and may represent unfinished or non-final art or design. All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is August 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your Reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

In Movie Empire you are a junior producer working for Mr. Grumpy while competing with other players to be the heir to his throne. You do this by producing movies (a few big blockbusters or several small trash movies) and releasing them at the right time in the right market to hit trends and get awards. Don't forget to keep an eye on pleasing your boss as this will have an influence on your assets. \nMovie Empire is a mix of worker placement and set collection for 1-4 players. And as Hollywood is a shark tank, you have 2 styles of play with the (completely optional!) black dossier variant, that adds a take that mechanic to the gameplay. Let the clubbing and stabbing commence!\n\n\n\nIt's as simple as that: a certain quantity of Movie Empire will be produced and when it's gone, we don't know if there ever will be a reprint. So, if you are interested in Movie Empire, now is the best time to pledge for it. Not convinced yet? Then read on, we have some surprises for you.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nThe shipping / fulfillment is most probably the hardest part of publishing a game. And a lot of people (including us) hate to pay for shipping later on. But by the time Movie Empire will ship, shipping fees could have changed. Several Kickstarter projects have blown up due to this circumstance. And the shipping fee is always dependent on the weight - and some of the stretch goals will raise it. So since we will still negotiating better prices and looking for alternatives for a longer time, we charge the shipping after the campaign with a pledge manager. Anything else puts a risk on this project. So these are current prices as a guideline.\nSo what about UK shipping? Well, Brexit. We don't know what will happen yet. We will know in the coming months, but you shouldn't have to pay for more shipping. The outcome is unclear at the moment, so we will reach out as soon as we know more.\nKarsten Schulmann is has been an avid gamer since childhood, playing everything from video to roleplaying and board games over the last three decades. He loves the immersion that games can achieve. For him, the perfect board game is a blend of easy to learn (but hard to master) mechanics and a captivating theme. Apart from that he is helping other designers with video, graphic design and translations from English to German (for example Arkham Horror LCG, Champions of Midgard or Human Punishment).\nKarsten's go-to illustrator on this journey is the equally talented and lovely Allan Ohr. He has a very distinct style and more importantly the gift of transforming chaotic ideas into feasible designs that work. A fruitful collaboration that shows in the final version of Movie Empire and hopefully many more after that.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYes, this is my first Kickstarter, but you have to begin somewhere. For the last 20 years I was working in the media business on all sorts of projects, so project management and design are key elements to my professional carreer. That's some solid foundation to work from. I analyzed the risks over the last months and took all steps necessary to prevent or at least minimize them.\n\nDesign & content \nEasy. All the work has already been done. Only a maximum of 5 cards for the higher stretch goals have to be illustrated in May. That's it. (Please note that pictures on this campaign do not come from a mass-manufactured product yet - all assets are constantly being optimized up until manufacturing for the best possible product and can therefore change.)\n\nManufacturing \nMovie Empire uses standard components, and will be printed by LongPack Games, a proven Chinese board and card game manufacturer. Nevertheless all components will be thoroughly checked in their final form before going to mass production.\n\nShipping \nDistribution of the game will be managed by two fulfillment companies. One for North America (probably Quartermaster Logistics) and one for the rest of the world (probably Happyshops). This way we can deliver US-, Canada-, EU-, Australia- and China-friendly. This means no taxes for you in these countries. For all other countries, customs fees and / or taxes may apply.\n\nStretch goals \nAll stretch goals have been carefully pre-planned and pre-budgeted. Those which have an impact on manufacturing costs have already been taken into account, and will unlock once the appropriate funding target has been reached.\n\nSchedule \nThe estimated delivery date will be February 2020. We don't have any special components to produce (all in all it's just paper, cardboard and standard components) and (excluding some stretch goals) all graphical assets are already done. Now, we all know that a lot of Kickstarter games arrive late. But this is only a target date. Things can happen. Such as the earth being hit by an asteroid (but, hey, then we all have some other problems to solve). Yes, there are a lot of factors affecting when you will receive your package and many of them are out of my control. But as project management is part of my day job, I also know, that there has always to be a backup plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "\ud83c\udfac \"Go ahead, make my day.\"", "descp": "You only want to feel like a producer?

Work together as conservationists trying to save just one species from extinction. It will take everything you've got to stay ahead of environmental collapse and a variety of other dangers, while also enacting plans to win your species a chance at long-term survival. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act that brings to life the complex challenges that conservationists face in trying to protect our vulnerable friends!\n Endangered is a cooperative game. This means that all of the players are working together to try and defeat the challenges the game throws at you. Though you all have different roles with unique advantages, you will all either win the game together, or lose the game together. The game is not easy to win, but losing is a lesson! Come back stronger the next time with a different plan, better communication, and tighter teamwork!\nEndangered is also a modular game system. The base game includes the Tiger and Sea Otter modules; you\u2019ll play with the environment, cards, hazards, and special rules that apply to your chosen species. We also have a number of other modules planned for a variety of threatened species. Each module tells a different story, offers unique challenges, and helps players understand the difficulties facing these animals and the conservationists determined to help them. With your help we will be able to make many modules a reality!\n\n\nThe Kickstarter edition comes with these extra-gorgeous custom-screened dice, featuring the role symbols in place of the 6! Three of each, so fifteen custom dice total! The Kickstarter edition will also be notable for the shiny Spot UV finish on selected areas of the box top which will make it POP off your game shelf!\n\n\n\n\n We\u2019ve teamed up with the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental group with an amazing staff of lawyers, scientists and organizers who fight every day for endangered wildlife and their homes. Through our alliance, every game played will advance the Center\u2019s mission and help increase awareness about the vital need for action now to save the wild. \nPost-Kickstarter, the Center will consult with us on the game's content to ensure that we are accurately reflecting the conservation community. They will also help us reach a population of enthusiastic animal lovers who might otherwise have never heard of Endangered.\nWe will be supporting them during the campaign with a special pledge level. If you choose that level, we will gift the Center one copy of Endangered as part of your pledge. They will distribute those copies through their educational initiatives!\nAs well, in the post-campaign pledge manager we will donate all of the funds from the \"Tip Jar\" to the Center, and we will support them with a portion of proceeds from non-Kickstarter sales. (Kickstarter's terms expressly forbid the direct donation of campaign funds.) \nEndangered is played in turns. On your turn, you go through 5 phases:\nRoll your dice and then place them onto the Action spots, triggering a number of useful abilities. Stuff like moving animals around, managing the destruction of the environment, trying to influence ambassadors, preparing for Impacts, and playing cards from your hand. As the game goes on, you will be adding Actions to the play area which will develop your team's capabilities. Work together to form the best skill set!\nHopefully your species will breed! Each species has different rules for generating offspring, but in general you will want to encourage the forming of mating pairs so that your chances of increasing the population go up!\nUnavoidably, the environment will degrade. For Tigers it is deforestation; for Sea Otters it is Oil Spills. Here you'll carry out the relentless spread of destruction, which eliminates any animals it comes into contact with. Keep them out of harm's way!\nThe Impact deck for each species comes with an unpredictable set of Impacts. Some are positive, but most are a real threat. Clearcutting, Poachers, Sharks, Fragmentation, and Government Upheaval are just a few of the potential disasters you might encounter. Reveal the next one from the deck and carry it out!\nDraw a new card into your hand and pass play to the next player. If everyone has acted, the Year is over and the next Year begins. If it was a voting year, check the ambassadors to see if you have earned 4 or more yes votes!\nYou all win the game together only if you can get 4 or more Yes votes from your ambassadors in one of your two voting years. If your team fails to do that, or if your animal population vanishes, or if the environment becomes too devastated, you all lose the game!\n  Check out the previews, reviews, and quotes below!\nWe\u2019re happy to support Tantrum House Season 6 with a set of promotional Ambassador cards you can find on their campaign. These cards will be available after our campaign, and you are getting a complete game even without them. Both the Guild and Tantrum House thank you for your support!

Players will assemble a garden of strategically placed seedling tiles to grow them into plant tiles which will yield an opportunity to play a flower tile to earn points called prestige. \nIn the center of the playing surface is a market of seedling tiles in the bottom row and a market of plant tiles in the top row - separated by plant color. Players will first draft a unique hand of four flower tiles each before beginning to build their own individual gardens. After receiving and playing a starting seedling tile in your garden, on your turn you may complete one of four actions:\nPlayers acquire seedlings from the market by spending any combination of resources (sunlight and water) according to the seedling tile\u2019s market location. Seedlings tiles include seedlings of 6 color types.\nWhen you have an appropriate seedling combination in your garden you may acquire a plant tile by paying its resource cost. The cost to acquire plant tiles escalates as the game progresses. There are six color types of plants, each having their own unique resource cost combination. Plant tiles are also worth prestige if they are visible in your garden at the end of the game.\nYou may take 3 resources from the supply, taking 1 of sunlight and 2 of water, or vice versa.  \nAfter playing two plant tiles in the right  combination, you may play a flower tile from your hand! Upgrading plants to flowers is the best way to score points, and it also provides you 3 free resources. \n Each player starts the game with 1 of each of the following:\nWhen a player has played their fourth flower tile or when the seedling market runs out of tiles, the end of the game is triggered and each player plays an equal number of turns before tallying their prestige score and determining the winner! \nFisher Heaton Games is committed to helping protect our planet.

After we fulfill backer rewards (around September 2019) you may be able to find Freshwater Fly at your friendly local game store or online. Be sure to ask your store of choice to order a copy for you from their distributor. We also hope to release Freshwater Fly at Essen Game Fair in October 2019. Look for it there!\nYou may also be able to find Freshwater Fly in the future at our website, and we will announce more Freshwater Fly news via public campaign updates and our monthly email newsletter. (Subscribing to our newsletter is also the best way to learn about new games we may launch on Kickstarter in the future.)\nOut of respect to our backers and everyone who supported us and sacrificed to help make this campaign a success, we are not planning to open a pre-order system for Freshwater Fly or accept any late pledges. In the meantime, please check out the excellent content made by Freshwater Fly reviewers in the Reviews section below and subscribe to Freshwater Fly at Board Game Geek.\nTo contact us directly, please email campaign creator Dennis Hoyle at info@bellwethergames.com. \nThank you again for supporting Freshwater Fly!\n=======================================================================\n\nContents shown on this page are for visual representation only. Objects may vary slightly in form and appearance from the final produced game.\n1-Player Adventure Mode is now unlocked! Every copy of the game will now include the alternate game board for solo players (on the back of the standard board), plus the Adventure Map and Adventure Mode pages in the rulebook (starting on page 18). For more details about this single-player adventure experience, read this update.  \nThere is an art to playing Freshwater Fly as there is to fly fishing. It may seem straightforward at first, but you will find nuance (and victory) in the details.\nEvery round of Freshwater Fly consists of seven or nine turns, depending on player count. Your turn includes at least one Dice Action and a number of Bonus Actions,  which skilled players will maximize for the most efficient maneuvers. Can you find a way to use the right flies to catch the most lucrative fish combos, while keeping pace in total fish count? The game ends when a single player catches a seventh fish and achievement points are awarded. \nHere are some Freshwater Fly fishing basics:\nDice Action: Cast - It's all about hooking the right fish with the right fly at the right time. Select a die to cast to the best landing spot in the river, usually upstream from your target fish. Earn one Strike card immediately when your fly matches one Hatch token in the same column as your cast, but earn two Strike cards per match when you drift downstream. When the jumping fish is revealed from the Strike card deck, you hook a fish, but will it be the one you aimed for?  \nThe Casting token is placed and drifts downstream. One Strike card is gained in the first column for the matching yellow Hatch token. Two more are gained in the third column, but only one is needed because the jumping fish is revealed.\nDice Action: Reel - Reel swiftly, but also reel carefully. Select a die to advance your reel to powerful actions spaces. Every circuit of the reel will bring your fish one step closer, but the technique you use is equally important to the speed you spin. Applying drag, for instance, will tame the strongest beasts, while gaining the right Momentum tile can set-you-up perfectly for your next turn. Will you be able to strike the right balance between progress and purpose? \nThe reel is moved two spaces to the Momentum action. A Momentum tile is gained and immediately activated to apply drag and increase finesse.\nDice Action: Finesse +2 - Sometimes you need to re-adjust to gain a better casting angle, or calibrate to the behavior of your fish. Boost your Finesse to experience better results from your other actions.\nBonus Actions: Don't underestimate the following bonus actions, which can maximize your performance and give you the lead:\n1. Finesse Actions: Used freely on your turn to gain extra Strike cards, modify dice values, move Hatch tokens, change your Fly or apply Drag. Keep your Finesse charged for best results!\n2. Momentum Actions: Gained when your reel lands on the Momentum tile space. Take a tile and use it right away or wait until the opportune moment. These are among the most powerful actions in the game and should not be ignored!\n3. Skill Actions: Gain special abilities when you catch fish near Rocks in the river. These personal abilities stay with you throughout the game and can help you out of a tight spot.\nRound End: When all the dice are gone, the player with the lowest pip-count is the new first-player and gains a bonus turn next round! Roll all the dice, move the current and get back to fishing!\nThe Hatch tiles move downstream between each round.\nThese were just the basics. For a more complete look at the rules, download a draft of the rulebook below or watch the instructional video at the top of this section.\nUpdated rule book includes 1-Player Adventure Mode rules.\n\n\nHear the full review of Freshwater Fly at the Brawling Brothers Podcast (~1:41:43)\n\n Hear the full review of Freshwater Fly on the Draft Mechanic podcast episode 98!\n For One Board Family's full written review go here!\nBrian Suhre Interview with BJ Rozas on Board Game Gumbo Live:\n\nCheck out a LIVE playthrough of a 1-Player Adventure Mode \"Day\" from reviewer Jeremy Howard here.\n\n\nContents shown on this page are for visual representation only.

We have applied a $9 discount to the actual shipping costs for all pledges to help reduce your total shipping amount. \nShipping is added when you pledge. We will NOT charge extra for shipping after the campaign. Your shipping costs shown above apply the same to all pledge levels.\nFriendly Shipping:\nRewards shipping to the US, EU, Australia and Canada will either be shipped from within those regions or with duty and taxes paid in advance.  \nNote for backers outside of the US, EU, Canada and Australia: \nThe chart in the graphic above is only an estimate of the final cost for us to ship to you. If you live outside the US, EU, Canada or Australia, you may be liable for duty and taxes based on the actual declared shipping cost. For example, if you live in Brazil, you will pay $39 in shipping when you pledge, but the actual shipping cost (to us) will be closer to $48 and your country may assess duty and taxes according to the higher declared value. We will not reimburse duty and taxes you may have to pay to receive your reward.\n1. Money-Back Guarantee: If after receiving your reward you feel it doesn't live up to your expectations you can return it within one month for a refund of your pledge level.\n2. We will not be using a third-party pledge manager to to collect late pledges or upgrades after the campaign, so pledge the whole amount you wish to pledge before the end of the campaign to ensure you get the reward you want. \n3. The Freshwater Fly Deluxe Upgrade Pack will not be packaged for retail and may not be readily available to purchase outside of this Kickstarter campaign. \n4. This first Kickstarter Edition printing of Freshwater Fly will include the Alternate Strike Card Pack, which we do not plan to include in future printings.\n5. Stretch goals we unlock during the campaign will add bonus components and upgrades to Freshwater Fly that we would not otherwise be able to produce.

Tunnel through the land as The Great Underground Duchy. Infiltrate the hands of your opponents with the Corvid Conspiracy. And, with two additional maps, new and experienced players have never had so many ways to explore Root!   \nIn the fall of 2017, we brought Root to Kickstarter. With your support, we expanded the scope of the game, offering new factions and improvements to the game\u2019s components. It has been an immense privilege and a pleasure to bring Root to market, and we couldn\u2019t have done it without you all. \nShortly after the game\u2019s release, we began to see eager players and designers produce new content for the game. We understood the impulse\u2014even as we had moved to other projects, everyone in the office continued thinking about Root and working on new content for the game on their own.  \nIn the winter, Patrick pitched his concept for a new expansion: two new factions and two new maps, built to expand the possible faction configurations and offer totally new styles of play. Patrick handed the design to Nick Brachmann and Cole Wehrle for final development and, after months of work, the game is ready to share.\nWith this Kickstarter, we want to raise funds to print the new expansion and another large run of existing Root products. In the past, we\u2019ve always done our best to take care of our Kickstarter backers. Root: The Underworld Expansion will be no different. Backers who pledge at a level that includes the new expansion will also get a set of custom Vagabond meeples, a set of resin clearing markers, and an alternative deck (The Exiles and Partisans) for free!  \nIn addition, we\u2019ve got a new set of automated factions built in collaboration with Benjamin Schmauss and his Better Bot Project. And, for our returning backers, we have a full set of new faction boards with the rules updates from the third printing. If you'd like to play with these alterations without buying the replacement boards, you can find the update kit on our website. \nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. First released in the summer of 2018, Root was the next chapter in our exploration of truly asymmetric game design. Like our previous title, Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different way to win. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. With creatures and cunning, you'll rule a fantastic forest kingdom in the ultimate asymmetric game of adventure and war. \nIn Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability. \nOver the past year, Root has inspired players around the world. Just check out this amazing video tribute from Boris Ignjatovic and Sanja Ignjatovic. \nThe Corvid Conspiracy ransoms the hands of their opponents by filling them with their agents. Using these agents, the Corvids can trigger insidious plots and advance their own agenda. But as each plot comes to fruition, their hideout must move to a different forest in the Woodland before their great conspiracy is unmasked!   \nFor generations the Duchy extended its reach through the caverns below the great woods. Now, newly elected lords in the Duchy's Parliament have raised a call to explore the lands above. Armies have been mustered and new tunnels prepared for the coming struggle. The creatures of the woods will soon learn to fear the great power beneath their feet.\nThe struggle for dominance continues in the great mountains to the northeast of the Woodland. Fight for control of the narrow mountain pass or dig new tunnels to the great mountain caverns.   \nThe conflict moves west to the homeland of the Riverfolk! Battle for control over the great lake by skillfully managing the ancient riverboat. Shore up your coastal clearings or explore the hinterland in the hills beyond.  \nSwap out the game's original deck with this new set of cards, free to backers of Root: The Underworld Expansion. While the items to craft remain unchanged, players can develop over 20 new special powers. Recruit ex-Eyrie officers to help run your military operation, or dig your own tunnels through the Woodland!  \nSince Root was released, we have been amazed by the ingenuity of our players in crafting their own print-and-play copies of the game. As a tribute to those fans, we will be releasing new print-and-play kits for each part of the expansion over the course of this campaign. These kits don't represent the final product you'll receive, but they'll give you a good taste of what's to come. You can find all of our released kits for Root: The Underworld Expansion by clicking on the images below:  \nThroughout the campaign, we will stream games featuring some of the new content. Our first stream will be Saturday, March 16, at 2pm CST. You can find the stream here.

This represents the surface of the asteroid and its shadow area.\nA four player setup.\nEach player is dealt 5 cards. \nAfter determining the starting player, players take turns placing their two playing pieces on the first ore deposit of each location card, starting with the card immediately next to the first (left-most) shadow card.\nPlayer's two bots are added to the asteroid in reverse player order.\nAt the beginning of each player's turn, the active player turns over the left-most face down card to reveal the location. The active player then plays two cards from his hand, representing an action for each active mining bot they control. When the player plays a card, he will do the following:\nMOVE one of his mining bots clockwise to the first open instance of the ore printed at the top of the card. \nIf the card being played has the 'Prospect' action written on it, the player may use its special ability written beneath it. If the card has any other action on it, that action is ignored. \nIf the played card has the 'Upgrade' action on it, the player can ignore the ore and not move his bot; instead, the card may be played in front of the player, giving him a permanent upgrade to his bots on future turns. (Note: A player may only have one instance of any given upgrade in their tableau.)\nWhen moving the bot, if it lands on a card that has the 'When Mined' action on it, the player also takes that action. This only occurs when a location is landed on (the piece is moved onto the card). All other stated actions are ignored.\nAfter two actions (one for each of the player's mining bots), the player draws a card from the asteroid deck, chooses one card from his hand, then places it face-down on top of the card immediately to the right of the right-most shadow card.\nIt is now the next player's turn.\nOTHER ACTIONS PLAYERS MAY TAKE ON THEIR TURN:\n Instead of playing a card, a player may take a 'Communicate' action. He moves his bot counterclockwise to the first open location that contains a bot (his or another player's). He may then draw a card into his hand (there is no hand limit). Any other players on that particular spot may then draw a card into their hand.\n'Recharge' - Instead of playing a card or taking the Communicate action, the player may simply draw a card from the asteroid deck and place it in their hand. \nHere is the full set of rules for Dark Side of the Mine, as well as the print and play so you can take on your friends during your next game night.\nTake a look at the SOLO RULES.\nAnd here's where you can give the game an online try-out\nWant to challenge others online instead?

You'll smoothly & easily push through a series of 'conveyor belt tiles' thanks to your double-thickness player board. Each tile will start off with a cacao bean which will be upgraded by activating your factory parts to create better and tastier chocolates.\nA Medium-Weight (3/5 complexity) Euro featuring literal \"engine building\" with a twist.\nYou will upgrade your factory each turn. The deliciously crunchy decisions come from choosing which factory parts to draft and where to build them.  Every factory part is unique, so there are a ridiculous number of possibilities!

Each turn, you get more coal to run your machine but use it wisely to gain the most benefit.\n\nEach factory part can only interact with the adjacent tile. You really need to think about where you place each factory part to create an efficient engine\nOne by one, use each factory part to convert, multiply or upgrade the chocolate in front of itself. Spend the coal depicted and then carry out the operation.\n\nEach round, you will 'Load, push, then operate' at least 3 times. This lets you get a good amount of new chocolate, as long as you use your coal wisely!\nNow you can use all the chocolate that you have generated to fulfil your personal corner shop contracts. \n\nBut don't forget about those lucrative department stores! The employee you picked will have a connection to one of the department stores which lets you sell there for the current turn. You may fulfil the contract with a department store as many times as you wish. At the end of the game, there are bonuses for the main suppliers of each department store.\nDesigned by Matt Dunstan and David Digby.\nThe solo variant is a clear win or lose game.

This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we aim for an update once a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we in turn delayed the retail launch to put our backers first. Coral Island's deluxe version will not be in general retail until backers have had it for many months. Backers are always our priority.\nWorld class manufacturing\nThis is a game of premium wooden components. For this project, we are using Longpack, who manufactured Dice Hospital for us and gave us some fantastic wooden doctor meeples. \nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via our business Royal Mail account. Unlike Dice Hospital, we will NOT be using GamesQuest for fulfilment. If Brexit happens and free trade is no longer possible between UK and EU, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers. It is likely US shipping will be done from within the USA using QML - this ultimately depends on a number of factors, but we will keep everyone informed of course.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n March: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development. \n April: Submit Files to manufacturer \n May: Manufacturing\n June: Shipping from China to the UK begins \n Late July: Arrives in ports \n Early August: Fulfilment commences \n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in October - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nESSEN SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at Essen Spiel 2019. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before Essen, but you or a friend are attending Essen, you/they can pick it up from Essen itself.\nOur last medium weight euro - Dice Hospital - was in high demand and hard to find for several months after release.

Justin explains that he likes to lure viewers in with \"superficially charming images,\" but then reveal something more \"heartbreaking\" or \"daunting\" upon closer inspection.  In 2010, Justin started his independent studio, The Flying Chair.\nMark Swanson, Game Designer\nProfessor by day and game designer by night, Mark Swanson lives in Columbia, Missouri with his three splendid daughters. Mark was was Inspired by Eurostyle games in the late 90s and became a fan of legends like Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Martin Wallace and Andreas Seyfarth. He unveiled his prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. Mark is grateful for Feudum's wonderful reception back in November of 2016 and thrilled by its ever growing community.

In Movie Empire you are a junior producer working for Mr. Grumpy while competing with other players to be the heir to his throne. You do this by producing movies (a few big blockbusters or several small trash movies) and publishing them at the right time in the right market to hit trends and get awards. Don't forget to keep an eye on pleasing your boss as this will have an influence on your assets.\nMovie Empire is a mix of worker placement and set collection for 2-4 players. And as Hollywood is a shark tank, you have 2 styles of play with the (completely optional!) black dossier variant, that adds a take that mechanic to the gameplay. Let the clubbing and stabbing commence!\n   It's as simple as that: a certain quantity of Movie Empire will be produced and when it's gone, we don't know if there ever will be a reprint. So, if you are interested in Movie Empire, now is the best time to pledge for it. Not convinced yet? Then read on, we have some surprises for you.\n\n We have some tremendous (p)reviews for you and others will follow during the campaign. Please note: The pictured version of Movie Empire in these videos is not production quality, just a prototype version. All graphical assets are still being polished for the final production run.\nThe shipping / fulfillment is most probably the hardest part of publishing a game. And a lot of people (including us) hate to pay for shipping later on. But by the time Movie Empire will ship, shipping fees could have changed. Several Kickstarter projects have blown up due to this circumstance. And the shipping fee is always dependent on the weight - and some of the stretch goals will raise it. So since we will still negotiating better prices and looking for alternatives for a longer time, we charge the shipping after the campaign with a pledge manager. Anything else puts a risk on this project. So these are current prices as a guideline.\nSo what about UK shipping?Well, Brexit. We don't know what will happen yet. We will know in the coming months, but you shouldn't have to pay for more shipping. The outcome is unclear at the moment, so we will reach out as soon as we know more.\nKarsten Schulmann is has been an avid gamer since childhood, playing everything from video to roleplaying and board games over the last three decades. He loves the immersion that games can achieve. For him, the perfect board game is a blend of easy to learn (but hard to master) mechanics and a captivating theme. Apart from that he is helping other designers with video, graphic design and translations from English to German (for example Arkham Horror LCG, Champions of Midgard or Human Punishment).\nKarsten's go-to illustrator on this journey is the equally talented and lovely Allan Ohr. He has a very distinct style and more importantly the gift of transforming chaotic ideas into feasible designs that work. A fruitful collaboration that shows in the final version of Movie Empire and hopefully many more after that.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYes, this is my first Kickstarter, but you have to begin somewhere. For the last 20 years I was working in the media business on all sorts of projects, so project management and design are key elements to my professional carreer. That's some solid foundation to work from. I analyzed the risks over the last months and took all steps necessary to prevent or at least minimize them.\n\n\nDesign & Content \nEasy. All the work has already been done. Only a maximum of 5 cards for the higher stretch goals have to be illustrated in March. That's it.\n\nManufacturing \nMovie Empire uses standard components, and will be printed by LongPack Games, a proven Chinese board and card game manufacturer. Nevertheless all components will be thoroughly checked in their final form before going to mass production.\n\nShipping \nDistribution of the game will be managed by two fulfillment companies. One for North America (probably Quartermaster Logistics) and one for the rest of the world (probably Happyshops). This way we can deliver US-, Canada-, EU-, Australia- and China-friendly. This means no taxes for you in these countries. For all other countries, customs fees and / or taxes may apply.\n\nStretch Goals \nAll stretch goals have been carefully pre-planned and pre-budgeted. Those which have an impact on manufacturing costs have already been taken into account, and will unlock once the appropriate funding target has been reached.\n\nSchedule\nThe estimated delivery date will be December 2019. We don't have any special components to produce (all in all it's just paper, cardboard and standard components) and (excluding some stretch goals) all graphical assets are already done. Now, we all know that a lot of Kickstarter games arrive late. But this is only a target date. Things can happen. Such as the earth being hit by an asteroid (but, hey, then we all have some other problems to solve). Yes, there are a lot of factors affecting when you will receive your package and many of them are out of my control. But as project management is part of my day job, I also know, that there has always to be a backup plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Karsten Schulmann\n2 created \u00b7 227 backed\nMedia designer by day and avid gamer by night.

Driven from our ancestral home beneath the mountain, we have been wandering the wilderness, scratching out survival in the cold and the dirt. But now something has happened. We feel it in our bones. Without the soul of our people to sustain it, the mountain has collapsed, taking our revenge for us. Our enemies have fled, and the rubble of our ancient halls calls out for we trolls to come home. So we shall go. By claw and by hammer and by sweat and by song we will return to our home and our home will return to us.\nAs a respected leader, gather a following of trolls from the Mud, Fire, Ice, and Moon clans. Dig tunnels clad in stone, iron and heartstone. Carve out spacious galleries as great halls. Unearth the statues of the ancients, and with the help of the clans return them to places of glory near the mountain\u2019s heart. The surging cascade of trolls returning home will grow ever mightier as our kingdom is rebuilt, rising and crashing forward until one leader rises above the rest to be crowned the Mountain King!\n We are trolls, returning to our ruined ancient mountain home. We compete to excavate out the mountain, earn honour, and become the Mountain King! Honour is earned for digging tunnels and great halls, for building pedestals for statues, and for raising the lost statues of our ancestors back to places of glory close to the mountain's heart. \nRules are simple. Turns are:\n1. (optional) Cast 1 spell and/or activate 1 Workshop\nPlace a rune crystal onto a spell to unleash an awesome magical power! After three castings, the spell disintegrates and a new one comes into play. Use workshops to transform the things you have into the things you need... but only the quickest miners will get access to the best shops!\n2. Recruit 1 Troll or Dig 1 Tunnel.\nRecruit 1 Troll:\nPick any troll from the horde... but you'll have to bribe EVERY troll beneath it for it to join you! When you add your new recruit to your own trollsmoot, it will generate its own resources AND the effect CASCADES downward, so every troll beneath it ALSO gains the resources it isn't already holding. Time your recruitments wisely!\nDig 1 Tunnel:\nSpend minerals to dig tunnels on the map... the tunnels help you reach buried resources and statues, connect to workshops, and forge into the heart of the mountain!\n3. (optional) Dedicate a great hall.\nIf you've assembled a region of tunnels big enough to hold a great hall, you can lay it over top to open up big scoring opportunities.\n4. (optional) Move statues.\nSpend carts of the correct clan to move those statues from tunnel to tunnel. The closer to the heart, the better... especially if you get them onto pedestals!\nHow to Win\nAt the end of the game, you'll score honour points for your tunnels, for your great halls, for the pedestals and statues you've placed, and for leftover resources. Highest score wins!\nGameplay Explained in Detail\nMan vs Meeple give us a detailed look at how the game works!\nWant to watch a playthrough?\nRahdo takes us through a 2-player session, below!\nFull play through recorded live!\nDerek & Lizzy Funkhouser of Board Game Spotlight deliver a full fun play through with their usual enthusiasm and inevitable destruction of Derek.\nWant to take an even deeper look?\nCheck out the draft rulebook below, to learn the game in detail!

Shipping games is expensive, so it is an expense that we are going to share with you. For the In the Hall of the Mountain King campaign, we will be subsidizing the shipping costs so that it is more affordable for everyone.

In the Hall of the Mountain King is a big game with many components that must be manufactured just right.

Although we have budgeted 10 months (more than enough time) to bring this game to your doorstep, we also know that these delays can change our timeline at various stages. We are working to do everything we can to meet our goal of getting In the Hall of the Mountain King to you by December 2019.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation.

After its action resolves, a new card is revealed\nRangers skip over tiles with Hikers as they don't want to impose on the Hikers' experience of the Trail, but they don\u2019t mind sharing a space with each other\nThe first Ranger to reach trail end will close down a Park and select an additional effect\nHikers caught on the trail when season ends cannot take any further actions until the next season\nOfficial Solo Rules available in the rules folder above\nOur love of board games all started with a standard deck of cards\u2014so when Fifty-Nine Parks brought up the prospect of doing playing cards as well, we jumped at the opportunity! Each face-card will house a park for a total of 12 Parks in the deck. In this set you\u2019ll find: Acadia, Arches, Everglades, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Joshua Tree, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. The deck will be made with the United States Playing Card Company on premium card stock featuring sustainable forest paper and vegetable-based and metallic inks. \nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want. This extra money will appear as a credit in Backerkit. You do NOT have to do this! Once the campaign is over, you will be sent a link to finalize your order. All the things will be there.\nThe Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series is a celebration of our National Parks. The strength of the series comes from an eclectic mix of artists and the unique beauty of each park. Every screen printed poster is printed here in the USA. Fifty-Nine Parks' goal is to get poster fans into the parks and parks fans into posters. The full series is currently being archived by The Library of Congress.\nVisit their website for more details and to view their collection of wonderful prints, many of which are available for purchase. Remember they donate 5% of their sales to the National Park Service too! \nKeymaster Games publishes board games with captivating experiences and elegant designs. Our games can be played with the friends and family around you in the hopes of creating deeper connections and fun memories. \nKeymaster is happy to offer retailers an opportunity to back PARKS. Any pledges made in this way will be fulfilled at the same time as backer fulfillment. Here are some things you should know before you pledge:\n1) You must be an authorized BRICK & MORTAR reseller (you will be asked to provide your reseller's certificate) in the US, Canada, EU/UK, or Australia. If your store is located elsewhere, you must arrange your own US/CA/EU/UK/AUS based freight forwarder.\n2) By pledging, you are agreeing to purchase a minimum of 1 half case of PARKS. In the pledge manager, you will be able to increase your order by half and full case increments. Regardless of your order quantity, you will be receiving 1 free copy to be used for demos in your store. All copies you receive will include all unlocked stretch goals and any Kickstarter Exclusive materials unlocked by the campaign. Distribution copies of the game will NOT include Kickstarter Exclusive materials.\n3) Additionally, you will be able to order playing cards by the \"brick\" (increments of 12 decks). Shipping will be charged separately for playing cards. \n4) The pledge amount you are making is a deposit and does not reflect the full charge of the minimum order. After the campaign has ended, we will contact you for your resellers certificate and you will be able to select your quantity in BackerKit. Your payment will be due in BackerKit once the game has arrived at Port in the US/EU/AUS. In addition to your BackerKit receipt, we will provide separate invoices upon request.\n5) We will cover the shipping cost for your order. If you have any additional questions (e.g. the price breakdown per unit), please reach out to Keymaster games by email or through the KS messaging system.\n6) Fulfillment on these orders will be congruent with the fulfillment of individual backers. We will plan to send out updates to retailers specifically, as the need arises, through Kickstarter Updates.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your product to you in a timely manner. If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nAfter two shipping attempts to your provided address have failed, you will be responsible for any additional postage/shipping costs to ship out your rewards again.\nWe plan to promote and sell retail copies of PARKS at Gen Con. Our goal is for fulfillment to be well underway prior to August, but it is likely that games will be sold at Gen Con before we finish fulfillment. Gen Con pickup will be available. Retail launch is targeted for October, but we reserve the right to change this based on fulfillment status.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you are reading this, then you are seriously considering our project. Thank you! We are very confident that we will deliver you an incredible experience. We have successfully completed four campaigns and are currently in the process of delivering a fifth.

More information on Panda can be found at pandagm.com\n\nRegarding fulfillment, shipping happens. We have not finalized a partnership with a fulfillment company, but we will prioritize the following in our selection process:\n1. High level of customer service regarding communication and issue resolution \n2. Accountability for timelines \n3. Quality of shipment (picking accuracy and package safety) \n4.

We will also provide you with news, variety shows (such as Board Game Breakfast), a series of popular \"Top Ten\" videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\nOur show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year.

This year, our goals are:\nProduce regular live content on a set schedule\nIncrease interaction with our listeners\nContinue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows\nWe're asking for your help as we pursue our goal of covering the entire world of board games.

Each player takes on the role of a classic monster at a masquerade party - Identify and expose everyone else... and keep all those juicy villagers for yourself.\nDracula\u2019s Feast is a hidden roles game with no narrator, no \u2018eyes closed\u2019 phase, no player elimination, and no generic \u2018villager\u2019 role. Each character in the game has a unique ability - Doctor Jekyll can transform into a monster at the end of any of her turns, Van Helsing is here to hunt down Dracula, and the Witch is hiding from her neighbors.\nTurns are simple - choose another player, and either:\n Inquire their identity, asking if they're a specific character (they'll answer secretly with a Yes or No card)\nAsk them to dance; if they accept, you'll look at each other's cards. If they refuse, you may inquire a different player.\nOnce you think you know who everyone is, you may accuse the party. If you've correctly guessed everyone's identities, you win! But if you get even a single guest wrong, you're exposed...and have likely given one of your opponents the information they need to win.\nIt's simple, fast, fun, and with 10 different characters who can be played in any combination, each game is totally different.\nFor more information on how to play, view the rules online.\nDracula\u2019s Feast: New Blood improves everything you loved about the original. The second edition includes:\n New roles! The game now comes with 10 unique roles (plus any promo roles unlocked through stretch goals), including a brand-new guest for advanced players - The Witch! \n Extensive rebalancing! Since the first edition was released, we\u2019ve playtested the roles hundreds of times to ensure that all the characters are finely-tuned and ready to scare.\n Updated art! Character artist Michael Dashow has done an amazing job of bringing the guests to life, giving each of them their own thematic movie poster.\n Streamlined rules! Years of development have resulted in simplified, more accessible rules - while still containing all the strategy of the original. Changes include players keeping their powers after they\u2019re revealed, fewer rules exceptions, and simpler (but equally strong) guest powers.\n More powerful actions! The tweaks to the three basic actions mean that every turn you take matters!\n Advanced guests! The characters have been split into \u2018basic\u2019 and \u2018advanced\u2019, to make the game easier to teach to new players, and to provide a meatier game experience for experts.\nYou do not need a copy of the first edition to play! Dracula\u2019s Feast: New Blood contains everything you need!\nWhat's Eric Playing:\n\"If you\u2019re looking for a fun, spooky deduction game for your game group, Dracula\u2019s Feast: New Blood might be right up your alley!\"\nBrian's Got Game:\n\"Dracula's Feast: New Blood was a wonderful little surprise. I'm not usually looking for social deduction games, but this one won me over with its potential for creative misdirection. This isn't simply a matter of figuring out which player is the baddie\u2014instead, you get to juggle dozens of little hints and must pay attention to every player at the table. The resulting challenge is as hilarious as it is interesting.\" - Cole Wehrle, designer of Root.\nDracula's Feast is easy to learn and quick to play. It\u2019s been played thousands of times over the last half-decade, and players are consistently impressed by the depth of play, constantly finding new interactions and tricks to stay one step ahead and avoid giving themselves away.\nThis is a logical deduction game with: \n10 unique roles (and no generic \u201cvillager\u201d role)\nBluffing without ever having to lie\nEngagement during all players\u2019 turns\nFlexible player count\nNo \u201cnight\u201d phase\nNo narrator\nNo player elimination\nNo yelling! \nApplies to all pledge levels!\nTo add $23 to your pledge, select \u201cedit pledge\u201d. After the campaign, using the pledge manager, you\u2019ll be able to add a copy of Dracula\u2019s Feast: New Blood, The Lady and the Tiger, Scuttle!, Village Pillage, or Hidden Panda for each $23 added this way.

Many of these promos you can't get anywhere else! \nPromo Paradise is a community driven project brought to you by The Board Game Spotlight and Board Game Exposure. That means we've built this campaign with one thing in mind; you, the backer! Your pledge will help us run those huge communities and bring you more awesome opportunities like this one!\nWe're offering what we believe is a great package of promos for some of your favorite games and at great prices too! Throughout the campaign, we will hold community polls, livestreams, and various updates to keep everyone involved and informed.\nCreating content for these groups has become a full-time job (which we love!), and we feel lucky to be in a position where we can offer promo cards from various publishers that support us in part due to the relationships and business partnerships we have built over the course of a few years. We'd like to thank all the amazing publishers who have come alongside us to support Promo Paradise!\nWe spend a lot of time cultivating our groups. This helps us provide fun, engaging content such as livestream playthroughs and interviews with designers, publishers, and content creators. We often travel to various conventions in order to foster new networks in the industry to bring you even more content to The Spotlight and Board Game Exposure.\nWith the money raised through Kickstarter, we hope to accomplish the following goals:\nBy pledging for this campaign, you're not only investing in upgrading the games you own but you're also investing in the lives of Martyn, Derek and Lizzy. Your support will allow them to achieve bigger dreams in the industry! If you're asking yourself, \"Why should I pledge?\" don't think about this campaign only in terms of promo cards, but rather, think about the communities the groups have formed and how much support they are to our ever growing hobby and industry. Both of these groups combine for nearly 20,000 board gamers around the world and they're still growing!\nIf you're not a member, why not join today and see what the fuss is about?

In the summer of 2017, they felt called to share their passion and love for the board game community. 2 years later, here they are, making this their full-time careers.\nLizzy and Derek wish to take The Board Game Spotlight to greater heights. They want to show the world the love they've developed and nurtured in their Facebook Group and to do that, they need your help!\nIn order to continue to share new, engaging, and fun content with the community, they're asking for you to join them in bringing positive, respectful, fun, and loving attitudes to tabletops worldwide.  #youarewelcomeatmytable\nMartyn started Board Game Exposure roughly 2 years ago - it's a group unlike any other where there is a solid mix of gaming industry professionals and board gamers. This gives people the chance to interact with the designers, publishers, and artists they know and love. With twice-weekly live interviews, competitions and news, this group is a great place to keep up to date on what's new and current in the board game world. \nMartyn wouldn't be where he is today without the help of the team of admins that assist him, as well as, reviewing the latest games and sharing their thoughts in the Board Game Exposure group. They do this for free and they have helped many first time publishers get noticed in the busy world of Kickstarter.\nMartyn is also co-designer of Robin Hood and the Merry Men which was a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2018. He learned a lot about game design during the development and hopes to bring more ideas to life in the near future. \nWe understand as backers of campaigns that getting shipping right is important for a campaign.

Continue below to learn about player powers, libraries, powerful component powers, and game-changing artifacts! \nAfter a limited print run in 2012, Atlantis Rising, like its namesake, virtually disappeared into legend.  We (Elf Creek) managed to get our hands on a copy and immediately understood what Zee and Sam at the Dice Tower loved about this game.  Gripping, tense, thrilling, truly cooperative.  We fell in love.  It's been a joy to work alongside designer Galen Ciscell to bring this game back, with the same core gameplay and new revised features that make it better than ever.  And with the gorgeous artistic work of Vincent Dutrait, it's been a dream come true.  But you don't have to take our word for it. \nAtlantis Rising: Second Edition preserves everything that was cherished and loved from the original edition. The feeling of dread and tension, that rises like the tides along the island shores, the mix of calculation and risk needed to succeed, the stories that the game creates with each play\u2014it's all still here. And it's been improved upon:\nMore strategic choices created by redesigning additional worker recruitment in the Cities and the Wrath of the Gods round tracker (replacing the original's Atlantean Navy)\nNew asymmetric variable player powers that have quickly become a favorite of the new edition's playtesters, that help you feel like your character is in the world helping to save Atlantis!\nAs the floodwaters rise, the tension builds, and hope begins to falter, players now also feel a sense of progression, at their own increasing capacity to stem the tide. New library artifact cards grant players ongoing abilities and the cosmic gate components feature powers that are now reusable.\nFor the first time, a dedicated solo mode and simple ruleset variants to help the two and three player games play with the same excitement and tension as larger player counts.\n But, as with the original edition, you don't have to take our word for it. \nGames will ship in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to keep customs fees & VAT as low as we feasibly can. Rewards shipped to backers in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China will be shipped to backers from within those regions. The amount under \"You Pay\" is what will be added to your pledge when you select your reward (we have already included a base amount for shipping to our pledge levels). Backers from Thailand and Indonesia: Your shipping costs should be $16. We made a mistake when creating the rewards and Kickstarter is adding $26 to your pledge. We sincerely apologize for this. Please check the FAQ for instructions on how to proceed with your pledge.\n  Any questions?  Just ask us, either in the comments or by message. \nThe Champaign-Urbana Community: Our local board gaming community is an amazing source of support, advice, and encouragement.  Whether it\u2019s a casual board game night or an intense playtesting session, we love playing games with y\u2019all.  We cannot thank you all enough for your playtesting, feedback, advise, and friendship.  Curious parties can learn more about our community at www.cudoplays.com and facebook.com/cuboardgames \nWe Make Games: We loved working with Bryce Walter of We Make Games on the End of the Trail project video and were excited to work with him again on Atlantis Rising.  He\u2019s a wonderful person and talented creator and we cannot wait to see what\u2019s next for him in the greater board game community.\nCoalition Game Studios: We want our games to be the very best that they can be.  As with End of the Trail, we partnered with Coalition Game Studios for blind playtesting and we cannot recommend Mike and his team enough for their feedback and hard work with Atlantis Rising. \nMatt Paquette: We first met Matt at Gen Con 2018 and we are blessed to have him working on the Kickstarter page as a creative director.  Matt has worked with AEG, Floodgate Games, Brotherwise Games and others in the board game community and we greatly appreciate his insights and guidance with our campaign.\nPhilip Glofcheskie: Philip has spent over 20 years in the art and game community and recently ran a successful Kickstarter for Wunderkammer. We are thrilled with the work that Philip has done on our Kickstarter page and can\u2019t wait to see the work he will be doing in the future.\nJoseph McDaid: We want to thank Joseph for all the hard work during the past week in assisting with our Kickstarter. Joe has been working alongside Matt with creating the animated gifs for the page. He has also worked with Roxley Games on their Kickstarter projects. \nProtospiel: We are blessed to have been able to playtest with the designers and playtesters that are part of the Protospiel community this year and the game improved due to their valuable early feedback at Protospiel Minnesota and Protospiel Milwaukee. We wish all the designers and publishers that are part of that community well. \nStonemaier Games Design Day: Speaking of early feedback, one of the first places where Atlantis Rising: Second Edition was playtested at was the 2017 Stonemaier Games Design Day. We want to thank the Design Day community for their feedback and Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone for hosting such a tremendous event.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAtlantis Rising is Elf Creek Games's second Kickstarter project. We fulfilled our first game, End of the Trail, on time, getting it to backers ahead of its public release at the Origins Game Fair this past June. We are working with the same game manufacturer (Panda GM), where many of the non-printed components are already in production for this project. Any concerns that came up during the manufacturing of End of the Trail were addressed quickly and taken care of in a very timely and professional manner. This is one of the reasons why we are proud to partner with Panda moving forward.\n\nWe are continuing to partner with Quartermaster Logistics for fulfillment in the US and parts of Asia, with Aetherworks for fulfillment in Australia and New Zealand and with Gamesquest for the UK and elsewhere. We also have decided to add Happy Shops as another European fulfilment partner as well as Snakes and Lattes as a partner for Canada. Partnering with these companies will allow us to have shipping and fulfillment costs that are great for our customers and they will work with us to make sure that the fulfillment process with Atlantis Rising: Second Edition goes as smooth as possible.\n\nAs Kickstarter enthusiasts ourselves, we understand that sometimes it is necessary to cancel a pledge, even after it has been collected. Hardships occur to everyone and we want to be a company that understands the issues that backers might face. To this end, we will offer 100% refunds within 90 days of the campaign ending. We will offer a 100% refund within 60 days of receiving your reward.\n\nLastly, we are anticipating for Atlantis Rising: Second Edition to be a larger campaign than our first campaign, End of the Trail. Every campaign brings with it new challenges and learning experiences. We have the utmost confidence in the experience and expertise of our partners to help us along our way. And we have worked to establish relationships with publishers throughout the industry who are always willing to offer us their advice and support. We will be keeping you, our backers, up to date each step along the way.

Click here to see how it works.\nThe Stretch Goals System\nIf you've never used Kickstarter before, it is sometimes hard to understand the Stretch Goals system. As more people pledge, the costs of production for the game go down. Instead of just pocketing the difference as in a traditional retail distribution, Kickstarter creators choose to share it with the backers. More people means more stretch goals unlocked, in turn meaning more people interested in the game because everyone gets more content for the same pledge amount.  \nThis works also because people like you help us share the project with their friends, drawing in new backers. We know this is only possible because of you so we'd like to give a huge thank you!\nEN: The game box and expansions will come in English.\nFR : La bo\u00eete de jeu et les extensions seront disponibles en Fran\u00e7ais.\nSpanish, Italian, German: a free pdf will contain all texts from the game (including optional buys). If there are 700 backers in one language we will add a $20 CAD ($15 USD) optional buy for a printed language pack.\nHelp us spread the word ! Click on the images below to share on your favorite social platform. \nTo score a successful Memory, the Assassins must complete the Objectives listed in the Campaign Book (some are optional) and then exit the Memory map. The game plays in Game Turns:\n1. Assassins draw an event card\n2. Assassins take their actions\nMove Attack with a weapon Assassinate with the Hidden Blade Use their character Special Ability Use an equipment (Smoke Bomb, Medicine, etc) Remove a dead enemy\u2019s body and draw an equipment card Climb a Synchronization Tower Keep an action in reserve 3. Guards take their actions\nReinforcements (more and stronger if the Alarm is triggered) Movement (Towards an Exposed Assassin if there is one) Attack within range (same tile or one tile away for ranged weapons) Assassins must remain stealthy to avoid triggering the Alert or be prepared to face the consequences. After the Memory, the Assassins go back to their HQ where they can exchange loot, heal the wounded, train their Apprentices and so on.\nGAME OVERVIEW\n                                                                              You can find more info about Roma in this Update. \nWhy optional buys?  \nOur optional buys are really optional. You can play the complete core box game and fully enjoy the campaign without any optional buy. Optional buys will add to your experience, with new optional miniatures and new optional gameplay. But when you pledge for an addon, you both get new material for the game AND you contribute to unlock new stretch goals, adding new components along the core box for every pledger.\nFor this project, we work with some of the best sculptors in the world. Miniatures will be 32 mm from eye to foot and all come unpainted. They will be a combination of PVC and ABS (when needed). All bases will come textured.\nAlessandra, Ezio and Bastiano Miniatures sculpted by Edgar Skomorowski and painted by Studio Mathieu Fontaine. \nBrute hand sculpted by St\u00e9phane Simon.\n                                                                                                                                                                We will be using a pledge management platform after the campaign to manage pledges and charge shipping. All pledgers will have access to the pledge manager. The Pledge Manager will not be open for non pledgers. IMPORTANT: you will NOT receive the free Tower if you pledge less than 158 CAD (Assassin pledge) during the Kickstarter campaign.\nNon pledgers will be able to preorder the game (without Kickstarter exclusives) for a higher price.\nShipping will be charged on the pledge manager platform once we have final estimates for weight. We will do our best to get pledgers the best possible rates for shipping. \nThe games will ship from the warehouse closest to your delivery address. \nCurrent estimates are as follow for the Game (based on a total weight of\n18 lbs / 8 kg) (updated nov. 21st). This includes the Assassin pledge with the free tower offer and all stretch goals. We continue to update this as we get better quotes.\nPlease consider the shipping costs can increase when you add Optional Buys.\nIf your country is not listed in the table above please contact us.\nWe are sadly not able to deliver to the following countries: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR UK PLAYERS\nAs the United Kingdom is on course to exit the common market and customs union in 2019, there are risks that import duties and tariffs are imposed on goods imported from outside the UK. We will do all possible efforts to minimize the costs, including trying to have a dedicated warehouse in the UK. Despite these precautions, those potential import tariffs and duties are completely out of our hands and UK pledgers might have to pay for these at time of delivery.\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-question-asked refund policy. \nIf you cancel within 14 days after the Kickstarter campaign end, we will refund 100% of your pledge. \nIf you cancel 14 days after the end of the campaign or later, we will refund 85% of the the amount you pledged (to cover the irreversible payment processing and Kickstarter fees that are imposed on us).\nCURRENCY CONVERSION\nAll USD pricing conversions have been made using the market exchange rate on November 11th 2018 ($1 CAD = $.757 USD). Pledgers need to be aware that exchange rates vary daily. Creators cannot update the reward descriptions to reflect changes in exchange rates. We thus recommend that pledgers check the current rate at the end of the campaign. Remember that all pledges are in Canadian Dollars. Your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars at the end of the campaign.\n\u00a9 2018 Ubisoft Entertainment. All Rights Reserved.

Rest assured we'll do our best to react as fast as possible whenever such issues occur. Thus, we commit to maintain a timely, open communication channel with our backers. \nV-Commandos was our first Kickstarter campaign and we had very positive feedbacks from the backers about both the Kickstarter campaign and the final game quality. We've been managing creative teams and game projects since 20+ years. The great majority of such projects were delivered on time and within budget.\n\nMANUFACTURING \nManufacturing a board game is associated with inherent risks, such as insufficient quality as compared to demanded standards, delays in manufacturing and out-of-specs components. \nWe've spent the last 18 months establishing a relationship with various top quality board games and miniatures manufacturers. We also have an ongoing trust based relationship with the manufacturer of V-Commandos. \nAlthough we have taken into account many factors that can impact a production schedule, risks still exist. \nWe seek to optimize costs, obtain the best possible quality and ensure that all components meet design specifications. We've settled on established manufacturers with offices in Canada or Europe in order to ensure timely and effective communications and resolve any potential issues.\n\nMISSING & DAMAGED ITEMS \nGiven the complexity of component handling during the manufacturing process, it might happen that some components are either missing or damaged. \nAfter receiving your game(s), if you find out that some items are missing or damaged, please contact us and we will send you a replacement for the the missing or damaged items as fast as possible free of charge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 158 or more", "title": "Assassin Pledge", "descp": "Approx. 119 USD / 105 EUR / 92 \u00a3\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice game box\n+ ALL unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be calculated after the campaign and charged at a later time.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["4,181 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 376 or more", "title": "Master Assassin All-In Pledge", "descp": "Approx. $285 USD / 251 EUR / 224 \u00a3\nGame box + Ezio Miniature (Kickstarter Exclusive) + Roma Expansion + Creed vs Crows Expansion + Tokyo XXI Expansion + Deluxe Assassins Dice Set + Crow's Nest Tower + Free Tower (KS exclusive, free during KS only) + All unlocked Stretch Goals (Save $50 CAD)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["1,676 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #107", "update_userinfo": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice\u00ae - Freight Status", "update_content": "*Version en fran\u00e7ais plus bas*\nAfter more than four years of hard but exciting work, we are in the final lap: delivering your games!

Resources are limited, and players must constantly decide where to allocate them best to score the most points. They can choose to specialize in launching rockets, delivering spacecraft to targets, downlinking science data, or spread their resources across multiple areas to increase the likelihood of success.

The letter in the upper left-hand corner of each Playing card indicates whether a card represents a Technical, Management, or Cost element. This trio represents the three types of analyses that are required for each stage of space mission development. The text in the lower left-hand corner describes the second use of the card. During Phase 2, a player must discard one Technical, one Management, and one Cost card to form a TMC Triplet. The remaining three cards are available to play as Actions.\nEach turn requires players to make a strategic decision about which cards to keep and which to discard\nTo assemble the best hand for Phase 2, a player may trade one or two cards with the Market (five face-up cards available to all players). A player may also discard any three cards into the TMC Discard Pile and draw three new cards. \nPhase 2 \u2013 Discard TMC Triplet and Perform Actions\nAfter discarding their TMC Triplet, the player may perform up to three actions in any order. Possible actions are: \n Retrieve a Card from the TMC Discard Pile: Search through the TMC Discard Pile, retrieve one card of your choice \n Build a Rocket: Place a Rocket card from your hand next to the matching Launch Pad on the Game Board - then place the indicated number of Resource Cubes on top of the card \n Build a Spacecraft: Place a Spacecraft card from your hand next to a matching connector on any open Rocket or Spacecraft - then place the indicated number of Resource Cubes on top of the card \n Build a Science Instrument: Place an Instrument card that matches any open connector on a Spacecraft card - then place the number of indicated Resource Cubes on top of the card \n Enhance Ground System: Each player operates a ground system. The capabilities of the ground system can be enhanced by playing specific cards as actions \n Add Resource Cubes to a Component on Earth: A player may add one or two of their Resource Cubes to any Rocket, Spacecraft, or Science Instrument card that is still on the Earth and already has at least one of their cubes on it.\n Retrieve One Resource Cube: A player may remove one of their Resource Cubes that is in play and return it to their Available Resources box.\n Transfer Resource Cubes: A player may transfer one or two of their Resource Cubes across a Connector. Connectors exist between Rockets and Spacecraft, between Spacecraft and Instruments, and between training boxes on the Ground System Mat \n Launch a Rocket:   Requires a dice roll. Remove Resource Cubes from a Rocket card to gain dice. Train your launch team to increase the odds of success.\n Move a Spacecraft: Requires a dice roll or Gravity Assist cards. Remove Resource Cubes from a Spacecraft card to gain dice. The more experienced your spacecraft team, the more likely you are to arrive at the target.\n Downlink Data from a Science Instrument: Requires a dice roll or Science Operations Center cards. Remove Resource Cubes from a Science Instrument card to gain dice. A knowledgeable science team has a better chance of downlinking data.\n Acquire New Discovery Cards: Draw three Discovery cards and choose to keep one, two, or all three \nPlayers spend their resource cubes to build rockets, spacecraft, and instruments. Blue has built the Ariane-5 Rocket, green built the Large Orbiter, and yellow added the Lidar Science Instrument.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Make Discoveries\nWith the right combination of Downlink Cards, players make scientific discoveries. Players may claim their Discovery cards once they have the right combination of Downlink cards. After completing the Discovery, the player scores the points indicated on the Discovery card.\nCombine Downlink cards to make scientific discoveries\nPhase 4 \u2013 Restore Hand \nAt the end of their turn, each player draws new Playing Cards to restore their hand to six cards.\nQuick Summary cards provide an easy reference for players\nGame End\nThe game ends when a player reaches 30 or more points on their turn or if there are no cards left for a player to restore their hand to six cards. When one of these events happen, each player gets one last turn. The game can be lengthened or shortened by adjusting the number of points needed to win. \nAfter each player completes their last turn, they total up the number of points scored. The player with the highest total number of points wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the highest Discovery points wins. \nRead the full set of rules here \nBackers that support us at the $39 level and higher will receive the Kickstarter-exclusive Downlink Mission Patch!\nPlaytesting and Feedback\nFor an excellent rundown of a playtesting session - read this article by Jason Davis: The Player of Games: A round of Downlink with Dante Lauretta\nWe spent over a year testing and improving this game. We play tested with kids as young as 10 years of age, college students, graduate students, gamers (some pretty intense), spacecraft engineers, scientists, and more. Along the way we made improvements and refined the game mechanics. We are confident this is a game everyone will love!\n Downlink has been playtested by over 50 people across the world, and launched on Kickstarter with the design complete. Just like with Xtronaut and Constellations (which were delivered to all backers on time), Downlink is ready to move into production once the Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nReviews of Xtronaut Games\nAbout Us\nBe sure to follow us on Social Media!\nXtronaut Facebook Page\nShire Post Mint Facebook Page\nDante on Twitter\nShire Post Mint on Twitter\nXtronaut has a track-record of designing award-winning games that combine fun with a bit of science learning along the way. \nWe formed Xtronaut to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and citizen scientists through space mission-related games and education programs. Professor Dante Lauretta, the leader of the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission (launched September 2016, to an asteroid named Bennu), and Michael Lyon, a leader in the space tourism sector (organizing the first tourist flights on the Soyuz Rocket to the ISS) founded Xtronaut. Our games are distinguished by their family-friendly engaging play and adherence to real scientific principles. \nShire Post Mint has fulfilled 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past. They have been making and shipping coins for 15 years so we are confident in our coin-making timeline. Shire Post Mint is a traditional fantasy coin making mint with four full time staff specializing in the fabrication of fully-licensed fantasy currency from fictional worlds. Shire Post utilizes antique coin making processes to recreate the feel and look of ancient and medieval coins, from hand-carving dies, using solid metals (never cast or plated), stamping with antique machines, to tumbling and chemically or thermally treating the coins in order to bring about the weathered look of old coins. They will be creating the coins in their workshop so we will have full control and give accurate updates on timing and any challenges that arise. Space mission coins are a new venture for us, but prototypes have been very successful.\nWe have worked hard to be ready for this Kickstarter. When our campaign is funded, we will immediately place the order for production of the final product -- all materials are ready to go, and the game has undergone extensive and fruitful playtesting. We have proven our manufacturing and distribution system with Xtronaut and Constellations. For Downlink, we have brought on two new partners for fulfillment and shipping.\nBackerkit is the platform we\u2019re using to manage your Kickstarter pledges. After the campaign, you\u2019ll be able to add additional items to your pledge, manage your shipping address, and be informed when your items have shipped.\nWe look forward to getting Downlink in your hands as soon as possible, with our goal of on time delivery. We will use Fulfillrite to fulfill the games. We recognize that shipping costs are substantial. The prices reflect our best estimate of the actual shipping costs with no markup. Our goal is to provide the best and least costly shipping available. Shire Mint will ship the coins to backers directly. \nSpecial Thanks\nWe  would like to thank SpaceCom for their support of our Kickstarter campaign and at their upcoming conference and exposition in Houston! Look for Xtronaut at the exposition area.\nTo Aerolite Meteorites for assistance with the video production. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of tangible product to be delivered, there is a real chance for production delays and other factors presenting challenges along the way. Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and shipping mistakes.\n\nFortunately, the designers of this game are used to managing large projects. Just like in building a spacecraft, we developed plans to handle a wide range of contingencies. Our success with Xtronaut and Constellations has resulted in a streamlined system for design, testing, production, and distribution.

Dependent on final discussions with manufacturer.\nA thematic Roll and Write with DINOSAURS!\nPaths let people explore your park. Dinosaur enclosures are the main attractions! Enclosures need generators to keep them electrified and your visitors safe.\n\nAt the core of the game is a fun story of building a great dinosaur park!\nRacing for Visitor Cards adds tension and interactivity\nWhen playing with 9 or fewer players, you will compete for a different set of Visitor Cards with each of your neighbours. Which ones will you prioritise? Keep a close eye on what your opponents are doing, so they don't grab the visitors before you!\nDANGER MODE adds even more tension\nIn Danger Mode, the dinosaurs are trying to break out! You need to not only worry about spatial planning but also about the security levels and how much stress you place on each generator, as you try to keep the fences electrified and stop the dinosaurs from escaping!\nLIGHT MODE is an introduction, with meaty decisions\nWe strongly recommend everyone play Light Mode first. Not only is it a relatively simple introduction to the game, but there is already plenty to think consider. With 27 visitor cards to compete over, and 6 different special buildings, there's a lot of replayability.\nMillions of possible setups!\nWith a whole variety of Visitor Cards, Labs and Special Buildings, there are millions of setups for Danger Mode! Each time you play, you'll have to consider a new set of abilities and ways to score.\nPlayable with 150 players!!!***\nBy using a central pool of visitor cards, Light Mode can be played with a ridiculous number of players! Theoretically, you could use the 150 sheets of paper included to run a massive event at a convention!\nOr, if that's not enough, use 2 boxes for 300 players.\n*** - Final number depends on the arrangement with the manufacturer as it may be 150 double sided sheets (light vs danger mode) or two 75 sheet pads of paper for each mode.\nA complex spatial puzzle \nEvery square of your park is a valuable resource. Enclosures must be accessible to visitors. Each path you build should lead directly somewhere. Generators can be cleverly used for multiple enclosures! Special buildings make you think even more carefully about where your pens are. Every placement is critical!\nROLL the dice\nUse each die to draw one of 3 things: paths, a special building, or a dinosaur pen!\nPaths let you connect everything together. In DinoWorld, rather than using whole dice values, you use the pips. So to draw two straights and a T you need two pips for the straights, and another two pips for the T!\nSpecial buildings are different each game and offer you different ways to score!\nDinosaur pens are one of the main way you get points! Draw your fences, make sure you have the required number of generator connections, and then simply draw in your dinosaur! You just need to make sure you have a path leading into each of your new dinosaurs by the end of each round.\nAt the end of each turn, check if you've managed to complete any of the visitor cards next to you! If you have, you take those cards! You'll score them at the end of the game, and you've just denied points to your neighbour!\nThat's it! Ater 9 turns, the game is over. Hopefully, you'll have drawn a beautiful park where visitors can go to see exciting dinosaur clones!\nIn danger mode, the dinosaurs might break free! This time introducing a damage tracker, and a power outage phase.\nFor each dinosaur pen you build, the risk increases. Herbivores increase your threat by one, carnivores are doubly risky!\nYou can use security to mitigate the danger, but risky play (not using security) does have potential reward...\nAt the end of each round, roll the danger dice! Add your threat level, subtract your security and see if any pens are straining the generators too much! If they are, the pens will be damaged and be closer to a break-out!\nDanger mode also adds a variety of public use laboratories, which will give you different ways to mitigate the rules each game, for a limited use per type of lab.\nIn the deluxe and expanded edition of the game, it contains 2 new mini expansions and cards for an automa.\nNotably, this edition will not be available for general retail until 6 months after copies have been sent to backers! We will however may still sell it directly at conventions such as GenCon, UKGE and Essen and our own website.\nAquatic expansion\nFirst, we have the aquatic expansion (3 cards), which lets you fill that lake! The aquatic expansion has fixed numbers for the dinosaurs which are randomised at the beginning of each game. Each card dictates which dice spread is required to build a certain dinosaurs, so some cards may only allow one type of dinosaur to be built with one type of value on the dice, while other cards will allow an even spread of dice for all dinosaurs. \nThese dinosaurs are scored using a set collection mechanic, with the same, and different dinosaurs scoring (almost) exponentially.\nAviary expansions\nNext, we have the aviaries! Choose from a wide selection of awkward and fixed shapes that you will play with each game. Flying dinosaurs breed, so place them early enough that they can be filled! (Final card count 15-20 depending on final playtesting during the campaign)\nAutoma deck for solo players\nThe 1p Automa lets you play solitaire in a brand new way, making some binary decisions for an AI that competes with you for visitors and points. More details below....\nHow does the automa play?\nDesigned by automa creation specialist: David Turczi and further refined by Nick Shaw, you will play against a \"normal\" or \"hard\" automa. The automa has it's own deck with 16 double use cards. 12 can be used with the core game, while 4 can be added if used in conjunction with the aviary and aquatic expansions. The automa also uses an extra die so that each round you will be rolling 4 dice, allocating one to the automa, and the final 3 to yourself. \nHow does it work?\nThe automa will have one card drawn from the automa deck at the beginning of each turn. The card will be double use, with each side giving instructions of what the automa would do (and therefore score), if you choose that side. The side you choose will be dependent on the die you allocate to the automa - hence starving yourself of a particular value, and potentially gifting the automa valuable points if allocated without careful consideration.\nHow does it score?\nThe automa scores by using a set collection mechanic of units written on the cards themselves such as special buildings, dinosaurs and in hard mode, the security and generators. The trick is to allocate a die to the automa with careful consideration!\nA german version of the rulebook has been translated, while a french one is in the works. We hope to offer multiple languages through the Boardgamegeek page soon\n *The deluxe edition will not be available for retail purchase for 6 months after backers get their copies. We will however allow late pledges to allow those late to the party, to get this edition, right until we start shipping them out. So if most backers have received their copies in June, the deluxe edition will only be available the following January. Please note, Retailers who back this campaign directly, will also be treated as kickstarter backers - so there may be a small number of retailers who sell the deluxe version of the game.\nTo save on shipping costs you can order our popular and previous games: \nRuthless - a pirate themed deckbuilding game (\u00a323/$29)\nPocket Pharma - a pharmaceutical themed drafting game (\u00a321/$27)\nPocket Sub - an abstract strategy game of nautical warfare (\u00a316/$21)\nTo add these on, please use our pledge manager when it opens\nThe Pocket games mentioned above are the deluxe editions\nDice Hospital may be available in the future as an add-on, but will be available soon through all good FLGS's. \nAdditionally, we are likely to offer extra pads for people to purchase, again in the pledge manager. We think it'll be around \u00a36-8 if purchased along with a game through kickstarter/pledge manager. \nPlay along with Tom Heath by using the basic print and play files we've supplied!\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 10 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates. \nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment, so we can offer shipping within UK/USA at no additional cost!\n\nCosts elsewhere are shown in the approximate local currency. To double check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the tier and select your country. \nDue to previous shipping issues we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia). \nWe do not charge additional shipping after the kickstarter! You will not have to pay anything more!\nTransparency guarantee\nWith every game we have kickstarted, we kept backers informed of all the problems, issues, and - of course - good news as we get the games finished, manufactured and sent to your door. This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we try to do an update twice a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we are in turn delaying the retail launch to put our backers first. Backers are always our priority. \nWorld class manufacturing\nFor this project, we are considering Longpack, who we have worked with several times in the past. We are also considering established Polish manufacturers (Trefl and Axel), who might be able to print and deliver the game in only 6 weeks. Ultimately, it will depend on the exact number of backers, and how many we print.\nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via Royal Mail. If Brexit has happened before the games are ready to be shipped, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nmid-December: Submit Files to manufacturer \nJanuary: Manufacturing\nFebruary: Chinese New Year\nearly-mid March: Shipping from China to the UK begins\nMid-late April: Arrives in ports\nEarly May: Fulfilment commences \nlate May: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies. \nIf we do decide to use a Polish manufacturer, our timeline will be as follows:\nDecember: extra time for tweaks\nJanuary: Submit Files to manufacturer \nearly February: Manufacturing  \nearly March: Shipping from Poland to the UK \nmid-March: Fulfilment commences \nlate March: EU Fulfilment completed. \nearly May: fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always put a worst case scenario on our tiers - as delays can happen.\nThis game has had the attention of a talented team lavished upon it.

We are a capable and knowledgeable company. Customer service has always been our number one priority.\n\nBrexit is a new potential obstacle that we might have to deal with. Worst case scenario, we will have WTO terms for import/export with EU and customs will become an issue. ACG does have the cash reserves to absorb the potential extra cost of the game and - worst case scenario - we will send several cases of the game back into EU. \n\nWe have worked out a plan to hopefully send the games to EU backers before Brexit, but this can't be guaranteed. If we do get the games as planned, EU backers will be sent games earlier.\n\nWe will be selling the games at UKGE - but only if backers can get their games first, or at worst, pick up their games at the UKGE.\n\nWe are a very open company and welcome feedback, suggestions and comments either publically or privately!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Probing Protoceratops (RETAILER OPTION)", "descp": "- For retailers to back here for retailer rates.\n- Please message us for retailer rates.\n- Non-retailers can back here to stay informed.\n- A big thank you from us!\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincere thanks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["120 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "Velociraptor Value", "descp": "- Full game plus all stretch goals\n- Free shipping to UK/USA!\n- Subsidised shipping elsewhere\nAppx: $27, \u20ac24, AUS$38, CAD$36\nPlease select your country for more detailed shipping costs outside UK/USA, or see the shipping section.\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome to DinoWorld full game\nAll stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a329 or more", "title": "Tremendous Tyrannosaurus rex", "descp": "- Full game plus all stretch goals\n- Expansion pack with aquatic expansion, aviary expansion, 1p automa mode.\n- Free shipping to UK/USA, subsidised shipping elsewhere\n- We will not sell this version to distributors/retailers for 6 months after backers receive their copies, although we may still sell it directly at conventions and our website\nAppx: $37, \u20ac33, AUS$52, CAD$49\nPlease select your country for more detailed shipping costs outside UK/USA, or see the shipping section.\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome to DinoWorld full game\nAll stretch goals\nAviary expansion\nAquatic expansion\n1-player automa mode\n6 months exclusivity after release", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,941 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to DinoWorld shipped!", "update_content": "We've just shipped all NON-UK orders!\nAfter shipping domestic (UK) orders last week, we've now shipped all international (non-UK) orders.

Lovecraft\nBy  night we came, descending upon the old house like the vultures that we  are. They say the manor is full of valuables and relics. They also say  Lovecraft is mad, believing his writing to be more than mere fiction.  Let's hope that isn't true... and why the front door was  left unlocked. \nAll Manor of Evil takes players inside the mind and abode of HP  Lovecraft. As players pilfer and steal ancient relics, unseen forces awaken and madness stirs. Beyond the larceny at hand, each player has an agenda of their own. Some want only to survive the night, while others wish to call forth an elder god eager to devour the players... or the world.\n \"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. \" - H.P. Lovecraft\nThe LUNATIC pledge of All Manor of Evil includes upgraded awakening and madness tokens, as well as more relics, roles, and, yes, gods. More importantly, this pledge adds monster cards and arcane relics. Monsters are added to the Manor deck during setup and trigger game-altering effects when they are drawn. Arcane relics feature a silver border. Some role and relic cards reference these powerful objects, each of which is unique. Lastly, this pledge level includes additional components to allow for up to six players to play!\n \"I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness.\" - H. P. Lovecraft\nThe contents of Madness Stirs will be comprised of stretch goals unlocked throughout this campaign. Backers will receive this expansion for supporting this campaign. It will be available in limited quantities after the campaign at a cost directly from Kolossal. This expansion will contain more complex monsters, relics, roles, and other content not available in the retail version of the game.\n \"Wise men have interpreted dreams, and the gods have laughed.\" - H.P. Lovecraft\nTake a look at what those who have had an early look at All Manor of Evil think about the game!\n All Manor of Evil is the 2nd Mikro campaign from Kolossal Games and the 9th overall campaign from Kolossal Games. While Kolossal is new to the industry, we hit the ground running, armed with the  knowledge of industry best practices, experienced partners, and  wonderful games. Our first game Western Legends   is in the process of fulfillment. We believe in open and honest  communication and will share all info as we receive it with our  backers. \nThe game is designed by Kolossal's own Travis R. Chance (Heroes Wanted, Path of Light and Shadow, Legendary: Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with haunting art from Mike Riiven (Omen: A Reign of War). Though a game in our Mikro line, it packs a punch with highly interactive play, as well as an interesting take on the very popular Lovecraft theme.\nOur team is led and supported by industry and marketing experts.  We have a machine that works, fueled by amazing games that are designed,  developed, and illustrated by incredibly talented people. The game is  easy to learn while providing interesting, diverse, and tense game play  each game, combining familiar mechanisms in a unique, new way.  \nWe are committed to begin fulfillment to backers of this game  before it is made available in retail. Components and materials for the  game are in the final stages of completion upon launch. All files will  be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week of the  campaign's ending. This ensures timely delivery to our backers. \n Kolossal does not sell to online discounters. Backers will receive all of our games at a lower cost and before the retail release of the game. Further, direct sales via the  Kolossal website will only be to US customers.\nBy backing at ANY pledge level through our campaign, you will receive, at no extra cost, the Madness Stirs expansion. This expansion will be comprised of stretch goals unlocked throughout the  campaign and will only be available directly through Kolossal (at a  cost) after the campaign in limited quantities. This expansion will only be overprinted by 500 units for the initial release of the game. We have many exciting and interactive goals  planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's ninth official release! \nPlayers take the role of thieves that have all broken into the opulent manor of writer H.P. Lovecraft. Upon entry, they discover valuable relics of strange origin throughout the manor. Little do they know, their mere touch has stirred ancient and otherworldly forces. At least one of them will be driven mad, but who among those remaining will escape with the most relics... and their sanity?\nBackers wanting more info about how to play the game may peruse our draft rule book link here. We also invite them to read a step-by-step description of the game below.\nAll Manor of Evil is played over a number of game rounds. Each Round has three phases.\nSelect Actions\nResolve Actions\nEnd of Round\n                                        SELECT ACTIONS\nEach player has 4 Action cards that they will choose to play one of each round. Each Action card has a Title, Initiative Order, Card Action, and Room Action.\nEach player simultaneously selects one Action card from their hand and places it face down in their play area. When a player places their Action card face down they immediately return any face up Action cards to their hand. This return step will be skipped on the first round of play.\nAll Players simultaneously reveal their Action cards. Any players who selected the same Action card as at least one other player take a Madness token from the supply. \nThe player(s) that selected the Action card with the lowest initiative number resolves their Action card first. If more than one player chose the same Action card, players with the same initiative number will resolve their actions in clockwise order starting at the Lantern token. Players that chose the same action also receive one madness token. \n                                       RESOLVE ACTIONS\nWhen resolving an Action card, first resolve the Card Action and then the Room Action.\nRoom actions require the player to steal a relic from one of the rooms on the Manor Board. Players MUST steal a relic from one of the rooms listed on their Action card. Depending on the other players actions there may not available Relics to steal during the Room Action step and in this case the player does not steal a relic.\nOnce a Relic is stolen, place or remove Awakening tokens, gain or lose Madness tokens, and resolve any indicated Special effect on the card.\nThe Madness Value and Relic Value will be considered at the end of the game. Players will only know for certain the values on the top card of each player's Cache. The uncertainty of just who has the most madness adds to the tension of the game!\n                                                END OF ROUND\nAfter all players have resolved their action cards, the round ends. Players check to see if any Elder Gods have 6 or more Awakening Tokens and if so the game ends. If not, the player with the Lantern Token passes it to the next player in clockwise order and the next round begins.\n                                                   GAME END\nA game of All Manor of Evil will end in one of three possible ways. \nDuring set up, two Clock Cards will be added to the relic deck. When the second clock card is revealed, the game immediately ends.\nIf one Elder God has 6 or more Awakening tokens at the end of a round. \nIf more than one Elder God is Awakened at the end of a Game Round, then all players are devoured and nobody escapes the Manor.\n                                   DECLARING A WINNER\nWhen the game ends each player will reveal their Role card and resolve all abilities.\nIf an Elder God was awakened, resolve any Awakened ability on the Elder God's card. \nAssuming that the thieves have not destroyed the world by awakening several ancient cosmic gods, the remaining players will total their Madness and Relic Values.\nPlayers will total their Madness tokens and the Madness Value of all cards in their Cache. The player with the most Madness has delved too deep into the dark and unknown and will never be the same. This player is eliminated.\nThe remaining players will then compare the total value of stolen relics to determine who among them was the most successful relic thief.\nIn addition to the standard game for 3 or more players, each copy of All Manor of Evil includes rules and components for a solo and 2 player variant. These Lovecraft rules can be found in the rule book.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.

Well, no matter the size of the group or the experience of the players, Welcome To... will be the perfect fit for your game night. \nIn Welcome To... players compete to be named Best Suburb by giving the houses in their developments the best parks, pools, and curb appeal. The game supports 1 to 100 players out of the box and is perfect for any size playgroup, because everyone takes their turn at the same time!\n  Every round players select which house they want to build out of 3 available, writing their selected house onto their player sheet. They\u2019ll then have the option of taking a bonus action, based on the house they picked. In addition to competing for the title of Best Suburb, they\u2019ll also be racing to complete objectives set by the city.

We realize that the publication of a tabletop game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of several well-seasoned professionals; Nolan Nasser, Travis McIntire, Jacob Way, and Levi Mote. All have been involved extensively in the successful completion and delivery of over 50 total Kickstarter campaigns\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. Whether the news is good or bad, you can expect us to report it honestly and openly.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Welcome To... are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "STARTER HOME", "descp": "1 copy of Welcome To\u2026, All applicable unlocked stretch goals.\nAdd additional copies of Welcome To for $25 each (additional postage included).\nFREE SHIPPING for all US & CANADA backers\nUK rewards will ship from within the UK\nAU rewards will ship from within AU\nCA rewards will ship from within CA\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome To\u2026 Game\nFREE SHIPPING to US & CA", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,145 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "INTERN", "descp": "Unlocked Thematic Score Pad refills, Unlocked City Plans, and all applicable stretch Goals\nThe more we Unlock, the better value this pledge becomes!\nUK rewards will ship from within the UK\nAU rewards will ship from within AU\nCA rewards will ship from within CA\nINCLUDES:\nUnlocked Thematic Score Pad Refills\nUnlocked City Plans\nUnlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,509 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "VETERAN ARCHITECT", "descp": "1 Playmat, plus Unlocked Thematic Score Pad refills, Unlocked City Plans, and all applicable stretch Goals\nThe more we Unlock, the better value this pledge becomes!\nUK rewards will ship from within the UK\nAU rewards will ship from within AU\nCA rewards will ship from within CA\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome To...

By charging shipping after the campaign, we can properly assess the final weights and measures of our games, as well as group backers in such a way to maximize utility and ensure you get the lowest shipping cost. We will cover all customs and duties, but our low pledge tiers and small margins prevent us from providing free shipping.\nThe following table includes estimated shipping costs provided by stamps.com (for US backers) and Spiral Galaxy Games for our European and international backers. These are not final costs, but rather estimates.  The true and final shipping cost will be charged after the campaign.\nApproximate Shipping Rates\nCanadian backers.

With larger and larger game companies taking up greater share of the market, small indie board game publishers like ourselves can often be left in the dust - especially if our campaigns lack the polish backers have come to expect. While the ever rising bar is good for Kickstarter, it presents new challenges. With more up front capital needed and a demand for near completed games prior to launching, the cost of failure can be significant.\n\nWe at Doomsday Robots recognize the risks involved in pursuing our passion of making board games and are ready to rise to the challenge. Market analysis is a huge part of what we do prior to deciding which game to create and bring to publication, We want to make sure that not only is our investment secure, but that we can meet the demands of this amazing Kickstarter market. As such we've done our homework to minimize costs and risks to our backers.\n\nWe aren't perfect, and we've made mistakes in the past, but we never let that prevent us from doing right by our backers - a commitment we will keep today. We welcome feedback for how we can improve, and indeed listening to our backers have helped us to be a better company.\n\nThe biggest risk we face is the same that most publishers face - ever changing shipping costs. We've taken definitive steps to minimize this risk with an unprecedented level of transparency with our backers so that we can support one another in not only the successful creation of this game, but ensuring the costs to deliver it aren't unbearable to either party. As such we've moved the shipping charges to be collected after the campaign so we can truly minimize the costs with the foreknowledge of how many games we need, and exactly where they are going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Print and Play", "descp": "Receive a download link for the official print and play of Zoo-ography after the campaign and once all art assets are finalized.\nINCLUDES:\nZoo-ography Digital Print and Play Files", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["201 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Zoo-ography", "descp": "*The Game*\nReceive one copy of Zoo-ography Retail Edition including the Kickstarter exclusive Panda meeple with all applicable stretch goals.

The spirit of the world lifted the animals to new heights, bestowing great gifts upon them. The Foxen race grew proud and true.\nThat is, until the Guardians rose. No one quite knows why they came, but these are not the kind, life-giving Guardians of spiritual legend. These are darker, more ferocious versions, and now they're wreaking havoc in the realm.  \nSkulk Hollow is a 2-player, asymmetric, tactical combat game where players take the roles of either a band of Foxen heroes or a towering behemoth of a Guardian.   \n One vs Many Asymmetric Combat creates a fresh, fun, 2-player experience.\n Action takes place on the Board AND the Guardian. Not only does the battle occur on the Kingdom board, but the foxes must traverse full size, Guardian gameboards. Each guardian has unique routes and abilities to stop the foxen. \n Dual Purpose Cards give players a wide range of movement and ability powers while keeping them quick to pick and easy to play.\n Unique Foxen Nobles and Guardians creates a range of tactics and dynamics, adding depth and strategy that makes each game a new challenge.\nSkulk Hollow is a 30-45 minute game for 2 players, aged 8 and up. \nKeith Matejka of Thunderworks Games- renowned designer of Roll Player and collaborator on Herbaceous & Sunset Over Water - has created a dynamic, fresh 2-player combat game and Dustin Foust's (Atomic50) amazing art brings the world and characters to life. Eduardo Baraf of Pencil First Games is at the helm of Skulk Hollow to ensure it is the perfect balance of dynamic play, compelling choices, and amazing art in a fantastic package.\nOn the battlefields of Skulk Hollow, ancient relics can still be found amongst the various ruins that scatter the land. It's been said that crystalline bones of the wizards who sacrificed themselves during the creation of the Smallfolk still hold great power, even after being dormant for centuries. \nAll Kickstarter Backers who pledge for Skulk Hollow will also receive the Ancient Relics Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale on BGG, at Conventions, etc, but will not be packaged within the base game.\nIn Skulk Hollow, one player represents a guardian trying to eliminate the smallfolk who corrupt their once pristine creation, while the other player represents a band of Foxen heroes bent on vanquishing the guardian in order to protect their people and homes.  \nMain Phase: During this phase, the active player may take as many actions as shown by the action limit on their player mat. With each action, they may play one card or prepare. They may also spend power to take additional actions. Actions may be taken in any order. \n Play Card: The player plays one card from their hand.\n Prepare: The player discards one card from their hand, then draws two from the deck. \n Spend Power: The active player removes one power cube from the guardian player mat or any hero unit card in order to take an additional action.\nCleanup Phase:  Once the active player has taken all of the actions that they wish to take, or they no longer have any more actions available, they move to the Cleanup Phase of their turn. During this phase, they will allocate power and refill their hand. \nMore Details and all the Incredible Guardian and Foxen abilities can be found in the rules \nDOWNLOAD FRENCH BACKER RULES (WORD DOC) Note: French Edition will have completed rules, components, etc. This is just a primer.\n Board Game Closet - Skulk Hollow Preview \nClick for the Full Review!\nTantrum House - Skulk Hollow Preview \nClick for the Full Review!\nAnt Lab Games - Skulk Hollow Rules and Playthrough\nClick for Full Article\nBoard Game Spotlight - Skulk Hollow Preview: Pencil First Games paid to be included in a variety of media on the Board Game Spotlight channel.\nMan vs Meeple - Skulk Hollow Preview: Pencil First Games paid to be included in this overview on the Man vs Meeple channel. \nBoard Game Revolution - Skulk Hollow Extended Preview: Pencil First Games did not pay for this review, however we are paying for some ad spots on BGR FB group and newsletter.\nKeep up on Skulk Hollow\n                                             - Follow Skulk Hollow on Facebook\n                                             - Skulk Hollow on BoardGameGeek.com \nKeep up with Us\n                                              - Pencil First Games, Follow Ed on Twitter and Kickstarter\n                                              - Thunderworks Games, Follow Keith on Twitter\n                                              - Atomic50 for more Art from Dustin\n                                              - OK Art Studio for more Art from Sebastian\n                                              - Happy Valley Meeple Farm for more Meeples from Helen\n KS Intro View VO: Dorsey' Jackson\n Original Game Inspiration: Ethan Baraf ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Skulk Hollow\" is Pencil First Games' Ninth Kickstarter. \"Lift Off!

I've gone out of my way to surround myself with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and I'm sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, I will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\nFantastic Factories is a dice placement, engine building tabletop game for 1 to 5 players and takes 45 to 60 minutes to play. Players build a set of factories into their compound and then roll dice to use as workers. With over 35 different blueprints, you can discover endless inventive and creative ways your factories can work together. \nDifferent factories have different worker requirements. Some require a pair of matching dice. Some require a specific value. You aren't stuck with what you roll, though. With training facilities you can manipulate the values of your dice in order to figure out the optimal placement of all your workers! Each turn is a satisfying puzzle to solve. \nThere are over 35 unique buildings!\n                                                                             28 dice (16mm) (4 red, 4 blue, 4 green, 4 yellow, 4 purple, and 8 white)\n50 energy resource tokens\n30 metal* resource tokens (*clarification: represents metal resources in the game but made out of chipboard)\n85 goods tokens\n4 tool label tokens\n78 blueprint cards\n18 contractor cards\n1 first player token\n5 player boards and player aids\n Fantastic Factories comes with over 40 unique blueprint and contractor cards, ensuring each game is a fresh and new experience with lots of replayability.\nPromo Cards\nPledge now to receive 4 bonus blueprints and 1 bonus contractor!\nKickstarter backers will also receive 5 promotional cards FREE! After the Kickstarter campaign these cards will only be available at conventions or through other exceptional means. \nPlease note that the art and components are not completely finalized and may change slightly.\nIn Fantastic Factories, your goal is to build the most prestigious buildings and manufacture the most goods. Players start with 4 blueprints and some resources (1 metal, 2 energy). Players also have 4 colored dice that act as their workers.\nMarket Phase\nEach round begins with the market phase. On your turn you either select a face-up blueprint to add into your hand for free or discard a card to hire the corresponding contractor. Contractors have unique effects that allow you do things such as roll additional dice or gain resources. \nTake a blueprint or hire a contractor.\nOnce all players have taken a turn, the work phase begins. \nExample of some contractors you can hire.\nWork Phase\nDuring the work phase players take their turns simultaneously. You start by rolling your dice. Then you can take various actions in any order. \nYou can place your workers on a set of basic actions to gain more resources or draw cards:\nBasic actions let you draw cards and gain resources.\nYou can build cards by discarding another card with the same tool symbol and paying the resource cost: \nBuilding a Nuclear Plant.\nAnd finally you can activate your cards (yes, even on the same turn you built it!). Training facilities help you get the correct value workers to run your factories. \nSequencing your actions correctly can allow you to maximize your turn!\nOnce all players are finished with their turns, the round is complete, and another one begins with the market phase again. If any players have manufactured 12 or more goods or have built 10 or more cards, the following round is the final round.\nSolo Game\nFantastic Factories supports playing solo. You still get to build awesome combinations of factories and strategize where best to place your workers. The only difference is you will be competing against a simple but efficient opponent known as \"The Machine\". The Machine is easily managed and guided by dice rolls and can be adjusted for varying levels of challenge. More details can be found in the rulebook. \nFantastic Factories is that perfect mix of approachability and strategic depth. The mechanics and rules are simple but the creative combinations of factories and numerous ways you can manipulate your dice make each game feel new and fresh. We've played the game more than 300 times, and we still enjoy playing it. \nWith simultaneous play, each game takes an hour or less so you know you'll be able to get it to the table time and time again and even play games back to back. With so many viable strategies to pursue, you'll be exploring the depths of Fantastic Factories for many games.\nSome of you may be waiting for the game to hit retail stores instead of pledging now. We would love to be in retail but getting the attention of distributors largely depends on the success of the Kickstarter campaign. There is a very real possibility that Fantastic Factories may never be available at retail outside of retailers who choose to back the Kickstarter. We know there's always risk in backing a Kickstarter so as a thanks for joining us on this journey, we've priced the pledge levels below our anticipated MSRP and are also including promo cards that will not be widely available through retailers that receive the game through distribution.\nRetailers\nInterested retailers should back at the retailer pledge level. We plan on charging standard retailer pricing and delivering the games well before normal distribution (if we even end up with a distributor). After you pledge, we will reach out with details about pricing. If you choose not to purchase for any reason we can refund your deposit pledge. Beyond the initial pledge there is no money due until just before fulfillment at which time you can specify your desired quantity and we will invoice you. The MSRP of the game will be $40. If you are a retailer and have any questions you can send us an email at retail@fantasticfactories.com.\nCheck out this 3 player full playthrough by JonGetsGames: \nYou can also see Jambalaya go through the first few rounds of a SOLO game:\nFantastic Factories is available on both Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia. We also have a print and play available!\nPlay on Tabletop Simulator!\nPlay on Tabletopia!\nPrint and Play!\nThe rulebook is still being finalized. You can find the latest rulebook here. \nWhat are stretch goals? Meeting our funding goal allows us to place an order with our manufacturer for the minimum order quantity. However, the more quantity we order, the cheaper it is to manufacture each individual copy. We reinvest these savings into upgrading the components of the game. That means the more funding we receive, the better the game will be for you! Sharing this project with people you know helps us improve the game.\nPlease note that our stretch goals for the game itself are component upgrades ONLY. We do not believe in additional content or gameplay as stretch goals because we have thoroughly play tested the game with all the content that we believe is necessary for a balanced game and the best possible gameplay experience. No more. No less.\nDigital Puzzle Book Stretch Goal\nWe'd like to release a printable PDF that includes a curated selection of One Turn Puzzles and solutions.\nOn July 6, if there are 50 or more puzzles on the BGG forum AND 200 or more thumbs up collectively on the puzzles, we will release a PDF puzzle book complete with final art and layout. We will also credit each puzzle creator in this book. There are already 10+ puzzles and 20+ thumbs up in the forum right now.\nBut there are only a few short days before the campaign ends! That's why we are extending the deadline of this stretch goal to July 6th. That's still only a short week and a half away so don't wait too long to get involved.\nWhen we were selected for the PAX South Indie Showcase in January 2017, we were faced with a conundrum. How could we possibly demo our 1 hour game to the masses on the show floor of PAX?\nAnd that's how we came up with the Puzzles. They are literally snapshots of a single turn in Fantastic Factories, taken at the moment right after you've rolled your dice. The challenge is the same as your final turn in the full game: make as many points as possible, given these dice, resources, and buildings in your compound.\nHere are a couple of them, see if you can figure them out!\nInstructions: Manufacture as many Goods as possible by assigning the dice (with values as shown). Each building card has an ability on its bottom half that you may use, but you may not use the same building twice.\n(Note: you can ignore the build costs in the top left corner of the cards. These cards have been pre-built for you)\nAn Introductory Puzzle\nDojo flips a die to its opposite side. Warehouse requires 3 dice, and those dice must sum to 14 or more.\nSee solution.\nAnother Puzzle!\nManufacture as many goods as possible!\n See solution.\nSolve More Puzzles, and Create Your Own!\nDiscover (and try to solve) more puzzles on our forum on Board Game Geek (some of them are challenging).\nAlso, check out this post to find out how you can create and share your own Fantastic Factories One Turn Puzzle for others to try to solve!\nIf enough people submit puzzles by July 6, then Joseph and I will put together a printable PDF of the best puzzles (with solutions) so you can bring them to game night!

They have a great reputation as experts in shipping and will be assisting us with coordinating shipping games across the world. As a result, shipping will be EU, AUS, and CAN friendly with no additional VAT being charged separately to backers. \nShipping is one of the most expensive parts of bringing a Kickstarter game to life. We estimate that shipping within the US will cost $12 per game, but we wanted to subsidize the shipping and split the cost with our backers. That means US backers will only be charged $6 for shipping for a single copy and we will cover the other $6. For non-US backers, we will still subsidize the shipping costs for $6 but the shipping cost to backers will vary by region. To see the shipping cost to your region, select the pledge level and then select your region.\nTwo Pack Bundle\nWe know that even with the subsidy that shipping can still be a lot. That's why we are also offering a pledge level for 2-game bundles at a significantly lower shipping price per game. For example a 2-game bundle being shipped to the EU would save you $11.\n3+ Copies\nIf you want to order more than 2 copies of Fantastic Factories, you can select the Two-Pack Bundle pledge and pledge an additional amount:\nFor Continental US/EU/Norway/Canada/AUS/China you should pledge for the Two-Pack Bundle and then add an additional $31 for each extra copy you want (this amount includes the additional shipping). \nFor Alaska/Hawaii, add $37 per extra copy.\nFor Puerto Rico, add $36 per extra copy.\nFor New Zealand, add $36 per extra copy. \nFor Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan, add $33 per extra copy. \nAnd for the rest of the world, add $40 per extra copy. \nWe are not offering any group buy discounts outside of the shipping savings.\nFor example, if you live in Belgium, the Two-Pack Bundle is $56 plus $15 shipping (total of $71). If you would like 4 copies of the game, you would add $31 for each additional copy so your pledge should be for a total of $133.\nIf you are currently pledged at the Retailer pledge level but are not a retailer, please switch your pledge to the Two-Pack Bundle and adjust your pledge amount for the quantity you want.\nWho are we?

Now play with up to 6 players!\nCo-operative: All players are working together against the dungeon, which makes it easy for new players to join, even if they are not hardcore gamers.\nFast Paced: There are no turns. You\u2019re all racing against the clock to defeat the cards in the dungeon before time runs out!\nFlexible: Rounds are short\u2014only 5 minutes\u2014and you can swap between heroes or even add or drop players between rounds.\nTwo new heroes have joined the party, with powerful special abilities and a new deck of cards. With them by your side, you can now play with up to six players!\nEach of the bosses now gets their own custom deck of five Boss Cards, giving each dungeon its own unique personality.\nAnd the Boss Cards introduce a new type of card to the dungeon: Curses! These cards change the game in strange new ways, and once encountered, they stick around for the rest of the dungeon.\nThe heroes have unearthed six powerful Artifacts with game-changing effects. These are shared by the party, and you can use them whenever you want\u2026 but only once per dungeon! And the fewer heroes you have on your team, the more artifacts you bring along, giving a helpful boost to smaller parties.\nFor this campaign, we've decided to focus on community involvement rather than have stretch goals. We want you to get all the goodies we designed for this expansion, no matter how the funding turns out!\nSo, instead, over the two weeks of the campaign we'll be revealing cards and asking you to vote on the art and titles for some Kickstarter-exclusive cards. Check back often to see what's new and make your voice heard!\n5-Minute Dungeon is quick to set up and play.\nThe first thing you need to do is pick a hero! Like the Barbarian here...\nYou\u2019ll draw a hand of cards, some of which will be resource cards and action cards. Your team will also get a number of Artifact cards, depending on how many people are playing.\nFlip over the top card of the dungeon and start the timer! You now have 5 minutes to defeat every card in the dungeon, and the dungeon boss! (You can keep track using our handy-dandy timer app, too!)\n\nDoor cards come in three varieties: Monster, Obstacle, and Person. Most of the time you can defeat a Door Card by matching the symbols on the card. Sometimes, though, you'll want to use an action card, like Fireball, which can instantly defeat a Monster.\nThere are no turns, and anyone can play the cards needed to defeat the Dungeon Card. But be careful, any card played is gone forever, so play smart!\nSometimes your party will come across a Curse. These pesky cards affect the whole party right away and stay active for the rest of the dungeon... unless you can find a way to get rid of them, that is.\nAfter you\u2019ve dealt with all the door cards, it\u2019s time to take on the big boss himself\u2014the Baby Barbarian! Bosses take a lot more resources to defeat than any door card.\n\nWe're partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information at the end of the campaign.\nWhen the campaign ends, you'll receive a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. As part of this survey, you'll have your choice of the following add-ons:\nUPGRADE YOUR BOX: If you pledged at the Expansion or Expansion + KS Booster levels, you'll be offered a chance to upgrade your small expansion box to the larger curses box for $CDN 5. This is a perfect option if you really like the new box design, or if you like to put your cards in sleeves and you want the new tray with extra space for cards! No need to buy the game again... just upgrade your box! (Note: This upgrade is not a limited quantity item.)\nADD ON A BIG BOX: After the campaign ends, if there are any Big Box games left, each backer may add one additional Big Box to their pledge at the regular price ($50 CDN) for no additional shipping cost!\nADD ON MORE EXPANSIONS: Each backer can pledge for additional copies of the Expansion or Expansion + KS Booster editions at the regular price and at a reduced shipping rate of only $2 CDN per game!

Foiled Again! we will be adding a new voice and new music to the timer app!\nIt\u2019s available for iOS, Android, and Windows devices, and best of all, it\u2019s completely free!\nWe are partnering with depots in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes being charged to you. Shipping to areas outside these regions may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before placing an order.\nIn order to keep costs down and reduce the potential for errors, we cannot split orders to ship to multiple delivery locations.

Featuring characters from SpongeBob Squarepants, Invader Zim, Hey Arnold!, and Rugrats!\nIn Splat Attack, players will take control of a team of 4 characters, grab a hand of food cards, and load up their team with Cool Points. Cool Points range in value from 0 to 3 points, and can be stolen from your characters when they get hit with food! However, additional Cool Points can be collected by reaching key locations on the game board.\nWhen hit with food, splat tokens must be placed on the defending character. Placing these tokens strategically will be key to your success, as your character's grid space is limited. Once a character's grid is fill, the character is splatted and out of the game.\nPlayers that are able to get the last hit in and splat a character, earn a golden Cool Point. Once the last golden Cool Point is taken, the game ends, and all players add up their Cool Points to determine a winner.\nEach team is fighting to have the most Cool Points at the end of a Food Fight!  \nEach turn, you can activate two different characters, and those characters can each perform two actions.   \nA MOVE action allows a character to move a number of spaces equal to their SPEED rating.  \nA GATHER Action allows a character to draw 2 food cards and pick up any Cool Point tokens they find in their space!  \nA THROW action allows a character to throw food at a rival character! Some Food cards have special effects and abilities! \nYou can Throw food at any opponent within your Range. Roll a number of dice equal to that food card\u2019s Splat Rating plus your character\u2019s Aim Rating. \nIf you roll at least 1 Hit Result the throw hits the target! Your target must pull a splatter tile from the bag matching the food card\u2019s splat rating. \nThe target must place that splatter tile on their character grid. They must cover 1 space for each hit result the throwing character rolled.  \nThen, take 1 Cool Point token from the target. However, if the target\u2019s grid is completely full, or they can\u2019t fit the tile on their grid, the target is SPLAT and you gain a SUPER Cool Point token instead!    \nOnce the last Super Cool point token is claimed, the game ends! The player with the most points at the end wins!  \nGame play tips from game designer Jonathan Ying:\nNickeoldeon's Splat Attack is a frantic game of throwing food and scoring points, but there can be a method to the madness if you can play strategically. Given that it\u2019s a free for all game it can often be a wise course of action to focus on not making too many enemies or being perceived as too great a threat! The last thing you want is to have other players teaming up against you.\nTemporary alliances can be very useful if you can get your rivals to work with you to take down a player who seems to be running away with the game. Many characters have special abilities that allow them to assist their teammates, like how Phoebe can use her ability to protect her friends. But remember, you can also use her ability to help out a character on a different team to prevent another opponent from scoring or perhaps as leverage to discourage the player you helped from attacking you in the future!\nBe wary of stacking up Danger tokens, they allow you to perform some pretty incredible feats, but they make your character a much juicier target! Also, when you take a hit from an opponent who is behind, it might be a good idea to let them take a danger token or two from your grid. That way they won't ALL go to the player who ends up splatting you!\nCharacter and Team play tips from Jonathan Ying:\nYou should learn your team\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and position accordingly. Each character has a number of unique abilities that can synergize in interesting ways. For example, Arnold\u2019s ability to allow his allies to perform additional actions is very useful when both Helga and Gerald can do unique tricks when they Throw food.\nBefitting a seasoned fry-cook, Spongebob Squarepants is a versatile character who can both move fast and draw food cards quickly for his team, Meanwhile, Sandy is a dangerous opponent in close quarters with her mastery of Kay-Rah-Tay. Use Patrick\u2019s ability to shove rival characters closer to Sandy and use Squidward\u2019s bad luck to your advantage by having him soak up splatter tiles and keep his allies fresh for longer.\nThose Rugrats are always finding their way into crazy adventures! Tommy\u2019s bonus action is an incredibly useful tool for giving his team an edge, he\u2019s the only character who can reliably perform THREE attacks in a given round. To supplement his otherwise low skill ratings (I mean, to be fair, he\u2019s one year old.) Suzie can use her ability to assist in his mobility while Angelica can steal food from nearby characters!\nZim\u2019s team is all about hitting hard and causing chaos for their opponents. GIR is the fastest character in the game and can charge into the enemy ranks while Zim, Dib and Gaz throw a barrage of snack foods into the mix. You\u2019ll want to get Zim into position quickly so he can perform his bonus attacks at the end of your turn, meanwhile Dib requires some careful play to tempo his unique action economy. Gaz is your trump card, she\u2019s a solid character for your backline but after she\u2019s taken a few hits and lost her Cool (points) she\u2019ll go berserk and wreak havoc with incredibly high mobility, range, and accuracy!\nPLEASE NOTE: All backers that have selected retailer pledges will be required to have to provide our fulfillment hub with a store address in order to recieve their pledge.  \nHey Arnold! - Character Art\nRugrats - Character Art\nSpongeBob SquarePants - Character Art\nInvader Zim - Character Art\n Game Designer - Jonathan Ying\nJonathan Ying is a game designer and author currently operating out of San Diego California.

Sprawlopolis is growing and YOU are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center, it\u2019s you.  \nIn Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice.\n\nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.  \nIn this game, you will try to keep Parks away from the edges, line up lots of  Commercial blocks in a row or column, and create roads that connect your Parks.   \nBut not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.  \nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible.   \nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.   \nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap, so each road will cost you points in the end.   \nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.   \nCan you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\nSprawlopolis is the next game in our ongoing Wallet Line. Simply 18 cards and rules, packed into a small wallet for maximum portability.\nWe sent out a handful of review copies and the reviews are glowing.

But watch out!  This region of space is populated with dangerous meteors that frequently hit the planets.  So you are not only racing your opponents, but also the meteors.\nCosmic Run: Regeneration is a turn based game for 1-4 players.  You begin a turn by rolling 6 dice. After the roll, you must assign at least 1 die to planets (to move ships), alien cards (to recruit the aliens), or to your tech card (to gain crystals).  After assigning, you may re-roll any unassigned dice. All of the locations have different assignment requirements, so you must choose which kind of strategy to employ: Do you push your luck to try to move up more valuable planet tracks or play conservatively by placing dice on less valuable tracks? Do you recruit aliens who will help you score points and grant special powers? When should you spend your crystals? It is a game that is not only easy to understand, but contains many interesting decisions.\nA strong selling point is that the game can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo.  Each of the variants have been fully developed and all offer a compelling gaming experience.\nCosmic Run: Regeneration was co-designed by Steve Finn and his two sons, Seamus and Orion. Seamus contributed greatly to the original version (published a couple years ago) and Orion helped with the development of the newly revised co-op game.  Seamus and Orion also play tested and made adjustments based on the play test sessions.\nAll backers receiving a copy of Cosmic Run: Regeneration through this campaign will receive the Allies Expansion at no additional cost inside their copy of the game. This expansion pack includes 6 ally cards (plus 2 instruction cards) that add an interesting twist by giving players special powers.  Each ally card has an icon with a die, numbered from 1 to 6. At the end of a player's turn, the player recruits the ally whose number matches the yellow die.  The player may then use the ally on future turns until another player recruits the ally.\nCosmic Run: Regeneration is a highly revised version of a previously Kickstarted game, Cosmic Run. Here's a quick description of the major differences between Cosmic Run: Regeneration (CR:R) and the original Cosmic Run (CR).\nCR:R has a tri-fold board showing 6 planet tracks. CR had 5 individual planet track boards. The 6th planet track has a new mechanism for movement based upon the number of pips on a newly added yellow die. \nCR:R uses \"meteor cards\" to determine meteor strikes, as opposed to a dice roll. This cuts down on the randomness of meteor strikes and ensures a timely game end. \nCR:R includes a new alien race, the Dahas. They allow a player to take a turn with an extra die. \nIn CR:R all alien cards are 1x use. Players no longer need to rotate cards. Also, alien cards are \"retired\" during the game to score points, instead of scoring at game end. Sets of cards score fewer points as they are turned in, so there is a race to retire aliens early, adding more excitement and decision-making to scoring points with aliens. \nThe Monashians now all have the same power, i.e., the power of a virtual die. This streamlines the card powers, making it easier to play. \nIn CR:R, Infodere tokens replace the crystal tokens. Some of these are placed on the board and players can acquire them as they move up tracks, making for more interesting movement decisions. Infodere tokens are also gained by Infodere aliens (similar to CR's crystal tokens for Infoderes). \nMuch of the graphic design elements are updated. \nThe tech card now just collects crystals, so players do not need to move a marker on the tech card. \nThe cooperative game has been seriously improved with the use of tool cards and many new rules. \nThe solo game has also been improved with new rules. \nCR:R will be a bigger game in a larger box too. \nThere are some other minor rule changes as well. Watch this video if interested. \nNote that the cover artwork has changed since these videos were made. Also, the videos may reference another game, Waters of Nereus, which was originally planned to be Kickstarted at the same time as this game, but that game will be Kickstarted in the late fall of 2018.\nThe following is not a review, but a play through by the Painted Meeple.\n VIDEO OF COOPERATIVE GAME\nThe following is not a review, but a video of a co-op version of the game played by the designers.\nShipping Information\nDr. Finn's Games offers \"flat rate\" shipping, so you pay one price for shipping regardless of the number of games. The rate is based on location.\nCustoms Information \nU.S./Canadian/U.K. Backers: The games will be shipped to you from your respective country, so no duties will be required.\nE.U. backers:  The games are shipped from the U.K.  As of now, this means you would not pay any duties either.  However, due to Brexit negotiations, it is possible this might change before the time of shipping (though perhaps not?).  \nAll others: The games will ship from the U.S. and you may be responsible for paying import duties and other taxes.\n\u2022 Get a fun game by a highly regarded game designer. All of Dr. Finn's games receive glowing reviews from members of the board gaming community.\n\u2022 Receive the Allies expansion at no additional charge. The Allies expansion pack is included inside the copies of the game received by backers of this campaign.\n\u2022 Help bring this game to existence. If this campaign does not fund, the game very likely will not be made.\n\u2022 No post-Kickstarter bargain prices. You will not find Dr. Finn's games on sale at online retailers a week (or even months) after a Kickstarter campaign because I do not sell my games to them. I do have my own sales, but I usually wait until the game has been published for a while to do so.\n\u2022 Great add on prices. This campaign provides an opportunity to get multiple Dr. Finn's games at a great bundle price. Check out the various levels to see the great deals. You can also add games to customize your rewards.\n\u2022 Support an independent game designer. Dr. Finn's Games is not a big company and will only continue with successful crowdfunding campaigns.\nFind out more about the combo games by following these links:\nC.O.G.            Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire         Foragers   \nLittle Flower Shop         Sunset Over Water\nThis campaign offers a great opportunity to pick up other great games from Dr. Finn's Games for 1 flat rate shipping price. If you're interested, there are two ways to do so.\nDURING THE CAMPAIGN: Decide which games you would like to add, calculate the amount and add it to your pledge. After the campaign, you will use a survey to inform Dr. Finn's Games of your add-on choices.\nAFTER THE CAMPAIGN: you can wait until the campaign is over, then decide to add additional items at that time.\nLIMITED QUANTITIES WARNING: It is possible, though unlikely, that some of the add on games are oversold during the campaign and backers may not receive some of the add on games requested. In this case, backers would receive a full refund on any add on items not received. Although this is very unlikely, it is a possibility.\n*Note: There is a 4-player and a 5-player version of the Little Flower Shop.\nPROMO PACKS AVAILABLE AFTER THE CAMPAIGN\nThrough the pledge manager, after the campaign, backers will be able to order special promotional packs for some of Dr. Finn's older games, such as those for Capo dei Capi and Institute for Magical Arts. Sorry, but promo packs are not available for Herbaceous or Sunset Over Water (as those are no published by Dr. Finn's Games).\nSPECIAL OFFERS AFTER THE CAMPAIGN\nDuring this campaign, Dr. Finn will be doing an inventory count of his older games, which are not listed above. Such games may be offered as a late add-on at discounted prices.  Also, such games as Herbaceous, Sunset Over Water, and Biblios may also be offered.\nDr. Finn's Games publishes the games of Steve Finn, an independent game designer. Dr. Finn's Games relies heavily on funds raised during Kickstarter campaigns and direct sales to individuals. Thus, your support in this campaign is greatly appreciated.\nReviews of Dr. Finn\u2019s Games have been overwhelmingly positive. In one of his many reviews of a Dr. Finn's game, Richard Ham (\u201dRahdo Runs Through\u201d) dubbed Dr. Finn the \u201cKing of the Filler.\u201d In addition to Cosmic Run: Regeneration, other games from Dr. Finn's are available to backers of this project. Many of these games are low in stock, with reprints very unlikely for a long time, if at all. So, if you're interested in other Dr. Finn's Games, now is a great time to pick them up.\nBoardgamegeek.com is a great place to do research on Dr. Finn's Games. Click on the name to go to the BGG page: Biblios, Biblios Dice, Butterfly Garden, Capo dei Capi, Cosmic Run, Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire, Foragers, Herbaceous, The Institute for Magical Arts, Let Them Eat Shrimp, The Little Flower Shop, Slush Fund 2, Sunset Over Water.\nMost of the artwork of Cosmic Run: Regeneration comes from the original Cosmic Run, which was illustrated by Lawrence van der Merwe. Lawrence provided two new illustrations for this game: the artwork for the cover and the Daha alien card.\nSebastian Koziner is a graphic designer who has worked with Dr. Finn's Games on many projects and he's done a great job updating the graphic design of this game and using the old artwork to create the game board. His wife, Rocio Og\u00f1enovich, made the main campaign video. Together, they operate OK Art Studio.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease read carefully before backing this project.\n\nDELIVERY AND PAX UNPLUGGED\nThe game is likely to be manufactured by November and delivered in December. However, it is possible that Dr Finn receives the games in October or early November, which would mean this would be in time for PAX Unplugged. In all previous campaigns, Dr Finn has ensured that backers are the first people to receive the games. However, in this particular case, Dr Finn may wish to show and sell the game at PAX Unplugged, which is usually the only major convention Dr Finn's Games has a booth at. Ideally, the game could be manufactured, shipped and delivered to all backers before this (though this is unlikely). It's also unlikely to have the game for PAX Unplugged. But, if Dr Finn does have it in time, he hopes backers will understand the need for his small business to take advantage of the convention's size to help publicize this game. Also, backers will be allowed to pick up games at PAX Unplugged (if available). This is all speculation and, if too many backers think this is wrong, Dr Finn will not sell the game at PAX.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS \nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the packs will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threat in this regard concerns quality control over the manufacturing. A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced good results on card projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nIf you receive any rewards that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the item arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS \nRefunds are not usually given, unless there is a failure to deliver the games you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nLOW QUANTITY ALERT \nSome Dr. Finn's games are getting low in stock and it is not feasible to track add-on items during the campaign. It is possible (but unlikely) that there is not enough of a particular game to fulfill all rewards. If this happens, you will be refunded all expenses related to adding that item on.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Of course, unexpected things happen and there is chance that the game will not be shipped on time. I will keep you updated if the unexpected happens.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a shipment is returned, it is your responsibility to pay for the re-shipment.\n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the shipping section above.\n\nUPDATES \nAfter this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects. However, such updates will be infrequent.\n\nBy backing this project, you acknowledge and accept the risks and challenges just stated.\n\nThanks!

This year we are excited to expand the Kodama universe with Kodama Duo - a two-player version that utilizes the core mechanics of Kodama - the Decree Phase, a Growing Phase, and a Kodama Phase.  Kodama Duo also expands Kodama to six players, and introduces new draft rules for Kodama.\nKodama Duo is a two-player version of Kodama: The Tree Spirits. You will grow a tree by placing branch cards in clever arrangements, making a happy home for your Kodama! \nKodama Duo is a card placement game for 2 players that plays in 30 minutes. Players will turn over one Decree card per season to set the unique conditions. During the Growing Phase, players take turns revealing branch cards and splitting them into two piles until each player has added four branch cards to their tree. In the Kodama phase, players will each choose one of their Kodama to score and live in their tree. The game lasts 3 seasons (12 turns) and whoever cares for their Kodama best will be remembered for generations! \nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Kodama: The Tree Spirits, you can check out the BGG page for more details. Also, follow along on our Kodama Duo BGG page and click the heart to like the game!\nFor more information, we encourage you to view the videos directly below, or simply read our draft rulebook here.\nThere are a couple of cool twists on the original Kodama rules for Duo.\nFirst, instead of a display of branch cards to choose, each turn one player (the splitter) will reveal three branch cards from the deck. They will then split those cards into two piles. The other player (the chooser) will select one of the branch piles. The other pile will go to the splitter. Then, both players will add one of the branch cards they received to their tree. The player who received two branch cards will discard the extra card.\nSecond, Duo introduces spirit tokens, which are tokens with the six features from Kodama. After the player that received two branch cards discards one, the other player receives a spirit token from the discarded branch card. They pick one of the features from that card and take the corresponding spirit token. That player then places that token over one of the icons on their tree. This allows interesting scoring interactions as feature chains can be shortened or lengthened to increase the scoring potential for future branch placements.\nAdditionally, most of the new Kodama cards and Decree cards interact with the spirit tokens and splitter/chooser mechanic. All of these changes provide an interesting twist on the core mechanics you already love about Kodama.\nDuo also introduces the ability to play Kodama: the Tree Spirits with six players. With this update, we've included new rules for branch selection. Each player will secretly choose from four branch cards simultaneously in a draft format. Players will also be allowed to place and score their branch cards simultaneously. This will shorten the downtime that could have been added by including more players.\nHere Rahdo reviews Kodama Duo:\nIf you aren't familiar with Kodama - Have Rodney from Watch It Played show you how to play!\nWe know that some backers want more than one copy of a reward level. To do this, you will need to 1) pledge at the highest level from which you want the rewards, and 2) add to your pledge amount based on the add-on chart (ie, you don\u2019t have to add shipping cost for each item, just the first which Kickstarter does automatically). For full details on how to add-on items to your pledge, check out the chart located below. \nWe are going to use a pledge manager for this project. That means you can add to your pledge amount after the project is completed, however we highly recommend that you pledge for everything that you want to receive through Kickstarter. In order to get games to you as quickly as possible, the window for the pledge manager will be very short. \nTo change your pledge amount during the campaign, click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the top of this page.\nThen, click \u201cChange your Pledge\u201d enter the new pledge amount and click \u201cContinue.\u201d The tricky part is that you\u2019ll need to calculate the total pledge amount on your own and won\u2019t get an immediate confirmation of what you have added. This has to be done before the project ends (10pm pacific, Thursday, May 31st). We will get all the details we need from you when we send the project surveys out (we need to get the information quickly in order to send the right number of games and add-ons to their fulfillment centers). \nKodama Duo is the 43rd project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 42 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nKodama Duo was designed by the talented Daniel Solis, the same designer of Kodama: The Tree Spirits. \nThis game has been blind tested, in addition to being tested in-house, ensuring that every part of the game is of the best possible quality. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. Prices include US shipping. \nThis project is also EU & Canadian friendly.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Indie Boards and Cards on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more! \nINNER SPIRIT: (Pledge $19 or more) One copy of Kodama Duo with all of the stretch goals.

We will not be taking reservations as in years past, everything will be first come, first served at Essen. If you would like to get the rewards from this project, we suggest you back through kickstarter!\nWhile our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out well before Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.\nIf you still want to try Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 43rd Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Kodama:Duo will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has two previous kickstarter projects from earlier this year that have already funded that have not sent out rewards. Those projects are scheduled to be delivered in October of 2018. We have had multiple projects ongoing in each of the past five years, so are confident that this will not cause delays to those projects or this one.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY \nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. \nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "INNER SPIRIT", "descp": "One copy of Kodama Duo: Kindred Spirits with all of the stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,093 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 34 or more", "title": "SHAPESHIFTERS", "descp": "One copy of Kodama Duo: Kindred Spirits with all of the stretch goals and one copy of Kodama: The Tree Spirits.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["209 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 34 or more", "title": "RAY OF LIGHT", "descp": "One copy of Kodama Duo: Kindred Spirits with all of the stretch goals and one copy of Kokoro.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["157 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 47 or more", "title": "KINDRED SPIRITS", "descp": "One copy of Kodama Duo: Kindred Spirits with all of the stretch goals, one copy of Kodama: The Tree Spirits, and one copy of Kokoro.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["236 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Catch the Tree Spirits Before It's Too Late!

To take a Main Street action, a player must choose from the communal Main Street cards, and place the required number of pennies on the open action space. The player then carries out the effect of that card. Possible actions include purchasing a building (Masons' Guild), moving a citizen into a job vacancy (The Gazette), rearranging buildings (Tower), or claiming the Mayor meeple to become the new 1st player (Town Hall).\nEight \"Main Street\" cards have action spaces to place pennies or citizens.

Do you like them? Do you even know them? What are they doing right now? Wouldn't it be nice not to have any? Or, are they there when you need to borrow something?\nWell, you might like them, or you might not. But one thing is certain. You probably would not appreciate it if they stepped into your garden when you're away on holiday and try to mess with it, right?\nThis, and managing his bee population is what Mr. Cabbagehead has to deal with in between holidays, when he is planting his garden in anticipation of the Garden Committee's visit.\nJoin us in creating this beautiful game full of victorian-era illustrations, some of which are not pleasantly disturbing. Join us in Mr. Cabbahead's Garden!\nMr. Cabbagehead's garden is a simple, yet sometimes frustratingly challenging game. It is designed by Todd Sanders, who was inspired by a day spent in the library looking at books of victorian seed catalogs that featured some very quirky anthropomorphic vegetables\nCombining his love of gardening and his passion for unconventional game design, he created a game to match the style of these lovable curmudgeons that beckoned Victorians to garden.\nMr. Cabbagehead's Garden was first released as a solo-play-only Print & Play that quickly intrigued gamers on BoardGameGeek, and has been played and enjoyed as such since 2016.\nSince then Todd has continuously refined the game, and after a period of development within LudiCreations, we are pleased to be able to present it for a high-quality print run, as befits a game as iconic as this.\nImprovements include rules for 2 players, a rebalancing of point values, a clarification of the flow of the game and an update of the graphic design. Combined with endowing it with high quality materials such as linen-finished cards and cardboard, the boxed commercial release of Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden is something we are very proud to bring to you.  \nIn doing so, we would like to complete Todd's vision and offer game new content. This includes The New Neighbours, 6 new tiresome busybodies who can't wait to mess with Mr. C's beautiful garden. It also includes the Grasshopper expansion, and the Romancing Eudora expansion.\nAll cardboard is 2 mm thick, and all cards are 320 gsm. All surfaces are linen-finished.\n We have partnered with Dogmight, your friendly local viking berserker woodworkers to bring you something they are clearly crazy enough and talented enough to even dare to make:\nThe ultra-deluxe custom-made wooden Prestige Box\n For more details, please check out this backer update!\nIn Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden you will be planting your garden in a 3 x 6 grid of Vegetable cards. In each of the game's 3 rounds there is a Planting phase and a Neighbour phase.\nIn the Planting phase, you draw 3 cards from the deck of Vegetables. You plant one in the garden grid, and then draw Neighbour tokens according to the values of the other two cards.\nIn the Neighbour phase, the Neighbour with the most matching tokens is the one who visits and interferes with the garden, removing or moving Vegetable cards.\nAt the end of the game, the garden is ready for evaluation. The more vegetables of the same kind you have, the better! And if you really want the coveted Blue Ribbon, you better arrange them in aestheticallly pleasing patterns!\nFor more detail, here's Bebo with a rules overview:\nEach of the included expansions also adds something, ranging from a huge jump in variability with the 6 New Neighbours, to an increase in difficulty with the Grasshoppers and a modular bonus possibilities with Romancing Eudora. All that and more are explained in the rules linked below.\nAs usual, we offer you the chance to try the game before you back the campaign. The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\nYou can download the rules of the game here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026).

The game has been developed over a period of years, both in its graphic design and in the values of various cards and scoring bonuses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnApjD6C8zw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYYm7vxogc\nRunthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24hexXxlaY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICW4QfIRUy0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKOWvolaC60\nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. Todd is well known as a designer of solo board games. Many of his games have already been published, including IUNU and They Who Were 8, the first two in the Sanders Select Series of games by Ludicreations.\nEven though Todd has been designing games for several years, he has never been at Spiel. This, even after 2 of his games have debuted there. Travel & accommodation there are not cheap, as we have certainly experienced in the past few years.\nGiven that this year Todd expects to see at least 2 more games being published and shown there, we wanted to do what we can so he can get to Essen, and with your help we hope to cover some of his expenses.\nIf you would like to contribute and get some really special rewards prepared by Todd, simply pledge at the $34 level. Todd and we would be very, very grateful for your support!\nThe special rewards include:\nA postcard from by Todd, signed & sent to you!\nA special promo Neighbour for Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden. This will be designed in full view of backers of that level. We do not like exclusives, but if we sell it later, we will give profits to Todd.\n5 Daily vlogs from Essen, right from the exhibitor floor, and possibly some other places too! Probably not live, since the connection there is terrible.\nPlaying a game with Todd! Quite a few of Todd's games are on Tabletopia, and they are free to play. At some point or another, Todd will play a game with you, either one-on-one or as part of a group. This would have to be up to Todd's availability and time zone issues. LudiCreations games on Tabletopia are free to play!\nPlease note that there is always the possibility that due to any unforeseen circumstances, Todd does not make it to Essen. If that happens, we will still be able to fulfill the above in the best way we can. Postcards can still be sent, promos made, vlogging from Todd might be from his design space, and Tabletopia is still happening as it normally would.\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, and the rewards bound for EU and other countries from Germany. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 16 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 19 USD / 25 CAD / 25 AUD / 19 CHF / 2101 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained.\nUnfortunately, we are not able to make bulk shipments.\nWe are not able to ship to some countries during the campaign. If your country does not appear on the list after you click the reward in which you are interested, please send us a message via KS.\nThe Prestige Box will be shipped separately from the game material, from the USA. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees related to it.\nThe shipping cost for the game is 5 USD worldwide.\nThe shipping costs for the Prestige Box are:\nUSA: 12 USD\nCanada: 25 USD\nOther countries: 35 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We already go to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nRetail availability: We have no idea. This is a weird game. Past experience shows that this type of game rarely finds its way to stores, but we can not make any guarantees either way.\nSPIEL availability: We intend to sell the game at the SPIEL trade fair in Essen. We do not yet know the price, but we are confident we will have very few copies there.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\n Game design, graphic design, visual identity: Todd Sanders\nTabletopia implementation: Viktor Csete\nAudiovisual support: Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen\nSpecial Thanks: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou, Brittanie \"Bebo\" Boe, Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan, those Victorian illustrators, and many, many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll 2017 campaigns have been fulfilled. The CRISIS: The New Economy campaign is in the production phase. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know. Informal currency conversions made on this campaign may not be accurate by the time you read this, and therefore result in seemingly cheaper prices further in the future. Warning: Please practice safe gardening. Avoid sticking sharp tools into any squishy things, even if they deserved it those bastards who keep stealing m- your vegetables. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this game are fictitious, maybe.

Harness the power of the wind to push the blaze towards the other towers, clear tracts of land to fortify your tower, hinder the plans of your opponents with torrents of water, and unleash an arsenal of fire cards upon your foes.

Although the core mechanics are easy to grasp, an ever-shifting environment forces players to switch up their tactics and experiment with varied strategies, making Fire Tower a difficult game to master and each play-through a fresh experience.\n                                          EASY TO LEARN\nWe made sure Fire Tower's rules were simple and easy to learn, so that you can start playing within minutes of opening the box. Below is a brief overview of how to play the game. For a more detailed explanation watch our 5 1/2 minute How To Play video above (stop motion animation!) or follow the link to our rules. \nTHE BASICS \nYour turn has two steps:\n1. The wind spreads the blaze. Choose one empty space orthagonally adjacent (not touching diagonally) to another fire gem or the eternal flame (the fire marked at the center of the board) and place a gem on it.\nIf the wind is heading east, you must place a fire gem to the east of another fire gem or the eternal flame.\n2. Take action from your tower. Either play one of the five action cards in your hand or discard as many cards as you want and redraw up to your hand size. Find out more about the different types of cards below. \nHARNESS THE POWER OF THE WIND \nYou may play Wind Cards to do one of three actions: change the direction of the wind to the direction shown on the card, roll the wind die in hopes of a better wind direction, or place one fire gem in the direction indicated on the card.\nWind cards allow you to choose one of three actions.\nSPREAD THE BLAZE  \nWe told you this game is competitive! Play Fire Cards to spread the blaze towards your opponents. Place the fire gems on the board in the pattern indicated at the bottom of each card. The fire can be placed anywhere, as long as at least one gem is touching the eternal flame or previously existing fire gems on the board.\nOne example of a fire card is the burning snag, a falling burning tree that creates a square of four gems.\nEXTINGUISH THE FLAMES  \nFeel the heat? Use Water Cards to remove some of the fire gems from the board in the pattern shown at the bottom of the card.\nThe smokejumper, one type of water card, allows you to choose a fire gem and remove fire gems from the eight spaces around it. The center gem must remain on the board.\nBUILD FIREBREAKS  \nNeed more permanent defenses? Firebreak Cards allow you to build firebreaks (purple tokens), areas devoid of vegetation that the fire cannot go on or pass through. They can only be removed using the De/Reforestation card. Quick note: Firebreaks cannot be built orthogonally adjacent to any previously existing firebreaks on the board.\nOne type of firebreak card, the dozer line, blocks the fire from passing through.\nBEWARE THE FIRESTORM  \nBurn, baby, burn! The Firestorm Card comes up once per deck cycle. It must be played as soon as it is drawn, regardless of turn order. Once it is played, roll the wind die and place a fire gem orthogonally adjacent to every fire gem on the board in the direction the die indicates. At this point, every player has a chance to discard and redraw as many cards as they want from the deck.\nIf the wind die rolls west, you must place a fire gem west of all fire gems on the board, and the eternal flame.\nPROTECT YOUR TOWER \nYour fire tower is made up of the nine colored spaces in your corner of the board. You may not use water cards or build firebreaks in this area. Once the fire has breached your tower, your only recourse is your Bucket Card (every player gets one bucket for the game). You can toss it out the window in an attempt to save yourself from the flames. But if the fire comes back, watch out! This time you don't have a bucket to save you. \nThe only way to remove fire from your tower is by using your bucket card.\nTAKE DOWN YOUR OPPONENTS   \nOnce the fire reaches the back corner of your tower (outlined in orange), you are eliminated from the game. Hand your cards to the player who finished you off. Everyone now plays with an additional card, and a firestorm immediately takes place. But don't worry! The way this fire is raging, it'll just be a matter of minutes\u2014maybe even seconds\u2014before the other towers burn down and you can start your next game.\nEliminate opponents by reaching the back corner square, outlined in orange.\nLast tower standing wins the game!  \nTEAM VARIANT\nIn the team variant, players sit diagonally across from their partners. The first team to burn both of their opponents' towers wins. All players remain in the game until the end, regardless of whether or not their tower burns down. This is an alternative to player elimination in the Free For All version.\nWatch our two player play through video >\nUnlocked!!!

Both of us grew up playing board games and designing games for fun. We have spent the past three years working tirelessly on Fire Tower, not only because we want to give you a high quality, beautiful, and fun game, but because we want to lay the groundwork for a real business. We know exactly how we will manufacture our game and every detail about fulfillment and shipping. We've gone to 15 conventions and countless game nights, playing our game over and over to ensure that it is exactly the product you want. We've listened to your advice, and we've been fine tuning our product since day one. \nWhy now? \nWe are offering Fire Tower at a discounted rate for the duration of this Kickstarter. After the campaign is over, the price will go up. Plus, your support now goes towards funding this project and reaching stretch goals to make it even better!\nWhat makes it unique? \nOkay, we are the ONLY competitive forest fire game (that we know of). But that's not all. Fire Tower has such unique mechanics that in the hundreds and hundreds of games we've played, no one ever says to us, \"Your game is just like ______.\" Considering all the games on the market right now, we are very happy about that.\nHere's a few other points we think are pretty neat:\nThe artwork. If you're familiar with Kevin Ruelle's fine art, you already know that we lucked out having him as our artist. If you don't know, check out some of his work here. \nEasy to learn. Fire Tower takes about 5 minutes to learn. Don't believe us? Watch our How to Play video above and get back to us.\nLots of pictures. Each card includes a grid that visually explains the ways it can be used, saving new players from having to constantly refer to the rule book. \nEasy to set up. \"Let's play Fire Tower,\" you say. One minute later, you're playing. No special placement of tokens, separating cards into several piles, nothing. \nThe fire gems. They are just really fun to hold. And they look like candy. And you get 135 of them in every single game. We know you are thinking of buying more copies because you want to fill a bathtub with those gems. Don't let us stop you. \nThe variations. Gwen likes this game best with two players. Sam likes it best with four. Looking for heavier strategy? Try the team variant or the two player version. Want to trick your friends into thinking you're the nice guy while you plot to burn down their towers? Play the three or four player \"Free for All\" version. Add chaos with the Firestorm. The games feel different, even though the mechanics are simple to learn. \nLastly, this game is just plain fun. We've personally played Fire Tower more than 1000 times, and we still enjoy it. That's some serious replayability.\nFor a copy of the game for $39, back our project at the Fire Fighter tier. Looking for more?

For large quantities of games (group pledges), please contact us at runawayparade@gmail.com with your quantity and location, and we will get back to you right away with costs.  \nSOLD OUT - Sam Bryant, co-designer of Fire Tower and talented woodworker, will handcraft and hand finish four wooden buckets to add to your game, one for each player to use in place of their bucket card.

And thank you to our incredibly supportive friends and family, and the many game designers, publishers, reviewers, etc. who have helped us throughout this process. We couldn't have done this without you!\nKickstarter has been a huge part of the renaissance that board games are currently going through, and we are thrilled to be a part of that. The fact that Kickstarter provides an avenue for designers to print their product is a dream come true. $8,000, our funding goal, is simply the amount of money it costs to manufacture a minimum print run of our game and get it to your mailbox. We are not paying ourselves for the time we've put in, or any costs that we have incurred up to this point. We just want to be able to get Fire Tower onto your table, and we hope you have as much fun with it as we've had.  \nThanks so much for checking out Fire Tower! If this is your first Kickstarter and you haven't backed before, follow these simple steps: \n1. Click on the pledge level you'd like to back. For the base game, choose Fire Fighter. If you would like to donate money without a reward, click the \"Back this project\" button at the top of the page and choose to pledge without a reward. You can also choose a pledge tier and choose to pay more than the actual tier, either for extra copies or for no additional reward. \n2. You will be prompted to enter your email address, and then click \"continue as a guest.\"\n3. Fill out your payment information as requested and click \"Pledge.\" \nThat's it!

The game features highly detailed miniatures and the Modular Deck System (MDS) introduced in Street Masters. In the game, players take on the role of heroic cops inspired by classic action movies and are tasked with protecting the city from the recent rise in criminal activity. Each game is dictated by the chosen criminal deck and case deck. These decks are modular and the different combinations of decks create unique experiences each game.\nThe game is played on a beautifully illustrated board of the city, where the cops must run or drive to various locations and bust up crimes. While cops start the game with a standard issue B.C.P.D. Cruiser, they can also commandeer many other types of vehicles on the streets of Brook City.\nEach cop in Brook City plays differently thanks to each having their own unique cop deck. Cop decks include encounter cards, ability cards, and tactic cards to represent each cop\u2019s unique strengths and strategy to take on the criminals underworld.\nWhile the cops try to crack the case, their prime suspect is represented by the criminal deck. Each criminal deck contains at least 1 suspect card, as well as a slew of crime cards that spawn crew members around the city to interfere with your detective work. If cops ignore these criminal masterminds while trying to pin the crime on them, things may just get seriously out of hand\u2026\nCase decks represent the cops\u2019 overall goal of the game. While keeping the criminal under control, they must also concentrate on working their way through the case. Each case has special rules governing how cops can interact with clue cards and get their hands on enough evidence to bring the criminal to justice. In addition to clue cards, case decks include a variety of events that are designed to hinder the cops or punish them for not making enough progress solving the case.\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word on how the game plays. Please click HERE to read a draft of the rulebook.\nBrook City features a variety of highly detailed miniatures, which are used to mark the location of the cops, criminals, and crew throughout the city. With our experience producing miniatures in our previous game, Street Masters, we are confident in the level of detail and overall quality of the miniatures that will be in this game. While we were extremely happy with the miniatures in Street Masters, we learned some tricks to improve them even more for Brook City.\n         Blacklist Games is committed to publishing only high quality games. Please watch this video of Adam and Brady unboxing a production copy of Street Masters:\nAs you can see from the video, great care was taken to ensure every component was of the best quality possible. Backers of this campaign can feel confident that the same amount of care and attention to detail will be taken with Brook City as well.\nLike many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room to pool into stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as we possibly can.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Following, is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. ($30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $15-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland and Israel. $45 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to that we will not ship to these areas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaign for Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom, we've taken what we've learned from production, shipping and fulfillment to strive for an even smoother experience from start to finish, continuing to focus on overall quality.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts from the Kickstarter, production, manufacture, to fulfillment, then distribution. Timing seems to be one of the biggest obstacles in many campaigns, especially from small, indie publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can be; we have strong relations with the factory/manufacture; we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on; we are completely passionate about our games; and most important, we care about our backers.\n\nWe also understand there may still be confusion about our first campaign, as it was a card game that we cancelled. It didn't receive the momentum it needed due to us purchasing the rights from a publisher that has not had much luck in the industry. Currently we're developing an app for the game and tightening up some of the original rules and cards in order to release it under our brand at a future date.

By coming to work early and making use of your full pantry of supplies, you will earn money, customer reviews, and critical acclaim. With a little luck, you might win out over your rivals and be crowned Star Baker!  \nFiller combines many of the ingredients that have made Green Couch Games a treat to bring to the table. Easy-to-learn rules mixed with a quick playtime and playful appearance makes Filler a great game for families of casual gamers or connoisseurs looking to pass the time waiting for more guests to arrive. In the game, players will use multi-use cards and a blend of simultaneous action selection, time and resource management, set-collection, and hand-building to collect ingredients needed to fill tasty pastries on their way to becoming the Star Baker. \nStarting with a hand of 3 cards with various start times and basic ingredients, players will choose a card to reveal along with other players to determine the turn order. The earliest player to show up for work goes first and so on around the table. Using cards from their hands (Pantry), players may use ingredients they have acquired to Fill recipes from a central row of available cards (Recipe Book) or Restock The Pantry by picking up all of their previously played cards. Each recipe filled will provide new start times and ingredients to use in future rounds and may earn points that are represented by money, customer reviews, or critical acclaim at the end of the game. The availability of bonus points and cards containing special actions help to direct players\u2019 choices in the kitchen, add depth of play, and provide variety and replayability.  \nThis card game crams a lot of sweet delight into its small package. With illustration and graphic design by Claire Donaldson (Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun, Go Nuts For Donuts, Food Truck Champion), Filler will leave players with a mouth-watering desire to play this delicious game again and again.  \nFiller is a game for 1 to 5 players, ages 8 and up and is designed by Jonathan Chaffer of GRUBS (Grand Rapids Unpublished Boardgame Society). This game follows Chaffer\u2019s first game, Stroop, from Grand Gamers Guild. The game plays in 20-30 minutes.\nHere's a quick video from designer, Jonathan Chaffer, teaching how to play Filler:\nFiller consists of a deck of 70 cards and a rulebook in a small box that's great for grabbing on-the-go!\nHere's what folks are saying about this yummy little game!\nGeekyGaymerGuy says:\n                   \"Filler has been an absolute blast to play. We\u2019ve really been impressed with how this card game had been balanced. Just because you have the ingredients to fill a pastry doesn\u2019t mean that you should. The game honestly feels a little like a deck building game as you acquire new cards and cycle through your discard pile to refill your pantry. \" -One Board Family\n\"Is Filler empty calories? Well, yeah, sort of. But like any good treat, it\u2019s not too filling, and it makes up for any lack of depth with smooth, intuitive mechanics and quick, fun gameplay. This one\u2019s a no-brainer; Filler is the sort of game you will throw in your backpack or purse or briefcase and play anywhere with basically anyone. Everyone\u2019s collection\u2019s got room for some Filler.\"-Gameosity\n\"I think Filler delivers exactly what it promises: a nice, short game that may not be a showstopper centerpiece but works perfectly well as a crowd-pleasing snack. If you enjoy casual games (and pastries), Filler just might hit the spot.\"-Jonathan Liu, GeekDad\nTantrum House says:\n                                                                       \"Get the very best donut!\" -Draft Mechanic Podcast\n\"Overall, Filler is a fun little game. It\u2019s designed for a specific niche and I think it hits the mark well though; it\u2019s light and reasonably easy to pick up...I think this occupies the \u201clight game\u201d space a bit more, rubbing elbows with games like Medici: The Card Game, The Fox in the Forest, or Harvest Dice.\" -What's Eric Playing?\nBrian's Got Game says:\nListen to Jason and Jonathan chat about Filler here!\n\"If you\u2019re looking for a game that's quick, simple and fun, then Filler may be your family\u2019s next filler game. If you have a casual gaming crowd that needs an introduction to set collection, then Filler is probably your group's next filler game.\" -Jumbalaya Plays Games\nBearded Meeple says:\n                                       \"In short, Filler is a neat little game that uses multi-use cards in a interesting and unique way.\" -Open Seat Gaming\nDeluxe 15\" by 10\" cloth playmat with rubber backing!\nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Filler that we think you will really appreciate. We'll achieve this by upgrading components and increasing replayability with added game content.  \nWe have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a preview of what's to come with YOUR help:\nShipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.  \nUK and EU copies will be shipping from within the UK with VAT paid!\nNote: International Backers outside of the UK and EU will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package.  \nWe have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the ever-changing rates of the US Postal Service. We must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe understand that shipping to our international friends can be cost prohibitive and that others have found creative ways to mitigate some of this cost. As a small company that handles our own fulfillment, we simply pass our shipping cost on to our backers. In addition, it is our goal to continue to develop our network of awesome international partners that we have worked with to localize Filler for game markets around the world. \nIf you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the First Edition Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! \nRead the SOLO Rules RIGHT HERE!\nThe rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the updated graphic design.  \nThe rules are hosted on BoardGameGeek and will require a free account to download. But if you like games, BGG is the place to be so head over there now to get plugged into the world-wide gaming community!\nIf you've read the rules and are still on the fence please check out the free Print & Play version of Filler! This way, you can try the game out and if you like the experience then come on back to pledge for a full production copy!  \nWe believe in this game and know that if you give it a chance you'll see the love and attention we've put into developing it for game tables around the world.

And so far I have been able to avoid delays and common pitfalls by paying special attention to the following areas and building on previous experience:\n\nArt and Design. The art and design for the game is nearly complete so we'll be ready to print shortly after the close of the campaign. I always like to show you I mean business by paying for the art and design upfront!\n\nPlaytesting and Reviewing. Filler has been tested by many different playtesters and even a bunch of game designers. I have sent a bunch of prototypes to a variety of reviewers. I want to earn your trust by providing you with a solid product that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by folks from varying backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nPast Experience. This is the eleventh Kickstarter project I've run for Green Couch Games and I have helped with several other successful campaigns.

If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

Run a shift at that shop, which will allow you to buy and sell from the Heroes. When you're done, put a \"closed\" sign on the shop. It can't be used by any other player this round. \n> Visit a Guild: Pick an open Guild and use its action. Guilds are special locations that the Heroes don't visit. Each one provides a special game action, like increasing your crafting skills, or adding a new shop to the city. Like shops, each guild can only be used by one player each round.   \n> Craft for a Monster:  Head over to the workshop to smash your loot into raw materials and craft an artifact for an eager customer. As soon as you're done, the monster will head back to the dungeon to fight the Heroes. This is where the real money is! \n> Call for Round End: Send the Heroes back to the dungeon to get more loot.

The subtle rhythm of the music wafts its way out the ajar door. You poke your head in, not sure what to expect; all the same, you are surprised by what you see. The hushed murmurs of passion and energy procreating from the filled room send tingles throughout your body. You involuntarily step inside the doorway, smiling, as you survey the scene of people weaving in and out of each other\u2019s way. They stream from the magazine rack containing some of the most popular publications about vinyl records, back to the aisles of albums looking for the perfect album to complete their perfect collections. You are enamored with the intensity of the scene and feel the need to start your own perfect collection.\nVinyl is designed by Eric Alvarado and can play from 2 to 4 players. Players will use a combination of set collection, card drafting, worker placement and hand management to build the best collection of Vinyl records and win the game.\nIntroducing the Top Shelf Expansion that will be exclusive to Kickstarter and will not be released in the Standard Version of the game at retail.\nAfter the game has been set up, each player will have a hand of five to seven Magazine Rack cards, depending on where they are seated in accordance with the start player. Each player will also have two Loyalty Cards for end game goals.\nOn their turn, the active player will place their meeple at a location in the Record Store.\nThere are 5 locations in the store in a 4 player game. Each location has a different action that can be completed by the active player. The lower action is the Primary Action and the upper action is the Bump Action. After the active player places their meeple on the store location\u2019s Primary Action, they then will perform that action.\nThe Bump Action happens when the active player moves their meeple to the same location that a non-active player\u2019s meeple is located. The non-active player slides their meeple to the Bump Action Location. After the active player is done with their Primary Action, the non-active player can now take their bump action.\nCollecting Albums\nPlayers will use Magazine Cards to collect albums from the Bins. They must match all the attributes on the Album Card. The magazine cards are discarded and the Album is added to their active collection.\n Pure: Players must match the Genre and one other Attribute\n Mixed 1: Players must alternate Genre and match one other Attribute\nMixed 2: Players must alternate Genre and match two other Attributes\nRefilling the Record Bin\nWhen an album is collected out of a Record Bin or Sale Bin the albums move downward and fill in the empty spots.\n Building Collections in your Player Area\nWhen a player adds an album to their collection, they will score the album on the score track.\nRetiring an Active Collection\nAt any point during a player's turn, they may retire an active collection. When you retire a collection you can take a Collection Reward Token\nDuring gameplay, a player can visit the Front Counter and as their Primary Action may draw two new Loyalty Cards. You may keep any two and discard two. You may also perform this as a Bump Action at the Magazine Rack. Loyalty Cards are kept secret until the end of the game. At that time, they will be revealed and scored.\nGame End\nThe game will end when the album Stockpile is empty and all the albums have emptied out from the store. Each player will get one final turn.

The feedback has been awesome. This is why we continue to offer a high-end version to backers that want it. The Platinum Edition will have plenty of added value over the Gold Edition.\nExamples of Past Boxes from other games\nHouse of Borgia\nKing's Champion\n The 80s expansion will add in some new mechanics to the game. We have opened up the Trade Counter. You will now be able to trade unwanted or low-value records in to gain attributes that you may use in later turns.  \nCollection rewards have been reduced to max out 4. The lower end will now be 2 albums in a small collection and this will increase the number of records that a player may retire during the game. In addition, the Extended Play format and the Long Play format have been added as attributes and these albums can provide a bonus to your collections for end game scoring. There is still more, however.  \nWe have also added 12 new Loyalty Cards which will help to bolster your end game scoring even further. Taking all of this into account that is over 150 new components added to the game!  \nWe will also introduce gameplay with 5 Genres in play instead of 4. This will give players a different style of game in this expansion. There are 6 Genres added so that players can choose which 5 Genres they would like to play with.  \nWhat comes in the Expansion?\n As a reminder, here's how you include Add-Ons into your pledge:  \n1.

However, Talon Strikes Studios will share the burden of shipping with you. We will subsidize the shipping to lessen the cost. This helps to make shipping affordable for everyone. We will be fulfilling Vinyl at depots around the world. While we cannot guarantee that you will not have an import tax, but by bringing the game into your zone in bulk we absorb this burden as well.\nFulfilling a game is not something to be taken lightly. We here, at Talon Strikes Studios, work very hard to do the very best we can for you. We honor our backers by shipping to them first, because without you, we would not be able to manufacture and ship games.\nThere are a lot of different people and companies involved in bringing a game to the fulfillment stage. Once the games are on the boat we are counting on these different folks to do their portion of the fulfillment process. There are things that can pop up that are not in our control. However, just as we have done with our previous campaigns we will keep you informed through out the process and promise to bring Vinyl to your door! \nDay One Avatar\n Thank you to all the folks that have play tested Vinyl and helped bring this project to life.

Players must decide if they should save tools for an epic late game point swing or grab points now to take an early lead. \nAI Variants: Experience the excitement of Fire in the Library on your own with the solo game or spice up a multi-player match by adding new challengers.\nHistory is burning\u2014take chances, be brave, SAVE BOOKS!\n See the rest of Gameosity's review here. \nYou can see Jeremy's full review here. \n Below is the How to Play video: \n Below is a full playthrough video: \n Below is the How to Play for the solo version: \nEach round of Fire in the Library begins with each player obtaining a turn order card. Turn order cards contain safe and risky spaces for different strategies.\nPlay then moves to the Saving Books phase where each player, in turn order, draws tokens from a bag to see what they save. If you stop, you\u2019ll score points for any books you save and earn points for bravery if you stopped on a risky space. Books will increase in value as Sections of the Library burn down. \nWatch out! Pressing your luck while Saving Books may pull out fire tokens. Pull two fire tokens out\u2014or just one in a risky space\u2014and things will all go up in flames as the fire spreads! Sections of the Library will collapse based on the tokens you pulled during the Saving Books phase if you've pressed your luck too far. This can cause more Fire tokens to be added to the bag, as well as increasing the value of the burned Sections. \nFortunately, not everything is left up to luck. As a resourceful librarian, you have tools at your disposal. You start with two and may gain more during the course of the game. All of the tools provide new options for saving  books, changing the odds, or giving more opportunities to press your luck.\n Once each player has taken a turn, the Round is over and the fire continues to grow. Burn a Section of the Library by setting aside the Library card that has the lowest Burn Index Number (smaller number on the Library card).   \nThe game ends IMMEDIATELY when the last Library card for any one Section of the Library is removed. The player with the highest score, wins!\nRules, Print and Play, and TableTop Simulator\nYou can learn from the full rules here: http://fitl.sale/rules (The rules are not final and will be formatted professionally in the final game).

We'd love to get the games to the libraries and other locations that could use them. \nThe Gift backing levels will also come with an additional laser cut Fire in the Library gift token as a thank you for thinking about others!  There will be two tokens made, the Library Hero token for anyone who gifts at least one game and the Super Library Hero for those who gift at least three. \nAdd-Ons\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, click the Manage Your Pledge button, click the Change Your Pledge button, then update the pledge amount. \nThe Jumbo Laser Cut Token Add-On will come with a set of Tarot sized Turn Order cards to fit the tokens.  Shipping is included for US backers, but if you're outside the US, you should add an additional $2 for shipping for each token or bag add-on.\nUltra Edition of Fire in the Library\nThis Ultra Edition is very special and unique; we'll make a few more than are backed here, but we'll never make a large number of them. Each one will have a unique token that only you will get. These are going to be handcrafted and put together in the US. This will complement the base Fire in the Library game and if you back for the Ultra Version, you will receive both the Ultra and base game. This means you can mix and match the components as you wish to create the game experience that you want. \nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach four out of the five social goals and we'll add a Bravest Librarian card to the game! If we meet all five goals, we'll include a special promo card in the game, as well! \nHere's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post,Twitter, Twitter tweet. \nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Fire in the Library is that we currently have no plans to put this game into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.  \nKickstarter Limited \u2013 Fire in the Library might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions.\nHelp Us Improve Fire in the Library \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality of the components and add more content to the game for everyone! \nSubsidized Shipping \u2013  $5 shipping to the USA,  $10 to the EU and Canada and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs. \nDiscounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost. \nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT fees for backers. \nMost importantly, without you, Fire in the Library would not get created. We definitely appreciate every backer\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Fire in the Library to retailers during the campaign. Back the project for $1, send us a message, and we'll get back to you! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping costs differ based on your location:  \n$5 for the United States \n$10 for the EU, Canada, and Australia \n$15 for the rest of the world \nWe are still working on the fulfillment strategy with several potential fulfillment partners to get Fire in the Library to you the proper way, with fulfillment partners in different parts of the world which will be chosen closer to shipping, as things tend to change over time. We intend to personally be shipping out the copies that have destinations within the United States. \n To order a second copy of Fire in the Library, add an additional $24 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost. \nI am happy to discuss group orders larger than two copies, but these need to be handled on a country by country basis. Please send me a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nFire in the Library is the third project of Weird Giraffe Games. Super Hack Override was our first project and it was delivered a month early to backers in March 2017. Stellar Leap is our second project and is currently scheduled to be delivered early to backers in June. \nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.  \nThe Fire in the Library team is made of the following people:    \n We're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after! Please feel free to reach out to us directly, in the comments, or in a variety of methods on social media if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

Imagine if Carcassonne, Dominion, and Galaxy Trucker were combined into a magical strategy game of sorcerer architects competing to see who could gain the most prestige! Walk with us down the streets of Sorcerer City! \n Building your city\nShuffle your starting deck of 12 tiles. Place them face down and prepare to start the round. Once the round starts you will place one tile at a time adjacent to a previously placed tile. \nTiles can be arranged in any direction and they DO NOT have to match other colors when placed. Obviously, you will want to strategically place a tile to score the most points in whatever strategy you are attempting to construct. \nThere are 3 different scoring goal types.\nIt can be any shape!\nAll tiles that form a straight line are counted.\nThese tiles can be diagonal or orthogonal, and of any goal type or color.\nPrototype Rulebook\n                                                                                                      \nRaw Magic Conversion Cards: Each player secretly decides how to use their raw magic, as all raw magic is converted into one of the three other resources. Players reveal simultaneously.\nInfluence Rewards: The player with the most influence wins the reward for that year and the Prestige associated with it. The second place player chooses either the Prestige or the Influence Reward. Third place is rewarded the option that the second player did not choose. All remaining players receive 5 gold to spend at the market or an additional buy action.\nMarket Phase: In order of influence, players will buy tiles from the Market. Only 2 tiles may be purchased unless they have unlocked more buy actions from their player board, influence rewards, or tiles in their cities. \nMonster Phase: Each player receives a Monster from the current year. Players should review as a group the monster ability that everyone is receiving. \nShuffle and reset: Players collect their Prestige coins from their supply for the amount they accumulated during the round. The player with the least amount of Prestige gains the free tile that matches the current year. Now players take all tiles, including newly acquired monsters and market tiles and shuffle them face down and prepare their deck for the next round. \nEnd Game: After the 5th year, count up all Prestige Tokens and determine the winner!\nThese items give players asymmetric starting abilities.\n\"Work in progress\" - Subject to change\n\"Work in progress\" - Subject to change\n\"Work in progress\" - Subject to change\nWe are listening to your feedback!\nLISTEN TO AN INTERVIEW WITH SCOTT CAPUTO\nShipping is expensive and is a burden that we all have to share. We have subsidized the shipping costs so that you have very affordable shipping. We will be fulfilling the Kickstarter copies from strategic locations around the world. If you live in an expensive part of the world to ship things, it is a big advantage to secure this subsidized shipping through the campaign. \nSome backers will receive their games before others, that is just a fact of fulfillment. We will balance this the very best we can and we will do our very best to keep everyone up to date on where each region of the world is during shipping. There are things we cannot control, like sea freighters getting delayed or customs taking much longer than what is normal, these situations pop up, we will do our best. The region of the world we have the most control over is the USA, we promise that no retail sales or Amazon sales will occur until backers have been shipped. We will also do our very best to do the same for every other area of the world, but those areas are much harder to time fulfillment. \nWhen it comes to shipping and fulfillment, please be patient. There are a lot of moving parts to pull off shipping thousands of games to almost every country on this planet. We learned a lot in our previous campaigns, we have vetted great fulfillment partners, but ultimately once the games are put on the boats, we are at the mercy of a lot of other people.

We just need to prepare any additional items that are enabled by this campaign.\n\nBecause we are partnering with other publishers to enable different language editions there may be some unexpected delays due to translations and localisation work by those partners.\n\nMartin and I want to make the best possible game, so there may be some to and fro with our manufacturer to fine tune the components.

We had some bumps along the way and didn't quite schedule some of the promo cards production cycles with our fulfillment calendar. We've been backers before too, and we completely understand how frustrating that can be when campaigns run into unforeseen issues. We certainly don't plan on dropping the ball and we've planned our promo cards much more carefully this time around so fulfillment (one wave instead of two) should be far easier, but if manufacturing issues do come up, PLEASE understand that we will try to do everything we can to remedy any problems that may arise.\n\nWe are working with many different publishers to bring you the promos we have on offer, and that takes a lot of coordination. We anticipate having all promos ready to deliver as planned, but as stated production schedules are always subject to delay. We will communicate these if they do occur, but please understand we are at the mercy of a giant industry that relies on a multitude of printers from many different countries.\n\nFinally, and probably most importantly, we have done our best to estimate our needs for the various promos we have on offer. Some printing schedules require us to set quantities as our campaign is live. We've structured the pledge levels to provide you with the most flexibility when choosing the promos you want, but some quantities may require you to choose alternate promo(s) in the event that supplies run out. We recognize that this possibility is less than desirable, but please understand that we will try to make up for it with any excess quantities we might have.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Start Player - Gloomhaven Scenario", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Man Vs Meeple.

Our plan is to get \u2018Escape from Dulce\u2019 into your hands before Christmas 2018, but this is only an estimate. There could be unforeseen delays related to production, shipping, or customs that we might have to overcome. We will be completely transparent about any potential delays that pop up and address them in updates. \n\nShipping a product around the world is always a challenge for any company. While we have given accurate shipping estimates, shipping rates can change on a week by week basis, and might change a bit by the time the games are ready to leave our distribution centers. Any changes that occur will be addressed in updates. We\u2019re hoping you might even get charged less than our estimate!\n\nAll artwork and mini sculpts shown in the Kickstarter campaign may not be final versions and are subject to change. The game manual and rules are still being edited for consistency and clarity and, therefore, are also subject to changes. \n\nYou may be aware that we ran an unsuccessful campaign to fund \u2018Escape from Dulce\u2019 last Spring, so let\u2019s address the elephant, or giant two-headed cow, in the room. In hindsight, we made two major mistakes: having an overall goal that was too high and a lack of marketing. Our overall goal was too high because the factory we were working with had a high minimum order quantity, and the goal was set to cover the costs of producing that many games. We\u2019ve since found factory partners that will produce smaller runs of our game, and we have been able to bring the overall goal down to $35,000. On the marketing side, we\u2019ve now gone out to a dozen conventions, have demoed many of the smaller events at our local game stores, and have created a strong web presence across multiple social media platforms. We\u2019ve met a ton of great people at these events and online that have helped spread the word.\n\nWe have learned from our mistakes and grown as a company over the past year, and we truly believe that things happen for a reason. We wouldn't trade the knowledge and experience of preparing for this relaunch for anything. The game is better for it. \n\nEvery Kickstarter has its share of risks, but we are confident that the amount of time we have spent learning about the business of game publishing, attending cons in the past year, and play-testing to hundreds of people will help us hit our goal. We are right where we are supposed to be with \u2018Secret Unknown Stuff: Escape from Dulce\u2019. Our goal was to bring to you the best game we can make, and everything we have been through this past year has brought us to this. A huge thank you to all the current and future members of the Cow Army for your support!\n\nREFUND POLICY:\n\nYou can request a full refund, no questions asked, up until 14 days after the Kickstarter ends. After this period, you can still get a refund, minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees. This is equal to approximately 8% of your pledge and are fees that we cannot get back from Kickstarter at this point.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter or our pledge manager using whatever payment method you used. If this is impossible for some reason, we\u2019ll arrange a refund through another channel.\n\nAll pledges are shown in USD, and any refunds will be processed for the exact amount you paid in USD, minus any applicable fees at the time the refund is requested. Sentient Cow Games is not responsible for changes in the foreign exchange rate.\n\nAfter the games have shipped, refunds will be considered on a case by case basis and at our discretion.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS:\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined below. While we encourage a lively comments section, please be courteous to the other backers. Name-calling, harassment, or inappropriate behavior of any kind will result in a cancellation of your pledge with a full refund. We want to run a positive campaign that helps bring people together over our shared love of gaming. \n\nSentient Cow Games reserves the right to cancel your pledge, with a full refund, at any time. We will not tolerate trolls of any kind. If your pledge is cancelled, you agree not to pledge again from your current or a new account. Violation of this policy will result in you being reported to Kickstarter. \n\nPlease confirm your shipping address with our pledge manager as soon as possible once contacted, to ensure you get your game in a timely manner. Sentient Cow Games is not responsible for shipping delays due to a lack of shipping address confirmation on your part. We cannot ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you move after you have already confirmed a shipping address, please contact us immediately, and we\u2019ll ensure your game is sent to the correct address.

(Check the \u201cWhy Kickstarter Exclusive?\u201d section for details)\nTraduction de la page en fran\u00e7ais\nEnglish and French (printed copies) - Spanish, German (as PDF downloads)\nNew to Kickstarter?\nHere is a guide to guide you through all the steps from pledging on Kickstarter to getting your game!\nThe Base Game Pledge for the core boxes gives you a complete game experience with dozens of stretch goal extras for even more replay value.\nHowever, the Batman universe is so vast that we couldn\u2019t fit all of it into the core boxes.\nThe expansions listed below all add new miniatures, new gameplay, new game boards, new scenarios, or a mix of all of these. They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster. Each hero is represented on the game board by a blue miniature.\nFrom left to right: Nightwing, The Huntress and Robin\nFrom left to right: Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Batman and Catwoman\nBatman sculpted by Arnaud Boudoiron\nThe Huntress sculpted by Edgar Skomorovski\nEach hero has their own hero board detailing their characteristics, skills, and traits.\nBatman, Jim Gordon, and Nightwing's hero screens\nThe hero board is made of 2 parts: a hero screen that slides into a bat-tablet.\nA hero screen and a bat-tablet forming a hero board\nThis hero board allows the player to control their hero to perform actions such as fighting or jumping from a walkway, by spending energy cubes from their reserve zone.\nThese energy cubes represent both a hero's life points and their capacity to act. The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

They may activate up to 2 tiles per turn by spending energy cubes. But unlike the heroes, these cubes only represent the villain's ability to activate tiles, as each character they control has their own life point count.\nPlastic sample of the command board\nClose-up of the plastic sample of the command board\nTo better understand how the command board works, please watch the following video series from Wayne Entertainment:\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be of high-quality plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nThe scale of our miniatures is 35mm from feet to eyes. This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language of your game during the Pledge Manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Robin is the designer of our very own Starship Babel and Legends of Dsyx roll and write series. He creates unique print-n-play games and many can be found on his itch.io page.\nArcane Bakery Clash was a winner in our 2017 Wallet Design contest. The judges were enchanted with the \"baking spells\" theme, mixed with the way that the game integrated both memory and time management.\nTRY THE GAME: Black and White PNP\nREAD THE RULES: Prototype Rules\n      You may have noticed that both designers were also the artists this time around. It was great to see the designers come with a complete vision and ride that through to the final product. Both games really scream Jason and Robin.\nWhat is the Button Shy Box? Here it is. It's been a long time coming. We ordered a handful last year as a test and had lots of interest. The box holds 18 (yes, 18!) of our little 18 card wallet games. We are only ordering enough to fulfill orders here, so if you want one, now's your chance. We will likely repeat this during future Kickstarters if it goes over well.\nHere's a peek at one of the test copies (with \"Collector's Edition\" photoshopped on top by Josh Mills).\nFor $35 you can get Stew and Arcane Bakery Clash along with the box, and for $60 you can get our Instant Collection of Stew, Arcane Bakery Clash and 3 more games of your choice (see the wallet games at Buttonshygames.com). If you need suggestions, just ask in the comments. We'll get you setup. :)\n\nUPDATE: These are now available for international supporters. These aren't cheap to ship, and we're charging the bare minimum that we can to make these exist, so there's no way to absorb any of the shipping. The good news is that is the cap on shipping, so if you want to add any additional games, it won't cost any more.\nIf you are a Board Game of the Month Club Member and would like the box, you can absolutely still get it. Keep an eye at Patreon or your email for details. :)\nHere's how to add-on games:\nVisit buttonshygames.com and add the games that you would like to your cart. \nCheckout with the coupon code FEBBACKER and you will not be charged shipping. \nIn the notes section of your order, add your Kickstarter name and/or your backer #.\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS: If you ordering more than 3 games total, please contact me to arrange shipping costs as they increase after 8 oz.\nAlternatively, you can order games using the code LITTLEHELP to save 10% and they will ship now.\nBoard Game of the Month Club\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers.

You take the role of a detective who is in charge of solving a case. But you only have 24 hours to do it. \nYou need your ingenuity and flair to find 4 clues so you can confront the criminal. Grab your gun and solve the case!\n(Pour les souscripteurs fran\u00e7ais, choix de la langue lors du survey final.) \n   voici les r\u00e8gles en FR et un descriptif complet sur mon site) \nYou are italian: back the project on Giochistarter to get the italian edition\n    Pulp Detective is a card/dice/narrative game with a strong theme, that takes place in the middle of the 1930s, the golden age of pulp magazines and hardboiled movies, between the two world wars. The illustrations come from real pulp magazines covers (Black Mask, Detective Tales, Detective Fiction, Dime Detective, All Story Detective). \nWe managed to obtain the rights to use an amazing array of 58 pulp novel covers, so that we can dress this game in the period apparel that it deserves to have.\nthe 3 cases of the base game\n  Each turn of the game consists of two phases: The Storyline and the Investigation. \n- Phase 1: Storyline\nDraw 3 Investigation cards from the deck; keep one, discard one, and return the last one to the deck. You can use these Cliffhanger, Follow A Lead, and Informant cards to get new items, gain stamina, or unearth a new clue!\n- Phase 2 Investigation\nUse your stamina and the items you have to roll dice which can help you complete the task on the card you kept during the Storyline phase. Choose your dice and decide which order to roll them in, using your detective instincts to match icons.\nFind all 4 clues, and if you still have time and stamina, confront the criminal in the final showdown!\n        Because Todd Sanders, the designer is an unstoppable fountain when he starts designing, we decided to release the Pulp Detective Double cross & Masterminds expansion at the same time: More cases to solve, funny sidekicks to use, and double cross cards.\n      Todd Sanders has revealed a little bit more about the Campaign mode which is now included in the Expansion box. This is a light legacy variant that links all the 7 cases of the base game and the expansion box.\nHave a look at the not final version HERE\n  PLAY\n\n      You might want to read an extensive review of the game from Jambalayaplaysgame, CLICK HERE\n  For more details on the components and rules of Pulp Detective, download the rule book HERE, and the Double cross & Masterminds expansion HERE (right click and Save as).\nPlease download these files, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. These files are the low-resolution version of the rules documents.\nYou, as a resourceful Detective, have a special ability that you can use whenever you need it:\nAt the beginning of each round, you lose an hour and mark it on the case card. You must spend your time wisely because when the day is over, you have lost the game! \nWhen drawing your three Storyline cards, choosing to keep is important in advancing the investigation. If you want to get a new item, choose a Follow a Lead card. Items are great because they improve your chances to find clues.\nFor example, hiring the Paperboy will allow you to get more Newspaper icons, and flirting with the Underground will allow you to get more weapons. Drinking a bottle of whiskey may improve your stamina when you have low stamina and you feel frustrated.\nTo get more Stamina, choose a Cliffhanger card. Stamina is crucial to your success in the game. The higher your Stamina is, the more dice you will roll during the Investigation phase.\nIf you ever run out of stamina, you immediately lose the game.\nThe game allows for 3 levels of difficulty, and determines how much Stamina you start with.\nTo find more clues, choose an Informant card. Finding clues is the goal of the game.\nRoll the dice and try to find matching icons: If you fail, you will lose one hour and you will be closer and closer to the end of the game, faster than expected.\nChoosing which cards to play adjacent to others will help you with the plot twists that can occur.\n4 Spatial Icons at the 4 edges\n    You can choose from 4 Detectives and 4 Police Inspectors in the base game, each with a different special action that affects game play.\nWhile there is only one Case in the base game it does not have a solution per se but you will come up against 1 of 4 different Criminals once you find the clues you need.\nThe Storyline cards you use in the game never come out the same way twice and this affects game play and the finding of clues.\nIf we add on the Expansion, now you would receive 3 more cases, each with some tweaks, 4 more Detective to choose from and 4 new Mastermind Criminals.\n- The illustrations are stunning. They are real covers of pulp magazines from the 1930s, 40s and 50's. The immersive ambience of the game will make you feel like you are part of a hardboiled movie from the 1940s. You are the detective, trying to unravel the complex case, feeling blue when your stamina is low, while trying to contact your last informant to finally get the one clue that will break this case.\n- The game contains 6 custom embossed dice - 4 Investigation dice, 1 Paperboy die and 1 Underground die. All the dice are unique and sized at a hefty 16 mm.\n- The Storyline phase flows like a movie script. Maybe you will Follow A Lead during your first round, then experience a Cliffhanger on the way to meet your Informant. Then you use one of your Items and call a taxi to hurry to your destination, saving crucial time. And, just like that, at the end of the game you will see a complete film noir story laid out before you. \n- The variants for 2 players allow for both a competitive game and a cooperative game. In the cooperative mode two players work together solve the case, as the Detective and Police Inspector.\nTwist markers\n- Pulp Detective has been in development since 2015. It was a long and captivating process, and is documented by Todd Sanders for his fans. You can read about this HERE .\nDesign notes\n  We'd love for you to try Pulp Detective before you back the campaign! The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\n        If you are a retailer, please contact me at avstudiogames@gmail.com\nThe game is perfectly balanced as it is. Adding more stretch goals is dangerous and increases the production time, making it unpredictable at the end.\nThe box already has all the components required to play the game, and they are the best quality possible. Moreover, more SG multiplies the number of mistakes during the fulfillment process, and they prevent us from perfectly planning the shipping costs of the game. Nobody likes mistakes. \nBut a few more cards, particularly more case cards, would be great to have, and I will ask Todd if we could design more of them to include in the deck!\nLinen options would also be great to add.\nAVStudioGames PLUS represents the games I like, with a strong theme and gorgeous graphics. \nPulp Detective would be the first in the series: They are more accessible than the games I tend to design and usually release under the label AVSG. But we are a single-man company and my games are not distributed by major distributors. I don't use Kickstarter as a pre-order platform; I use Kickstarter to fund my games.\nIf you pledge now, you help me to fund the game, which won't exist without your help.\nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. He has a great renown as a solo board game designer.\nMany of his games have already been published and last year Ludicreations funded a KS campaign for his card game IUNU and They Who Were 8\nOther games should come later this year, as well\u2026 several prototypes graced the tables in Essen in October 2017.\nI have designed and developed several boardgames during the last 8 years such like Tramways, Small City, CliniC, Card City XL, Town Center and many expansions for these games.\nBeing an unconditional fan of Pulp Magazines, I was immediately hooked by Todd's game. The graphics remind me of my collection of books and magazines from this golden age.\nI enjoyed working on this game with Todd, and together we developed the ability to play with 2 players, balanced the gameplay and built on Todd's months of development work to make this great Print & Play game ready for the board game market.\nLike our past campaigns for games such as Tramways, the Tramways expansions, and Card City XL, we have respected the delivery time, and in some case, boxes were even delivered earlier than expected (depending on how complex production of the game has been).\nFor example, for the Card City XL campaign, thanks to very rigorous management of the files, and great contacts at the manufacturers, we managed to deliver the game 2 months early! \nWe expect the game to be ready for December, the embossed dice are the most complex part of the components to produce, and samples of them are mostly ready.\n  Because you are helping me finance my project, I will help you finance your shipping: I will pay part of the cost, so you only have to pay $5 for shipping a game of this size. It is the least I can do. \nThanks to Ludicreations for their help during the campaign.\nLike my Facebook page : https://www.facebook.com/AVStudioGames-800700710043132/\nFollow my projects on Twitter : https://twitter.com/AlbanVIARD?lang=en\nBecome a fan on BoardGameGeek : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233149/pulp-detective\n F.A.Q: \nHow can I choose the french version ?\nBack the campaign, you will choose the french version when we send the pledge manager later in the campaign ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAVStudioGames Plus has already put a substantial amount of money into the initial illustration and graphic design. \nWe now need your help to traverse the final route: Producing the game.

You\u2019re staying at one of the three major establishments in Deadwood where you and your associates are working together to steal some of the gold-filled safes floating around town. But you suspect that the \u201cfriends\u201d you\u2019re working with are secretly plotting to keep all the gold for themselves. Will you be ready to turn on them before they shoot you in the back?\nDeadwood 1876 is a social deduction game where you'll work with teammates to find and collect gold. But in the end, the team with the most gold will have to fight each other to the death to determine the winner! Will you spend your turns helping your team find gold, or preparing to defeat your own teammates in the Final Showdown?\n2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 13+.\n1 Magnetic book box\n1 Faux leather pouch\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies and Deadwood history)\n3 Wood carved platforms\n9 Wood star pawns\n10 Wood engraved dice\n79 cards (9 Characters, 20 Safes, 50 Deadwood)\nThe game comes in a magnetically-closing faux book. Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter!

Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world!

See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level. After the campaign we'll send out a survey where you'll select which games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged.

Use crystals to earn exploration badges by turning them in at the mysterious Outpost 13 to prove yourself as the galaxy\u2019s next great explorer in Space Park!\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\n1 Modular Board featuring 7 Destinations \u2022 3 Rocket Minis \u2022 12 Purple Crystals \u2022 12 Teal Crystals \u2022 24 Small Pink Crystals \u2022 27 Square Badge Cards (70 x 70mm) \u2022 1 Scout Explorer Bot Standee \u2022 1 Scouter \u2022 12 Fast Travel Tokens \u2022 15 Explore Point Tokens \u2022 1 First Player Marker \u2022 Rulebook\nGame Overview\nView the Rules Here\n20\u201330 Minutes \u2022 1-4 Players \u2014 Space Park can be enjoyed with 5\u20136 players, but plays optimally with 1\u20134.\nWhat's the theme? \u2013 Think national parks in space. Explore exotic destinations and earn badges to prove yourself as the galaxy's best explorer.\nWhat makes it unique? \u2013 A destination can be visited if it has a rocket on top. Once a destination is visited the rocket moves clockwise around the board to the next open destination\u2014skipping over any with rockets already on top. Choosing where to go might help you, but it also opens up places for your opponents. \nHow do you win? \u2013 Collect the most Explorer Points (XP) by the end of the game by earning space badges.\nStretch Goals\nGame Setup\n      Rockets begin at the starting destinations and components are placed by their corresponding actions. Each player receives one badge to begin. Three badges are placed face up by Starlight Station and the rest form the the badge deck on top of it.\nGive the First Traveler marker to whoever most recently looked at the stars. Play begins with the First Traveler and proceeds clockwise.\nVisiting Destinations\nOn your turn, you\u2019ll choose which which destination to visit:\nChoose a destination with a rocket on it\nPerform the action of the chosen destination\nMove the rocket to the next destination in the clockwise rotation, skipping over any destinations that already have rockets on them.\nDestination Actions\nYour Trusty, Explorer Bot\u2014Scout\nScout's design will be changing slightly. Take a look at the new one in our latest update.\nScout moves to new destinations when players visit Astral Arcade. Whenever any player visits a destination with Scout on it, the player who currently has the Scouter may choose to gain either a Pink Crystal or a Fast Travel pass from the supply. \nFast Travel\nBefore visiting a destination, Fast Travel tokens can be spent on your turn to move one Rocket to the next available destination\u2014multiple tokens may be spent in a single turn before choosing a destination. \nBadge Perks\nAfter you earn a badge, you'll gain its Explorer Points (XP) in the top right and its perk on the bottom. Some are ongoing whereas others trigger immediately. Getting great badge combos can be a sure way to victory.\nGame End\nWhen a player has reached 20 or more Explorer Points, finish the current round of play so each player gets an equal number of turns\u2014the last player should be the person to the right of the First Traveler. The player with the most Explore Points at the end is the winner of Space Park!\nSolo Mode: Playing Against Scout\nIn solo mode, a player is racing to score 20 XP against Scout who is running through the Badge deck to move himself and the rockets around the board.

In LIGHTNING & BOLT, one player takes on the role of Lightning, the fast-flying, power-punching superhero, while the other takes on the role of Bolt, her towering robotic companion. The city of Midtown is being terrorized by the Evil Doctor, and it's up to Lightning & Bolt to swoop in and save the day!\nLightning's mechanics are fast, simple, light on rules, and high on fun. Bolt's mechanics are more complex, and take more finesse\u2014but once you get Bolt's engine running and software upgrade, the Evil Doctor had better watch out!\nAlso available: Our exclusive 16x20\" POSTER, for sale through the rest of the campaign as a $25 add-on!\nWe're excited to announce new stretch goals for LIGHTNING & BOLT! All stretch goals will be equally valid for both physical and digital copies of the game, and will be announced as the previous one is unlocked. There's lots to come, so spread the word about LIGHTNING & BOLT, and let's make this game even more amazing! \nLIGHTNING & BOLT is a dice-rolling, tile-flipping, bot-destroying search-and-rescue mission. To win, you need to rescue all 9 neighborhoods, fighting off the evil bots that are terrorizing them, reuniting friends and family, and cornering the Evil Doctor in his secret lab!\nSETUP\nSetting up LIGHTNING & BOLT is fast and easy. Just deal the 9 neighborhood tiles facedown, and give each player their pieces. \nLightning gets a player mat and standee, 1 purple cube, and 1 purple die.\nBolt gets a player mat and standee, 2 black cubes, 3 black dice, and a deck of upgrade cards (shuffled and placed facedown).\nNow Lightning decides where to touch down. She flies onto any tile she chooses, carrying Bolt with her super-strength. This is the tile that both players start on. Roll the green Doctor die, and place the resulting number of DocBot tokens on the tile. These are the bad guys you have to fight first thing!\nLIGHTNING'S TURN\nLightning always plays first. On her turn, she can move, smash DocBots on her location by rolling her die, and rescue neighborhoods she's cleared of bots. Lightning ALWAYS defeats all DocBots on her space, even if she rolls below the number of bots surrounding her. But, when she rolls low the extra DocBots make her trouble meter tick upward\u2014one for each extra bot. Once her trouble meter is full, Lightning is trapped, and can't move until Bolt comes to rescue her!\nLightning rescues neighborhoods by flipping over tiles that have been cleared of DocBots. Once she flips over a neighborhood tile, it stays face-up until the next neighborhood is rescued. If the tiles match, they're safe, and remain up and clear of bots for the rest of the game! If they don't match, they both flip back facedown, and moving back to facedown tiles you've visited before brings a new batch of DocBots to fight.\nBOLT'S TURN\nOn Bolt's turn, the giant robot rolls three dice, and assigns them to the actions described on its player mat. Some actions (like moving and searching a neighborhood) require 1 die assigned, regardless of value. Others (like attacking DocBots or rescuing Lightning from trouble) depend on the value rolled. If Bolt needs to increase the value of its roll, it can increase its heat by 1 per die re-rolled. But if Bolt's heat meter gets full, it overheats, and must spend all three dice on the following turn to cool down. Still, sometimes overheating is preferable to taking too much damage from being swarmed by DocBots in neighborhoods Bolt enters\u2014bots Bolt doesn't defeat remain on its tile turn after turn, dealing continual damage and preventing it from moving or taking any actions until Lightning swoops in, destroys the bots, and spends a turn repairing her robotic friend.\nIf Bolt rolls a 6 on any of its dice, it can choose to assign that die to downloading an upgrade, drawing a card from its upgrade deck. On the following turn, dice can be assigned to that upgrade to activate it. This means that every game, Bolt's abilities and strategy vary, depending on the upgrades it downloads and installs.\nWINNING THE GAME\nTo win, Lightning & Bolt must match all four pairs of neighborhood tiles. But if at any point they reveal the Evil Doctor's lair, all unmatched tiles are shuffled, setting back our heroes badly! However, if all four matches are made, and the last tile flips up to reveal the Evil Doctor's lair, Lightning & Bolt have cornered him, and take him off to jail, saving Midtown once again!\nLIGHTNING & BOLT is built to bring together players of very different skill levels. By giving one player a much simpler ruleset, it lets a serious game player have fun with someone used to only mass-market, luck-driven games. The use of dice in the game keeps the Bolt's player on their toes and unable to predict what will work best for Lightning. It encourages experimentation and risk-taking, and empowers both players to work together.\nThere's a kind of magic that happens when both players work together, throwing themselves into the game to capture the evil supervillain, cheering and helping each other when they get stuck in a jam. \nAt the end of the day, it's good to enjoy time with people you love. LIGHTNING & BOLT is built around that idea. (And, on a personal note, those of us behind the game just want to keep playing it.)\nDAVID SOMERVILLE, DESIGNER is the creator of Vast: The Crystal Caverns, the runaway hit game that introduced total asymmetry to the tabletop world. By day, he's the creative director of The Atlantic, but by night he's either hanging out with his wife and three children or throwing dice and scribbling furiously about oddball mechanics in various notebooks scattered around the house.\nANDREW BOSLEY, ILLUSTRATOR is the artist behind Everdell, Mission: Red Planet, and Citadels. He is freelance concept artist and illustrator, working primarily in the video game industry. When he\u2019s not daydreaming or drawing, Andrew is playing games with his wife and five kids. He is pretty good at ping pong, possum wrangling, and he\u2019s the best ukulele player in his family.  For examples of his non-possum related work go here.\nBEATRICE SOMERVILLE is David's daughter, and the reason this game exists in the first place. She is four years old, and enjoys singing, fighting evil robots, and making her own PB&Js.\nLIGHTNING & BOLT was never supposed to be released to the public. After David Somerville created Vast: The Crystal Caverns, he designed two more as-yet-unreleased games. Vast was dedicated to his first daughter, and the next two games were dedicated to his wife and son. His three-year-old daughter, Beatrice, asked him to design a game for her. After a few questions (\"Pirates or superheroes?\" and \"What would your superhero name be?\") and a few late nights designing, David Somerville had drafted a new game just for Beatrice. \nAs David was designing, the challenge was to make a game that tiny little Beatrice could understand and really play, while keeping her dad engaged, too. Having cracked open fully asymmetrical game design in Vast, David started playing with the idea of a team game where a pair of heroes could play totally different games at entirely different skill levels. Beatrice would zoom around the board as a nimble, almost-unstoppable force of nature, while her dad would have to balance limited resources, tactics vs. strategic decisions, and character-enhancing options that would vary from game to game. \nThe resulting game, LIGHTNING & BOLT, is a fast, fun game that (while still light), engages a hobby gamer with interesting mechanics and meaningful choices, and allows a casual player to get in on the fun. David and his daughter played it endlessly (even cooking up a third-player option for his other daughter to play too!), and they thought it would always stay a hand-drawn game just for their kitchen table. \n...and then along came Andrew Bosley. David and Andrew had wanted to collaborate for years, but never quite found the right project. When Andrew found out about the game, and started sketching it, the game's potential quickly caught fire in his imagination, and soon Andrew was pouring out the amazing art that you see in the finished game, as well as taking on the role of producer, researching printing options, logistics, and making it possible to bring LIGHTNING & BOLT to Kickstarter.\nLIGHTNING & BOLT has a Kickstarter campaign that's a little different than most board games. Since this game is a labor of love\u2014and also fairly unusual\u2014we decided to launch the game as part of Kickstarter's Make 100 initiative. By doing this, we can test out how interesting this idea is to you, the board game enthusiast, and not overcommit to mass manufacturing for a novel idea.\nIf the response is good, we'd be happy to explore launching a larger campaign down the road. But we think creating a hundred hand-crafted copies for those who are excited about the idea of the game seems like a great start. Hopefully you agree!\nNo matter what happens with this campaign, we believe that games are a powerful way to bring people together. We encourage you to back this game, and come together at your table over LIGHTNING & BOLT.

Did you miss your chance to play it when the original edition was available? Did you play a friend's copy and can't understand why it ever went out of print? Did you play your own copy into ragged pieces like we did? Whichever one of those is true, or if this is your first look at the game, welcome to the campaign! It is a dream come true for us to bring this game from Jarratt Gray and Carl de Visser back to gamers everywhere!\nEndeavor: Age of Sail is a strategy board game set in the historic Age of Sail. Starting out in the crowded hub of Europe, you must struggle to dominate at home while sending ships to the closed regions of the world... and be ready to seize control when they open up! You'll compete to grow the most successful empire through a smooth combination of:\narea control (capture key cities and the routes that join them!)\nresource collection (get the assets to build your empire!)\nengine-building (construct the buildings to power your strategy!)\naction management (use your population and trade tokens wisely!)\nThe elegant gameplay is driven by five different actions (Occupy, Ship, Draw, Attack, and Payment), and five different attributes (Industry, Wealth, Culture, Influence, and Glory):\nThe way you build, combine, and manage those elements creates your empire. Your challenge will be to navigate the maps of the world as they unfold, and write the history books so that the Age of Sail describes your victory!\nFor a detailed description of gameplay, see the How to Play section below. \n      Endeavor: Age of Sail preserves everything about the original edition that you know and love. The satisfying pacing which begins briskly but grows richer and deeper with every turn, the always-interesting breadth of the choices available to you, that feeling of the world unfolding as the game progresses, it's all still there. And it's all driven by that surprisingly lean ruleset which draws its complexity from the interactions and tensions that it creates. So how did we improve on this? Let's take a look:\nExploits are the major new gameplay addition unique to Endeavor: Age of Sail. Sure you can play the game without them (and for your first play you probably should), but once you play with them you'll never go back!\nIn each game you'll deal out three random Exploits (or choose three you enjoy playing with). Like the regions of the world, Exploits are locked at the start of the game. Each Exploit is a historical event from the era that is related to two of the regions on the board. When both of those regions are opened during the game, that Exploit becomes unlocked, and players may now begin interacting with its unique mechanisms and scoring opportunities.\nFor example, the Spanish Main Exploit is related to North America and South America. When those regions open up, that means that the Spanish Main is now occurring in the story of our game. Players may now use the Exploit's actions to Fortify their cities using the provided tokens (making them costlier for foes to attack), and once they've fortified, can trigger a powerful mid-round payment of workers back home! In addition, a new scoring opportunity opens up. Amazing! \nEach Exploit comes with its own immersive new abilities and strategic possibilities, and the game includes all of the special components that are needed to carry them out. This exciting variety of possible Exploit combinations means that every game will drive player interest towards different regions of the world, and create new pathways to victory even for seasoned veterans!\nPlayers command major seafaring empires during the historical Age of Sail. You have your own player mat, where you track your empire\u2019s attributes, construct buildings that permit you actions in the game, and gather Asset cards to build your attributes and gain Glory!\nEach round, you\u2019ll construct one building (based on your Industry level), gain population (based on your Culture level), pay workers to free up buildings (based on your Wealth level), take actions, then manage your cards (based on your Influence level).\nAt the start of the game, player actions are mostly limited to interacting with Europe; using your population to activate your own buildings, you\u2019ll draw Asset cards to increase your abilities, and occupy Cities to gain their Glory and assets, and to control the valuable links between them.\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll construct buildings that permit ship actions, and this allows you to reach out to the closed regions of the world. By shipping to a region, you can begin drawing cards from that region; when its shipping track is filled up, the valuable Governor card is awarded and the region becomes open. An open region\u2019s Cities and links can be competed over just like Europe\u2019s.\nEventually players will run out of room to expand, and if you\u2019ve built buildings with attack actions, you\u2019ll be able to engage in combat. Drive your opponents from the cities they\u2019ve claimed, to deny them the city\u2019s Glory points and to break up their network of profitable trade routes!\nOnce seven rounds have passed, the game comes to an end and scores are tallied. You\u2019ll earn Glory for:\nHow well you\u2019ve improved your four attributes (Industry, Culture, Wealth, and Influence)\nThe Cities you occupy and the links you control\nGlory symbols on your cards and buildings\nSpecial scoring opportunities from this game\u2019s Exploits\nThe player whose empire has accumulated the most Glory wins! \n           Tom's Playthrough\n Tom's Final Thoughts\n       ...plus glowing praise for the original edition of Endeavor:\n\"A very elegant design with easy to grasp, easy to teach mechanisms. Rich choices of actions on a rapidly evolving world map. No randomness beyond initial setup. Plenty of strategy and tactics packed into a 75 minute play time window. A definite 10 after repeat playings. Bravo!\"\n~Thorwolf (bgg user)\n\"A fantastic game - just the perfect level of depth for non-gamers to grasp reasonably well, but plenty of room for strategizing as well! Well done to the designers! So many paths to victory - and each so beautifully balanced.\"\n~superbgg (bgg user)\n\"I was surprised at how simple Endeavor is. It looks so thinky and complex, but the game play is actually quite easy. What sets it apart is the uniqueness of its mechanics and how it covers its historical theme in a way that is much more complete and accurate than most games with the \"Age of Discovery\" theme. It may be simple, but you have to use advanced thinking to defeat your opponent!\"\n~espoon82 (bgg user)\nEndeavor design and Age of Sail development: Carl de Visser & Jarratt Gray \nGraphic Design & Development: Joshua Cappel \nPublisher, Burnt Island Games: Helaina Cappel\nPublisher, Grand Gamers Guild: Marc Specter\nVideography: Jon Mietling\nBuilding art & coloring: Leandro Oliveira & Vinicius Townsend\n3D Models: Heriberto Martinez\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA note on our combined track record from KTBG (Burnt Island's Sibling Company) and Grand Gamers Guild: \n\u2022 Successful and timely fulfillment of 5 projects over 2 years.\n\u2022 Wide praise for production quality and gameplay development.\n\u2022 Designers and artists with years of experience in their disciplines.\n\nAll of the art and mechanics for the game are complete, so once this campaign ends, we'll be ready to roll.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can insure a fast and smooth operation.

Some of the great titles that inspired the design were Stone Age, Agricola, 7 Wonders, and Race for the Galaxy.\nIn summary, gameplay for Everdell is as follows: On your turn, you may either place a worker or play a card.\nPlacing a worker allows you to gather resources to play cards, draw more cards into your hand, or other various actions which will benefit you in different ways.\nBy playing cards, you are building your own city which will consist of Critters and Constructions. Constructions are played by paying the raw resources, and Critters are played by paying berries--or a Critter can be played for free if you have their corresponding Construction already in your city.\nView from the Ever Tree\nThere are five different factions of cards in the game:\nGreen Production activates immediately when played and once during season production.\nMaroon Destination serves as a placement location for workers.\nBlue Governance give you rewards after playing certain card types, or offer unique ways to bend the rules.\nGrey Traveler activate once immediately when played.\nPurple Prosperity give bonus end game points based on other cards in your city.\nPlayers are limited to 15 cards in their city. The rewarding challenge of the game is to optimize on your opportunities to build a strong engine of cards and combos that will serve you well, not only to produce resources, but ultimately to reach the most points before the end of the game.\nThe deck weighs in at 128 cards, featuring 48 unique card types (28 Constructions and 28 Critters), all of which work in different and interesting ways to offer tactical and strategic forms of play. The game is designed with high replayability in mind, while still offering enough straightforward decisions to be easily accessible. \nEvery game of Everdell also features eight Events which all players will be competing to achieve. Four of these Events are standard for every game, but the other four are random from a total of 16 unique Events. These powerful rewards are thematically designed and help to give players a focused goal, albeit a goal that others are working toward as well.\nPlayers have their own hand of cards that grows and changes as the game progresses, but there are also eight face-up cards available to choose from at all times as well. These face-up cards are open to every player, working as an open draft of sorts.\nTimely placement of your workers, smart utilization of card abilities and combos, and achieving Events before your opponents will ensure that the sun shines brightest on your own unique corner of Everdell.\nRead the rules here (currently using placeholder prototype artwork and component images).\nThe Art of Everdell\nAndrew Bosley is Everdell's amazing artist! Andrew is currently working on all the art for the game, and will be completed shortly after the campaign ends. When all the art is done, the game is going to look MAGICAL!\nAnd here is a teaser of some of the Critters being worked on...\nand the Constructions.

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! However, due to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

It's up to Leo to solve the clues, and figure out the suspects in each room before the timer runs out. But beware, it has been rumored that there are ghosts and monsters lurking in the night! \n70+ UNIQUE ART.  74 CARDS. 1 NEW DEDUCTION GAME.\nIn this competitive deduction card game, up to four players will compete to score victory points. At the beginning of the game, each detective will receive a secret identity card which will have it's own character image and a custom objective symbol on the top left corner of the card.  \nOn each player's turn, two clues are placed under locations to score community points.  Points are achieved in many ways, but in general, ahem.. just be a good detective.  In this example, player one has just placed a card with four flower symbols in Leo's room, and another card with four skull symbols in the living room.  Each symbol is worth 1 point at the end of the game.\nSome clues are action cards, and are performed at the time they are played.  Playing cards in a location will also trigger room effects, which may alter the course of the game.\nFace up cards will score a point per objective symbol.  When this happens, you are scoring for everyone. Therefore, take extra precaution when placing clues down, especially since other players don't know your identity. In addition, players will have a location at the start of the game. Any cards played in your location will score you one bonus point each clue card that is stacked in that room. \nPay attention to the clues that other players are placing. The locations that players are placing the clues are also good indicators of who they are. Do your fancy deduction work to collect even more points.\nIf you suspect somebody, don't be shy, simply solve the identity of that player in the guessing phase.  If you are victorious, you will be rewarded with additional guessing points. If not, the person you are guessing will be getting the hard earned points. Its not the end of the world, its just a penalty for poor detective work.\nThe game flows in two phases: the clue phase, and the guessing phase.  In the clue phase your placing down clues to score points. In the guessing phase your guessing players to score additional points.  Guessing points are worth more in earlier rounds, so be sure to watch the timer.\nAt the end of each round, the timer will go down by one, and a new event will unfold.\nWhen the timer reaches zero, the game is over. The remaining identities get revealed so that all the players know which points can be counted torwards their character. The person with the most victory points is clearly the best detective. \nReview detailed instructions by clicking the instruction image below.\n      55 clue cards, 5 event cards, 5 location cards, 8 character cards. 1 timer card, 1 timer handle, instruction manual, first player token, 30 scoring tokens, 8 player tokens, 4 reference cards\n                                                                                           Our campaign is shipping friendly worldwide.

Players are nobles attending an extravagant masked ball while a plague ravages the country. Players are trying to do what nobles do \u2013 feast, dance, celebrate \u2013become as popular as they can. But rumors swirl as the night goes on, and everyone feels oddly nervous each time the clock chimes. The nobles might be wise to spend some time listening to these rumors. It is becoming increasingly clear as midnight approaches that something sinister awaits. At midnight, a horrible figure in the guise of the Red Death appears at the masquerade! It stalks amongst the rooms of the abbey, killing the nobles it comes across. The most popular noble wins\u2026 but that only matters if you survive the night.  \nThe game takes place in the peculiar abbey of Prince Prospero. The abbey is divided into 7 rooms; each decorated and lit in a particular color.\nPlayers start with a set of 9 identical action cards and one unique personality card. These action cards include things like: Discuss, Dance, Admire, Mock, Flirt.\nEach turn, players will:\n1. CHOOSE a card from hand to play (simultaneously)\n2. PERFORM THE ACTION one at a time, to gain popularity or rumors\n3. MOVE to an adjacent room (after everyone\u2019s actions are complete - optional)\nAs each turn goes by, the clock gets closer to reaching midnight. As players gather rumors, they begin planning out their movements after midnight to avoid the Red Death. They can make changes to their plan at any time\u2026 until 12:00. The Red Death will visit 2 rooms at each time: 12:00, 12:10, 12:20, 12:30, 12:40, 12:50.\nPlayers must plan out movements behind their player screens to avoid being in the rooms that the Red Death visits. \nAt midnight, the game drastically changes. Players can no longer change their planned movements and they must now hope they gathered enough information to avoid the Red Death! Players enact their planned 12:00 movement, either moving their figure clockwise, counter-clockwise, or staying in place. Then the two 12:00 Red Death cards are revealed (one at a time, for suspense). \nThe Red Death visits the rooms shown on the cards, killing all nobles in those rooms \u2013 removing their figures from the abbey and the popularity track. Surviving nobles enact their planned 12:10 movement, and the 12:10 Red Death cards are revealed once again. This repeats for each time slot until the 12:50 time is resolved. The most popular surviving noble wins! May this victory give you strength as you contemplate the inevitability of death amongst the corpses of your fallen countrymen\u2026\n   Play Tips from Designer Adam Wyse\nMasque of the Red Death is all about the balance between gaining popularity (to win) and gaining information (to survive). You can\u2019t have one without the other. If all you do is Flirt and Laugh and Dance around all night, odds are you\u2019re going to die after midnight. If all you do is Discuss (to take rumors), you should be able to survive but if anyone else survives they will likely be more popular than you. You must strike a good balance of both. Not knowing for sure if you will survive is what makes the game so tense. It is very important to not fall too far behind in popularity. \nPlayers who take advantage of the ability to jump over others on the popularity track will consistently get extra popularity each time they take a popularity action. The unique personality card each player gets at the start of the game can be quite powerful, and no one knows which card other players will have. Time it right to benefit as much as possible from your personality card. Movement over the course of the night can be very important. Prince Prospero will be flitting around the abbey from round to round, but players get to see which room he will be in at each time, from the very start of the game. Try to move in a way that gets you near the prince as much as possible. \nYou may sometimes want to bunch up with other players so you can play cards on them, or you may want to get away from the pack so that others cannot play cards on you. Some action cards allow you to lower or raise other players\u2019 popularity or even steal or look at their rumor cards. But be careful about making enemies; they may be looking to get you back later. Stealing rumor cards can often be very effective. If you know nothing about 12:30 for example, when you steal a rumor you are allowed to request a particular time. This is obviously more effective than simply playing a Discuss action to draw a random rumor from the deck.\nEach player starts with 9 action cards and 1 personality card, but most of these do not come back to your hand after being played. You\u2019ll want to wait for the right moment before you play your more powerful cards!\nMovement matters during the masquerade for a couple reasons: 1. Many action cards can only be played on nobles who are in the same room as you. 2. Prince Prospero, the lord of this abbey, is here for the masquerade as well. The prince moves through the abbey a lot over the course of the night. It is good to be a part of the prince\u2019s entourage. If a player begins their turn in the same room as the prince, they simply gain 1 popularity. The popularity track that runs around the outside of the abbey board keeps track of the players\u2019 popularity level. It\u2019s important to note that players may never share the same space on this track. When you gain popularity, you move up a number of open spaces on the track, jumping over occupied spaces along the way.\n      Adam Wyse Interview\n                         Note: color will change before production.\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Archbishop Animus\n    Note: color will change before production.\n   Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Baroness Lathargy\n    Note: color will change before production\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Baron Gourmond\n    Note: color will change before production\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Countess Covetous\n    Note: color will change before production.\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Duchess Vanity\n    Note: color will change before production.\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Duke Desire\n    Note: color will change before production.\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Earl Envy\n    Note: color will change before production.\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Prince Prospero\n      Note: color will change before production.\n  Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - The Red Death\n    Note: color will change before production.\n   Gris Grimly Original Watercolor - Edgar Allan Poe\n    GRIS GRIMLY can be best described as a storyteller. For more almost twenty years, his distinctive style and wide selection of mediums have captivated a variety of loyal fans worldwide. Originally recognized for his dark yet humorous illustrations for young readers, Grimly has transcended the realm of picture books through writing, concept art, fine art, fashion design, and film.  \nIn 2000, Gris received his first children\u2019s book job illustrating Monster Museum for Hyperion. His distinct style earned the attention of fans and clients far and wide. A consistent demand from publishing giants followed and kept him employed doing what he had always wanted to do. Gris has worked with Simon and Schuster, Chronicle, Random House, HarperCollins, and Scholastic. He has illustrated classics by Ray Bradbury, Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, Mary Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe. He has written and illustrated his own books like the Wicked Nursery Rhymes trilogy and Little Jordan Ray\u2019s Muddy Spud as well as worked with contemporary authors like Neil Gaiman on the New York Times best selling book The Dangerous Alphabet. He has also collaborated with big studios like Disney, DreamWorks and The Jim Henson Company as a character designer and production designer.  \nGris lives in Pasadena with his wife, two children, and a very vile Boston Terrier. He is the one and only Mad Creator.\n The designer of Masque of the Red Death, Adam Wyse, is a former software engineer who has been designing games for several years now. As the steward of the Calgary chapter of the Game Artisans of Canada, he is part of the strong and vibrant design community that stretches all across Canada. A lifelong hockey and soccer fan, he used to have many hobbies until board games consumed them all! He lives with his wife Chelsea, dog Scooter, and far too many cats.\nMasque of the Red Death started as one of his earliest designs - borne of a love of the old short story. It's important to Adam to do the story justice by staying very close to the wonderful source material. The goal has always been to evoke the same feelings of dread and tension that the story brings out in its readers.\nThe game has been in development for years, was recognized as a finalist for the 2015 Canadian Game Design Award, and is finally being brought to life by the hardworking team at IDW and the incredible artwork of Gris Grimly.\nMasque of the Red Death features NO STRETCH GOALS.

This game of historical set collection will see players taking on the mantle of Curator in one of the world\u2019s great museums.\nDiscover lost civilisations from four continents and acquire relics to display in your galleries. Each object you exhibit will earn you points! Additionally, at the end of the game, you\u2019ll score more based on the size of your different Collections, which can be based on Civilisations or Domains. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!\nThe world will keep turning as you play however and you\u2019ll have to contend with historical events that may make the acquisition of artefacts harder, as well as facing the scrutinising gaze of public opinion.\nWill your Museum go down in the annals of history? Or will it simply be a footnote?\nMuseum is a \u00ab big box \u00bb game of set collection that allows you, as the curator, to choose the strategy that suits you best. Accomplished gamers will be able to draw out all the depth and complexity from the game\u2019s mechanics yet its simple rules can be easily adapted to suit newer and younger players.\nThe fruit of over a year\u2019s research, the 180 objects included in the game are real and each one has been lovingly redrawn by Vincent Dutrait.\n The cards are also furnished with accurate historical information, bringing each artefact to life! This continues into the rest of the game which has been designed to provide a fun and immersive experience featuring almost 300 unique illustrations!\nA challenging set collection game that can also be adapted to suit less experienced players.\nA beautiful game featuring almost 300 unique illustrations by Vincent Dutrait.\nRich historical content that will pique your curiosity!\nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 15-20min per player.\nThe Central Board represents the organised chaos that was a curator\u2019s desk during these wonderous times! On it, you\u2019ll find many of the elements required during the game.\nMost prominent are the 4 Continents and the available Objects brought back for your consideration by industrious explorers. During the game you\u2019ll be attempting to amass collections of these cards. Collections can either be based on the treasures of one Civilisation in particular, or be themed on artefact Domains, and ensure you additional points at the end of the game.\nEach card possesses a Value (used when purchasing/scoring cards), a Civilisation/colour (used when scoring collections based on civilisations) and a Domain/icon (used when scoring collections based on domains). Each of these authentic objects also has a Name, Illustration and Description. These don\u2019t have any effect on the rules but will give you a much better sense of what the game is about!\nAt the start of your turn you can choose one of the eight object cards available on the main board and take it for free. These cards will serve bothfor scoring items and as currency in the game as in Museum, objects are purchased using other objects! So, choose your card wisely\u2026do you want to exhibit a card, or do you need it to pay for something more interesting? Maybe both?\nOther players don\u2019t sit idly by during your turn either. After you\u2019ve chosen one, all the other players may also take a card. If they do though, you get Prestige Points! Prestige points represent the favours and honours your museum accumulates during the game and can be used to purchase cards!\nOnce all players have taken a card, you can move on with your action phase. Each player has a Museum Board representing the hallowed halls of their great establishment and it\u2019s in this part of the turn that you\u2019ll be filling yours with wonders from around the world.\nYou have two actions available to you:\nYou can furnish your museum (placing cards down)\nor\nPerform an Inventory (picking cards up).\nTo play a card into your museum you simply discard other cards of equal or greater value. You can also use any prestige points you collect to pay for cards too. Whenever you play objects into your museum, you score their value in points. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can purchase in one turn, as long as you can pay for them!\nDiscarded cards aren\u2019t lost however! Your Discard Pile represents your museum\u2019s storage and Objects in there can still be played exactly as if they were in your hand, with the exception of course being that you can\u2019t use them to pay for other cards.\nHowever, as you\u2019ve shown that you\u2019re not as interested in these cards, you leave them open to being taken by other parties who may have a better use for them! Effectively; cards that are in your discard pile aren\u2019t available only to you, any other player can now access them too! Any player can purchase a card from your discard pile. If they do so though, they must give you one of their Prestige points as payment!\nInstead of playing cards down you can pick them up! This action allows you to take all the cards from your discard pile and place them back in your hand. Although you won\u2019t be able to do anything else that turn, it will allow you to (maybe) get a full hand of cards back and ready to use again as well as keeping them out of the reach of your opponents!\nOnce you\u2019ve performed one of these two actions any missing objects cards on the central board are replaced and play passes to the next player!\nThis represents the basic rules and structure for each turn of the game: play will continue to pass from one player to another as each of you improves upon your collections.\nIf you think that the game is going to let you do that peacefully though, you\u2019re in for a surprise:\nHeadline cards: Historical events will unfurl as the game advances, having a direct effect on players. Headline cards can make it harder, or easier, to acquire objects as well as having other amusing or challenging effects.\nNotoriety Cards: As your Museum grows so will the different favours you can call in. Notoriety cards are powerful single-use abilities that can give you an edge during the game.\nPersonnel: A good museum needs the right people to help run it and that\u2019s where personnel cards come in. Representing experts from different fields, these individuals can help you enrich your collections and score more points at the end of the game.\nPublic Opinion: Hidden within the continent decks are Public Opinion cards. These represent the press noticing curators that have been taking lots of artefacts from certain Continents, without ever displaying them to the public! These can accumulate on different continents, leading to lost points at the end of the game if you don\u2019t manage your discard pile properly!\nPatron Cards: Rich patrons of history and art are more than willing to help you in your endeavour, all you\u2019ll have to do is meet some of their requests. You\u2019ll choose one of these cards at the start of the game and they\u2019ll ask you to assemble certain collections in order to gain more points at the end of the game.\nThe game Continues until a player reaches 50 points. This signals the end of the game as the public starts lining up to visit your establishment! The player in question finishes their turn and then everyone else gets one more turn before we move on to tallying up points.\nCards placed into your museum can be moved around as you see fit during the game as you search for those last items and perfect layout. At the end though you\u2019ll need to decide on your final layout before your museum opens!\nCollections are formed by placing cards orthogonally adjacent to each other, and consist of two categories: Civilisations (cards of the same colour) and Domains (cards with the same icon but different colours). The bigger the collection, the more points you can score!\nOnce everyone has finished organising their collections, your museum opens its doors to the public (with no small amount of pomp and circumstance) and we move into final scoring to see who wins!\nFirst take the points you scored during the game and add those gained from your collections. You can also convert any remaining Prestige points into victory points too.\nYou then score points for your Patron card as well as your museum\u2019s layout. If you managed to amass a big enough collection and fill your Grand Gallery (the red slots on the board) and/or your Entire Museum, you score even more points!\nFinally, players lose points based on the Public Opinion tokens on the board. Each card in your discard pile belonging to a continent with at least one Public Opinion token loses you points! The more tokens there are, the more points you lose!\nYour fellow curators will of course do the same and once scores have been tallied up, the player with the most points wins!\nThis is of course a summary or Museum\u2019s rules. If you\u2019d like to read the full version, you can find the work in progress Rulebook below.\nClick to download.\n Please note that this is a work in progress and not representative of the final product.\nMuseum is, at its heart, a set collection game. It's family orientated with just the right amount of rules and player interaction. Additionally, it can be tailored to suit more casual or younger players by easily removing elements such as Personnel, Events, Notoriety cards or Public Opinion to create an even easier, quicker, yet just as fun to play game. You can then add the different modules back in as the players become familiar with the rules and want to challenge themselves more.\nFor the more seasoned players out there though, don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve forgotten about you. Museum is a simple game compared to some, but it doesn\u2019t lack depth. Whilst the game has been designed with a family setting in mind, some of you may have noticed some of the subtler nuances whilst perusing the rules above. From manipulating discard piles to \u201ctaxing\u201d highly sought-after cards, there\u2019s more than a few ways for gamers to get their kicks! On top of this, upcoming expansions will allow you to add other elements to the game and create a much more cerebral challenge!\nYou can watch a full 4 -player game of Museum here:\nYou can also watch a video explanation of Museum's rules with Jamie here:\nStill not convinced that you want to back Museum? This video by Rahdo might change your mind!\nBarry Doublet from Board Games Everybody should has made a video about Museum !\nYou can also read his written article here!\nInterested in the World's Fair Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nInterested in the Archaeologists Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nWe'll be posting lots more video content during the campaign, including interviews with the game's authors and opinions from reviewers from around the world!\nWhat would a good KS be without Stretch Goats? As we move further and further through the project you'll unlock more and more content including plenty of exclusive elements that will enrich your pledge!\n From the seedy underworld of the Black Market, to the prestigious heights of the World Fair, there\u2019s more to the world of Museum than meets the eye!\nHow do I include add-ons in my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page.\n2. On the next screen, click on the blue \u201cChange your pledge\u201d button.\n3. Then, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the add-on and then click on the green \u201cContinue\u201d button.\n4. A new window will appear, click on the blue \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\nCurrently the game design for Museum is complete. You can see prototype copies of the game being played in the reviews and videos shown on this page. Whilst we\u2019re very happy with the game\u2019s current state, there may well be a few final modifications and checks to be made before we\u2019re fully satisfied with the final result.\nAs for stretch goals and other content we may unlock during the campaign: The game design for the majority of these elements have been tested and finalized. Any remaining queries should be resolved not long after the Kickstarter has ended. The brunt of the remaining work lies in the illustration work as you may have guessed.\nThe Core game is around 80% complete whereas the expansions require significantly more work. This has of course been taken into account for the announced delivery date. As Vincent finishes the illustrations the rest of the team will be working on pre-production so that the game is ready to be sent to print as soon as possible. We\u2019re planning for production to begin in late March in order to hit our planned delivery date of late July/early August.\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind.\nOlivier Melison and Eric Dubus have known each other for over 30 years, during which time they have played a huge selection of games together! Museum was born from their mutual desire to create a historically-themed game. When they're not creating amazing games together, Olivier works in international publishing, and Eric is a history teacher.\nVincent Dutrait is one of, if not the most, respected illustrators in the board gaming industry. Having worked on over 50 different projects (including Lewis & Clark, New York 1901, Robinson Crusoe, Broom Service, Lovecraft Letter, T.I.M.E. Stories, Augustus & Tikal 2...) his unique style of illustration and graphic design is popular with both players and publishers alike. He has also had the opportunity to work on prestigious licences such as Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer Fantasy, Pathfinder, Cthulhu and Games of Thrones.\nHoly Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns) Vincent Dutrait (renowned illustrator and artistic director) , and Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author).\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue to do what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go. In the case of Museum, it has allowed us to justify the extensive art budget that we wanted to attribute to the game. Simply put, games like Museum and/or their content would just not be viable with a \"traditional\" publishing method.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by August 2018. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, fabrication and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nMeeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions whereas Shipnaked will be taking care of North America and other worldwide destinations.\nAs mentioned previously, Shipping costs are not included in your pledge. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase. \nCurrently the shipping for this project is both EU, US and CA friendly. What does this mean? It means that backers from these two regions will not have to pay any import tax whatsoever when they receive their game.\nHowever, even if your region is not covered by this: please rest assured that our dispatcher will ensure you pay the absolute minimum in tax or brokerage for your game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo crowdfunding project comes without risk but we have done our utmost to minimise it.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, we have been involved in many Kickstarters before so are very familiar with any potential pitfalls.\n\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating an August 2018 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

After this, many fortune seekers traveled to this region with their caravans in search of work in order to build a better future for themselves. And there is an abundance of work. In the mountains, precious metals are to be found and in the fields a lot of manpower is required. Meanwhile, the number of settlements is growing and the demand for goods is rising. Recruit the right workers, deliver goods on time, and choose your settlements tactically. Only then you will have a chance of winning Montana.\nThe first player to build all of their settlements wins!\nPlease note:\n    (physical components of Montana)\n  Bring on the deluxe! Watch the campaign as we reveal special upgrades that will enhance your experience with Montana while making this Heritage Edition super deluxe!\n*remaining stock of exclusives are expected to be sold at conventions.\n  ...you'll do one of three actions:\n  A. Recruit\nSpin the Recruitment Wheel.\n(that's right... A SPINNER!)\nAfter you receive your workers, you can pay grain to mitigate the wheel for more! For each grain paid, advance the spinner one space and hire the extra two workers. This gives you four workers total for that action.\n  B. Work\nSend your workers to the bank, the mine, the quarry, the fields, or the farmland and pay the space's required money to receive the goods. You can choose to place an additional worker (or two workers of any color) to receive an extra good.\nThe workers will occupy their spaces until all spaces in that region are filled. Once there are no spaces available, the workers will be dismissed to the main supply.\nOr you can send your contractor to the city to auction for extra goods or to upgrade your stone and copper.\n  C. Build\nPay the goods indicated on the location you want to build and place one of your settlements there. You can build up to three settlements during this action.\nIf you place a settlement that completes a line of four, you get to place an additional settlement on top of the settlement just placed.\nAdditionally, if you build onto a location with a cow, you take the cow and place it on your player board. Cows can be used for cattle trade actions. If you are the first to build adjacent to a body of water, you take the canteen and place it on your player board. Canteens can be used to take an extra action, but only once.\nIf you don't build three settlements on your turn, take a silver for each settlement not built, for a maximum of two silver.\nBuilding settlements is ultimately how you win the game. The first player to build all of their settlements, is the winner of Montana!\n...in addition to one of these actions, you can perform a cattle trade.\n(cows for the win)\nThis action allows you to trade in a cow (if you have one) for one good of your choice, three silver, or one worker of your choice. This can be done ANYTIME during your turn and AS MANY times as you want.

Ole prospector Gustauf recently got the fever, but sadly kicked the bucket not long after. Under the fever\u2019s grip, his last will and testament stated that the deed to his gold-rich land goes to the first miner to claim 30 ounces of gold from the dirt. Payment is due in seven days. Will you be the miner that claims it all?\nThe Gameplay\nIn Claims of Gold, you\u2019re a miner. You have one priority in life: Collect gold\u2014and lots of it. The miner with the most gold at the end of the game wins. Each player starts the game with a mining box and two action meeples.\n  You\u2019ll collect gold by placing meeples onto the map to take different actions like acquiring upgrades at the Shop, playing cards at the Saloon, mining the land, or cleaning out dirt to find that sweet, sweet gold.\n    Claiming an action first will give the best benefit, so players will be met with challenging decisions on how to efficiently collect gold while trying to foil the efforts of other miners.\nPress-your-luck comes into play as players clean out buckets of dirt from their box to find gold. Dirt like Bedrock (The Pick Axe icon) is more rich with gold than Topsoil (The Shovel icon), but watch out\u2014it also contains more rocks. If a player reveals two rocks when cleaning out, then a piece of equipment they have acquired from the shop breaks. \n    One 15.5 x 19 in. Board\nFour Player Mats\nEight Meeples\nFive Circle Trackers\nFirst Player Nugget Marker\n12 Equipment Cards and 15 Saloon Cards (Poker Size)\n28 Claim Markers\n70 Dirt Tiles (40 Topsoil Tokens and 30 Bedrock)\nOne Rulebook\nReviews\n           Watch How to Play\nDays \u2022 Rounds\nClaims of Gold is played over a series of rounds called days. These are marked by the Day Tracker on the board. A day consists of three phases:\n1. Reveal Claims\n2. Place Meeples\n3. Take Actions\n1. Reveal Claims\nClaims are revealed onto the map from the deck that the Day Tracker shows (Either I or II). Claims revealed are always equal to the number of players and arranged between the River locations. At the start of the week, I Claims aren't as rich, but are more plentiful with iconography. Since the miners have dug deeper by the end of the week, II Claims can be really rich but aren't as plentiful.\n2. Place Meeples\nStarting with the first player and going in a clockwise order, each player will place a miner meeple on an available slot at a location of their choice. A location is marked by a white callout box on the map, and a clearing symbol marks an available slot at a location.\nThe mining action is taken on a Claim, so three Bedrock tiles are added to the purple player's box.\n3. Take Actions\nOnce each player has placed their two meeples, locations will resolve from left to right on the map\u2014beginning with The Shop. Slots at a location will resolve from top to bottom. When a player resolves an action, they take their meeple from that slot and place it back into their box.\nLocations\nThe Supply Shack has three slots available. The first player there gets a discount and has first pick of what's available that day.\n The Supply Shack - Upgrade your box with any of the available equipment at the cost marked on the slot.\nAt the Shop players can upgrade their box, but it comes at a cost of one or two gold. Equipment can allow a miner to get more of a certain type of dirt or give them special abilities at different locations. When a player purchases a piece of equipment at the Shop it is immediately played onto their box. A player can have a max of three upgrades.\nThe amount of slots at the Saloon is different for different player counts marked by the number below the clearing.\nThe Saloon - Play a Saloon Card then redeploy that meeple to a new Claim or River slot down the map.\nAt the Saloon, players can play cards allowing them to manipulate different gameplay elements like strengthening their cleanout odds or lessening other players. After a player resolves their Saloon card they can redeploy their meeple to any slot still available down the map. Since they spent part of the day drinking and playing cards, they'll only get a pick of what's left.\nThe player arriving first to this claim will mine four topsoil. The player arriving second will only mine two bedrock. Some claims like this one have two slots available as there\u2019s still dirt left to dig, but others aren\u2019t as deep with just one slot.\nThe Claims - Mine the Dirt (Topsoil or Bedrock) tiles from the side of the board and place them into your box. Do not flip the tiles and don\u2019t forget to apply any equipment bonuses.\nThe heart of the game lies in mining the Claims. Claims can have two different types of dirt: Topsoil or Bedrock. Topsoil (The Shovel Tile) is a little safer to mine as one in every four tiles contains a rock. Topsoil dirt contains 1s, 2s, 3s, and a rocks. Bedrock is more rich with gold, but also has more risk with one rock in every three tiles. Bedrock dirt contains 2s, 3s, and rocks. \nSome Claims have two slots available as there\u2019s still dirt left to dig, but others aren\u2019t as deep with just one slot. The first slot is symbolized by the Sun fully shown and it must be occupied before the second slot is reached. The second slot is symbolized by a Sun barely shown and not every Claim has one. When resolving a claim resolve the first slot then the second.\nThere are three river locations on the map with the action of cleaning out your box. The first two only contain one slot and the last contains two.\nThe Rivers - Cleanout your box and take any other actions applicable to that river\u2019s location.\nThe main action at the River will be cleaning out your box. This is done by flipping over the dirt tiles in your box one at a time. You may stop this action at any time, leaving unflipped dirt still in your box. When you flip over a tile, you'll find how much gold you've mined or if you've hit a rock! Every two rocks you reveal when cleaning out breaks one of your upgraded equipment\u2014forcing you to choose one to discard from your box. If no equipment is left to break then nothing happens when revealing rocks. \n  Different River locations also give an added benefit, but which one you choose will also be determined by the order you want to resolve your actions. Other benefits include:\nDraw two Saloon cards and keep one\nDraw one Saloon card\nTake the First Player Nugget\n  End of the Day\nOnce all actions have been resolved, moved the day tracker to the next day and begin a new day.\nEnd of the Game\nIf a day ends and any miner has at least 30 gold, then whoever has the most gold wins. If no one has hit 30 by the end of the Sunday then whoever has the most gold wins.\n Solo Play Overview\nWho would enjoy Claims of Gold?\nClaims of Gold is easy to pick up and play. We found that people who game casually have no problem easing into the mechanics and quickly having a great time. We also think there's enough going on here that gamers can have a hoot with it. In gamer terms, Claims of Gold offers a unique take on the worker placement genre by injecting action timing and press your luck into mix. It could work well as an opener to game night with or fitting it in on a lunch break. \nRetailers\nIf the Kickstarter is successful, we have plans to release games through normal distribution channels. Please check with your favorite distributor in order to pickup Claims of Gold once it's closer to the June release date.\n----- \nMusic in video by audionautix.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our third game we have Kickstarted.

Strategically position your gears to fix a mysterious clockwork machine in the corner of the workshop.\nCollect parts and build fantastical contraptions! Will the other tinkerers sabotage your efforts or will you earn the workshop owner's favor and become the master tinkerer?\nGearworks is:\nPuzzle-y. Players say it feels like Sudoku.\nBeautiful.\nAccessible to gamers and non-gamers alike.\nUnique in game mechanics and experience.\n  Build beautifully illustrated Contraptions.\n  Play as tinkerers with unique special abilities!\n  On your turn, play a gear card into an empty space in the play area.\nPlay a Gear card!\nThere are two placement rules. (1) Each column can only have one card of each color. (2) The cards in each row must be in either ascending or descending numerical order.\nIn column A, only a Gray or Blue card may be played in the empty space. Row 1 is in ascending order and Row 2 is in descending order.\nRotate the gear tokens in the corresponding column and row to point your player color toward the card you played.\nYour color is White, so you rotate the gears to point your color towards your Yellow 3.\nGain sparks by tinkering! You can choose any 2 of the cards closest to your played card in each of the four directions, then add them together or subtract one from the other. If the result equals the value of your played card, gain 1 spark. Sparks can be used to draw extra cards or even play on top of other cards.\nAdd or subtract 2 cards that are closest to your played card to gain a spark!\nAt the end of the round, collect parts for each column or row with your color pointed toward the play area. You can use them to build fantastical contraptions.\nCollect parts for A, C, and 1. Two of those parts can be used to build your mechanical bird!\nThe game lasts 3 rounds. At the end of the game, score points for contraptions you built, unused parts, and sparks.\nClick to download the latest rulebook!\n      Play Gearworks for FREE on Tabletopia!\n     You can create your own Contraption or put your name on an existing card!\n                                                                                  Click to read Benjamin's full review!\n          Click to read Eric's full review.\n    Click to read Kristi's full review.\n    Limited content.

During the game, players will use their action pool to move around the evocative maps, investigate mysteries, interact with their environment, and unleash powerful attacks and abilities unique to each character. Once selected, however, these abilities will be unavailable until that character\u2019s action pool has emptied \u2014 a process that becomes more challenging as that character gains fear.\nStory maps for Chapters 1 & 2 - Click to enlarge\n  Players live the adventure of Legends of Sleepy Hollow over eight chapters filled with mystery, suspense, and a deeply rich story. Each chapter is kept separate from the others so players will discover the secrets of Sleepy Hollow as they play. There are seven distinct maps in the game and each chapter unfolds and plays different than the last, so playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow feels much like playing eight different board games!\nNow that we've achieved our base funding goal we will be able to publish Legends of Sleepy Hollow at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff, like a stand-alone scenario and more Chapter game mats!\nThe mats will introduce the Heroic and Legendary difficulty levels so that players who have completed the game can try again with beastlier baddies and special conditions! The mats will be produced at the same factory as the base game, and on the same stock as the base game Standard mats. We've now unlocked enough of them so we will produce a whole mini-expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free!\nBackers at the \"Defender of Sleepy Hollow\" pledge level receive the core game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow, complete with 39 custom sculpted miniatures, nearly 200 cards, dozens of wooden tokens, premium player boards and maps, and more! Backers also receive the stand-alone game Lost in the Woods, which tells the prelude to the Legends of Sleepy Hollow story. Finally, backers at this level receive the Kickstarter set of promotional Hero Totem cards, and all applicable stretch goals!\n  Backers at the \"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" pledge level receive all of the \"Defender of Sleepy Hollow\" rewards, as well as a special hardcover book, American Gothic: The Art of Legends of Sleepy Hollow, filled with over 50 glossy, full-color pages of awesome art! Inside this book you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the Heroes, Foes, miniatures and more. Also, American Gothic will include the original short story by Washington Irving with special illustrations!\n      Three days after the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, four Tarry Town residents with strange ties to the supernatural venture into an ever-darkening Sleepy Hollow to uncover its mysteries.\nAs our story begins, the townsfolk of Sleepy Hollow have grown increasingly frightened by tales of dark creatures and ghouls haunting the hillsides. Some of the newer residents scoffed, calling it myth and superstition, but older settlers felt that something was out there lurking. Elijah Kappel could feel it, and he knew the elders were wise; he'd spent the past decade studying the old ways and customs, and could now interpret the hushed whispers of Old World folklore.\nElijah feared that Ichabod's disappearance was only the beginning of something sinister. He knew that even if it was old Brom Bones cavorting around the forest on horseback, his head tucked into his vest, that Elijah might need more than his faith and a trusty walking staff to confront such headstrong opposition. What he needed was someone more imposing than the town bully - perhaps someone who walked softly and carried a big shovel...\n  The Legends of Sleepy Hollow is an adventure game for 1 to 4 players featuring cooperative tactical missions and some \"legacy\" elements.\nChapter 1 set-up - Click to enlarge\n  Watch our rules video for an overview of gameplay:\nOr download our \"print and play\" version of Chapter 1, and try it out for yourself! Just be careful - there are SPOILERS! Please read the file marked READ_THIS_FIRST_Seriously before you look at anything else.\nIf you don't mind spoilers and you just want to see how Chapter 1 of the story plays out, check out our official playthrough:\n  Legends of Sleepy Hollow is a game of mystery and secrets, so many of you may wonder if the game is replayable after completing the game and revealing the story. The answer to that is a resounding YES. While players who have experienced the full story will know the surprise twists throughout the game, each Chapter is designed to be a variable experience each time you play. \nFor instance, during set-up in Chapter 1 the Discovery tokens are randomized so players may find the journals in different places each game. Each Chapter's game mat also has variable conditions such as unpredictable creature spawns, or random event actions.\nFinally, we have created advanced \"Heroic\" (hard) and \"Legendary\" (very hard) versions of each map! We will be offering PDFs of those maps after the game is produced, and sending professionally printed hard copies to each backer for free if we unlock those stretch goals!\nLegends of Sleepy Hollow comes with 7 different Chapter game maps, custom screen-printed dice, thick, layered player boards, tons of cards, 39 gorgeous miniatures, and more! Here\u2019s a complete run-down:\n16 thick, interlocking punchboard map tiles \n4 sculpted plastic Hero miniatures \n10 sculpted plastic Gobkins \n10 sculpted plastic Schrikroots \n15 sculpted plastic other miniatures (shhhh, it\u2019s a secret!)\n Over 140 Euro mini-sized cards with linen finish (for the Legends story deck, character Skills, Skill upgrades, Foe cards, more)\n Over 50 bridge-sized cards with linen finish (character equipment and proficiency upgrade cards) \n4 thick, layered player mats with wells for Action/Fear tokens and equipment/proficiency upgrade cards \n20 wooden Action tokens \n25 custom wooden Fear tokens \n6 custom screen-printed dice \n1 regular six-sided die \n40 thick punchboard Damage rings (attach to bottom of the miniature bases to track damage) \n12-page full color glossy rulebook \n24-page Storybook with thick card stock pages (contains Chapter details, story elements, and game mats) \n1 amazing box - check it out!\nAs a story-driven game, theme and atmosphere are key elements in the experience of playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow. We want you to feel as though you're a part of the world from the moment you pull the box off the shelf. We created this box to replicate an 1800s Dutch-style dresser chest, but with the unique whimsy and beauty that Abigail's art brings to the game. It's as if this relic was lifted directly from the in-game world to your game table. The box lid lifts open to reveal the game contents inside - just as if you were in the game unlocking Ichabod's chest to see what mysteries it holds. The box lid hinges with support from ribbons connecting the inside of the lid to the base. Double-walled interior elements make the box extra sturdy and create a smooth, tight seal when the lid is dropped down. We even included artistic details such as hinges and a front lock!\nSamples of Legend deck, Foes, and starting Hero Skills - Click to enlarge\n  Legends of Sleepy Hollow will have more awesome features inside the box - and we can't even show you all of them... that'd spoil the story and half the fun!\nFirst up, the game will include 39 highly-detailed miniatures designed by Francesco Orr\u00fa and based on character artist Abigail Larsen's concepts. You can check out the four main Hero sculpts below, and get a closer look at the Gobkins and Schrikroots that will be battling our heroes - at least in Chapter 1!\nHero mini samples - click to enlarge\n            Each Hero and Foe miniature has a punchboard ring that attaches to the bottom of the figure and is secured by a plastic base. Tracking health is as simple as turning the ring to the appropriate amount. Some Foes may have special damage track rings that activate abilities - but you'll have to wait and find that out on your own!\nAnother great feature is the Hero player boards. These are made of layered punchboard with recessed wells for Action/Fear tokens, equipment and weapon proficiency upgrades, and a raised surface with room to tuck Skill and Item cards underneath!\n   All backers of Legends of Sleepy Hollow will get some awesome extras!\nFirst off, backers at both pledge levels will also receive the fully-produced solo card game Lost in the Woods, designed by Robert Johnson! The game will retail for $9.95 after the campaign, but it will be sent for free to all backers!\nLost in the Woods is set on the eve of Ichabod Crane's fateful ride home at the end of the original story of Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Players must guide Ichabod from the Van Tassel mansion through the forest to the covered bridge before time runs out and the Headless Horseman chases him down. Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!\nIf you'd like to try Lost in the Woods yourself, you can download the print-and-play files right here!\nHere's an overview of how Lost in the Woods plays!\nNext, every backer will receive a set of personal Totem cards that will not be available in the retail version of Legends of Sleepy Hollow. \nPromotional personal Totem cards - Click to enlarge\n  If the players wish, each character may start the game with their personal Totem card in Inventory. The card may be played from Inventory at any time to resuscitate the character if they have been incapacitated, returning them to full Health and with 2 Fear on the next turn. These cards are useful for lowering the difficulty of the game for more casual groups, or for when things get really heated around Chapter 4!\nKevin and Melissa Delp of Tantrum House took a look at Legends of Sleepy Hollow, and they loved it!\nBeasts of War plays the first chapter of Legends of Sleepy Hollow in Legendary mode! Beware, there are SPOILERS!\nJonathan and Will from Roll For Crit produced an excellent preview video and gave Legends of Sleepy Hollow their official seal of approval!\nBell of Lost Souls did a live runthrough of Chapter 1 on Twitch, and they had a great time!\nBoard Game Gumbo interviewed game developer & lead storyteller Chris Kirkman about the game, the story, stretch goals, and more!\nLinks to Media & quotes about Legends of Sleepy Hollow:\n\"Like classic cooperative and dungeon crawl games, you\u2019ll find yourself trying to use your actions efficiently and working with your teammates to optimize your turns. With its goth horror storytelling and the tension created by the game\u2019s turns, your group will soon be overwhelmed by creatures who move with zombie-like relentlessness. You may not complete your quest on your first attempt, but like any good game, you\u2019ll be quick to try again.\" - Ruel Gaviola, Geek & Sundry \n\"The Legend is real! Story-based gameplay and replayability combine into one mythical gaming experience in the Legends of Sleepy Hollow. Your gaming table will thank you for this one... it definitely earned a spot on my game shelf!\" - Becca Kaufeld, Game Trade Magazine\nHaving played Chapter 1: \u201cAsymmetrical powers? A story to uncover? Secret envelopes to open? And a dude dropping baddies with a shovel!?! What's there not to be excited about???\" - Rob and Christina Rouse, Blue Peg Pink Peg podcast\n\"If you like classic horror, if you like intrigue, and if you have been looking for a well-done campaign game that doesn\u2019t pull any punches and keeps you engaged throughout the entire story, then you want to go look at their Kickstarter page and back it.\" - Marti Wormuth, Open Seat Gaming\n\"When I played solo, however, the game felt like a turn-based tactical video game, such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, where I was the tactician, in control of the actions of all of the heroes. Despite controlling multiple characters, playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow solo gave me a similar feeling that I had playing Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and I feel it will likely appeal to those that play AH:CG solo for its story-driven, exploratory horror experience.\" - Eric Buscemi, The Cardboard Hoard\n\"I won't spoil the events that take place after completing the team's objective, but if it's anything close to the events of the other seven missions, I expect Legends of Sleepy Hollow will provide ample opportunities for twists and exciting storytelling. Another thing driving story and replayability is once a mission is accomplished, players can choose an additional skill or upgrade their equipment to progress their character and make them more valuable for future missions. I love this inclusion, and I think it will add a lot to keep players engaged, ready to test their new skills on new foes.\" - Chris Hecox, Geeks Under Grace \n\"By the end of our play through, I was genuinely impressed with how well Sleepy Hollow seems to add new content and challenges, and will continue to do so into later chapters.\" - Wyatt Krause, Sprites + Dice\n\"I like how the players have to make their choices with limits, forcing each player to carefully consider possible outcomes. I also like that you can see doom approaching. This helped me and the rest of the players make better choices, while not ever feeling like the game was going easy on us.\" - Father Geek Approved!\n  More to come!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping. For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties.\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive.

However, based on our recent experiences delivering Kickstarter campaigns, we have come up with what we believe is a realistic timeline for this campaign. It doesn't mean that nothing will go wrong, but it will give you a guideline of what to expect. If anything comes up that causes this timeline to slip, we'll explain it in an update.

Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect.

COMPLETE?? ALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!!\nI cant believe it.\n  Direwild is a 1-4 player game where player's assume the role of Animists, heroes that can summon forth creatures great and small to aide them in battle. These heroes must band together and defeat minions across several lands in order to ultimately defeat a fallen member of their own order, Karn. \nLovingly crafted over 5 years,\nDirewild has been meticulously designed, and is 100% finalized and ready for the public! Direwild features beautiful art from the masterful Kelly Goodine. His credits include Marvel Comics and Bioware! As with any Kickstarter worth their salt, we have our manufacturing and shipping all ready and waiting!\nYeah, this game has red pandas. Deal with it.\nOur design was solidified a few years back, and we have been playtesting the game since, with about 300 playtests done at various gaming conventions!\n    A completely co-operative adventure. No dungeon master! All the players must operate as a team to overcome the game.\nA strategic deckbuilding experience that allows the players many avenues to spend their currency outside of simply \"buying a card, putting it in my discard\"\nA creature crafting system that takes the animals a hero summons each turn and forms them into a unique creature to bring into battle!\nA magic system that promotes team play\n5 clans with unique male and female heroes on either side, bringing together 10 playable heroes, each with their own synergies and strengths\nThe dungeon crawling aspect that has the heroes move tactically around the board, using the land and walls to their advantage, getting the jump on enemies, and picking up treasure.\nSome brutal boss fight mechanics!\nA save system that allows you to put your hero's deck in a deckbox and save your campaign over multiple game nights\nMassive replayability.The minions, creatures, treasures, and clan mixes will dramatically vary every game, so the experience is always fresh and new strategies must be developed.\nDynamic options and inter-player turn interaction allows players to make tactical choices, but restricts any player from calling all the shots.\nCheck out our rule books!\nWe split them into a setup book and a gameplay book. The gameplay book is built to learn as you play!\nClick on us to read the rules!\n      The land of Direwild has always been hostile.\nAll the creatures found here can be deadly in their own right. The tenuous balance between creatures and humans are maintained through the powers of ancient tribal animists. These animists commune with the creatures of Direwild, creating a symbiotic relationship between the human clans and their environments.\nWhile the tribes lived in harmony with the Direwild, they were constantly at war with one another. One such war led to the annihilation of a complete tribe with the only remaining survivor being a young animist in training, Karn. This animist, overcome with loss and hatred, sought to end the tribal warfare by ruling the Direwild. Karn left his home and relentlessly sought out ways to push the limits of his powers, embracing the dangerous dark arts, untouched by other animists. In this pursuit of dominance, Karn sacrificed any sense of his previous humanity. His mind was slowly corrupted, and his goals transitioned from ruling the Direwild to destroying it. The creatures he communes with have been warped and distorted into dangerous minions. They in turn roam the land, further ravaging the Direwild.\nBrimming with newfound power, Karn began hunting and destroying any potential rival animists. Desperate, the remaining clans formed an alliance, gathering their few remaining animists to work together in an attempt to defeat Karn. The creatures of the land, instinctively realizing that their fate is interwoven with these heroes, allow the animists to call on them to aid in the fight. The heroes journey will take them through lands scourged by Karn\u2019s minions, with the goal of defeating them and weakening Karn\u2019s power. The heroes must work quickly, because spending too much time clearing the lands could allow Karn to hunt them down and destroy them before they are strong enough to stand a chance!\n                These miniatures are so awesome\nDue to a huge amount of fan feedback, we are designing the miniatures for all 10 heroes, Karn, and the 4 minion totems - that's 15 miniatures! We have an accomplished miniature artist Michael Jenkins making some truly awesome miniatures! His credits include: Blood Rage, Rising Sun, Warmachine, Hordes, Undercity, Widower's Wood, Level 7: Invasion, Banner Saga: Warbands, The Others: 7 Sins,Clash of Rage, Outlive, and Dark Souls. We are super lucky to be working with such a talent!\nMiniatures are not required to play the game, and the game comes with 2d standees and bases that you can use in the adventure.\nTake a look at some of the miniatures below, and we will unveil more as the Kickstarter progresses!\n  Just of few of whats in store\nWhat if I want to add miniatures to my Standard Game later?\nNo problem. If you want to turn a Standard game into a Premium game later, we will have an add-on to upgrade. When the campaign ends, just add the \"Miniatures Upgrade\" in the Pledge Manager. Keep in mind if you have the Premium game already we cannot sell you additional miniatures nor can we sell the miniatures only.\n Karn, the Immortal\nPLAY\n\n Syl, from Clan Stormbringer\nPLAY\n\n Vail, from the Clan Shadowleaf\nPLAY\n\n Esma, from the Clan Bloodmaker\nPLAY\n\n    Each round starts with the Game Phase, in which the AI controls all enemy actions\nAfter this phase is over, players will pick turn order and then all draw 5 cards.\nIn the Summon Phase each player will take turns playing all the cards in their hand. Any creature with an action will perform that action when their card is played.\nIn the Charm Phase each player counts up the Charm generated by their cards and uses it to purchase creatures and unlock upgrades for the team. They then take the cards they played and create a single creature!\nIn the Battle Phase each player takes their creature and moves around the board, collecting treasure and attempting to defeat enemies in battle!\nThen all players discard their played cards and begin a new round\nThis is a creature card\nYou will collect these over the course of the game. They are the foundation of your power!\nThis is a minion card\nThey are the servants of Karn, and you must defeat them in order to face him!\n *Click here to see the graphic design journey of these cards*\n   ALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!!\n   Purchasing either of these add-ons will award you with 2 free promo puppy cards!\nThese promo cards will not be part of the normal game or a KS exclusive, the only way to get them is to get an add-on (even the dice). These pups do not change the game in any way, they just have unique artwork and would just be used to replace one of the other stock pups.\nIf enough people order the insert add-on (150+) we can reduce the price even further ($19.99). I will keep you updated of the amount of people that pledged the insert so we can keep a count.\nCheck out the review below!\n        click here to read Druid City's review!\n      Review coming soon!\n                 Shipping is an interesting monster, and we considered the best method that is the most accurate and fair. Due to the nature of Kickstarter, it is hard to know the final cost of shipping until all the stretch goals have been tallied and final weight can be considered. Rather than taking a  guess, we plan to accurately charge for shipping after the campaign ends during the pledge manager. We will then charge you based on your location and weight of the final order. We have partnered with Ship Naked to handle fulfillment for Direwild. Because of this, we are happy to offer Worldwide Customs Friendly Shipping. If for any reason, you encounter any surprise customs charges during fulfillment, contact us at ironhordegames@gmail.com and we will take care of it. Simple.\nAs of now, the game is roughly 7 lbs (there is a lot of game in here). We estimate the following costs per game:\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been part of Kickstarter teams that have developed many products, but this is the first time I am running all aspects of the Kickstarter. I of course have contacts from my career that have thus far made the design process go very smooth, and I have been very active in mitigating risks for the production side of the equation. As of now, I have samples coming in from my factories, and will be ahead of the curve when the Kickstarter ends. \n\nI have worked in miniature development before and I am happy to have Michael Sculptor on my team, an experienced miniatures creator who is very practiced at developing tool safe sculpts that should make the path from CAD to parts smooth.\n\nAs far as fulfillment goes, I am working with Ship Naked to take care of all my shipping and customs problems. Their experience has already proven invaluable with regards of saving money in the shipping pipeline. \n \nI have had a ton of experience manufacturing overseas, and the biggest obstacle will always be timing when it comes to manufacturing in China. As a product designer, I have manufactured many products and even visited a few of the factories I will be using. I hope to mitigate any risk by having several factories that have overlapping capabilities in case one cannot produce results. As they say, don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nThe game is 100% finished. We have been blind testing it at conventions for about 1 year now and things are rock solid. The stretch goal content has not been completely worked out, but the large majority of the gameplay impacts (new creatures and new minions) have been calculated and only need flavor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Direwild name", "descp": "Pledge here if you want to keep up with how the campaign is progressing before you decide!

Reminder: Ship Naked is our shipping partner for the US and several other countries: Argentina / Bolivia / Brazil / Canada / Chili / Costa Rica / Mexico / Peru / St Pierre et Miquelon / Puerto Rico / Uruguay.\n\nHowever, the shipping process to these destinations has only started a few days ago, on mixed orders (more than one copy, add-ons, etc.).

The Halloween delivery date we all hoped for hasn't been met, making us late on our promises. Even though the whole team has been working really hard on the game for over a year now, shipping to these destinations is the only thing we can't control and this definitely spoils the fun for us as well. \n\nWe thank you for understanding we can\u2019t make the process go any faster than its current pace, and we sincerely apologize for the situation.\n\nWe hope you'll all be able to play Monster slaughter next week, as promised by Ship Naked.  \n\nOnce more, our apologies about the situation.\n\nWe thank you all for your patience and understanding."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #79", "update_userinfo": "The Download Update", "update_content": "Hello, Monsters!  \nAs Monster Slaughter is progressively making its way into your hands, we can\u2019t thank you enough for making this game a reality.

It will also be easy to flatpack and put away back in the deluxe add-ons box.

You will be able to see the values easily and has a slot for each die.\nStickers: Used to number the ambulances so you know which ambulance should hold which dice and determines initiative for the upgrade section of the round.\nBox: the deluxe edition add-on comes in it's own box (which will have a slightly different illustration than the base game).\nThe reward levels available\n  Experimental chemistry expansion pack\nWhat it adds to the base game\nThis mini expansion pack offers a new style of upgrade tiles and specialists. While retaining the euro-style control of the base game dice manipulation, the expansion offers an alternative way to manipulate tiles. Essentially the tiles and specialists upgrades may change the value of the dice by going down a step (clinical trials), re-rolling dice (experimental drugs), and swapping values (transplants). This gives a much more versatile feel to the game and actually introduces really interesting levels of strategy that even we find to be novel each time we play it when combo'd with tiles/specialists from the base game! Please see below for how to play the base game and overviews. \nYour face (or friend/family) in the game\nThis can be anyone that gives you permission to use their face in the game. It will be at least for the first print run, but may be forever depending on circumstances. Importantly, their face will be in every single copy of the game! Children can be added, but we will need to draw them as adults since it won't fit well with the game otherwise.\n Since we have hit \u00a330,000 - this is:\nFree promo card! (purchasable afterwards)\n  We've now hit the \u00a3125k stretch goal which means each colour meeple will receive a different print of a doctor/nurse on it!\nWatch the preview from the Dice Tower! \n  Worker placement and dice manipulation mechanics\nAs far as we are aware this is the first game to combine worker placement-like mechanics with dice manipulation. It is also the first to use dice as patients were the pip value represents the die's health levels. Something our playtesters loved! \nBeautiful art with isometric style rooms\nWe asked famous board game artist Sabrina Miramon to illustrate Dice Hospital by drawing isometric rooms to give that 3d-like effect as well as the characters. The final product is something, we think, of beauty. Not only that, Sabrina did a great job recreating each room type as realistically as possible!\nDoctor meeples!\nWe asked playtesters what they wanted most as a stretch goal and they said doctor meeples. So we said, what the heck, lets just do it anyway! The result is really cool doctor meeples that you use as your workers to activate your rooms.\nOne of very few hospital games accessible to most gamer types\nWe feel Dice Hospital appeals to both light gamers, euro gamers and medium-heavy weight gamers. The beauty of the game is the simplicity of choices which allows accessibility to light gamers, but the very much forward planning and \"thinky\" requirements which will appeal to euro gamers and medium-heavy weight gamers.\nCo-designed and developed by an established designer\nMike Nudd, an established designer in his own right, worked with original designer Stanislav Kordonskiy to design the game. Given Mike's breadth of experience having designed the popular dice placement game Waggle Dance and CCG Game Vampire: The Eternal Struggle it ensures the game is mechanically sound, fun and balanced so that it's replayable time and time again!\nPrototype copy of Dice Hospital\n    Download the basic rulebook. Final version (with graphics design work and editing) coming soon.\n  FRENCH AND GERMAN RULEBOOKS NOW AVAILABLE! \nDOWNLOAD FRENCH VERSION HERE\nDOWNLOAD GERMAN VERSION HERE \nOther languages are planned as well as using final graphics design for the non-english rulebooks. \nWatch a 3 minute overview thanks to Slicker Drips\n        Players start with their own hospital board, 3 randomly dealt dice (pip values 3/4/5) and 3 starting nurses \nEach round sees randomly rolled dice placed on ambulances from low to high - which is placed by the first player, with tied (but different coloured) dice being decided by the last player \nStarting from the first player going clockwise players pick ambulance cards. The lower the number ambulance card the more likely you are to go first for an upgrade (and a bloog bag token and the first player token). The trade-off is that lower value dice are harder to treat.\nStarting with the player with the lowest value ambulance, each player then gets to decide which one of the face up upgrades they take for their own hospital.\nSimultaneously, players then activate their hospitals by moving their own nurse meeples onto action spots on their hospital and manipulating the dice. The more dice discharged (value of 7) in a single round the more points scored. \nOne of the best features of the game is the ability to combo rooms with specialists when you have built up an awesome hospital!  \n   A more detailed playthrough is shown thanks to Slicker Drips which can be watched in the solo playthrough section below. Essentially, the game becomes a lot harder, something we purposefully did. Essential differences are:\nMedical Report cards \nThese are cards supplied with the base game, which players are dealt at the beginning of the game. Players are randomly dealt 6 of these cards of which they are laid out face up in a 2x3 configuration. Only the bottom 3 cards are accessible in the first instance. The medical report cards state which dice you must discharge to gain that bonus written on the card. Once the player has discharged those dice that match a medical report card (or multiple if possible) those cards are discarded, scored on the tracker, and the cards directly above drop down to become available. At the end of the game, any medical report cards that remain unscored score negative points equal to that stated on the cards themselves\nDice drafting is from the bag, not the ambulance draft \nAs of now, we feel that this is the best system as it gives the most amount of difficulty since you have no control over the dice you receive. The 3 drawn dice are then rolled, with 1s and 6s re-rolled and placed into your wards. However, we are testing whether easier variants may be played that is not this strict. Right now, we are testing 1 die of your choice being drawn with the other 2 being random. We are also testing to see whether dice discharged are not put back in the bag as in the multiplayer variant so that players my gauge what dice are left in the bag.\nDrafting of specialists is limited \nWe say this because only 1 of each type of upgrade is revealed each turn. While you can pick whichever upgrade you wish, since the rate at which you go through the deck, is lower than that of the multiplayer version, specialists may only be useful at certain times of the game. We are, however, testing an easier variant where the duplicates of the tiles and specialists are removed making control of the dice much easier to anticipate - especially for more experienced players.\n  Download a basic and printer friendly version of the print and play file\n Please note, the print and play file is not the final art of the game, since we wanted to make it printer friendly. Each room and specialist will see unique art too. It is more to give an indication of how the game plays instead!\n    Solo playthrough with Slicker Drips\n    What reviewers thought of Dice Hospital\n  Some of the reviewers who have or will review the game\n   Please note in this review 1s are incorrectly described as going to the morgue and 6s are discharged. Dice must go to 0 to be sent to the morgue and 7 to be discharged. Otherwise, Rahdo gives an excellent description of the game! \n          Add on Cauldron Master - our last game to your pledge!\n  Please message us once you have added on Cauldron Master\nCauldron Master funded on kickstarter earlier this year and is running low on stocks of an initial 1000 copy print run. It is a light, fast but deep set collection, push your luck and slightly social deduction game that has proved popular with families and gamers who like a nice easy game to start their game night.

To that end please back us at the \u00a31 tier, message us and we will send you our excellently priced retailer rates!\nDice Hospital has been rigorously tested\nSince Stanislav made the original version of Dice Hospital (known firstly as \"Stat!\") in 2015 the game has been rigorously tested, blindly playtested and tested some more! Alley Cat Games signed up the game in winter 2016 and got Mike Nudd involved in early 2017 to develop and design the game further. \nWe have spent a huge amount of time and effort locally playtesting and lots of hours with blind playtesters rigorously testing the game and rulebook for us - this is testament to the 1000 member Dice Hospital facebook group in which we've had over 50 different groups playing the game and sending us detailed feedback. \nWe believe we have got to place now where the game is excellent, balanced, replayable, and most importantly: FUN! \nSome of our various blind and local playtests!\n  Transparency guarantee\nJust like our previous games which we kickstarted: Lab Wars and Cauldron Master, we kept backers informed of any problems, issues, and of course good news we had along the way to fulfilling the game to backers. \n Delivered on time\nAgain, our last two games were delivered on time and before retailers received their copies. In fact, Cauldron Master was delivered 2 months before our expected delivery date!\nWorld class manufacturing\nFor this project, we are using Longpack which produced a wide array of games including Unfair, Robinson Crusoe, and Queendomino. We have already received an early prototype of an early version of the game from Longpack and the standard of this was very very high. Their communication has been excellent as well as having been recommended by other world renowned creators.\nOverview of manufacturing and fulfillment \nWe will give ourselves a month or two to prepare the final artwork (custom and legendary medics) as well as the rulebook. Taking us to the end of December at worst. \nAt this point (late Dec-early Jan) we will submit the files to Longpack for approval. \nIt'll then take a 2-4 weeks to produce a pre-production copy of the game for our approval - reaching late Jan-early Feb. \nIt'll then take 8-10 weeks to manufacture the games, taking us to early April. \nThey will then be loaded onto ships bound for the USA, UK and Australia. Each will take approximately 4-6 weeks to reach their destinations taking us to May. \nThen fulfillment to you will take 1-4 weeks once they have reached their destinations and passed through customs! Meaning (hopefully if all goes to plan) it'll reach backers in June. This is what we call moderate case scenario - where worst will be August - hence why the date we have put on the expected shipment date as August. \nSince the game is quite large and heavy we will be providing subsidized shipping. We will be using the infamous \"Stegmaier\" method of shipping to different regional fulfillment warehouses around the world. We will be using ShipNaked/Funagain in the USA, GamesQuest in the UK and AetherWorks in Australia. \nUSA, UK and most EU shipping will also have the extra benefit of being tracked (wherever possible.) \nAlso as stated above, a small minority of non UK and US countries will need a to pay a little bit extra for orders with the expansion pack. This is because the combined package goes over the \"dreaded\" 2kg limit making postage much more expensive. We've kept prices as low as possible and taking into consideration VAT for EU countries. For full details click on the tier and select your country.\nSince we have had issues in the past with the following countries: we will be using special couriers which are tracked and insured against loss and theft. The price here is the price we pay to send it to you. Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Columbia, Peru, Puerto Rico are in this list.\nPlease read the FAQ for full details\nWe wanted to make the game as visually appealing to everyone as possible, while also making sure our colour-blind friends could also enjoy the game without having to ask what colour each component was.

Caezar also works as the official kickstarter campaign manager for Sierra Madre Games, with their first kickstarter launch: Bios:Genesis 2nd edition, raising $309,000. We have recently expanded our freelance network (of note, hiring Sabrina Miramon at our offices as our Art Director and Brett Gilbert as our co-lead developer) and have offices based in Hertfordshire, UK. We plan to release 4 games in 2018 having already signed up/ close to signing up 4-6 games. We are also in talks to take multiple multi million dollar licenses which we hope to conclude by the end of 2017 in preparation for 2018.

Roll, Treat, Discharge!"}}, {"backer": "Chad Elkins", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "DinoGenics is a worker placement game where players compete to build the most successful and profitable dinosaur park. Each player takes on the role of a multi-billion dollar corporation, each with access to their private island park. Over the course of seven seasons, players will send workers to the nearby mainland to collect resources such as DNA, fences and other necessities needed to run a successful park.  \n\nOnce a player has assembled their resources, they get to choose how to layout their individual parks and decide which dinosaurs they will attempt to house. Parks with the most prestigious dinosaurs will attract the most visitors, but remember, dinosaurs have a mind of their own and if neglected or improperly penned, they will attempt to escape and spread havoc.\n    DinoGenics plays out over 7 seasons, each composed of an Open Season and an Upkeep phase. During the Open Season phase, players will attract visitors based on the reputation of their individual parks. Reputation in DinoGenics is decided primarily by the types of dinosaurs a park contains; in general, the more dangerous the dinosaur, the more exciting it will be for visitors and increase your reputation the most.\nThe T-Rex is one of the most valuable dinosaurs when it comes to reputation, unfortunately it also requires the largest habitat and consumes more meat per season than any other dinosaur.\nReputation is important because the more visitors your park attracts the more money you will receive in a season. Reputation also determines player order, with the highest reputation park owners deciding where they send workers before lesser parks.\nPlayers take turns assigning their workers to action spaces on the mainland board based on their reputation order. Once a worker is placed, a player immediately pays any associated costs and receives the benefit of the chosen Action Space.\nDNA cards are just one of the resources that can be collected by workers. Turn in a complete set of DNA at the DinoGenics research facility to produce a matching dinosaur.\nMainland action spaces are limited. Players need to prioritize when and where they send their workers to get the best results. Having a bunch of high value carnivores is great until you don\u2019t have enough meat to feed them. Once all players have assigned all of their workers, play progresses to the Upkeep Phase.\nPlacing workers during the open season allows players to produce new dinosaurs, arrange fences or buy facilities.\nDuring the Upkeep Phase each park owner must attempt to feed any carnivores in his or her park. Failure to feed carnivores or properly pen dinosaurs will result in the potential destruction of park facilities or the death of visitors.\nA focus on lower value herbivores can help you avoid high meat upkeep costs, but keep a close on your competitors. If they build heavy into carnivores, they will easily outpace you in reputation.\nFollowing the feeding step, all visitors are returned to the main stockpile and any building resources or benefits are generated.  \nAt this point, the game will advance to the next season.\nAs a game of DinoGenics progresses, limited action spaces such as the Farm and the Uplink become highly contested. It is important to plan your turns in advance to prevent being blocked.\n  Mutants on their own are not worth much but if you combo them with the right facilities you can make them pay off as much as more popular dinosaurs.\n  Image is updated daily (Last Update: 11/1/17)\n Find us on Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Boardgamegeek.\n  Want to find out more about how DinoGenics plays? You can download a digital copy of the current rulebook by clicking the rulebook graphic below. Please be aware that rulebook artwork and layout are still a work in progress and subject to change.\n    After numerous requests, we have decided to offer the most requested item from our first campaign. If you are interested in purchasing an additional set of Dinosaur Meeples, add the listed dollar amount to your Kickstarter pledge total. When the Pledge Manager is sent out, you will have the option to choose where the extra money was spent.\nDinoMeeps add-on includes 6x of each normal dinosaur and 10x mutants.\n    A render of one of the Double Layered Island Board now included with every copy of the game.\n  DinoGenics now includes 20 custom Goat meeples with every copy of the game.\n  Prototype of the Upgraded Fence Stretch Goal.\n            We\u2019ve been in close communications with our manufacturer and shipping company to reduce game weight and keep the associated shipping costs down. In order to make sure that these costs are as low as possible we are going to be charging shipping after the campaign ends.  Backers will gain access to our Pledge Manager by email roughly two months after this campaigns completion.\nThe below numbers are our best shipping estimates as of September 26, 2017 and may fluctuate slightly between now and the time we ship, but we are confident these numbers will be accurate within a couple dollars.\n\u2022 US - $12  \n\u2022 CA - $14  \n\u2022 EU - $15  \n\u2022 Non EU Europe - $17\n\u2022 AU - $15 \n\u2022 NZ - $23 \n\u2022 Everywhere Else - $34\nAlso, in an effort to help backers in  more expensive regions, we are offering a group pledge level. If you can find a person to split a two pack of the game with you, shipping becomes dramatically lower per person.  The below prices are costs per \"2-pack\" of DinoGenics.\n\u2022 US - $15 \n\u2022 CA - $17\n\u2022 EU - $18\n\u2022 Non EU Europe - $22\n\u2022 AU - $18\n\u2022 NZ - $28\n\u2022 Everywhere Else - $37", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a relaunch of DinoGenics, which we first brought to Kickstarter in August. During our first campaign, we learned a lot about how Kickstarter works as well as the limitations of the platform. Now, we are returning with a stronger understanding of the platform and our audience. We have also doubled down on our artwork and will have a number of new pieces to share with you in the coming days.\n\nDinoGenics has been in development for over three years and we have finally brought it to a point where we feel it is ready for the public. Now, as we are nearing the finish line we need the little extra push that only Kickstarter can provide.\n\nAs it stands currently, the game has been in controlled playtesting for about two years and started blind-playtesting about eight months ago. Game art assets are about 85% complete and we have two great illustrators waiting on standby to finish production. Once the remaining artwork is commissioned everything will receive a final coat of polish and then it will be sent off to our manufacturer.\n\nOn the production side of things, we have chosen to go with Panda Games Manufacturing. Panda has been great to work with since the early days of our collaboration and has already provided us with some phenomenal production samples. With their help, we are confident that we can deliver a high quality product to rival anything put out by a major publisher.\n\nOne final hurdle is the matter of fulfillment time-frame and shipping. We have tacked on an extra couple months to our fulfillment timeline to accommodate any production delays. In addition, we have partnered with a shipping distributor that will provide customs friendly shipping to most of the world. Once manufacturing is complete, the game will be delivered to local hubs all around the world.\n\nAll of this said we are realistic and believe in complete transparency. If unforeseen delays occur, we are determined to keep our backers informed every step of the way.

In addition to riffing around the fretboard, guitarists can score points by completing Chord Cards. \nEveryone starts the game with three random Chord Cards but can obtain more during the game. Playing a second variation of the same chord proves you are a skilled guitarist and triggers the Re-Chord score.  \nOnce the first four frets have been filled with guitar picks, the game ends and guitarists tally up their jam sessions. The guitarist and genre with the most total popularity wins and gets to play air guitar to any song of their choosing (*or just says good game and respectfully helps put the game back in its beautiful box.)\nRe-Chord has been in Development for over a year, PAX South 2017 players enjoyed even the earliest version.\n                    The Re-Chord Soloist mode puts solo players up against three varying levels of difficulty.

Above you see the Blue pick MOVING another pick to an open location.\nBlue picks allow a guitarist to move or SWAP any other pick(s).

Yanaguana Games has published two titles previously and know the manufacturing process and the challenges that can arise. We've made the majority of the mistakes on our own dime which allows us to maximize your support by efficiently getting a great game delivered to you, the amazing backer. We've also partnered with Kickstarter Expert Daniel Zayas to help us avoid common pitfalls and mistakes we may not have been aware of. \n\nThere are a few unique risks with Re-Chord that could always produce unknown issues, but the most apparent is the use of custom guitar picks. We've worked with our manufacturing partner to ensure they are prepared to produce these for us. The process of producing picks can however take a bit longer than wooden meeples or laser cut chit board which is reflected in our estimated delivery date. \n\nWe want to deliver the best quality game to you as fast as possible. If we can expedite any part of the process without sacrificing quality it will be a priority. \n\nWe want to thank you for putting your trust in our team.

See special UK and Eu Pledge Levels!\nIt\u2019s time to build another treehouse!  \nIn the new stand-alone sequel to the Golden Geek Nominated Best Treehouse Ever (Best Card Game, Best Family Game, 2015), Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun, players compete to build their best treehouse, outfitting their treehouse with cool rooms, and creating fun habitats for their favorite furry and feathered friends, while also making sure that their tree doesn't tip over and that their rooms are more impressive than all of their friends' rooms at the end of the game.  \nIn addition, our treehouse builders have leveled up their experience by visiting new locations in the forest that provide special abilities to help them in their new build. Building takes place over three weeks/rounds, and in each round, players use card drafting and spatial reasoning to add five new rooms to their treehouse. Players must pay attention to the other treehouses being built since they take turns determining which types of rooms score for everyone at the end of each round. At the end of the third week, the winner is the player with the best treehouse ever!  \nBut the best part? Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun can be combined with Best Treehouse Ever to play up to 8 players!\nBest Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun is a game for 2 to 4 players (or up to 8 when combined with Best Treehouse Ever), ages 10 and up and is designed by Scott Almes.  \nWhere it all started! Best Treehouse Ever has since been published in 7 different languages around the world!\n   ALL New Room Cards featuring illustrations by Claire Donaldson (Go Nuts For Donuts)!\nAnimal Cards to add to your treehouse for new scoring possibilities!\nForest Cards!

The game includes 60 Room Cards, 12 Animal Cards, 10 Forest Cards, 4 Starting Tree Cards, 6 Scoring Cards, 8 Game Changer Cards, 4 Scoring Tokens, 4 Balance Markers, and a Folding Score Board!\n                    You may add up to 2 additional copies of Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun to your Basic, Basic PLUS, Deluxe, or Deluxe PLUS pledge level for the following prices:\nUS: $23 each.\nCanada/Everywhere Else: $30 each.\n       And here's a better look at that custom playmat that's included with the Deluxe pledge levels. It can be used with Best Treehouse Ever or Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun.\n  Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US except those going to the UK and EU which will be shipped from the UK. \nUK and EU copies will be shipping from within the UK with VAT paid!\n Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.  \nAdded Shipping: US $4-8, Canada, UK, and EU-$13 (See Special UK and EU Pledge Level), Everywhere Else-$20 \nNote: International Backers outside of the UK and EU will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. \nWe have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the recent rate increase in the US Postal Service and the increased box size and weight of this game. We must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe understand that shipping to our international friends can be cost prohibitive and that others have found creative ways to mitigate some of this cost. As a small company that handles our own fulfillment, we simply pass our shipping cost on to our backers. In addition, it is our goal to continue to develop our network of awesome international partners that we have worked with to localize Best Treehouse Ever for game markets around the world. So far these partnerships have led to Best Treehouse Ever being published in Russian, Ukrainian, Taiwanese, Chinese, German, Dutch, and French.\nWe are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game below MSRP. We'll also be adding some extra content and component upgrades at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course). \nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Best Treehouse Ever: Forest of Fun that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components and increasing replayability with added game content.  \nWe have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a look at what's to come with YOUR help:\n                           A sample of our even more cuddly new bear icon!\n  Get invovled in the discussion to help us choose new Promo Room Ideas HERE!\n Tiles unlocked!\n          We think this game is GREAT but don't just take our word for it!

Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. With creatures and cunning, you'll rule a fantastic forest kingdom in the ultimate asymmetric game of adventure and war.\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her iron rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Woodland Alliance will seek to strengthen their presence by building hideouts and launching missions to subvert the rule of the cats.\nIn this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the Vagabonds, who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander whom they hope will lead their faction to reclaim their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\n(Note: prototype board and pieces)\nRoot is the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like in Vast: the Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible. \nIn Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!\nRoot is designed by Cole Wehrle (Pax Pamir, An Infamous Traffic, and John Company) and brought to life by master illustrator Kyle Ferrin (Vast: The Crystal Caverns, Vast: The Fearsome Foes, Stitches).\nThe Marquise directs her cats to build up her frontier economy while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting and guarding her wood supplies, the Marquise must build workshops, lumber mills, and recruiters while crafting valuable infrastructure improvements.\nThe Eyrie muster their hawks to take back the woods. They must build roosts and capture as much territory as possible before they collapse back into squabbling and turmoil, choosing a new commander to guide them.\nThe Alliance hide in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build toward a dramatic late-game presence\u2014but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.\nThe Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for his own gain. He aids or fights other factions to earn their trust or ire, while picking through forest ruins in search of new equipment, all in service of his hidden, mysterious quest.\nRewards shipping to addresses within Australia, Canada, the EU, and the US will be shipped from within those countries.\nInternational shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping.

You and your fellow players run competing gin joints vying to be the talk of the town! Willie \"The Lion\" Smith is at the piano, jazz is in the air, Chaplin just walked up to the bar, and the flappers are starting to dance. Life is good. This is the story of Speakeasy Blues.\n  Roll The Bones, Stake Your Claims. Choose a pair of dice from the dice pool to take available actions: throw a soir\u00e9e, entice celebrities, build collections, recruit cops and gangsters, play sweet jazz, bootleg hooch, and more!\nBe A Boss. Run your own speakeasy in 1920s New York City, competing to build the best gin joint in town.\nMake Your Mark. Add Society, Collections, and Crime cards to your speakeasy for special abilities and create your particular engine - no two games will be alike and multiple paths for victory ensure replay value!\nRich in History. Everything in Speakeasy Blues from the gin joints to its people, things, and places were actually part of the pulsing, feel-good world of Jazz Age New York City. Immerse yourself in this fabulous place and time and let the 20s roar again!\n Speakeasy Blues is designed for everyone: women and men, boys and girls, serious and casual gamers, and the swingin' jazz club lovers among us. Throw your own soir\u00e9e and please help us bring this project to life!\n                            Speakeasy Blues is a quick, dice-placement game for 2-4 ambitious entrepreneurs during the Roaring 20\u2019s. Over the course of 10 rounds, players attempt to turn their gin joint into New York City\u2019s most influential Speakeasy. \nSpecial Events and Contests occur at the start of every round in the city, making each turn exciting and unique. A round consists of each player taking a turn and play revolves around pairs of similarly colored dice. Begin your turn by removing two dice of the same color from spots on the game board, roll them, and add them a dice pool nearby.\nEach space on the game board represents an action. On your turn, choose a colored pair of dice from the pool and place them onto the board to take actions.\nSpeakeasy Blues doesn\u2019t have traditional hands of cards. Instead, players have speakeasy boards that they develop over the course of the game. When taking an action to claim a card, add it directly to one of your Speakeasy\u2019s four slots covering up any previous card\u2019s ability. The trick is you can only use the top cards for their special abilities!\nLeveraging Society and Crime cards in your speakeasy is essential. Famous personalities of the era on Society cards let you activate powerful speakeasy abilities. Crime cards offer different kinds of powers and first come into your speakeasy face down. When turned over on a later turn, Cops provide ongoing special effects, while Gangsters offer devious abilities that hamper the plans of your opponents. Plan carefully - gangsters are powerful, but if you still have a trusty officer face down in your speakeasy, you can flip them over to counter any negative effect!\nAdd collections to your Speakeasy for big points at the end of the game if you can amass brilliant sets of the same type. Just be sure to have a Collection of that type on top or all that collecting may be wasted!\nFavors and other tokens can add to your success. Will you associate with cops and gangsters in the city skimming some scratch off the top for your \u201cgood\u201d works? Perhaps you\u2019ll accumulate a hoard of hooch to serve to your thirsty patrons. Or maybe you\u2019ll use Jazz tokens to double rewards for your actions or change die faces to pursue your goals. Management of these resources can make or break a successful speakeasy!\nTally your score at the end of the game by comparing Favors, Reputation, Hooch, Money, scoring Collections, Contests, and special abilities. The player with the most points wins!\n        Speakeasy Blues will be manufactured in China. Copies will then be sent to our fulfillment partner depots in various regions around the world (APAC, EU, USA) for ultimate distribution to backers. This saves you on shipping and, for most countries, extra taxes. We're also offering discounted shipping to our backers everywhere in the world. We recognize that even with these discounts, shipping to many parts of the world is just plain expensive, but we're doing what we can to make it easier. Given our strategy of shipping to regional fulfillment depots, various countries will receive their copies at different times. Historically, backers in Asia and the Pacific receive their copies soonest since they are nearest to our manufacturer, then the U.S. and western Europe are relatively close together, and finally backers in the rest of the world receive theirs. We anticipate that all backers will receive their copies by June 2018, but most of you will receive your copies sooner. We'll keep you posted with more details via regular updates as we move forward into production and fulfillment.\nArtana is committed to supporting our retail partners. We offer wholesale pricing to verified stores and other gaming establishments. We treat you like other backers, but you will receive your rewards ahead of other normal distributions channels. If you are a verifiable retailer, please contact us through Kickstarter or send an email to hello@artana.com for more information about how to pledge at this level.\n(Designer) Daryl Andrews is a game designer and developer from Waterloo, Ontario.

With each action:\nYou can play a Scare invisibly (face down) to a Room, hiding your intentions...\nOR You can play a Scare visibly (face up) to a Room, which gives players information but lets you trigger the Room's awesome power.\nIf you think the time is right, skip your actions to point at a Room and yell BOO! Any invisible Scares in the room are revealed, and if all the correct Scares are present to create the needed combo (counting all Scares in the Room, plus all Scares in your hand), then you frighten out the Ghost Hunter and collect their precious gear!\nThese simple rules create lots of chances for clever cardplay and tricky situations. When someone scares out their fourth Ghost Hunter, your gear collections (and any Skulls you've gathered) are tallied and the player with the most points wins!\n                          The reveal dates are listed below, with some hints about the surprises behind those boards. Remember to come back to the campaign on those dates to see the details of each reveal in all their glory!\nWEDNESDAY OCTOBER 11th\nFour new Rooms with unique powers take you deeper into the haunted house than ever before!\nREVEALED\nThe Darker Corners Rooms (Armory, Master Bedroom, Stables, and Greenhouse) all have their own unique and awesome powers, just like all of the other rooms. Check them out, but then keep reading below!\nEvery Darker Corners room comes with two new features. First of all, see the stone wall at the bottom? It shows a \"+ Scare symbol\". That means that the Ghost Hunter in this room also needs that Scare to be frightened out, which means that these rooms are a little tougher than the others! The second feature is the Skull symbol with the \"Bad Boo +\" symbol. This means that when this room first comes into play, place a Skull token on it; whenever a Bad Boo happens in this room, add another Skull token to the room. Whoever frightens out this Ghost Hunter earns all the Skull tokens in the room!\nTUESDAY OCTOBER 17th\n16 new Scare cards... but with a special twist that will change the way you play!\nREVEALED\nThese special Darker Corners Scare cards are known as Courage cards. They make the game a lot more tricky... keep reading below!\nEach player gets 4 Courage cards (1of each Scare type) shuffled into their own deck. You may only play Courage cards invisibly. When someone calls Boo and invisible cards are revealed, players get their rewards as usual, then any revealed Courage card will cause a Scare of the same type to be eliminated from the room! So evil! The Courage card is then removed from the game... so spend your courage wisely! This adds a whole new layer of uncertainty and sabotage that will really spice up your play!\nTUESDAY OCTOBER 24th\n8 new Phantom cards; four powerful allies that will make your rivals scream!\nREVEALED\nThese special Darker Corners Phantoms are nasty and powerful, with amazing new art by Apolline Etienne! The Terrifying phantom will chase any Ghost Hunter right out of the house! The Possessing phantom lets you take over an opponent's phantom! The Wandering phantom lets you access any Room you want! And the Wild phantom can be used as any Scare! There are two of each Darker Corners phantoms included in the Deluxe Edition, and they will make your games more exciting than ever!\n HALLOWEEN! TUESDAY OCTOBER 31st\nFour challenging new Ghost Hunters for you to tangle with.\nREVEALED\nMeet the Professionals! This team of bad-asses isn't like the other Ghost Hunters. They are calm, cool, and unflappable. They take more Scares to frighten out of the house than your usual explorer, they earn a sizzling 5 Skull points, and they come with a random Phantom when you frighten one out! Not only that, every time a Bad Boo happens to a Pro, another Phantom is added to their reward pile. (They're very skilled at vacuuming up stray spirits, you see!) \nCan you imagine running into one of these Pros in a Darker Corners Room? That would be a very challenging \u2014and very rewarding\u2014 situation!\n                                        Want to add anything from our catalog to your pledge? It's easy!

We will reimburse you right away.\nShipping Prices\nShipping will be added automatically based on your region.

Also included are updated scenarios and tiles for the core game and The B-Files expansion, allowing players to encounter these deadly enemies as part of their games\u2014plus a brand-new scenario for the final showdown with the massive Birkin Stage 5 mutation!\nThe Retro Pack is for the old-school Resident Evil\u2122 fans out there, recreating the artwork and style for each of the item, enemy, and character cards to appear as they did in the classic video game. It also includes a series of additional iconic tiles and scenario items to customize your play experience. If you\u2019re a series veteran who played the game the first time around and want to indulge your nostalgia for the good old days, then this expansion is definitely for you!\nYou can also purchase multiple Survivor Pledges by increasing your pledge amount by +\u00a370 per pledge. NOTE: There is no Early Bird discount on these additional pledges. The 'Extra Survivor Pledge' gets you an additional copy of the Core Game, B-Files Expansion Set, and Kickstarter Exclusive Leon Alt.

This includes the following:  \n10x 3D Corpse Markers  \n5x Ink Ribbons  \n2x Typewriters  \n2x Item Boxes\nLurking under the streets of Raccoon City are dark and foreboding sewers, teeming with undead fiends\u2026 but that\u2019s not all!

The Giant Alligator Expansion introduces this fearsome adversary into your games of Resident Evil\u2122 2: The Board Game as a new Boss Monster for the survivors to battle their way past. This expansion includes the finely detailed model of this iconic foe and rules for the special scenario in which it is encountered, along with a new Boss Behaviour Deck, unique item cards, and additional game tiles.\nThe 4th Survivor Expansion includes finely detailed models for HUNK and fan favourite TOFU, as well as a new scenario, additional game boards and item cards allowing you to play 4th Survivor as part of your games of Resident Evil 2\u2122 - The Board Game.  \nAdditionally, 4th Survivor also includes an extra three scenarios from Extreme Battle Mode, as well as cards for the deadly anti-virus bombs scattered throughout the RPD building.

It includes a finely detailed model for the Giant Moth, as well as four Zombie Crow models. This expansion also includes the rules for including the Giant Moth Mini-Boss in your games, as well as new enemy models and optional rules for Zombie Crows as an enemy model rather than an event from the Tension Deck. \nResident Evil\u2122 2: The Board Game combines intense resource management and an innovative Tension Deck mechanic to create an enthralling experience for veterans and new players alike. With world-class miniatures that are faithful to the original in every detail, this game will capture the essence of the classic genre-defining Resident Evil\u2122 2 video game.\nTo survive the nightmare, players must explore dangerous and foreboding places for clues, equipment, and weapons that are critical to staying alive. Unusual sounds or barely glimpsed movement could hint at disaster. The Tension Deck forces players to carefully consider traveling through each area\u2014and whether they can afford to avoid it altogether.\nThe Player Characters: Ada Wong, Leon S Kennedy, Claire Redfield and Robert Kendo\nWith precious few bullets and recovery items, every step into the unknown presents a difficult decision. Do you dare explore that darkened room? Can you afford to face your enemies head-on? Putting a bullet into an enemy isn't always the only way to survive!\nResident Evil\u2122 2: The Board Game is a fully cooperative experience. If even a single character dies, the scenario is lost, meaning players must work together in order to succeed. Each character has distinct special rules based on their personality and background which must be used to aid their allies over the course of the game.\nA swarm of zombies surrounding the 3rd Mutation of William Birkin\nWhilst players can see some enemies and know how to plan ahead, what lurks behind each door is completely unknown. Remember, if one character dies, then it's game over for everyone, so pay careful attention to each shadowy corner! What will you do if a player is ambushed by a horde of zombies?\nThe scenario brief for the prototype demo we showed at GenCon '17\nAs players make their way through each location, they must consider speed as well as strategy. Leaving doors open provides a much quicker path for you and your allies\u2014but also for your enemies. If you hear the screams of another survivor echoing through the corridors, do you still play methodically and carefully secure each area behind you, or do you risk leaving rooms vulnerable and rush to aid your embattled friend?\nFear the unexpected\u2014at any moment the undead could crash through a window, arms could grab at you from a hidden place, or you could hear the blood-curdling howl of a zombie dog. Thanks to the unique Tension Deck, players experience a growing sense of fear and trepidation, with each step potentially leading to their untimely death!  \n\nDesigned to be deep enough to satisfy experienced tabletop gamers whilst also remaining accessible to newer players, Resident Evil\u2122 2: The Board Game is easy to learn but difficult to master. It can be played as a standalone game for casual gamers or as a fully supported narrative campaign for hardcore players.\nEveryone who pledges gets this EXCLUSIVE Alternate Leon model\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system.

You'll reveal a unique and challenging landscape every single time the game is played which will require you to adjust your strategy as you go. Managing resources and battling the other explorers, it's a tense and explosive race to control the Shrines first!\n                                  YOU DID IT! Unbelievable. You have unlocked all of the stretch goals! This game is much higher quality than I ever imagined it could be. It's going to be so luxurious. Thank you for turning this dream into a reality. \nThe artwork for The Island of El Dorado was painted by artists in the 16th century when the game takes place. I am honored to have these beautiful pieces of art set the scene for these explorers' journeys. What better way to transport a gamer to another age than works of art from that time period?\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art has graciously allowed me to use these exceptional pieces through a new policy known as \u201cOpen Access\u201d, implemented on February 7th, 2017. This policy allows images of artworks from the public domain to be widely and freely available for unrestricted use. I\u2019m very proud to use these remarkable pieces in a new way.\nI\u2019ve partnered with a well-known fulfillment company called \u201cShip Naked\u201d to deliver the most efficient shipping experience possible. I\u2019ve also subsidized much of the shipping and taxes to keep prices low for our backers.\n  Your name will be printed in the box. It's very important to me that the backers are part of this project. There will be sheets with \"A special thanks to:\" and a list of names of everyone who supports our Kickstarter. It's a fun part of the project that you can show off.\nYou will be heard. We're working together on this project, and I will read and hear every comment and message you send me. I'm happy with where the game is currently, but I'm always looking to improve it and make it even more fun, and I\u2019ll be honest with you the whole way through this process.\nThe Island of El Dorado is a passion project. When this started out, I just wanted to design a game that my friends and family would enjoy. Some of my friends are heavy gamers, and some don\u2019t game at all. It's really hard to find a game that excites both groups, but I designed El Dorado purposefully so everyone would be able to understand and enjoy it. This caused the game to be very simple to play, but deep in its strategies.\nI saw how much fun and excitement the game was bringing to my friends and family, so I started blind-playtesting it with people I didn't know. Through hundreds of playtests (with both friends and strangers) I've seen that El Dorado is fun for all sorts of different people, and my hope is that people all over the world would enjoy with their friends and family the exciting moments that this game creates. It seems like every game ends with the whole group standing up in tense excitement for one last fight!\nI'm a family man who could not do this project alone. I run a creative agency, and because of that I want this passion project to greet you with its full potential, and the best way to do that is through mass production. I'm very excited to share this game with you all!\nYou are needed. I need your help to make this game happen. The game is completed and ready to go, but in order to make it high quality, we need to mass produce it. Panda Manufacturing has a minimum order we need to meet in order to make this a reality, and that\u2019s where all of you come in.\nLimited Availability. There will only be a limited number of games printed in this version. With stretch goals, it could have more content and higher quality pieces than future printings do.\nThis is just the beginning. I see a modular board like this and see SO many possibilities for expansions just by adding more tiles to the starting stacks. It would be easy to do, and add even more depth to the game. Like I said, this game is designed to appeal to gamers and non-gamers, but I know there will be groups of hard gamers that would appreciate expansions, even more depth, and longer games. Exciting stuff!\nSome people have cursed hands and dislike dice in games. I\u2019ve included a very simple rule option for more experienced gamers who wish to reduce the effect of luck in El Dorado. It barely changes the gameplay, and removes 50% of the luck in the game.\nReduced-Luck Optional Rule: Instead of players rolling two die to start their turn, just roll one. Choose between the top and bottom of that die to be your movement and resources for that turn.\nWith this rule, players will always roll a sum of 7, but the split is what the dice determines. Nothing else in the game changes!\nWhy isn't this the standard rule? Both rules have been play-tested extensively, and I personally like the rush of getting \"good\" and \"bad\" rolls. The standard rule introduces an element of chaos and also makes the game easier for novices - which is huge for bringing more people into this great hobby!\n     ----------\nThis game is in pre-production. Kickstarter images are not final. While there is no immediate plan to change anything, the final look, materials, and content of the game are subject to change and may differ slightly from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike all kickstarter projects, there are risks. This is my first project. I have spent months and months researching to hopefully avoid any delays in the process. That being said, our biggest risk is the timeframe. Anytime you manufacture a game in China, the risk is higher for delays. Panda Manufacturing is the best in the business, and I've done everything I can up to this point to make this a smooth process going forward. I've also added 2 months of buffer space to the timeline in case any surprises pop up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "The Island of El Dorado - 1 Copy", "descp": "One copy of The Island of El Dorado plus all unlocked stretch goals.

Gofton, Lynnvander is responsible for the inception of several media initiatives including projects of film such as the award-winning fantasy series \u201cMind\u2019s Eye\u201d as well as the acclaimed Shadowrun parody film \u201cThe Gamers: Natural One\u201d and the epic sequel to The Gamers: Dorkness Rising \u201cThe Gamers: Hands of Fate\u201d. \nSince their inception, Lynnvander has gone on to create some of the best board games available today, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Galaxy Quest, Albion\u2019s Legacy, Sherwood\u2019s Legacy, Neverland\u2019s Legacy and more. They are currently handling adapting some of the most famous IPs in the world into board games, including Dragon Ball Z, Cowboy Bebop, Terminator, and the Three Musketeers. They work with countless publishers around the world including Ninja Division, Shinobi 7, River Horse Entertainment, Jasco Games, Catalyst Game Labs, Norse Foundry Publishing and Dynamite Publishing. \nBeyond their board game successes, they have also developed role playing games including their own Legacy of Mana, a world all magic must fear. Also in this world is the fantasy novel Hope\u2019s Ordeal, and it serves as the role-playing setting for both Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons. Lynnvander Studios works in the new world of transitional media to ensure that the properties they work with are treated with the utmost respect for both their owners and their fans.\nSpecial Thank-you\nTo Midnight Syndicate for permission to use your music in the video, and to Norse Foundry for the special run of red jade dice. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nLynnvander and Dynamite have developed a brand new partnership for this game, with the goal of delivering to you the best board game experience for ReAnimator. We have gone to Kickstarter for two main reasons.\nPrimarily, we have gotten the game to a point that it is very nearly done. There are still expansions to develop, and other ways we can hone and make the game a gift to the fans. We have gone to Kickstarter to ensure that fans have a voice in this process. Both Dynamite and Lynnvander have a history of delivering for their fanbase, and we wanted to continue that here.\nThe second concern is the not so glamourous realities of running a creative business. A Kickstarter allows us to gauge interest in the game and the expansions, helping to predict the number that should be manufactured and delivered into the world. It also helps us predict the demand for expansions, and how to ensure that they are delivered and of interest to our fans.\nKickstarter creates an entirely new, more democratic, relationship between creators and fans, and we want to be a part of that.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've come a long way and have learned a lot about Kickstarter and game manufacturing in general but challenges still come up.\n\nThere are certain risks that, even with the absolute best management in the world, we can't do away with. Weird things can happen in customs, creatures can emerge from beyond time and space, the usual things outside of human control.\n\nWhat we can assure you is that Dynamite Entertainment has experience with distribution, working with their partners, handling IP issues, and making amazing artwork. Lynnvander Studios has worked on several board games both on and off of Kickstarter, ensuring that the quality meets our exacting standards and we can deliver the best game possible to you. The project is coming to Kickstarter nearly complete, with manufacturers already lined up and art assets functionally finalized. We've planned for all the eventualities that we can, and we can assure you that when this project funds, we can deliver everything to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "ReAnimator #0 Digital Comic", "descp": "As a special thank you for supporting the ReAnimator Board Game you will receive a free download of ReAnimator #0 - the first ever Dynamite comic featuring Herbert West!

The game is quick to play and easy to learn, yet requires interesting decisions without causing analysis paralysis. Designed by Steve Finn of Dr. Finn\u2019s Games, The Little Flower Shop continues his tradition of making filler games that have a lot more going on than you first realize.\nMechanically, the game uses a familiar card drafting mechanic in which players receive a hand of cards, choose a card to keep, then pass the remaining cards to the next player. The familiar card drafting system makes it very easy to learn, especially for those who\u2019ve played similar games. At the same time, the friendly theme, beautiful artwork and interesting scoring system transforms the familiar into a unique gaming experience that can be enjoyed by casual and more experienced gamers alike.\n  Note: The rulebook file above contains a reference card on the last two pages, but this will be a separate reference card in the game.\n       During the campaign, many backers requested a 5th player expansion pack. Due to popular demand, I've added an option to include in your copy of the game an expansion pack for 5 players.  If you would like to have this pack added to your game, please add $7 to your total pledge (shipping included).\nTo use the cards, they are simply added to the game and then removed when playing with fewer than 5.  The flower cards will have no \"filler,\" so they can be easily distinguished from the cards in the base game.  Also, I will slightly change the color of the purple vases to make it easier to pull them out.  The other cards will be easy to remove as needed.  Note also that the lack of filler adds a new element to the game if you're using the filler scoring, as these flower cards will not give bonus points.\nHere's a brief explanation of the rules from Dr. Finn. Reviews of the game are found further below.\nRahdo explains the standard game in the following 2-player game:\n Rahdo explains the 2-player variant in the continuation of his game:\n  Rules for solo play are also included. This game variant utilizes a push-your-luck mechanic, making it a whole lot of fun as a solo gaming experience. \n  Kickstarter backers receive the Flower-Filler Promo Pack that adds variety to the base game. The pack will only be available during Kickstarter campaigns, though retailer backers of this project also receive a few packs for their own stores. The pack has 8 cards: 4 flower bonus cards, 3 filler bonus cards, plus 1 instruction card.  At the game's start, a bonus card of each type is flipped showing the popular flower and filler for the game. Players score bonus flower power for displaying the popular flowers and fillers in their windows.\n\u2022 Get a fun game by a highly regarded game designer.  All of Dr. Finn's games receive glowing reviews from members of the board gaming community.  \n\u2022 Own a great game to play with gamers and non-gamers.  Dr. Finn is well known for designing easy to learn games that appeal to all levels of game players. This game is especially good as a \"gateway\" game.  \n\u2022 Help bring this game to existence. If this campaign does not fund, the game very likely will not be made. \n\u2022 No post-Kickstarter bargain prices. You will not find Dr. Finn's games on sale at online retailers a week (or even months) after a Kickstarter campaign because I do not sell my games to them. I do have my own sales, but I usually wait until the game has been published for a while to do so. \n\u2022 Receive a Kickstarter exclusive. Get the Flowers-Filler promo pack that will not be available other than through Kickstarter campaigns. \n\u2022 Access to promotional items.  This campaign provides an opportunity to pick up other Dr. Finn's promotional items, such as the Institute for Magical Arts promo pack. \n\u2022 Great bundle prices. This campaign provides an opportunity to get multiple Dr. Finn's games at a great bundle price. Check out the various levels to see the great deals. You can also add games at great prices.\n\u2022 Support an independent game designer.  Dr. Finn's Games is not a big company and will only continue with continued successful crowdfunding campaigns.   \nThanks to all the reviewers for taking the time to play and review the game. None of the reviewers received financial compensation for their reviews.\n            Disclaimer for Ed's preview video: Ed and I worked together on Herbaceous (and are working together on upcoming projects).\n              The flower illustrations were done by hand by botanical artist Sarah Wry. Sarah spent nearly 20 years working for environmental and animal welfare organizations in the UK (where she is from) and the USA.  After having children, Sarah devoted her free time to art and took the New York Botanical Garden Certificate in Botanical Illustration. Sarah sells both bird and botanical prints and originals and has exhibited in the NY area. Her paintings are rendered in startling accuracy and keenly observed detail.  She works out of her studio in Chappaqua, NY.  More of her work can be seen on her website. \nThe illustration of the woman on the box cover and the order cards was done by Rocio Og\u00f1enovich, who also did the promotional video. All the graphic design comes from the hand of her husband, Sebas. If you want to know more about them, please visit their website for OK Art Studio.\nSupport this project and the arts at the same time! Original artwork from the game is available during this Kickstarter campaign at the $200 and $250 levels. These are not prints, but original works of art. The artist would normally sell these types of artworks for $400 or more.\n ARTWORK DETAILS\nEach piece is a signed watercolor on 300lb acid free, bright white, hot press paper. All pieces are each 8\"x10\" in a 14\"x16\" matt.\nTulip (NOT AVAILABLE -- CHOSEN BY A BACKER)\n  Iris (NOT AVAILABLE)\n  Rose (available)\n  Flower Shop (available)\n  You can customize your reward level by adding on games to any pledge level above $20. To add promotional packs, see separate section below. Please read carefully and contact Dr. Finn directly if you have any questions.\nHOW TO ADD GAMES\nChoose the add-on games from the list below \nTotal the costs for the add-on games \nAdd extra shipping costs (if outside the U.S.-- see below) \nAdd games' cost + additional shipping costs to the amount of your pledge level \nInform Dr. Finn of your add-on choices AFTER the campaign via a survey \nSHIPPING COSTS FOR ADD-ON GAMES\nYour pledge level includes shipping costs for the rewards of your level. For add-on games, you must add shipping costs to cover the add-on games. For U.S. backers, shipping costs are already included in the prices. If you are in the U.K., please add $7 for the first add-on game, then $3 for each additional add-on game. All others must add $10 for the first add-on game, then $5 for each additional add-on game.\nEARN A FREE GAME\nAfter adding on games, if the total number of games (not promotional packs) is 4 or more, you earn an additional game of your choice from the add-on list (excluding C.O.G.).  Free shipping for the bonus game regardless of your location.  You will let Dr. Finn know of your choice after the campaign has ended.\nLOW QUANTITY ALERT\nSome Dr. Finn's games and promotional packs are getting low in stock and it is not feasible to track add-on items during the campaign. It is possible (but unlikely) that there is not enough of a particular game to fulfill all rewards. If this happens, you will be refunded all expenses related to adding that item on.\nHOW TO ADD PROMO PACKS\nPromo packs may be added to any level or you can back just for promo packs at the Promo Pack Level.\n Choose the add-on packs from the list below.  \n Total the costs for the packs \n Add extra shipping costs (if outside the U.S.-- see below) \n Add packs' cost + additional shipping costs to the amount of your  pledge level \n Inform Dr. Finn of your add-on choices AFTER the campaign via a  survey\nSHIPPING COSTS FOR PROMOTIONAL PACKS\nThe promotional packs include free shipping in the U.S. Outside the U.S., add $3 for the first pack (automatically added). You must manually add $2 for each additional pack.\nEngraved Wood Butterfly Garden Collector's Box\n  Shipping to the United States: All games going to U.S. backers will be shipped from within the U.S. either directly from Dr. Finn's via USPS or through Amazon fulfillment services.  \nShipping to European Union: All games going to non-U.S. destinations will ship from the U.K., which means E.U. backers will not be subject to additional taxes or duties. You will receive a notice when games ship from Games Quest. No tracking information is provided. Promo packs may or may not ship from the U.S. and so may be subject to duties. \nShipping to all other destinations (including Canada): Games will ship from the U.K. All items may be subject to duties and taxes imposed by your country's customs office. You will receive a notice when games ship from Games Quest. No tracking information is provided. Promo packs, however, might be shipped separately from the U.S. and may also be subject to duties. \nCosts: The listed shipping costs for those outside the U.S. are lower than the actual shipping costs because Dr. Finn's Games has reduced your shipping costs by incorporating some of those costs into the prices of the games. \nKickstarter backers have a wide variety of opinions about the purpose of crowdfunding. My own view is that Kickstarter's greatest strength is to help the \"little guy or gal\" bring something fun, creative, and good into existence, something that would otherwise be left aside. Dr. Finn's Games is a small company that relies heavily on Kickstarter campaigns to stay in business. My goal is to make sure that backers are pleased with the campaign from start to finish. So I maintain a good level of contact, with an appropriate amount of updates throughout the process, and I invite backers to contact me directly. I do my best to listen and respond quickly.  I've had 11 successful campaigns, almost all of which were completed right on time. The only late project was late by a month. I also try to ensure that my backers are getting the best deal on the game (at least for the first 6 months from release). Since my games are not distributed, you will not find them for sale at online retailers at 40% off a week after they hit the market (or even months after).  Of course, as a game gets older, I often have to sell the remaining copies I have at a discount, but that's usually down the road.  \nLet me mention my stretch goal philosophy.  I try to design my games to be whole without needing additional components. My primary use of stretch goals is to improve the quality of the components, because I believe backers should be rewarded for helping the project reach higher funding goals.  \nMy promotional pack philosophy is also a part of this. I want to reward Kickstarter backers with access to something special, so I do offer promotional packs that usually just add a little variant to the game, rather than a full expansion.  I frequently get requests outside of Kickstarter campaigns for access to the packs, but I do not sell them.    \nIf you are considering picking up more than just The Little Flower Shop, Boardgamegeek.com is the best place to do research on Dr. Finn's Games. Just go to the site and enter the game name to find out more about my games. Or, watch some of the videos below.\nThe Game Boy Geek Reviews Biblios\nRahdo's Final Thoughts on Biblios Dice\nThe Ant Lab Explores Butterflies\nRyan Metzler Reviews Capo dei Capi\nRahdo's Final Thoughts on Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire\nAnt Lab plays and reviews C.O.G.\nBower Reviews Foragers\nThe Boardgame Corner reviews Herbaceous\nThe Charters Family reviews Let Them Eat Shrimp\nRahdo's Final Thoughts of Slush Fund 2\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease read carefully before backing this project. \n\nPRIOR KICKSTARTER PROJECTS \nAll prior Kickstarter campaigns for Dr. Finn's Games have been completed, with the exception of Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire which is on time for a September delivery.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS \nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the games will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threat in this regard concerns quality control over the manufacturing. A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced good results on game projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nIf you receive any games that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the game arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%). \n\nREFUNDS \nRefunds are not usually given, unless there is a failure to deliver the games you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it. \n\nLOW QUANTITY ALERT\nSome Dr. Finn's games are getting low in stock and it is not feasible to track add-on items during the campaign. It is possible (but unlikely) that there is not enough of a particular game to fulfill all rewards. If this happens, you will be refunded all expenses related to adding that item on.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Of course, unexpected things happen and there is chance that the game will not be shipped on time. I will keep you updated if the unexpected happens. Unless otherwise noted, all items will ship with The Little Flower Shop at the same time. \n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a game is returned, it would be nice of you to pay for the re-shipment. However, I have paid for it in the past, though I think it really should be your responsibility. \n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the shipping section above. \n\nUPDATES \nThrough this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects. However, such updates will be infrequent. \n\nBy backing this project, you acknowledge and accept the risks and challenges just stated. \n\nThanks!

But this time, Masters of Elements have joined their ranks!\n In Masters of Elements, each player gets to pick a Master of Elements. This Master will produce an Element Token every round that will be allocated to a Building.  \n  Each player gets to draft 3 permanent Artefacts at the beginning of the game. They sit on an extra player board provided with this expansion.\nEach of these Artefacts will provide powerful and asymmetric abilities to all players around the table.\n  In this expansion, we wanted to move the type of decision you make from \"attack vs defense\" strategy to a more elaborate combo-oriented thinking.\nMost Units now carry an extra function that can be activated using the Elements on your buildings!\n  At the beginning of the game, everyone is given a God randomly. If we manage to unlock more than the 4 base Gods, each player is actually given 2 Gods to choose from. The special effect of this God is immediately available as soon as you reach level 3!\n                                                                       Congratulation for unlocking Borr, father of Odin!\nLucky Duck Games Facebook Fan Page is here. \nLucky Duck Games Twitter Profile is here.\nVikings Gone Wild Official Facebook Forum is here.\n                             This pledge contains:\n   - Masters of Elements Expansion\n   - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n   - Money-back Guarantee\nThis pledge is ideal for someone who already bought the base game on Kickstarter or in retail and is looking for a deeper and more strategic experience of the game.\n  This pledge contains:   \n  - Vikings Gone Wild (Base Game - Retail Version)\n  - Masters of Elements Expansion\n  - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n  - Money-back Guarantee\nThis pledge is ideal for someone who has not bought the base game yet and wants to experience the most strategic experience this game has to offer.\nThe Base Game included in this pledge is the Retail Version, without any Kickstarter content from the first campaign.\n  This pledge contains:\n  - Vikings Gone Wild (Base Game - Retail Version)\n  - Masters of Elements Expansion\n  - It's a Kind of Magic Expansion\n  - Guild Wars Expansion\n  - Ragnarok Expansion (Solo/Coop experience)\n  - All Masters of Elements Stretch Goals Unlocked\n  - Money-back Guarantee\nGet yourself the full range of experiences this game system has to offer. From the spell oriented strategy of It's a Kind of Magic to the 2 vs 2 mode of the Guild Wars expansion, or as a cooperative/solo experience to survive the flow of the Undead Army in Ragnarok, you will get it all in its beautiful Viking Glory!\nThe Base Game included in this pledge is the Retail Version, without any Kickstarter content from the first campaign.\n     We are very excited to announce the release of 3 unique Booster Packs. Each pack is unique (no random cards) and always composed this way:  \n1x Divine Favor \n1x Artefact \n10x Unit Cards \nWe have built one pack per Element. We are leaving you the surprise to open them. Want to bet what is inside? :)\nPS: $12 gives you 3 Packs. That is all you need.\nPS2: These cards are unique and totally different from any cards we will offer you in Stretch Goal or in the expansion.\n   We heard it during the entire campaign: \"Give us the big box\" :D  \nWe wanted to make sure we would provide a box big enough to cover this expansion and any future ones (yes there could be more!). So we are producing a custom-sized box almost 2 times higher than the original box in order to contain everything:  \nAll cards.\nAll boards. \nAll tokens. \nAll rulebooks. \nAll neoprene boards (yes, you read right!).\nWe provide dividers by expansions and by type of cards, depending on the way you prefer to sort your cards!  \n  In Vikings Gone Wild, players take the role of heads of clans fighting against each other to prove to the gods who is the best.    \nDuring each turn, you play the cards in your hand to buy Units or Defense cards, erect Buildings and attack other players. You will have to find the right balance between investing in your economy (buildings, specials cards) and growing your army! \n     It's a Kind of Magic expansion introduces original core concepts through new Buildings, Units and a new type of card: Spells!    \n  It focuses on deck manipulation and will transform your experience of Vikings Gone Wild in a very interesting, magical, way!\n     Guild Wars expansion introduces new core concepts through new Buildings, Units and Defenses!    \n  A brand new 2 vs 2 mode is at the heart of this expansion, but most cards can be used in a regular game.\n    The Ragnarok expansion is a solo or cooperative expansion for Vikings Gone Wild.        \n  In order to win, you have to defeat the Undead Army before your time runs out! Will you be able to save us all? \n   This 1st Season Pack contains the 110 Kickstarter Exclusive cards of the previous Kickstarter! We saved you the price of the box (who needs boxes anyway) to put this pack at a very affordable price! \n     We have selected the perfect fit sleeves for you - BCW 58x89 Sleeves.\n\nAdding sleeves to a Kickstarter adds a fair layer of logistic complexity, but many struggled to find the right fit for this game before so we decided to do this for you. \n This add-ons won't add any shipping cost, no matter the quantity you pick or the pledge you select. \n $5 per pack of 100 Sleeves (2x50). \n $20 per pack of 500 Sleeves (10x50).\nCards quantities per game:\nBase Game: 220 cards\nIt's a Kind of Magic: 110 cards\nGuild Wars: 110 cards\nRagnarok: 55 cards\nKS 1st Season: 110 cards\n5th Viking: 55 cards\n3x Boosters: 36 cards\nMasters of Elements: 219 as of Stretch Goal #27, can we get the last one?\n  Many of you have asked for ways to upgrade their gears, and more specifically their player board! We love neoprene mats ourselves, so it did not take too much convincing to put us at work on the idea.  \nBringing these playmats to life, we wanted to bring something different enough that the upgrade would feel truly special. Mateusz spent some time redesigning our standard player pad and came up with 4 unique ones!\nThis add-on contains:\nx1 Thor Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Grendel Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Ragnar Neoprene Playmat\nx1 Valkyrie Neoprene Playmat\n  We first wanted to have both mats joined into one large play-mat. But looking at every single play-tests we ran, tables were never big enough to put the Artefact board on top or at the bottom of the base game player mat. So we decided to separate them to give the freedom of arranging your table the way you want!\nThis add-on contain:\n4x Masters of Elements Artefacts Neoprene Playmats\n  Many of you have asked for that 5th player expansion! It took us a while to find a proper way to include only a cardboard mat. Since we will include for free a 5th Artefact cardboard pad in the Master of Elements, you only need the base game player mat.\nThis add-ons contain:\n1x Base Game cardboard player mat.\n55 cards (including 1 Starting Deck, more Missions, Units, Defenses, Odin's Path, etc).\n  If you simply want to upgrade your 5th player to the full neoprene experience, this add-on is for you!\n1x Hel's Neoprene Playmat.\n1x Masters of Elements Artefact Neoprene Playmat.\n  How to add an Add-On to my pledge?\nIt depends if you already pledged or not.\nIf you didn't already pledged, then when you do, simply change the pledge amount. You just need to add to that amount the total cost of all the add-ons you want. For instance, if you want to pledge for the Masters of Elements Expansion alone at $35, but you also want to add one pack of 500 sleeves at $20, then you'll select the $35 pledge, and change the automatically filled up \"$35\" by 35 + 20 = \"$55\".\n If you want to add something to your pledge, then go to this page which lets you manage your pledge, and change the amount. You can do so by adding the total cost of all the add-ons you want. If you chose the $35 pledge for the Masters of Elements Expansion alone and decide to add one pack of 500 sleeves at $20, then change \"$35\" by 35 + 20 = \"$55\".\n                                               Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 notre distributeur Atalia, qui s'occupe de la livraison de tous les jeux Vikings Gone Wild en France et en Belgique, nous pouvons offrir les frais de port pour la France et la Belgique dans certaines conditions.

Coupling that with its approachable ruleset, Mint Delivery is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of pick up and deliver.\nCheck out the Mint Delivery rules to see more detail about what makes Mint Delivery tick.\nAll Cards contained within a copy of Mint Delivery are printed upon Premium 305GSM blue core card stock. Mint and Truck Tokens are made of Wood and all other tokens are made from 2mm thick chipboard. All printed components will have a linen finish.   \nJames Hudson - Druid City Games  \nMarried with Board Games \nLindsay - Shiny Happy Meeples\nWhat's Eric Playing\nWhat's Eric Playing - #125 - Mint Delivery [Preview]\n Board Game Geek Comments \n\"...Even if pick up and deliver games are not your cup of tea try this one out and you might find a renewed interest in the genre.\" - MHGreenleaf\n\"Played a prototype yesterday and really enjoyed it. Similar to Mint Works, even though it's small there's a lot going on.\" - MichaelDyrud\nYou can download the rules here\nIn Mint Delivery, players take the role of a mint delivery truck driver, driving around the area taking orders for mints, then delivering them. Each player has two actions on their turn, such as moving, loading their truck, and upgrading the mints they are carrying. Once enough orders have been taken, the game ends.\nWhoever has fulfilled the highest value of orders will be deemed the employee of the month and win. \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nDiscord\nMint Delivery was created after the success of Mint Works, with the idea to introduce another mechanism to non-gamers while still being interesting enough for gamers to want to bring it to the table.\nI wanted to come up with another quick easy to teach game for a mechanism that I felt didn't have a lot of options that didn't take a long time to play, while also straying away from games with direct conflict between players.\nPick up and deliver seemed like a really good place to start. Since the vast majority of these types of games tend to be quite long, and have a lot of gotcha kinds of rules.\nThat gave me this set of constraints that I utilized for making Mint Delivery:\nHas to fit in a mint tin \nHas to be taught as easy or easier than Mint Works \nHas to play quickly \nWith those constraints in mind, I started the task. \nSince it was to fit in a mint tin, I decided to continue the same visual style that we used with Mint Works, and also to continue the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. It seemed logical to me that Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has started to branch out and provide mints to more than just the local neighborhoods.\nThat gave a great foundation for the supply/demand chain that would be the foundation of the pick up and deliver mechanism. I didn't want the mint requests to be too flat, so i added some \"improved\" type mints to the mix at that point. Which essentially gives us 3 forms of currency instead of just one.\nFrom that point, it was all about creating orders for mints, a few locations to pick mints up from, and a map to lay it all out. And that's where we are now.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Delivery that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Delivery as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advance copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advance copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nPhoto Credit Eric from whatsericplaying.com\nBecause Mint Delivery is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs.\nThat said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US. Here is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nWe have partnered up with Mr. B Games to assist in the fulfillment process to ensure that everyone gets their rewards quickly, correctly and in great condition.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Delivery before the game makes its way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email md.retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe will also be funding a re-print of Mint Works with this campaign, you can add extra copies of Mint Works at $10 each during the campaign, or later on during the pledge manager.\n\nNote: Any add-ons that you select will be delivered at the same time as the rest of your rewards from this campaign.\nSince the map doesn't change from game to game, we came up with the idea of using a mat for the game to play on during demos, it worked out so well that we have decided to add custom mint delivery mats on as add-ons to any pledge level as well.\nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of two Mad Scientists myself and Mel (you might recognize him as Mort) and our awesome testing group. \nI'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them. I have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations.\nThey are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects. I can't possibly thank them enough for all the work they do for the wages of snacks and fun and mild torture (in the form of terrible game ideas.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nComing off of the success of Mint Works, I feel like I have learned a lot about the process from start to finish.

It was destroyed during the many conquests of Alexandria, and all that knowledge was lost forever.\nWe may never really know how it happened, but the compelling story of its destruction has inspired us to publish this unconventional game. Join us in retelling the story of the burning of the Great Library!\nThe game as presented here is exactly what we imagined a great eurogame to be. It contains 138 unique illustrations by Vincent Dutrait and Asterman Studio, which aim to evoke a feeling of exploration and adventure.\nAlexandria is complete and includes the highest quality card & cardboard material, as with all our games - 2mm thick cardboard, linen finish, 320gr-weight cardstock, the works.\nHowever, we also have a \"dream\" version of the game, with custom-shaped wooden tokens that enhance the playing experience. For that we will order a limited amount of custom-shaped wooden token sets:\nThese tokens are meant to replace the cardboard tiles and give a more tactile playing experience. Just like our previous \"big\" game, CRISIS, availability of this edition may be limited.\n  Designed by Babis Giannios (KUNE v LAKIA, Shadows over the Empire), Alexandria is a eurogame that takes 45-60 minutes to play, albeit a more unconventional one. With asymmetrical gameplay and a shrinking gameplay area, parts of the library are slowly consumed by fire as Heroes seek the treasures within it.\nEach of the four Heroes in the game has a different reason for being in the library at the time, and each one has different skills and motivations.\nAs they move through the randomly-generated layout of the library, the Heroes interact with what they find in the rooms, as well as with each other.\nThey position themselves to take advantage of the situation as it unfolds, and must manage their time wisely.\nIn so doing they may rescue books, items or persons and be rewarded with fame. Throughout the game they are confronted by their shared destiny, and this will lead to the dramatic end that defines the ultimate fate of the library.\nFor more details on the components and rules of Alexandria, download the rule book here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026).\nPlease download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. This file is the low-resolution version of the rules document.\nIf you find any mistakes, please use this form to submit them: https://goo.gl/forms/jTFX4bDRvO7cuejD2\nAs usual, we offer you the chance to try the game before you back the campaign. The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\n  Keep in mind that prototype components and some placeholder art is shown below. For example, the Hero boards will be cut to a custom shape around the illustration. Please refer to the contents graphic for up to date images.\n          We expect to fulfill all rewards from within the EU, and as a result EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nWe are not able to offer multiple-game pledge levels through the campaign because we need to have a clear picture of how many copies to make - which will be just a few more than we need for the campaign. Since we already subsidize the shipping costs, a bulk pledge would not even save any money.\nHowever, we do expect to have a post-campaign pledge manager via Backerkit, which allows us to manage stock levels.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 41 USD / 52 CAD / 52 AUD / 40 CHF / 4548 JPY / 46740 KRW. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nTracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. Please note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nEven though we will be exhibiting at Spiel, and we hope to have Alexandria there, we are not able to offer pickup in Essen. There are many reasons for that, including the risk that it will not be produced in time, the limited space and time needed to hold and hand out copies to backers whose identity we need to confirm, backers not picking up their game, and more. If you would like to get your game there, it is better to not back the campaign (or back for $1 to follow it), and buy it on site. However, we can not guarantee we will have enough copies for everyone. We expect that the price will be 40-50+ EUR, depending on the edition, and on whether we have any Deluxe copies for sale.\n  What You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that add-ons and/or stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nWe do not offer add-ons (not even our other games) during the campaign, because we want to keep our operations simple and deliver efficiently. We may however be able to offer a post-campaign chance to obtain other games, if stock levels and our operations allow. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we would disappoint *all* backers. We have a reputation for shipping on time or early, and this is how we minimize the risk of missing our deadlines.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur previously launched campaigns in 2017 are still in progress and on schedule. Long Live The Queen and IUNU are in production. Diesel Demolition Derby is now in the campaign phase, but print prep has already started, and is expected to be on schedule. This project is independent of any other. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the graphics and components seen here are subject to change (however improbable). We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is possible that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do, although we plan to ship your games first. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game; the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal service. Once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know before pledging.

New passengers are flooding in. It's up to you to get them to their destinations before they get too angry and complain. If we get too many complaints, we'll be shut down.\nNow Boarding is a cooperative boardgame for 2-5 Players which plays in 30-60 minutes.  Each player has their own airplane they will be using to pickup and deliver passengers. Every round, more passengers show up. Players will need to plan together to make sure everyone gets picked up and taken to their destination on time.\nThings get crazy when the timer starts. Players have 30 seconds to take their turns \u2013 AT THE SAME TIME. Not only that, but new passengers show up right as the timer starts, throwing a wrench in your plans.\nEach player has their own unique route only they can take. You'll need to use these routes frequently to save precious travel time. But doing so requires tricky passenger handoffs and coordination between players.\nAs players deliver passengers, they earn money that is used to upgrade their planes - allowing you to fly faster and carry more passengers.\nA intense, cooperative, pick-up-and-deliver game\nMake complex, logistical decisions - in a matter of seconds\nExperience the mayhem of running your own airline\nMounting tension as more and more passengers arrive\nAll new art from acclaimed illustrator, Ryan Goldsberry\n2-5 player, ages 10+, 30-60 minutes\n        Read the rules here  \nGrab the Print and Play files here\n   Click the images to read reviews\n                                \"Now Boarding is the kind of cooperative game that hits that great balance where every player contributes and everyone has to carry their own weight. It\u2019s really unique, unlike any other game, cooperative, or real-time, or anything I\u2019ve played before, and I do recommend you check it out.\" - Meeple Overboard\n\"Interesting decisions, lively table talk, and a really good time ... there was mounting tension, there was laughter, there was success - the hallmarks of any great co-op ... I will be backing this on Kickstarter the minute it goes live.\" - @gamegeekninja\n \"It's hectic and crazy, and just about makes you feel some sympathy for the airlines when they leave you stranded without a seat. Almost. An intense blend of logistics and real-time action.\" - Jonathan H. Liu, GeekDad Full review here\n\"Now Boarding walks a tightrope between smart strategy and manic energy. You'll work together to form your plan, only to watch as it all goes awry and your group scrambles to make it all work. Table talk is everything, making Now Boarding a great social experience, and the game's a good time too!\" - Gameosity\n\"Now Boarding takes real time cooperative games to a new level. The puzzle every player is attempting to solve together keeps you engaged and thinking the whole game. There is a ton of strategic bang without overly complex rules or a long play time. This is a must have for any gamer that likes cooperative play or real time.\" - Sam Aho, Sam Says\n\"Now Boarding is a solid game with a good hook that gets players involved quickly. The game play is very straightforward, but never the path to victory. Players must work together and talk things out constantly or the game will crumble. Unlike other cooperative games, players cannot be taking their moves in a vacuum and must depend on others to do things in certain sequences if they are to be successful.\"\nFather Geek\n          Announcing a new add-on!\nWe have partnered with the developers at Dino Polo Club to bring you Mini Metro!  Mini Metro is a minimalist subway simulation game about designing efficient subway networks. The player must constantly redesign their line layout to meet the needs of a rapidly-growing city. It really feels like a lot like Now Boarding, with the crunchy routing puzzles to solve, and passengers losing patience :-)  Only $5 for a copy via Steam for PC.(normally $9.99) Grab the new pledge tier, or grab it later in the pledge manager.\n  Wok Star was my first boardgame and I'm bringing it back for the fans. This will be a new 3rd edition of the game. Like Now Boarding, Wok Star is a realtime cooperative game for 1-4 players. Players are members of the Wang family, trying to keep their Chinese restaurant in business. Each player has a unique responsibility - ingredients to prepare, and recipes to serve.  And you only have 20 seconds to serve each customer.\nI'm mixing the best elements from the first two editions, and adding some new, modern mechanics. I want to keep it's identity as a game, but tweak a few things to keep it dynamic. There will be more paths to victory via new investments, each with their own risks and rewards. There are more ways to use your dice and deal with bad rolls. And of course it\u2019ll keep the great art and fun sense of humor.  \nCoordinate \"Grocery Runs\" that allow all players to reroll use their dice again.  \nGo fancy and add new ingredients to your dishes allowing you to make more money.\nEarn \"Hustle\" which allows you to manipulate dice in a pinch. \nIt will come in the same size box as Now Boarding, 6\u201dx9\u201dx1.5\u201d It'll have sandtimers and a timer app. Check out the new tiers that include copies of Wok Star.\n  Tim here  - Now Boarding started 10 years ago as a videogame (nowboarding.us).  My friend Tom Mason and I wanted to be indie game developers. We came up with a quirky time management game that captured the craziness of running an airline.  It's been a crazy journey since then  - working at game studios and recently going full time making boardgames.  So now it's back, converted into a boardgame that still has the interesting routing problems, angry passengers, time pressure - but now you have your friends to help!\nHelp guide the development of this game. We listen to our backers and strive to implement their clever ideas. \nOnce funded, our stretch goals will add more content and better components to improve the game for everyone.\nBackers receive the game at a discount compared to after the campaign. This game is not going to distributors.\nIt may not be in your local store.\nWithout your help, we won't be able to print this game and share it with the world.\nEuropean copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI will be working with my established partners for printing, shipping and fulfillment.

The Japanese celebrate this occasion, as according to their traditions, the goddess of Fuji mountain, Konohana Sakuya Hima revives the fallen flowers at this time. The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality, it is called Sakura.\nThe players in this game aim to play cards without taking any tricks. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules. The players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (coins). The best tactician will earn the least points by managing their coins the best and will win the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs till next spring.\nFor 2-6 players aged 10 and above.\n Easy to learn\nThe game is easy to learn and to teach. The active player has to play a card from hand onto each face-up card on the table.\nThe placed card must be the same colour as the card on the top of the pile, and it must be either greater or lesser in value then the top card, depending on the direction of the Yin- Yang card. Cards with the values of 1 and 13 count as adjacent. On the increasing side, a 1 may follow a 13, on the decreasing side a 13 may follow a 1.\nOR  \nThe placed card is the same value as the top card on the deck but is of a different colour.\nExample:\nTactical depth \nIf you cannot play a card using the main rules, you may hire one or more characters. To win the game you have to manage your coins well and combine the available character skills. \nExample: The player in his last turn cannot play any card by default. He has 5 coins, so he can use the first Samurai for 2 coins. It reverses the Yin-yang card and now he can play a black number 3 onto the right side. Now he pays his remaining 3 coins on Konohana, which allows him to play a card in any color. That way he can play his number seven card on the left side.\nYou have to take the pile(s) where you cannot play new card(s) in your turn. You will get coins from the cards immediatelly, but unfortunately they contain penalty points too, and only the player with the fewest points can be the winner of Sakura.\n             Note: Some components will not be included in the retail version and will be buyable only separately.\n  The game components are language independent, the rulebook will be included in 4 languages: English, French, German and Hungarian. \nThe latest rules are available on our homepage: http://a-games.hu/en/download/ \nDirect link: English rules, Hungarian rules, German rules, French rules\nAdditional: Spanish rules, Italian rules\nNote: The rulebooks are subject to change in the final product.

Make the team!\n  Heroes Wanted Elements of Danger is a special release, not only is it the last in the Heroes Wanted line of games, it is not likely to go into distribution.  This kickstarter project and limited number of games at Essen & BGG CON (if we make it in time) will be the only way to get the expansion in 2017.  In 2018, we will be selling this expansion directly via conventions and Amazon only - it will not be entering normal distribution channels.  If there are any copies left, we may be selling those into distribution in 2019 or later - but there is no guarantee that we will do so.\nHeroes Wanted: Elements of Danger is a superhero adventure game for 1-5 players that plays in 45 minutes.

We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Heroes Wanted: Elements of Danger will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays.

However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible.

We know money can be tight for retailers, so the amount you pledge today is only a deposit on the full amount. We'll send you an invoice for the remainder before we ship your rewards. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release the regular retail versions into distribution, giving you a head start on your competition. You can see the Retailer 12-Pack pledge level in the right-side column of this project page.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and it's own budget of production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively. \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion.

We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running successful Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers started the gaming frenzy on Kickstarter), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games (Sunrise City and the \"Valeria\" series of games).\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. Whether the news is good or bad, you can expect us to report it honestly and openly.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Crabs! are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered.

The knights were closely tied to the Crusades, and they were considered to be some of most highly skilled fighting units of that time. The orders grew in wealth and power for almost 200 years until King Phillip IV of France had them persecuted and arrested for reasons that are discussed by historians to this day.\nCrusaders: Thy Will Be Done, a brand new game from designer Seth Jaffee (Eminent Domain, Terra Prime), will put players in the role as the leader of a Crusading Order. Using an innovative Mancala/Rondel mechanism, they will move their knights through Europe and the Middle East. They will battle with enemies, construct buildings, and train troops - all the while trying to be the order that has gained the most influence before the game comes to a close.\nCrusaders: Thy Will Be Done will be published in glorious Deluxified\u2122 format, with all the quality you have come to expect from TMG.\n  First, why don't we let the designer, Seth Jaffee, tell us in his own words what was behind his creation of Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done:\n\u201cAwhile back, I heard about a brand new boardgame coming out that was going to combine a mancala mechanism with a rondel. I thought that idea was brilliant, and made some assumptions on how that must work. My guess was that on your turn you would choose an action to do, resolve that action based on the number of action tokens in that space on the rondel (the more, the better), then distribute those tokens around the rondel a-la Mancala. This sounded fantastic, as each action would sort of grow in power until you take it, then it would revert back to zero, and you\u2019d have to build it back up before taking it again. I was really excited about this idea, but to my surprise, I found out that I\u2019d guessed wrong!\u201d\n\u201cSo in a weird bit of serendipity, my incorrect guess at the mechanism ended up giving me an idea that would make for an entirely different mechanical experience, one I thought was well worth pursuing. Looking at how Crusaders turned out, I think I can safely say I was right.\u201d\nTasty Minstrel Games is committed to not only publishing amazing and excellent games, we also want those games to look amazing and excellent as well. Our past Kickstarters for Orleans and Yokohama have set a high mark for Deluxified\u2122 components, and we will continue that standard of quality with Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done.\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make and deliver them to you the backer. For this reason, TMG will only make a Deluxified\u2122 version through crowdfunding. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales in Limited Quantity.\n   A major part of playing Crusaders happens on a players personal player board, which has a lot going on as you can see.\nTo get a full run down of game play, and how the player boards interact with the main map, check out this video.  \nCheck out the rules for Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done HERE\nHelp our Crusaders rise up!!!  Conquer these funding goals one step up at a time.\n  TMG thinks Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done is sure to make gamers all over the world happy, but instead of taking our word for it, we reached out to several independent reviewers and asked them to tell us what they thought of the game.\n        While technically not a review, Twist Gaming was kind enough to have TMG's own UndeadViking on their channel at Dice Tower Con and played Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done!\nAlso at Dice Tower Con, TMG had dozens of people demo Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done. We were able to capture some of their thoughts on video!\n    With more reviews on the way. \nPeople have come to expect a premium experience when choosing to support a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game. Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done will follow our high quality shipping standard of being bubble wrapped, boxed individually and then boxed up again before being shipped to you. This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy. The following is an unboxing of a Deluxified\u2122 Yokohama, to illustrate what we are offering:\nPLAY\n\nIn addition to premium packaging this project is:\nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of these countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places.

Yes, this will include all of the stretch goals and be identical to the other Deluxified\u2122 copies. Only Brick and Mortar retailers can pledge at this level. \nRetailers can order 4 or 8 copies for $50 each, which is 50% off of the $100 MSRP pricing. This price includes shipping. This is for US delivery addresses only. Retailers outside of the US will need to use a US forwarding address.\nThe pledge tier cost of $30 which will applied toward the final payment. Final payment will be due just prior to shipping the games.\nAt the close of the Kickstarter campaign, retailers will receive a survey Retailers must provide a copy of their business license or similar information as proof of their retail business to qualify for this pledge level. \nWe are excited to offer this option to our Retailer partners so we can explore even more ways for people to enjoy the Deluxified\u2122 version of our game.\nAll of us here at TMG realize that a good relationship between publisher and backer during a crowdfunding campaign is paramount for it to be a success. It is our goal to make sure that the communication in the Kickstarter projects run by Tasty Minstrel Games will be more active and connected than ever before. For the first 7 days of the campaign, we will post updates at least once every 72 hours. In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff.    \nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis every day and questions will be answered at those times.  \nAfter the campaign has concluded, the comments page will continue to be monitored on a regular basis, but with less frequency than before. Any questions posted will be answered when they are seen. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers.  \nAfter the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal support lines.   \nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

The industrial smog is choking the city to death but there is nothing its citizens can do about it. The Royal Company controls what comes in, what goes out, and all the people that live within. What's strange is that nobody seems to remember when they came to power or how they stay in power, for that matter. \nHowever, a few key citizens with extraordinary talents in the art of lock picking have just received a series of strange lock boxes inviting them to a mysterious location near The Station. This group of individuals come from all walks of life and social tiers, drawn together for some unknown purpose by a masked stranger. \nThis is Triplock, the latest game from acclaimed designers Josh and Adam Carlson and Chip Theory Games. This heavily themed abstract game will have you wracking your brain to solve locks faster than your opponent. Play 1 vs 1 against another lock breaker, or take on The Station in a series of 4 solo challenges as you begin to unravel the mysteries of New London. Play vanilla rules for a completely level playing field, or take on the role of one of four unique personas to add new strategic depth and theme to each game.  \n    The Rules\nHere is a web optimized version of the Triplock Rulebook 1.0.  \n Triplock can be learned in minutes. Players compete to solve the Master Lock first or before time runs out! In competitive play, solving the Master Lock means being first to complete 5 Diagrams or acquire 10 pts.\n\nWhen going Solo, you must select which characters you will be bringing into the depths of The Station and with each Room you encounter, you will need to select the best lock breaker for the job. Every Room is different, some are on timers, while others have Station opponents! Solve all the Rooms before running out of characters to win. \nTurn Sequence\nIn Triplock, your turn gives you the chance to use your Skill and roll your Action dice. That's the easy part. What you do with those dice is where it gets interesting as you have two options: Take the two Actions you rolled and perform one or both of them. Or, forgo both results to choose any 1 Action. \nRemember, your objective is to manipulate the Master Lock to complete Diagrams by discovering and matching specific Mechanisms per your Diagram's instructions/orientation. Solving your Diagrams can award you points, further Actions, even new Diagrams. \nThere are many lines of play a person can take - but your opponent is doing the same and is manipulating the Master Lock as well! You will want to use Traps and Counter Measures to stall and befuddle your opponent while you make the necessary adjustments needed to reach your goal (10 pts or 5 Diagrams) to solve the Master Lock! \nCheck out this quick overview of the components and how they all fit together: \nDiagrams\nWhen Diagrams are drawn, an orientation must be selected. It is then placed face down in front of you. Each player is allowed 3 Diagrams at one time and cannot see what the other has chosen unless they use an Action to Reveal the Diagram.\nDiagram Card\nEach player starts with one Diagram and may draw more throughout the game by using a specific Action to do so, or by completing a Diagram that tells you to draw a new Diagram. Each Diagram has 4 orientations you may choose from, each with a variety of symbols showing and also the method required to solve it (Trip, Combo, Collect).  By manipulating the Master Lock using your Skills and Actions, you\u2019ll attempt to identify and line up Mechanisms in various patterns to match your Diagram. Bigger groups of Mechanisms will earn you more points. Be careful though, going for aggressive Diagram orientations will take longer to complete!  \nTraps and Counter Measures\nTraps and Counter Measures are also Diagrams, but are used specifically against your opponent. Traps stay hidden just like a normal Diagram and are revealed when they are Triggered. Counter Measures always stay face up and can be an ongoing source of Points, however, you cannot \"Complete\" a Counter Measure. It's always there, taking up one of your 3 spots. You will need to use them wisely!\n      Triplock is designed, out of the box, with a strong solo component. This is not something tacked on after the fact to add artificial value. The game comes with 4 solo challenges and a storyline to follow right out of the gate. Once you\u2019ve completed the entire location (The Station), revisit it with our Challenge Mode to increase difficulty. Still too easy? Become a Master Lock Breaker and attempt to complete the game without failing a lock! Quick to setup and tear down, Triplock makes for a great travel solo experience. Also, as you will soon see...this is just the very first location of many.\nThe story follows a group of people from New London who, whether they realize it or not, have managed to become the best lock breakers in the city. They all hail from a different walk of life, but their paths are criss-cross in important ways. Solo play in Triplock will have you assembling a specific team and taking on The Station one room at a time.  \n                  If you've followed Chip Theory Games for any other campaigns, you already know what to expect. For those that are new here, let us explain how we operate. We believe many game companies don't spend enough money investing in, or time thinking about how components affect their games. We see components as more than just the tokens used to play a game. Premium components add immersion, top-level enjoyment, and durability to any game. Each of these are imperative, in our opinion. Combined with innovative mechanics and solid game play, it can change your entire experience for the better. \nEvery CTG game is designed with this in mind. We eschew traditional cardboard whenever possible and use neoprene mats, 11.5g premium custom-foiled chips, waterproof PVC cards, and HD print/heat-impressed dice. Our components, box inserts, and box itself have their own development timelines alongside the actual game. In our minds: \"Everything says something.\" The best game in a shoddy box = less than \"the best game\". Obviously, this attention to detail tends to come with a price tag. But, we are trying to buck that trend a bit with Triplock by offering amazing value and a very aggressive price savings for the game on Kickstarter. \nWe want you to feel great about your game the first time you crack it open, before you play it, while you play it, and after you've put it away. But achieving this goes beyond the game itself. Over the course of our previous four campaigns we've developed an industry-best reputation for communication with our backers and fans. We treat you how we'd want to be treated, period. This means sending out regular, timely, informative, and often entertaining Kickstarter updates to our backers. It also means staying OUT of the unreachable \"ivory tower\" and making ourselves contactable directly on social media, etc. \nIn addition to all of this, we're very active in the comments, BGG, facebook, Twitter, Discord, and anywhere else you might find us. We don't take a single one of your entertainment dollars for granted and want to make sure you're feeling excited, comfortable, and confident about your purchase every single step of the way. That's the Chip Theory Games experience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery new Kickstarter is an opportunity to improve on the last.

Once upon a time. Since her passing, this once great land has dissolved into formless void. While all of the Fae kingdom has mourned this tremendous loss, you \u2013 the Guardians of the Four Winds \u2013 have vowed to restore Idyllon to its former glory.\nGroves is a strategy game that combines worker placement with bag building. There are multiple worker types that a guardian can summon to reap the benefits of the land.\nRounds start with players drawing three spirits (workers) from their summoning bag and placing them one at a time.\nAfter drawing their Spirits, players take turns placing those Spirits in available locations. At the start of the game, Spirits can be played on a player's own groves or onto the central Tree of Idyll.\nOnce a player constructs a portal, that player can also place their Spirits onto another player's groves.\nPlaying on Groves will earn a player resources and/or dominion points. Any spirit earns the general ability (lower left).  When a paired spirit is played on a matching grove, the player earns the general ability as well as the bonus ability (bottom right).\nPlaying at the Tree of Idyll allows players to purchase new Groves (crystal costs vary and are paid to the player currently holding the crown token), collect summoning bonuses, and construct portals.\nAfter all players have placed their three spirits, any spirits in the Tree of Idyll are discarded, while the spirits played on groves are placed in the summoning bag of the owner of the realm they are played in (regardless of which player played them there).\nThe game continues until the Grove deck runs out. Players count Dominion from their groves, Dominion earned from Grove abilities, Dominion earned from completed summoning bonus cards, and any Dominion earned from global bonuses that they collected. The player with the most Dominion wins! \nTo win, players must make the most of their realm by adding new Groves to gain Dominion Points and new abilities. They must also optimize their draws by adding new, helpful Spirits while banishing unwanted Spirits to the Tree of Idyll or to their opponents' realms.\nLearn more about the gameplay by watching this Learn to Play by Cassie Elle!\n                                                                                                *Multiplayer and solo variant both included on Tabletopia!\n                                                                                                                                        Read the full Gameosity preview\n                                 Read Mike's take on the use of bag-building in Groves\n                                                                           Watch Rahdo's Runthrough of Groves\nWatch Rahdo's extended Runthrough of Groves\n   STAY UP TO DATE ON GROVES   \nCheck out Groves on Board Game Geek\nFollow Letiman Games on Twitter  \nLike Letiman Games on Facebook  \nFollow Letiman Games on Instagram    \nPOCASTS, INTERVIEWS, AND MORE INFO ABOUT GROVES\n  Tompet Games Kickstarter Interviews - Dan Letzring\nGo Forth and Game - Circle the Circus in the Grove\nBoard Game Workshop - Episode 13: Steven Aramini\nCardboard Architects Kickstarter Special: Steven Aramini & Groves\nPeople Behind the Meeples - Episode 72: Dan Letzring\nPeople Behind the Meeples - Episode 75: Steven Aramini\nFairway Thoughts: Grove\u2019s Bag Building\nKickstarter Groves Livestream 1\nMEDIA COVERAGE\n\nHuffington Post - 8 *NEW* Games You Should Judge by Their Cover\nGameosity - Jess\u2019s Fav Five Kickstarters of the Week 6/9/17\nDice Tower News  Wallet Kicker of the Week - June 14, 2017\nDice Tower Crowd Surfing - June 21, 2017 (Kickstarter, Kickstarter)\nClub Fantasci Kickstarter of the Week - June 11, 2017\nGeekDad Kickstarter Tabletop Roundup - June 14, 2017\nDice Tower Board Game Breakfast - Pssst, Did You Hear?

The fun, excitement and rush it brings to the table offers a full course for gamers and family members alike.\nIn the game, players use hourglasses as their workers assigning them to various tasks from taking orders, cooking dishes and buying groceries. Any worker placed on an action space may not be used elsewhere before the sand within the hourglass runs out making each decision important as time is limited.\nKitchen Rush is designed by D\u00e1vid Turczi, known for his work on Anachrony & Days of Ire: Budapest 1956.\n                             You can view the English rulebook of Kitchen Rush by clicking here.\n   To include any add-ons to your pledge, please click on the \"Manage your pledge\" button on the top right corner of this page. Increase your total pledged amount to include any add-ons you would like to receive.\nBy the end of the campaign you will be asked to fill a survey where you will inform us which add-ons you have added in your order.\n    The production of Kitchen Rush is scheduled for July-August 2017. The game will be produced in Germany's largest board game manufacturer ensuring a high quality product.\nThe published product may have differences regarding sizes, quantities, colors and layout because of production limitations and/or adjustments.\nStretch rewards generated through this campaign will be given to all backers free of charge. Keep in mind that these Stretch rewards will not be exclusive and they may become available to acquire in the future at an additional cost. \n   We expect to have the game delivered to backers within November 2017. Please keep in mind though, that there is always the chance of the production and handling process getting delayed for various reasons.\nOur current shipping solution DOES NOT offer tracking. From past experience we already know that the percentage of lost items is almost 0%. However, If you require tracking for your order, please contact us at support[at]artipiagames.comand let us know. Please note that you will be requested to pay additional shipping costs since your order will have to be handled separately from our group shipping solution.\nAll orders will be shipped from Greece (EU member). If you have any concerns regarding customs and import taxes for large cost orders, please contact us at support[at]artipiagames.com and we will assist you on that.\nIn order to keep shipping costs as low as possible, we always try to find the most efficient solutions for mass shipping of games/items.

Note that the only guaranteed way that you will be among the first to get the game, is to select the \"Essen 2017\" pledge level. Since this is a Spiel 2017 release, several customers and retailers may purchase the game from the fair which means they will get it before our group shipment goes out to backers.

In addition, the production may get delayed due to various reasons. Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of examples. Artipia Games should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties.\n\nMISSING / DAMAGED ITEMS\nIf after receiving your whole order, there are missing/damaged items please inform us by sending an email at support[at]artipiagames.com including some photos of what was damaged. We will send you replacements for the missing/damaged items as soon as possible.\nUnfortunately, we are unable to send replacements for damaged inserts/trays.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\nWe will re-send any packages returned to us undelivered after we will inform the backer. If a package was not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), we may request additional shipping fees to re-send the package.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\nEstimated delivery is November 2017. However third parties involved with the production of items needed to fulfil the campaign may cause unpredictable delays. Also, after sending the packages, further delays may occur due to your local customs and postal services traffic that are out of Artipia Games control.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\nAfter the campaign is over you will be requested to complete a survey including your shipping address. Please provide us a shipping address that will be valid around November 2017. If after filling the survey you wish to alter your shipping address, please send us a message at support[at]artipiagames.com.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\nPlease note that due to weight limitations in the shipping methods we use, your order may be delivered in multiple packages. Even though all of your packages most probably will get shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nREFUNDS\nWe generally do not offer refunds unless we are completely unable to deliver the project. We will not offer refunds because of delays in delivery or changes/adjustments to the game's components, layout etc. or for damaged components that we are able to replace.

In it, players take on the role of a starship captain stranded in hostile space. As captain, you'll be tasked with assigning crew member to various stations in order to deal with external threats like enemy spaceships, as well as internal threats like system malfunctions. \nOriginally starting as a print & play game, Deep Space D-6 released commercially in 2015 through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Beautifully minimalistic and tightly designed, the small print run was quickly consumed by avid gamers of all types and stock has been scarce ever since. \nIt's time to return to the deepest of deep space! Whether you are an accomplished D-6 Captain or have never tried a solitaire board game before, I'm glad to have you aboard! Now is your chance to get a hold of Deep Space D-6 with a revised rulebook. In addition, there is a new mini expansion that brings a new threat to the galaxy. This is a rescue mission and we'll need all the help we can get. \n          What's new in the reissue? \nThis is a straight reprint (not a 2nd edition). The first Kickstarter unlocked a wealth of enhancements and the box is at max capacity. As such, there will be no stretch goals and only minor changes from the first printing. The components are largely identical with the following revisions:\nRevised Rulebook - added some card clarifications\nHull and Shield cubes now have rounded corners\nOuroboros gameplay text has been modified\nRead more about the changes here.\nNew RPG game mode:\nClick the image to learn more.\n  The Long Way Home is an optional roleplaying supplement for DSD-6 that will be made available for free to all backers in the months following delivery of the game. A professionally printed version may happen in the future, but will not be part of this campaign. \nEach turn in Deep Space D-6 you'll roll crew dice and assign them to stations to perform unique ship actions. There are 4 unique ships, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. \nYou can learn more about the game by visiting the original Kickstarter campaign here. \nHere are some videos made from the first printing:\n   Special thanks to all video contributors!\nWant to know more? Check out the original rulebook.\nOr try the Print & Play.\nMagnetic one-piece box\n4 Ship Boards\n6 custom 14mm crew dice, 1 standard threat die\nThreat Deck of 54 cards including the Ouroboros Boss Encounter  \n8mm plastic Hull and Shield tracker cubes\nRevised Rulebook\nInfirmary card\n  As with all my Kickstarters, you won't find crazy positive video reviews/previews or extensive marketing campaigns with stretch goals where I try to maximize funding by over promising. As an independent publisher, I believe in investing in a solid product, and not my ability to convince you to back it. The following videos are completely independent and have no affiliation with Tau Leader games. \nThis video nails my design intention regarding the interesting decisions and how they are less about the random dice rolls, and more about deftly managing threats and resources:\n  See more written and video reviews at BoardGameGeek.com\nFound this cool piece on reddit: I'm really surprised how well designed Deep Space D-6 is\nCalling all captains! A new threat has been detected. We don't know where they came from or what they want, but their numbers never seem to end.\nnon-final artwork\nTo defeat this new threat you'll have to perform overkill effects or be prepared to be overwhelmed by rapidly deploying enemy fleets. The Endless feed off each other and the more of them on the board, the more dangerous they become. Lucky for you, we've got ship upgrades available to help you overcome this radical new threat. \nThe Endless Expansion, available for the first time through this Kickstarter consist of:\n54 new cards including external threats, internal threats, ship upgrades, and a new final encounter.\nReplacement Ouroboros cards to bring the 1st edition inline with the 2nd printing.\nNote: You do not mix this new expansion with the base game cards. This new mini-expansion plays on it's own but requires the base game. However, the upgrades can be used with the original threat deck. Fully compatible with all 4 ships. Yes, it fits in the base game box.\nThe nice thing about this campaign is that shipping is no longer a mystery. Final box dimensions and weight have been predetermined. Shipping for this project is a subsidized rate of the actual shipping costs I was charged from the original Kickstarter campaign fulfillment. \nTo see the shipping rates, click on the pledge tier you are interested in and it will display the different costs based on your region. \nGames will be shipped through fulfillment centers primarily in China, the EU, and the US. This reduces custom fees and VAT. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies and/or any number of expansions for the listed pledge price. There is no extra shipping charge.\nPlease note: There is an error in the Fleet Commander pledge. The estimated delivery is not November 2017. Estimated delivery for Fleet Commander pledge is December 2017, just like the rest of the pledges. \n  Tony is a visual designer and UX specialist currently residing in New York.

Predict your opponent\u2019s moves to prevent them from gaining ground, and when all hope seems lost, snatch victory away from your opponent with clever use of your Specialist agents.\nIf you are the first to capture both parts of the Doomsday Device, it\u2019s game over for your opponent.\nA quick review of the game board and object will reveal that Pocket Ops is based on the familiar framework of tic-tac-toe \u2014 but don't write it off as child's play just yet! The prediction mechanic and Specialist abilities have been proven to offer playtesters both challenge and laughter. Don't believe it? Check out the sample Print n' Play files below:\n   ...or check out the Tabletop Simulator mod on Steam!\n  Pocket Ops is the first published design of Brandon Beran, with art and graphic design by industry veteran Josh Cappel.\n         Pocket Ops is quick to pick up, because you already know how to play; If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe before, you have the fundamentals: place markers in a grid, trying to get three in a row. But wait! The simple but game-changing twist with Pocket Ops is that before you make a move, the other player gets to secretly predict where you are going to go. After your move, if they were right, your move is canceled. In addition, a variety of Specialist tokens that introduce all sorts of sneaky abilities will change the way you place and predict.

Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards and transparency we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\n\nAside from artwork changes that may come about as a result of stretch goals, this game is finished and ready to go to Bang Wee, the experienced manufacturer of our two previous titles.\n\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign, and we feel confident that those lessons will help us make this campaign successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Spy in training", "descp": "Support our project + 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\nFREE shipping within the US, $5 Canada, $10 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Stroop Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["55 backers", "Limited (195 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Unreal Estate Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (205 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "Spy Hard", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 4 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 4 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$7 for shipping within the US, $12 Canada, $15 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Guild Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $15 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["43 backers", "Limited (207 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Santa Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 10 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 10 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $20 Canada, $30 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "\"Bond...

It was an era when Scotland made the challenging transition from an agricultural country to an industrialized one, heavily relying on trade and export. \nAs proud members of the old clans you use your unique abilities and cunning skill to earn the greatest wealth and fame.\nThe game is designed by Juma Al-JouJou, a solo-entrepreneur and founder of Karma Games. Juma has also designed and self-published Green Deal which Tom Vasel rated as the 5th best economic game of all time. Clans of Caledonia is illustrated by Klemens Franz, the illustrator of award-winning games such as Agricola, Caverna and Isle of Skye.   \nThere are more than 220 custom wooden tokens! Click for larger view.\n   Clans of Caledonia has a unique blend of mechanisms and includes elements of engine-building games (e.g. Terra Mystica) and economic mechanisms such as a dynamic market (e.g. Navegador) and export contracts (e.g. Voyages of Marco Polo). \nThe way you produce whisky, bread and cheese from grain and milk is interwoven with the trade and export of goods. This makes it a highly interactive strategy game, with great strategic depth despite having a very accessible rule set.  \nThe modular board, the 8 different clans with unique powers and the multiple scoring and port tiles ensure outstanding replayability.\nA game example at the 2-player count. Click for larger view.\n     The modular board offering 16 different map setups.

Click for larger view.\n      In addition to all the components from the Clans of Caledonia pledge level including all Stretch Goals, the Premium Clans of Caledonia pledge level includes 70 metal coins and a KS exclusive box sleeve.\nMetal Coins\nMoney is so important in this game! Upgrading the coins to 70 metal coins is the best upgrade possible. It feels great to hold heavy coins in your hands and their jingling sound is music in the ears of their wealthy and proud owner! In addition, there is basically no wear and tear! Perfect for a game with such a high replayability. \nThe supplier is producing sample coins right now. The producer of the metal coins is the same supplier as the one for Scythe from Stonemaier Games, so expect some awesome metal coins! \n  Render image: Lily, The Lion Rampant of Scotland & Mary Stuart. Klemens designed the coins specifically for Clans of Caledonia. The coins have a diameter of 20, 22 and 24 mm respectively and will be 2 mm thick (just as thick as the coins in Scythe).\n       Add-on: You can also add up to four additional sets of metal coins as an add-on to your pledge of the game by adding \u20ac19 per set of metal coins. Please check the FAQ for details. \nExcess Premium copies produced by this campaign may be sold in limited number at retail at a higher price. \nBox Sleeve (KS exclusive)\nThe premium sleeve slides onto the game box for a premium hold. The front proudly presents the eight clan chiefs of Clans of Caledonia.\n  The sleeve features all of the clan crests on the sides and a map of Scotland on the back with the current clan seats. Click for larger view.\n  Exclusivity: The sleeves and metal coins will not be widely available after the Kickstarter. There will only be enough sleeves printed to cover replacements. Take note that we also reserve the right to print similar box sleeves for special releases. Due to the high cost of producing metal coins, it is expected they will be very limited in retail. \nWe also want to give you the chance to shape the final product in a truly unique way! You can make suggestions and vote first for an additional port tile, then for a scoring tile and finally for a clan tile. At certain points during the campaign, voting for these will take place and will end: \nParticipate and shape the final product!\n   You, Kickstarer backers, will add one extra port, scoring and clan tile that will be included in every single game in this print run! The additional 9th clan will also be eternalized on the box sleeve. These additional tiles will be clearly marked as untested. The community of players can playtest and balance these tiles after release together. \nThe earlier you join in, the more you can shape the final game! Join this FB group to submit your ideas and vote!           \nClans of Caledonia includes more than 220 custom wooden tokens, a modular map and a full solo variant including custom silk-screened dice. We recognise that many of these features are often added as stretch goals but we don't want to compromise a top quality final product. Also, we don't want to risk the game balance by adding content that was not playtested (and that is not marked as untested). \nEven though we think that is the case, we are still going to add a few more components with your help!  \nAll Stretch Goals unlocked!\nFacebook Shares \nRetweets \nBoardgamegeek Thumbs \nDownload your favorite clan as a social media avatar.\n                                      Videos\nReview by Man vs. Meeple\nPreview by Counter Culture\n First impressions by slickerdrips\n\nHunter & Cron (German)\n\nAntlab Games, 2-Player\nSlickerdrip, Solo\n2-Player with Juma, the Game Designer, and Nick-Nack\n\nWritten Reviews\nBoardgamequest: \"If you\u2019re a fan of games such as Terra Mystica, Clans of Caledonia offers something equally fulfilling in an equal or shorter playtime\"\nMeoples' Magazine: \"Clans of Caledonia is great with two, three or four players.The clans are well balanced.\"\n\nSpielkult (German)\n\nRead the rules here.\nAnd play the game on Tabletopia now!\n                                   Within a month of receiving your copy (or if you haven't received your game by Dec 31, 2017) you can return the game and we even pay for return shipping, no strings attached. \nDepending on how early you pledge, you will receive:  \n  The guarantee applies to your pledge amount. The pledge amount equals the tiers you chose plus shipping costs.  \nClans of Caledonia was heavily playtested and I continued tweaking and balancing the game even when everyone thought I should stop. Thus, I am confident that, if it's a style of game you usually like, you will love Clans of Caledonia!  \nI strongly believe it's a stellar product that is truly outstanding and can bear comparison with the best Euro games on the market today.\nInspired by the so-called Stonemaier Method, we will ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low. Country codes are here.\nShipping fee automatically added at checkout.\nBackers are limited to 2 games per pledge (any combination is fine; you will only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add an additional game beyond the first, manually enter the \u20ac total when making your pledge or click the \"Manage your pledge\" button at the top of the page. \n\nShipping costs are heavily subsidized. If we had subsidized shipping even more to make it free in the US, we would have had to increase the pledge by \u20ac10. So we deliberately kept the tier low so you can actually save money by pleding for two copies because you pay shipping only once per pledge.  \n\nWe will be shipping from within US, within EU, within Canada and within China to the respective backers. Depending on the success of the campaign, we may also ship from within Australia. \nCustoms & Duty Free Shipping in US, EU and CA\n\nThe game will contain two rulebooks, one rulebook in English, and one in German. Since the game materials are language independent, we plan to offer digital files of translations of the rules in various languages.\nThe game comes with printed rulebooks in English and German.\n  Translations in French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch will be provided as digital files online.\n  Juma is a solo-entrepreneur and game designer. There is no big publisher behind this project. Consequently Kickstarter is the only way for Juma to publish this game as it helps him to assess the level of demand for the game and to finance the costly production. \n  All Kickstarter backers receive a money-back guarantee, but the sooner you back the better your guarantee is. Backers during the first 3 days receive even a 110% money-back guarantee! \nShape the final product! Based on your suggestions and votes, we will add one additional clan, one additional scoring tile and one additional port tile. The earlier you pledge, the more you can participate. \n Approximately 30% off MRSP and subsidized shipping: you are not likely to get this game cheaper any time soon. We are known for keeping our prices stable. \nExclusivity: The sleeves and metal coins will not be widely available after the Kickstarter.\nThere is no big publisher behind Clans of Caledonia so without your pledges this game won't be produced at all. \nBy backing this Kickstarter, you allow me to devote more time to our awesome hobby and bring more great games to you soon!\n\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering either version of the game to retailers during the campaign. Retailer backers, just like other backers, will receive their rewards before the games will go into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact Juma at juma@karma-games.de (please use \"Retailer\" in the email object) during the campaign for pricing information. \nAbout the Creators\nI am Juma.  \n  I am the father of a small family in Berlin (Germany) and an avid gamer. I studied Philosophy & Economics (bachelor's degree) and Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship / Business Administration (master's degree). No wonder I love economic games. \n\nKarma Games is just me - there are no emloyees, no marketing manager, I do it all! :)  \n\nWhen I was 16 I participated in a music school exchange program and was hosted by a lovely Scottish family on the Isle of Bute, west of Glasgow. I believe that the design process of this game can be traced back to that great experience!  \n\nKlemens Franz is the illustrator of Clans of Caledonia. Klemens has illustrated many award-winning strategy games such as Agricola, Caverna and Isle of Skye. Klemens is based in Austria: http://www.atelier198.com/   \nDan Cunningham, founder of Iron Kitten Games, reached out to me, a few months ago and asked if he could help. He was incredibly helpful with various tasks, from creating 3D renders and animations, to production, Tabletopia implementation and Kickstarter related issues (a truly multitalented individual!).\nMichael Csorba, recently asked if he could help and supports me with communication and running the Kickstarter. He is the only one who also resides in Berlin, it's great to see a team member face to face once in a while! \nAdriano Rahde, from Ao Amor in Brazil, has created the amazing Kickstarter video trailer! Thank you! \nPlaytesters: More than 50 regular playtesters helped to create this awesome game. I'm grateful that you were all willing to play the prototype again and again -  even in the early stages of development when it was still rough around the edges. Your contribution and feedback was invaluable! \nA lot more people actively reached out to me and offered help, some Boardgamegeek users who helped so much with editing the rules (especially Francois Landry Corbin, Mike Poole, Steven Barba and many more). The truth is: without the many people who volunteered to help, this game would not be as great as it is. It was a real community effort. I was, and still am, amazed how awesome so many board game enthusiasts are. Thank you all! \nOther Products\nJuma designed two other games that you can order from the Karma Games website.\n\n  Fette Ernte is a card game for 3 to 5 kids to learn about growing vegetables (only available in German).\nPlease feel free to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter here: http://www.karma-games.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI do have some experience with managing and fulfilling a crowd funding project. My last campaign was delivered one month ahead of schedule and only four months after the campaign finished. That game was also called 5th best economic game of all time by Tom Vasel. \n\nDespite my experience, there are still some risks involved that everyone backing the project must be aware of.\n\nThere could be delays: freight and worldwide fulfillment is complex and involves numerous companies. I read everything about the topic on Stonemaier Games' blog (an invaluable resource, thank you Jamey!) and consulted other creators for tips and tricks on how to manage fulfillment the best way possible.\n\nIn addition, I decided to work with the best fulfillment partners even if it comes at a higher cost. \n\nDue to proximity to the fulfillment centers or the factory some backers will receive their games significantly earlier than others. The majority of backers should receive their games around October 2017, ideally a few weeks before the game fair in Essen, though. If delays arise it may happen that the game is available at the game fair in Essen before some backers received their copies. \n\nI will do my best to solve any problems that may arise and keep you regularly updated.\n\nClans of Caledonia features variable player powers. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game. In the beginning the game was playtested with 50+ different play testers. They provided diverse qualitative feedback that led to the final gameplay mechanisms. \n\nOnce the game mechanisms were nearly final, I focused on balancing the clans. Therefore, I playtested again and again with the best players of Clans of Caledonia only because the stats were far more reliable than with new players whose skills varies a lot. I gathered the stats, fine tuned the clans and made some quantitative analyses in Excel that indicated that the clans are very well balanced. My playtesters agreed. \n\nNonetheless I am aware that other games with variable player powers ended up being perceived by players as much less balanced than the creators predicted. In order to mitigate this risk, I included a Clan auction variant that ensures nearly 100% fairness. Furthermore, one can also play this game without variable player powers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Sl\u00e0inte", "descp": "Join in and suggest the additional clan, port and scoring tiles.

You are all amazing! We'll be posting updates as the day progresses and catching up to all of your questions and comments soon. For now, THANK YOU SO MUCH!\nUPDATE: Multilingual support added!\nUPDATE: International partner Spieleschmiede campaign funds added to US total for stretch goal unlocks.\n5-16-17 / 11pm \nTOTAL: $63,450 (US) + $4,853 (DE) = $68,303 worldwide\n Tesla vs. Edison: Duel is a fun, easy-to-learn, 2-player card game that takes less than 30 minutes to play. Duel distills the epic War of Currents to its essence while still preserving all major areas of play from the original smash hit. \nChoose Your Side. It's AC vs DC - and only one can win! \nPlay as Famous Inventors. Select Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, or one of six other amazing inventors to run your electric company and compete for control over the nascent electricity industry of the United States. Each inventor plays differently leading to unique experiences every game. \nRecruit Heroes of Engineering, Business, and Popular Culture. Some of the most well-known historical figures from the actual War of Currents join your company and play key roles in your quest for glory. J.P. Morgan, H.G. Wells, Mark Twain, and others bring deeper thematic immersion and a wide range of special abilities. \nBuild an Empire. Vie for victory by controlling two of the three available regions: New England, New York, and Out West. \nClaim Electricity Projects. From Boston to Chicago, players extend their influence over each region by completing projects in the important cities of the time. \nDiscover New Technologies. Develop the \"latest and greatest\" technologies, seize pre-eminence from your opponent, and forge new relationships with other companies that assist your bid for victory. \nPlay the Stock Market. Joust with your opponent for control of other enterprises. Six minor companies, each with their own preferred technology, are also in the electricity business and located across the three regions. Acquire their stock if you lead in a company\u2019s preferred technology and increase your own regional influence. \nConduct Nefarious Propaganda. Promote AC or DC to lead public perception for added bonuses. Lobby against your opponent\u2019s technology to hamper their regional control. Propaganda is central to any winning strategy! \nAll in Less Time Than Lunch! While Tesla vs. Edison: Duel is a recognizable adaptation of our best-selling core game Tesla vs. Edison, the experience is very different and entirely unique. With lightweight rules, minimal table space, and play time under 30 minutes, Duel is a great game-over-lunch experience for casuals with enough strategic depth for hobby gamers too! \nCome play the War of Currents heads-up and enjoy our latest addition to the world of Tesla vs. Edison!\n                   Tesla vs. Edison: Duel pits two players head-to-head in a fast and fun area control game that packs a ton of electrifying goodness into a small package. Complete rules are available, and we\u2019ve also highlighted some key aspects of play here.\nIt all start with your Inventor.  Pick Tesla, Edison, or one of six other geniuses and prepare for the Duel. Each Inventor also has a different \"instant win\" condition so be sure to keep a close eye on your opponent!\nYour Assistants can claim projects, acquire stocks, influence playable power types in regions, conduct propaganda on the PR track, and advance technologies to help you expand your empire. Duel takes place over three phases. At the start of each phase, draft Assistants to work for your company. Alternate with your opponent and activate one Assistant each per turn by taking the two actions shown on each Assistant\u2019s card until the phase is finished.  Play is smooth and speedy with almost no downtime.\nPlayers battle for control of three regions. Regions award different bonuses and are scored at the end of each phase based on player influence. \nClaim a Project from the market and put it on your side of the board, contributing points to your control of that region. \nWhile you advocate for your preferred power, AC or DC, you also can develop technology of the time to lead in Transformers, Light Bulbs, or Electric Meters. Taking the card for one of these technologies endears you to smaller power companies that can help your bid for victory.\nThe stock market still plays a key role in Duel. Your company gives you influence in its home region. If you lead in a minor company\u2019s preferred technology, you can also acquire their shares to increase your influence in the region where they do business. The more shares you hold, the more influence you wield. You can also sell stock shares for free actions!\nDon\u2019t forget the battle for public perception and PR. Place No AC or No DC tokens on a region to entirely block your opponent\u2019s technology there - at least until they counter!  You can also increase the popularity of your chosen power technology on the PR track. Along with giving you more control over the No AC and No DC tokens, advancing here yields bonus actions and also serves as a tiebreaker for region control, sometimes literally winning you the game!\nAfter three rounds of play, whichever player controls two or more of the game's three regions wins. But don't forget each Inventor's unique instant win condition - if they achieve this goal during the game then they win immediately!\n         Tesla vs Edison: Duel will be manufactured in China. Copies will then be sent to our fulfillment partner depots in various regions around the world for ultimate distribution to backers. This saves you on shipping and extra taxes.\nWe're offering deeply discounted shipping to our backers everywhere. We recognize that even with these discounts, shipping to many parts of the world is just plain expensive, but we're doing what we can to make it easier.\nGiven our strategy of shipping to regional fulfillment depots, various countries will receive their copies at different times. Historically, backers in Asia and the Pacific receive their copies soonest since they are nearest to our manufacturer, then the U.S. and western Europe are relatively close together, and finally backers in the rest of the world receive theirs. We anticipate that all backers will receive their copies by October 2017, but most of you will receive your copies sooner. We'll keep you posted with more details via regular updates as we move forward into production and fulfillment.\nFinally, we also hope to offer Gen Con pickup for backers as we have in the past for other Kickstarter campaigns. The summer con season is very important for us. There's a chance we land the ocean container here in time for the show, but if not, we're planning on air shipping a limited quantity to Indianapolis for backer pickup and sales. We realize that this may occur before some backers, particularly those in more remote locales, have received their games and we're offering Gen Con pickup to give people more fulfillment options as a result. We'll provide more details about this via updates closer to Gen Con. We hope you understand and still choose to support our project!\n    Artana is committed to supporting our retail partners. We offer wholesale pricing to verified stores and other gaming establishments. We treat you like other backers, but you will receive your rewards ahead of other normal distributions channels. If you are a verifiable retailer, please contact us through Kickstarter or send an email to hello@artana.com for more information about how to pledge at this level.\n(Designer) Dirk Knemeyer is the creative director of Artana.

We've tested it, retested it, given it love, and are ready to send the game to print as soon as the campaign is over. Artana has successfully delivered three Kickstarter campaigns with a fourth on the way. We know how to quickly and accurately fulfill pledges for our backers.

Featuring an inventive dual-scale system, players in Rayguns & Rocketships take command of their bulky-but-powerful Rocketship, as well as their agile crew of Planeteers! Players will need to think strategically and plan ahead as their Rocketship\u2019s movements must be pre-programmed. Luckily, any poor decisions on the Rocketship scale can be quickly adjusted on the crew scale. Provided you have enough action points saved up, you can send your crew to repair the ship, man the Rayguns, or push the engines into overdrive!\nYou\u2019ll need everything you can muster if you wish to successfully command your crew as you race your opponents to accumulate enough victory points to claim the galaxy for yourself!\nHere's our extended look at the rules, strategies, and game play from Episode 03 - The Frozen Fear! out of the Episode book! We hope it gives you a feel for the excitement and strategies found in Rayguns & Rocketships game play. As well as the diversity of content in the episode book.\nScott talks with the New York Film Academy about Rayguns & Rocketships. Please note that he's showing his original prototype in this video.\n    The Galactic Astro Rangers are a peacekeeping force dedicated to bringing justice to a lawless, broken galaxy. Their ranks consist of adventurers, star jockeys, idealists, and scoundrels. Astro Rangers are the fastest of the Planeteer factions, whether at the cockpit of their speedy Rocketships, or flying their jetpacks through the inky void of space. All Astro Rangers are armed with deadly neuralizer pistols and circuit-swords\u2014AI-driven weapons that give their wielders a lethal advantage!\n    The Grand Zardian Navy is the military force of the proud Zard race from the planet Zardia. Once feared as savages, the Zard have evolved into highly cultured, highly civilized beings, despite their fearsome appearance. The modern Zardian culture is layered with ceremony, tradition, and manners. Instead of outright warfare, the Zard prefer dueling, and have developed superior melee skills. Swordszardship is taught as soon as a Zard hatchling can wield a blade.\n  The Star Pirates of Samadi were once the mighty military of the galactic empire, but now they have turned to piracy, displaying a fearsome skull to strike fear into the hearts of their victims, and to show that they take no prisoners. The crew don terrifying skull masks that disguise their identities. Emerging from a hidden base in the Samadi asteroid belt, the Star Pirates prey on passing merchant- and pleasure-ships. Their heavily armored Rocketships possess the strongest Raygun weapons of all of the Planeteers.\n  The Blaarg Collective are an alien race from another galaxy. They are a hive mind led by a gigantic leader who controls the smaller Blaarglings to carry out his every command. The Blaarglings have no individual identities, and live and die to serve their master as they scurry around their saucer in their mechanical pants. The Blaarg have found the chaos left in the wake of the galactic cataclysm to be the perfect environment to torment any being they encounter, which they dominate with their terrible mind powers. Will the galaxy survive their invasion?\n    Mercenaries are alternative captains for your standard crew. Occasionally, the captains of these powerful crews need to either celebrate an amazing victory, or nurse a few recently added scars. When these occasions arise, the captains call on the mercenaries to take control of their Rocketships, Rayguns, and Crew until their ready to pilot again. Adding new models, special powers, and gameplay options, mercenaries not only look amazing, they add another level or replay-ability to your game!\nThe WarWulf is a legendary warrior with a fearsome reputation. Some claim that the WarWulf is thousands of years old and shows up whenever the galaxy is in turmoil. Others say that the WarWulf is the state-of-the-art product of the Empire's weapons manufacturing labs. And a few whisper that the truth is anyone can become a WarWulf \u2013 and it is a dread curse passed down through the ages. None have survived a battle against this awesome beast to learn the truth.\nRead more about the WarWulf on the Official Rayguns & Rocketship blog here!\nRayguns & Rocketships is a dual-scale miniatures board game that plays over the course of a series of rounds. The objective of the game is to be the crew that earns enough victory points to command dominance over the entire galaxy!\nEach round in Rayguns & Rocketships happens in 3 phases: \n Rocketship Movement:\nDuring this phase, each player will select 3 of their command cards and place them face down into 3 piles. \nStarting with the first player, each player flips over their first command card, and moves their ship the indicated amount in the indicated direction.\nThey also collect the amount of action tokens indicated on the card.\nRocketship Attack:\nDuring this phase, all players, starting with the first, will check to see if their ships are in range of any enemy ships. Ships that have crew members on their Rayguns get a bonus to their accuracy and range. \nOnce the available targets are selected, players will roll a number of d8s to equal the amount of Rayguns facing their target.\nSuccessful hits can either be dealt directly to the ship, blocking the spaces where the blast markers are placed, or can be used to blow up enemy Rayguns.\n Crew Action:\nEach player, starting with the first, can select any number of their crew members to perform the following: \nMake a move action (move 2 spaces) and perform one attack, or spend an action token to perform one action.\nActions include things like repairing damage, opening the airlock, using the hatch, or making either a ranged or melee attack.\nDuring this phase, action tokens can be used to repeat the movement and attack cycle, dodge incoming crew-to-crew attacks, or use the special ship features.\nAfter these 3 phases have been completed, players, starting with the first, will flip over their second command card and begin the round cycle again.\nDestroying Rayguns, defeating crew members, and dealing damage to your opponents' ships all reward you with victory points. Depending on the number of current players, there is a victory point limit. Once one player has reached that goal, all players will have one final round to do as much damage as they can in an attempt to challenge the victor.\nScott Rogers is a veteran video game designer who helped create over 50 AAA titles, including God of War, Pac-Man World, the Maximo series, Drawn to Life, and Darksiders.

This mode features the greatest strategic depth as players must decide with each draft if they will focus on making the best bridge possible or prevent large scoring plays by their opponent. \nThe solo game uses the same components as the dueling game and requires the player win two contracts within three matches. Instead of scoring against an opponent, the player scores against an escalating point requirement predetermined by their skill level. The solo game captures the strategic challenge of the two player game while remaining a streamlined and fun solitary experience.\n3 to 4 players compete with one another to be the first to win two contracts. It features a unique drafting method to keep options tight which keeps the game fast while maintaining maximum strategic depth. This mode is great for players of any skill level!\nBridges to Nowhere in Action!\n    We offer several add-ons that can be purchased in addition to your pledge.\nBridges to Nowhere Game Mat  (14\" x 24\" x 1/16\") - Add $13 to your pledge (+$3 shipping outside the US/CAN) to receive our beautiful, high quality fabric game mat with rubber backing.

With peak oil looming ahead, you try to squeeze the last drops from oil fields around the world to gather the resources to invest into various oil replacement technologies. While you may try to emerge from the coming crisis by regular means, your competitors will most probably not, forcing you to dirty your hands as well.\nPeak Oil is an eurotrash-style game of worker placement, set collection and push your luck for 2 to 5 players of ages 10 and up. Games last around 45 to 60 minutes.\n Undead Viking's review\n\"Peak Oil is an interactive game with just the right about of interference. I really dig the game because of the clever action selection mechanism along with the artwork is amazing. For me, backing this game is easy. I love interaction in my games and Peak Oil has it in spades, plus its not hard to teach. This means more table time.\" - Larry Cruz (U.S.A.), of The Boardgame Group\n\"This game is great. I went in wanting to make all the right decisions and by round 3 I was doing everything wrong.\" - Patrick Leder (U.S.A.), of Vast: The Crystal Caverns\n\"There haven\u2019t been very many oil drilling based games through the years. But Peak Oil is a fantastic game of drilling, shipping, & investing in the future. Peak Oil hits on the real reality of things.\" - Christopher Richter (U.S.A.), of Board Gaming For the Win\n\"As a dreamer who wants to one day design his own game, I would love to sit down and pick the brains of this design team to see how they created such a minimized and sleek project.\" - Paul Gypson (U.S.A.), A.K.A. TaylonMoon\n\"The base mechanics are easy to teach and learn, but there's a lot of factors that give it great depth and replayability. Plus, the graphic design and illustrations are fantastic!\" - Juegos y Dados (Spain)\n\"The art work while simple is very easy on the eye and it would be a mistake to think of it as just a satire take on a global industry. Behind the exterior is a deep game offering great player interaction and choice but above all else its great fun to play.\" - Martyn Poole (UK), of Zatu\n\"The game's duration is great, as you can never do all that you want to do. There's also plenty direct interaction with other players, by blocking them and forcing them to push their luck. We can't wait to have the final version on our shelf!\" - Doctor Meeple (Spain)\nHere's the interview to co-author Tobias Gohrbandt by Jeff Beck of Your Table is on Fire podcast.\n  Peak Oil packs a lot of premium quality components, because we're determined to give you, dear backer, the best possible playing experience (We obviously don't expect a top manager at one of the big oil companies to play with inferior components...)\nAlso, we're happy to announce that all game materials are FSC certified.\nPeak Oil is an eurotrash-style board game. What does that fancy word mean? It means that both the mechanics and the theme are an integral part of the game, and they been wrought in together to create a unique playing experience.\nSince you already know about the theme, let's talk mechanics. Peak Oil's gameplay revolves around 3 main mechanics: worker placement, set collection and push your luck.\nWorker placement: On your turn, you assign your agents to different action spots on the board. If your agents are in the majority, or tied for the majority, at any given action spot they squelch the competition there and allow you to take the linked action(s).\nActions include developing and harvesting oil fields, building pipelines, hiring new agents, buying new ship contracts, investing in oil replacement technologies, conducting PR campaigns, engaging in piracy, and manipulating public opinion and oil prices (Yes, you can do a lot of stuff.)\nHere some of the guys and gals willing to lend you a hand\nPush your luck: At the beginning of the game you will put barrels (red, yellow and black) in the bag. Black barrels represent earth\u2019s remaining oil supply, and its number will dwindle down when you drill for oil. Each time you do something \u201ccost-efficient\u201d (I mean, you're an oil corporation, right?), you have to draw 1 or more barrels from the bag. If you draw a red or yellow barrel, it means the media has learned of your misdeeds and you get a PR Crisis (Yes, those are bad for you. You don't want to be on TV.)\n  Set collection: After some time, the oil will run out. This is called \"peak oil\" and marks the end of the game. Players then show the cards they've collected during the game: This is the point where you want to hold the cards that are worth more points. Whoever shaped the future best,wins the game (best as in best for their company, obviously. You're not that concerned with the welfare of the populace!)\nYou can also play the game on Tabletopia, the leading digital boardgaming platform, here (You need an account to play.)\nYou can also check the game's entry on Board Game Geek, the leading boardgaming forum, here (You can find all sorts of interesting stuff in this link, including microbadges!!)\nOK, let's get serious here.\n- It plays great: Whether you play a more cut-throat 2-player game, or a free-for-all backstabbing festival with 5 players, the game works as a well-oiled machine. That's precisely the reason why we haven't included a solo mode: we tested a ton of variants but none encapsulated the playing experience we wanted to offer.\nThe longer the game progresses, the more the bag is checked...\n- It looks great: Author Heiko G\u00fcnther (of Tesla vs. Edison, Glory to Rome, Potion Explosion, among others) is also the responsible for both the graphic design and illustrations. Being in charge for the art of his first published game as an author has inspired him, and we think that transpires on the final look of the game.\n...and this is an old version of the prototype\n- It feels great: The game packs only premium quality components. We believe that going the extra mile in this not only ensures the durability of the game, but also enhances the gaming experience.\n- It's fun: Who doesn't want to experience the power of an oil magnate? Fly on the Concorde, hire Mercena...erm, Consultants, buy start-ups, sway the masses, shape the future! This is a game with a light-hearted, ironic approach to a \"serious\" theme. \n- It is a finished & tested game: Peak Oil was initially concepted in 2005, and has been in professional development since Essen Spiel 2015, when the authors pitched the game to 2tomatoes (You can read the full story here). The game has been thoroughly tested and perfected until we all felt it was ready for release: besides our in-house testing, the game has been available on PnP form (with more than 800 distinct downloads) thorough the development process, and has also been present in major Fairs & Events (Essen Spiel 2016, DAU Barcelona 2016 and Cannes 2017). The invaluable feedback we've got from those varied testing groups and has been taken into account and incorporated into the game. And last but definitely not least, we were blessed to have the generous input of awesome boardgame designer Gil Hova (of Bad Medicine & The Networks, among others) during the development.\nCo-author Tobias explaining to a tester why he always wins at Peak Oil (Essen Spiel 2016)\n- Your pledge actually matters: Unlike other publishers out there, 2tomatoes needs your help to release this game in time for Essen 2017. This is an expensive game to produce, and despite our previous successful games (which you can check out here), we need you backing in this project.\n Please note that there are no early birds in this campaign, and all pledge levels include all unlocked stretch goals. We value all our backers equally, and we do not want to give anyone a pricing advantage (And we're fully aware that you're too busy managing your oil empire to be constantly checking this website for the start of this campaign.)\n Tally of backers who want the game in another language (including retailers):\nSpanish: UNLOCKED!\nFrench: UNLOCKED!\nGerman: 106 backers (with Spiele Offensive)\n\nIf you're a retailer, and want to buy copies of the game, please pledge for the $1 reward. After you pledge, contact us and we will provide you with further information. A survey will be sent to you after the campaign has ended.\nA brief note about Lord of the P.I.G.S.\nWARNING: Contains Pig Meeples\nLord of the P.I.G.S. is 2tomatoes' first game. It is a fast-paced filler card game of hand management and negotiation for 2 to 4 players of ages 14 and up. In it, you and your friends will take the role of Meridia\u2019s (a melting pot of southern European countries) leaders and will vie for economic supremacy!\nWe include it in the pledge level Pig Oil for 2 reasons:\nIt is not so easy to get hold of a copy of it, as it didn't really enter international distribution\nThematically, it has a lot of common with Peak Oil: it deals with a contemporary issue (in this case, the economic & social crisis in southern European countries) with an ironic, tongue in cheek approach.\nWhile every backer means the world to us, regardless of where you are based in, we can\u2019t avoid the reality: shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share for this project to be successful. However, since we want to do our best, we have included a discount for ALL shipping.\nThe rewards will be shipped to anywhere in the world. Depending on the number of backers of each region, we will ship from different logistics centers or from a single one. In the latter case, shipping might be slightly delayed. In any case, all shipping will be done through experienced fulfillment companies, so that you don't need to worry about anything regarding the shipping process, nor customs.\nShipping costs are detailed on the reward text, on the rewards sidebar. For your convenience, we've also assembled them here:\nPeak Oil, Start-Up and Corporation rewards: $0 if pick-up at Essen Spiel 2017 (see below), $7 U.S.A, $2 Spain, $6 Rest of E.U., $10 Canada & Australia, $15 Rest of the World.\nPig Oil reward: $0 if pick-up at Essen Spiel 2017 (see below), $11 U.S.A, $5 Spain, $10 Rest of E.U., $14 Canada, $15 Australia, $20 Rest of the World.\nHowever, if you\u2019re attending Essen Spiel 2017, you can skip this cost by simply coming to our booth and picking up your copies. To do so, simply select the \"United Nations Neutral Zone\" when you choose the shipping destination of your reward (After all, Essen Spiel is the Neutral Zone for the United Nations of Gamers!) \n Peak Oil is the brainchild of awesome game designers Tobias Gohrbandt and Heiko G\u00fcnther.\nThe authors pose stylishly in their HQ\nHere's Tobias' very official bio:\n\"Tobias was constructed in the early 15th century as a semi-sentient cyborg, designed to rid the world of the threat of the dodo. That noble goal accomplished, he commenced to work as a lawyer. He currently resides in Saarbr\u00fccken. Should the dodo one day return, he stands ready.\"\nHere's Heiko's very official bio:\n\"Heiko was found on the doorstep a shaolin temple deep in the darkest Texas. At the age of five, by then versed in every way of fighting imaginable, he was sold to traveling gypsies, and introduced to the ancient art of the shadow. A few years later, after acquiring degrees in philosophy and criminalistics, he started to work as a vigilante in Shanghai, under the guise of managing a gallery for contemporary nihilistic arts. In 2010, he discontinued his promising career as No performer, and since then lives in Saarbr\u00fccken and works as a graphic designer.\"\nThe game will be published by 2tomatoes games.\nEverything was blurry back in the noughties\nThere are 2 tomatoes: \u00c1lvaro Lerma and Jordi Rodr\u00edguez. We met at uni and after having adventures more or less all over the world we founded the company with a simple goal in mind: make games that are different, that stand out.\nWe're a young publishing company, based in Barcelona. We've published and distributed several games including Lord of the P.I.G.S., and the Spanish editions of Guilds of London and The Walking Dead - All Out War. We've also done other crowdfunding campaigns in the past.\nWe're very passionate about what we do and we only publish games that we love. It is a lot of work but we can live with the burden. Expect more from us soon...\nThe whole team wants to give very special thanks to Gil Hova for his outstanding input during the development process, and for the great times passed sharing the booth at Essen 2016. Fist bumps!\n2tomatoes wants to thank the special playtesters Guillem Roig, Sergio Navarro, Alberto Cano, Victor Samitier, Chris Halaska, Arne Kjell Vikhagen and Patrick Surdez; all our fellows at the \"Pati Llimona\" playtest meetings;  all our fellows at the \"Ludo\" (Spain's game designer's association) playtest meetings; all our fellows at the BGG's Peak Oil forums and everybody who has downloaded the PnP and/or has come to visit us and test the game in all the events we've attended.

It is prone to many mistakes and things can sometimes go wrong. However, 2Tomatoes has successfully run and delivered all of our crowdfunding projects (Kickstarter, Verkami), and this one will be no different.\n\nHere are the steps we have taken in order to reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1 - We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the materials for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete; the remaining 5% will be achieved by taking the backer feedback into account. We already have the production quote and an agreement with our manufacturer. We just need the funding to be able to start producing!\n\n2 - We use fulfillment companies for shipping when we have a large number of orders to ship in a short period of time. Peak Oil will use fulfillment for at least international shipping\n\n3 - We are fully committed to transparency and backer communication. We will be updating you on a regular basis and we will be present during the whole process to answer any questions and read every comment\n\nWe want to thank you, dear backer, for your support and trust.

Choose your divinity and place the 8 tikis of your color in front of you.\nTurn\nChoose between two actions :\nCreate a new totem by placing one of your tiki on an empty village\nor\nMove one of your own totems (a totem belongs to the owner of the tiki on top)\nThen, resolve influenced villages\nHow to move a totem\nTake the whole totem and move it a number of villages equal to the number of tikis which form the totem.\nThe move is always vertical or horizontal (diagonal is forbidden), without going back and forth between villages.\nYou MUST leave the lowest tiki in the village that you cross and pile it, if necessary, on the top of the tikis already there.\nResolve an influenced village\nA village is influenced if there is a totem made of 3 tikis on it. If you own the totem (you have the tiki on the top of the totem), apply the effect indicated on the corner of the village tile.\nThen, remove the 3 tikis from the tile and give them back to their respective owners.\nVillages\nThere are four types of villages :\nOne village allows to win 2 fruits\nAnother one allows to win 1 fruit\nThe marshlands doesn't bring any fruit. The 3 tikis are just removed from the tile and given back to their respective owners\nThe cursed villages causes the loss of 1 fruit. If you or your opponent don't have any fruit, a fruit from the reserve is removed from the game.\nEnd of the game\nIf you own 4 fruits, you win the game. If the fruit reserve is empty before this happens, the victory goes to the player who has the the most fruit. In case of a tie, return any fruit which was destroyed to the reserve and keep playing. The first player to win this fruit or make is opponent lose a fruit wins the game.\nShaman variant\nWhen you'll be an expert, you can play with the Shaman variant.\nAt the beginning of the game, place the Shaman near the fruit reserve and put the marshlands on the Shaman side. When you influence a Shaman marshlands, you CAN place or move the Shaman between two villages. In this case, all the moves between those two villages are forbidden.\n      Explanations in french on TricTrac\n             A game in french on Tric Trac\n   Download the rules :\n                              \n             And try the game on BoardGameArena :\n     JeuDeclick\n                                                                                                                                                              \"At first sight, Tiki attracts the eye with the beautiful illustrations of Pauline Amelin.\nOnce the rule is read, we would tend to say that the game is childish, but think again, the appearances are really deceptive. We imagine a strategy, we sneer low blows and we are disenchanted with every turnaround of situation, the whole with a rule admittedly slight but which imposes a true thinking. The game has a great depth of play with simple mechanisms but for which there are innumerable strategies and the variants would be almost infinite according to the random positioning of the tiles.\nTiki is one of those truly addictive games for which we \"chain\" the games.

The game met with huge success, being named a Best Family Board Game for 2016 by Good Housekeeping magazine, a Top-5 STEM Toy by City Kids magazine, an Awesome Math Game by MathsInsider, the Top Solar System For Kids Science Toy from Fractus Learning, and more! Xtronaut has received positive reviews from players and parents. Based on this success, we continue to grow our team and expand our line of fun and educational games.\nHumans have gazed into the night sky since the dawn of time. Dreaming, wondering, and developing stories around patterns of stars. These star patterns are now associated with some of the most intriguing and well-known creatures from mythology and nature.\nWith the introduction of telescopes, we have learned so much more about stars. They have different sizes, colors, locations, and characteristics. This knowledge has made looking at constellations all the more fun. We developed the Constellations game to bring our amazing sky, with its rich history, mythology, and science to your game-playing experience!\nOur Constellations game is based on the seven real types of stars in the Universe. Image credit: Wikipedia\nIn this game, players are stargazers, exploring the night sky and collecting stars to define constellations. They compete to find the right stars to fit the needed pattern -- are B-type stars or F-types required to complete the constellation? Players compete with each other to strategically collect the right stars, reserve patches of the sky for observation, and explore the universe. Once you have your constellation, add it to the map of the night sky being assembled right in front of you. The closer you get to putting together the actual map of the heavens, the more points you score!\nThe game involves drawing Star Cards, which represent the seven types of stars classified by astronomers. Each constellation requires a unique combination of star types to place in the sky. As the game progresses and more constellations fill up the night, players must use their puzzle skills to fit the hexes on the board to score the most points. The player with the most constellation points at the end of the game wins!\nThe game also includes an educational workbook about stellar evolution, star classification information, and the history and mythology of the real constellations.\n Each Constellation Hex has two sides: the Illustration Side and the Information Side.\nThe Illustration side contains original art and is used to place the hex in the sky\n  The information side of the hex guides placement strategy\n  Players collect unique combinations of stars that are based on the brightest stars in each constellation.\n Setup\nConstellations is for 2 - 4 players, ages 8+, and takes 30 - 60 minutes to play.\nSetup is easy. Players tailor the length of the game to time available and age groups -- shorter and simpler versions are available -- or you may choose longer and more advanced gameplay.\nBased on the desired length of the game, players randomly select a subset of the Constellation hexes for that round. Players start the game by placing a Zodiac or Milky Way hex in the middle of the table, illustration side up. This hex is the starting point for future placements.\nPlayers shuffle and deal five Star Cards to each player. Then, they place five cards face up in a row. These are the available stars. The remaining cards are placed face down and become the draw pile.\nGameplay\nThe full rules are here: http://tinyurl.com/ConstellationsRules\nOn a player\u2019s turn, they may take two of the following actions. The player can do the same action twice.\nDraw a Star Card\nReserve a Constellation\nPlay a Constellation\nPlayer's may draw Star Cards from either the face-up set or from the draw pile.\nTo reserve a Constellation, the player takes one of the available Constellation cards and places it in front of them. Only that player may complete that Constellation.\nTo play a Constellation, the player plays the required set of Star Cards for the desired Constellation. The player then places the hex adjacent to another Constellation on the board, illustration side up. The player scores points equal to the Constellation's point value plus bonuses for matching gems and desired adjacent hexes.\nPoints are tracked using star tokens, which remain hidden from other players until the game is over.\nGame End\nThe game ends when a player adds the last hex to the available constellations. Each player takes a final turn, and the game ends. The player with the highest score wins! As a bonus, a beautiful sky map has been created before your eyes!\n Backer Exclusive Items\nBackers that support us at the $22 level and higher will receive the Kickstarter-exclusive Constellations Mission Patch!\nKickstarter-exclusive Mission Patch!\nBackers that select a reward level that includes Xtronaut: The Game of Solar System Exploration will also receive an exclusive mission hex.

I really enjoyed playing it with my kids and, as each game progressed, we learned a little bit ... while having a lot of fun.\"\nDave Banks, Games Editor at GeekDad.com\n\"Constellations is a remarkable game which manages a feat that I feel is pretty rare: bridging the gap between light and accessible mechanisms and an educational experience. It can easily be taught to novice gamers, is strategic enough for veterans, and never loses sight of the fact that above all else its primary purpose is to be clean, fun, and engaging.\"\nChris Rowlands, NPCcast\n\"I had the chance to play Constellations at UnPub last weekend, and I can see this becoming one of my favorite games. The simple rules, the ones we played with for the demos, are easy to understand and ideal for younger players. The advanced rules, which involve minor penalties for over-spending your stars to build a constellation, add strategic depth to the game. In both cases, the game feels immediately intuitive after a few rounds, and this is one that I am sure is going to get countless plays in my house at game nights.\"\nDoug Levandowski, Nerd Nighters, Northeast chapter\nPlaytesting and Feedback\nWe have play tested the game extensively -- and players have enjoyed the excellent gameplay, science, and puzzle solving -- while becoming more connected to our amazing sky.\nConstellation's lead designer, Ian Zang, took Constellations to the Unpub Convention in Baltimore on March 17-19th. Many designers and playtesters there got a chance to play the game, and the experience was highly rated.\nPLAY\n\nHere are some notable reviews from our feedback:\n\"It was both educational and enjoyable. It's a great game to help teach younger players about the stars and constellations, yet it is engaging enough to satisfy older gamers.\" - Matthew Shade\nPlaytesters at the Unpub Convention in Baltimore\n\"I also appreciated the educational aspects of the game without it \"feeling educational\", preachy, or requiring advanced knowledge.\" - Bob Eckert\n\"I think this game is great as a casual and fun game-night game. The level of interactivity is low-medium which is great for groups that talk more than play. You don't have to explain each and every turn you complete as you do so and it makes it a great and fun game. I'm impressed by how much research into the constellations and the night sky went into this game. It is a beautiful game and would buy it as is. My game-night friends would enjoy this greatly.\" - Christina Weigand\nAbout Us\nWe formed Xtronaut to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and citizen scientists through space mission-related games and education programs. Professor Dante Lauretta, the leader of the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission (launched September 2016, to an asteroid named Bennu), and Michael Lyon, a leader in the space tourism sector (organizing the first tourist flights on the Soyuz Rocket to the ISS) founded Xtronaut. Our games are distinguished by their family-friendly engaging play and adherence to real scientific principles.\nDante Lauretta\n  Michael Lyon\nWe have a great creative team at Xtronaut. Ian Zang works to create and develop great games. He has worked on games such as Rayguns and Rocketships, Ashes, AssassinCon, and Seafall, with much more to come! He is the lead designer on Constellations.\nIan Zang\nAshley Kenawell has a passion for educational games and interactive storybooks, which has led her to be involved in indie game development on titles like Biota and Wandering Tales. She is currently using these illustration skills to help bring Constellations to life.\nAshley Kenawell\n  We have worked hard to be ready for this Kickstarter. When our campaign is funded, we will immediately place the order for production of the final product -- all materials are ready to go, and the game has undergone extensive and fruitful playtesting. We have proven out our manufacturing and distribution system with Xtronaut and look forward to getting Constellations in your hands as soon as possible.\nDante, Mike, Ian, and Ashley\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of tangible product to be delivered, there is a real chance for production delays and other factors presenting challenges along the way. Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and shipping mistakes.\n\nFortunately, the designers of this game are used to managing large projects.

It was the only time all 7 main characters were created so realistically, and Trekkies from all over the world came to see them.\nWilliam Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelly, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei and Walter Koenig, were molded, measured, photographed and sculpted from 1973-1981, by the legendary artist Logan Fleming, until their figures were perfect.\nEND OF AN ERA\nIn 2005, Movieland Wax Museum went out of business and all the figures were auctioned off separately, including the Star Trek figures and set. Many Trek fans, including families of the actors, bid on the figures, but one man bid higher than anyone else, so that he could keep all the figures together. Over $100,000 was spent and they were displayed once in 2006 at Star Trek Las Vegas convention, and never seen again!\nTHE FINAL FRONTIER\nThe owner of the figures knew about our 2017 would tour and asked if our Hollywood Science Fiction Museum would be interested in accepting all the figures and set, displaying them and keeping them together, of course we said yes. This Is a rare, long lost piece of Trek history, and it Is our honor to present them better than they've ever been seen before.\nTHE RESTORATION and TOUR\nWe haven't had a \"crowd fundraiser\" since 2014, and we've been fairly self reliant, but the opportunity to acquire these figures came so quickly, we didn't have time to get the funds through sponsors, so asking fans is our only way. Hair, paint and technical advising and repairs will be made by our board members, including Greg Nicotero's KNB, creator of The Walking Dead and TV and films.\nThis Star Trek Original Series Enterprise Bridge set and Spock wax figure will be introduced at Wondercon in Anaheim March 31 through April 2 2017, then the set and all figures unveiled later this year in our Hollywood Science Fiction Museum tour, beginning in Los Angeles, then around the world for the next 5 years. The tour is produced by SEE Global Entertainment, who also did the Star Trek Tour in the early 2000's. The tour will help raise money for the museum's permanent home in Los Angeles.\nREWARDS\nMany of our rewards aren't completed nor are the designs finalized. All will be the highest quality materials AND completely different from any previous Museum or Bridge Restoration items.\nTHE BUDGET\nSTRETCH GOAL\nAll funds over our goal, go directly into our STAR TREK NEXT GENERATION ENTERPRISE D BRIDGE Restoration, which will be presented late 2017, as part of our Hollywood Sci-Fi Museum Tour. In 2013 we raised $68k out of the $250,000 cost to completely restore the set, and it will FINALLY be seen.\nLEGAL\nThe Hollywood Science Fiction Museum is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational foundation.

Dino cooking!  All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens.  \nDo you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors?  They'll definitely excite potential guests...  but you better make a large enough enclosure for them.  And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security.  Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends.  You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores...  but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face).  So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?\nWhen we first played Dinosaur Island we knew we had something extremely special on our hands.  We had an accessible worker placement game that mixed some of our favorite gameplay elements rolled up in a theme that is ridiculously fun and perfectly integrated with mechanics.  I love games that have simple mechanics that lead to incredibly tense decisions. Like a dice pool as a resource (DNA), set-collection, turn-efficiency, a clever auction mechanic, and extremely tense decisions about where to spend your time and energy?  Yes, please!  You can also focus on upgrading your laboratory to make dinosaur creation more efficient.  But if you do, it means you're spending less time on opening new rides.  And the constant pressure to keep your guests safe while still turning a profit every season creates interesting decision making on players. It\u2019s a nail biter, for sure.\n   Dinosaur Island is a unique worker placement game with a combination of fascinating mechanics that is unlike anything you have ever seen.\nSCALABLE GAME LENGTH: One of our favorite aspects of the game is the scalable length mechanism that can change the length of the game from sixty minutes to two and a half hours.  Regardless of player count!  If you're looking for a shorter game at the end of the night or the main course of a game-night, Dinosaur Island has you taken care of.  \nWe also have a unique mechanic we call the \"Plot-Twist\".  At the beginning of every game two Plot-Twist cards will be dealt out that will break the rules of the game in myriad ways.  These rule-changes will drastically alter your strategy and decision making throughout the game.  No memorizing the optimal strategy here.  Dinosaur Island will keep even the most experienced gamer on their toes each time.  In addition to the Plot Twists, the goal cards in each game will be unique, creating a totally different feel to each and every game of Dinosaur Island you play.  Familiar mechanics and new strategy welcome you each time you sit at the table.\n       The Deluxe edition comes with everything you see above plus shiny metal coins, special Spot UV on the box, metallic ink on the box, a special numbered edition, and it will never be reproduced for sale again.  This will be your only chance to get your hands on the delectable, chrome Deluxe edition of Dinosaur Island!  \nThere will also be some very special stretch goals as the campaign continues that we hope to add exclusively to the deluxe edition of the game.  These include custom components that are too expensive to add to the regular edition of the game\u2014we can\u2019t wait to show them to y\u2019all!\n\u00b7         74 metal coins (50x1 copper, 24x5 gold!)\n\u00b7         Spot UV printing on the box\n\u00b7         Metallic ink on the box\n\u00b7         Individual Numbering\n\u00b7         Exclusive Stretch Goals throughout the campaign!\nSample images, final design of metallic ink, spot UV and metal coins pending!\n  We at Pandasaurus Games have a unique view of art direction.  Find amazing artists that you want to work with, give them an idea of the crazy we have in our heads, and trust their vision.  In this case we were incredibly lucky to bring on Peter Wocken (graphic design Dead of Winter, Xia) and Kwanchai Moriya (illustrations Catacombs, Kodoma) and work with them to create this beautifully bonkers art look that evokes the feelings of late 80s/early 90s graphic design.\nYou know, back when dinosaurs were amazing scale covered multi-colored terror lizards.  Not dumb birds with feathers.  We wanted to go back to our own childhood and bring out the colors, patterns (oh, the patterns!) and feeling of sitting down and playing a game of Sim City to the look and feel of the game.\nWe leaned heavily on collectible card games, old board game design and specifically the artwork of Paper Girls (which is an amazing comic that you should all be reading).  We couldn't be happier with the way the game looks.  It\u2019s bright colors, really fun art and a sense of really living in the world that Peter and Kwanchai created.  It doesn't look like all the other board games out there, and we are really happy that it doesn't.\n                                                                                                      These are all the stretch goals we had planned for throughout the campaign.

By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible.

Seek help from legendary fairy tale characters and avoid the cunning creatures that lurk in the forest to become the greatest builder in the land!\n    In The Grimm Forest, you are a niece or nephew of one of the 3 Little Pigs of legendary fame, competing to build a set of three houses quickly out of Straw, Wood, or Brick. Players make secret plans to travel to parts of the Grimm Forest to gather limited amounts of resources that are available there.\nThe Game is played over multiple rounds, split between two main phases : Gather and Build.\nDuring the Gather Phase, you will move to one of the Gather Locations; there you will gather resources to use in your house-building efforts.\nThe four Gather Locations : Fields, Forest, Brickyard and Market\nIf more than one Pig goes to the same location, you must share the resources found there, but if you end up alone, you get all the resources from that site.\nPlayer one decides to choose the Gather Brick card, in an attempt to get some of the Brick resources there\nPlayers may choose to secretly play up to one Fable Card from their hand. By accurately deducing the actions of other players the correct Fable Card can be played to enhance the number of resources gathered by you or slow the process of building for others. At different points during the game, allies come out of the Grimm Forest to help players meet their goal through the Friend Cards, which grant them powerful, permanent abilities.\nOn top of receiving the assistance of Snow White, this Player could choose to change the outcome of the Gather card by playing a Wishing Well or a Bridge Troll.\n Once everyone has selected the cards they want to play, the cards are revealed and the Pigs are placed on their chosen Location. Fable Cards are then played one by one following the order of activation.\nAll Players will need to share, except for the Blue Player who gets all of the Brick.\nOnce all cards have been played, players take or share their resources and place them on their Player Board, ready to be used in the Build Phase of the round.\nPlayer one uses 4 Bricks to construct a Wall for his Brick House.\n The first player to build three complete houses wins!\n     2-Player Play through with Tim Eisner and Late Night Tabletop\n                                                                                                                                           We pre-pack The Grimm Forest in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to keep shipping costs as low as possible!

In Farlight, you play as an entrepreneur engaged in (mostly) friendly competition against corporations, academics, and enthusiasts, all looking to be the first to discover the wonders that await beyond.\nTo get there, you'll build your own spacecraft from the ground-up, balancing power and efficiency to handle the myriad of missions you'll take on. You might find yourself making scientific breakthroughs, constructing new deep-space facilities, or transporting brave colonists to settle the untamed reaches of our solar system. But whatever the mission, you'll need both speed and savvy in order to best your rivals and forge the future of these faraway stars.\nWelcome to the world of Farlight!\nLike Nick Sibicky's other much-loved game King's Forge, Farlight is easy to learn but also has many interesting decisions and interactions, designed with streamlined play and extensive replay value in mind. Read on for more information, and we'll be posting more throughout the campaign. \nIn this Kickstarter, we're hoping to get enough support to print the game. As a thank you to supporters, we are offering the game at a discount price, along with some extra goodies we hope to unlock in the form of stretch goals.\n  A game of Farlight proceeds through a number or rounds, each with three phases: Bidding, Assembly and Launch. For all the details, check out the draft rulebook above.\n                     We'll be featuring videos and updates going into more details on the game during the campaign.\nHow to Play\n  Tabletopia Version is Live and Free to Play!\nFeel free to click the following image and head over to Tabletopia to try out the game, or simply play around with the virtual components! There are a few little differences between the physical game and the digital one, but you'll more than get the idea.\n      The Technology of Farlight Station\nFarlight Station is also home to teams of independent engineers and designers producing a range of vital components in the quest for space. This technology is of course much sought after by everyone! Let us take you through just a few exciting new technological advances...\nThis Tactical A.I. module processes all flight information and is able to directly modify engine structures and fuel dynamics to improve engine efficiency with each voyage.\n  Gathering scientific data about the often hostile locations in our Solar System is vital for successful missions. This Proton analyzer produces a steady stream of highly useful data on the elemental composition of whatever environment it encounters.\n  This bio-tech based module is highly versatile. It takes a few crew to install, but once attached it not only provides organic matter for terraforming or the habitability of long voyages, it also feeds into three other modules.\n  These Medium Boosters, though not as powerful as the Monster Boosters you may find, are much sought after for their solid performance and versatile connections.\n The Design and Testing of Farlight\nThe designer of Farlight, Nick Sibicky is also the designer of one of our favorite games, King's Forge. Nick is actually one of our favorite designers full stop, not only for his well-oiled and elegant designs, but for his ability to teach and discuss his designs in interesting ways. So we're very happy that Nick will be part of this Kickstarter campaign, and share his thoughts (and tips) on the game through comments, updates and videos. If you see him in the comments be sure to say hi!\n\nNick has been working on Farlight for over two years, and so when it came to us at Game Salute, the game play was already in a very polished condition. We worked with Nick on the theme, to tighten a few screws and added some frills. We also came up with a name. Nick's original working title was \"Project Eos\", and for a brief time we were considering \"Star Forge\" as a reference to Nick's other game with us, but we found another video game with that title and thus Farlight was born, which we are all very happy with.\nFarlight play testing session\n  Farlight play testing session\n    Credits\nGame Design: Nick Sibicky\nDesign/Development: Nick Sibicky\nArt/Creative Direction: Dann May\nGraphic Design: Dann May, Cody Jones\nArtists: Dann May, Zheng Fang\nThematic Copywriting: Chris Schreiber\nProofreading/Editor: Ren\u00e9e Snader\nProject Manager: Cody Jones\nKickstarter Manager: Chris McMullen\nPublisher: Game Salute\nPlaytesters: David MacKenzie, Richard Bliss, Kelson Kugler, Katrina Sibicky, Pat Burnett, Chuck Mueller, Matt Sledgianowski, Tom Hillman, Eric Hansen, Maldus Alver, Dan Logerstedt, and Evan Grim.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe team at Game Salute has delivered hundreds of successful Kickstarter campaigns including our own published titles and those we've helped independent publishers run and fulfill.\n\nWhile printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nWe're so confident that you'll enjoy this updated version of Farlight that we're backing it up with our Game Salute Guarantee.

Manufacturing is scheduled for April 2017. As soon as production is over, we will take over the game boxes and prepare the fulfillment process. \nAll rewards will be sent out of Poland with the postal services. To be able to offer free shipping world wide, we made a deal with the local post so that we can ship a large quantity of packages in a short amount of time. The compromise we had to make is that all packages will be sent without a tracking number. However, we have done that in the past and an insignificant number of packages failed to deliver on time.\nWe expect rewards to be delivered between June and September 2017, without delays. The map below depicts our expected delivery dates:\nGranna has been our partner since 2012 and we have printed together more than 100,000 units, covering 10 titles, with editions in a total of 11 languages.

Hire staff, cook food, and please customers to earn awards and gain popularity. At the end of the day, the food truck with the most popularity wins!\n1 Card Serves 3 Functions!\nGame cards can be used for 3 distinct functions: Staff Action, Order Ticket, or Ingredient. Clever hand management and action selections will be key in using your game cards to help you win the game. You'll also need to time actions so that you can gain cards from the Marketplace (center card pool) that benefit you the most!\nGame Flow\nOn your turn, you can either do Market Research (draw 2 cards), Take Charge (draw your Owner/Wild card), or initiate an Action Round by playing a card from your hand as a Staff Action. Use Staff Actions to move cards to and from different zones (the Marketplace, your Hand, Player Board) in an effort to complete Orders Tickets.\nThere are 5 different Staff Actions: \nDriver: Move a card from the Marketplace to your Fridge as an Ingredient.\nCashier: Move a card from the Marketplace to your Plating Area as an Order Ticket.\nManager: Move a card from the Marketplace to your Hired Staff for a bonus Staff Action in future turns.\nPrep Cook: Move a card that is an Ingredient from your Fridge to an Order Ticket in your Plating Area.\nExec. Chef: Play a card as an Ingredient from your hand onto an Order Ticket in your Plating Area.\nWhen you complete an Order Ticket, you'll take a Popularity Token from 1 of 3 stacks. Add that token to your Food Truck board to upgrade (level up) your abilities! \nThe Meat of the Game...  \nThe Action Round is where a lot of tough decisions and game play will take place. If you initiate an Action Round, all other players will get a chance to follow your Staff Action by either playing a card from their hand or relying on one of their Hired Staff.  \nBe careful, because a player can take several of the same action by following you! For example, if you lead with a Driver, your opponent can have a Driver in their Hired Staff and still play a Driver from their hand to take that action twice! Timing is everything if you want to serve up a hot meal and be the cream of the crop. \nWe've Sprinkled in Some Spice...\nBesides fulfilling Order Tickets for Popularity Tokens, there are 2 more ways to gain bonus points:\nFlavor Profiles: Each food truck has a Flavor Profile that will help you get 5 bonus points for a set. Add Order Tickets to your Awards when a Critique token comes up. This set collection mechanic seamlessly layers in added game play and strategy.\nSignature Dishes: Each Order Ticket has a food truck logo on it signifying that it is one of that food truck's Signature Dish. Try to match Order Tickets that have your food truck logo on them to get a bonus point at the end of the game.\nCheck, Please!\nThe game ends when 2 out of the 3 Popularity Token stacks are empty. Players take equal turns, then count up their Popularity on tokens they've gained throughout the game, bonus points for sets of Flavor Profile icons in their Awards, and bonus points for Signature Dishes. The player with the most Popularity becomes the FOOD TRUCK CHAMPION!\n   Game Contents:\n36 Cardboard Tokens\n5 Player Boards\n5 Player Cards\n100 Game Cards\n1 First Player Card\n1 Active Player Token\n1 Beautifully Illustrated Rulebook\nDeluxe Food Truck Champion\nThe Deluxe Food Truck Champion pledge includes everything above, plus the items below. \nKickstarter Limited Exclusive Token\n1 First Player Knife Token\nHelper Mini-Expansion\nWe've Added Another Helper Thanks to Our Backers!\nKickstarter Limited Exclusive Mini-Helper Expansion\n6 Double-sided Helper Cards\n5 Food Truck Logo Cardboard Tokens\nWe have some great Stretch Goals planned to help us add even more content, illustrations, and upgraded materials!

We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. For pricing, contact David at david@dailymagicgames.com.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and it's own budget of production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter when it's ready to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively. \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...  \nQuests of Valeria is shipping to backers. \nMerchants of Araby is at the printer.\nGo Nuts for Donuts has been taken over by GameWright.\nKitten Klash is at the printer. \n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower is at the printer \nVCK Flames & Frost is at the printer.\nFood Truck Champion is on Kickstarter now.\nSailing Toward Osiris is prepping for Kickstarter May 2nd .\nHorizons is in final playtesting.  \nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support this new project, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up.\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016. \nManaSurge delivered one month late in June 2016 and is currently sold out. \nVillages of Valeria delivered 4 months late due to production and fulfillment delays. \nQuests of Valeria delivered on time in February 2017. \nMerchants of Araby is at the printer and is on-track for early delivery in May 2017.  \nGo Nuts for Donuts has partnered with Gamewright and on-track for delivery in July 2017. \n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower is at the printer and on-track for delivery in August 2017. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost is at the printer and on-track for delivery in August 2017. \nWe are very happy to announce that Schwerkraft-Verlag will be joining us on this print run to bring Food Truck Champion in the German language to Germany.\nSchwerkraft-Verlag is a German board game publisher specialized in the localization of foreign language games. They are well known for their German versions of Terraforming Mars, Raiders of the North Sea, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, and other top sellers. \nThey are also an experienced partner when it comes to fulfilling German language pledges. Schwerkraft-Verlag has already provided excellent fulfillment service to backers of games like Mare Nostrum and Catacombs, and we have full confidence in their abilities and customer service.\nAll backers of a German language version of Food Truck Champion will get their service and delivery via Schwerkraft-Verlag. You can contact them via their website: www.Schwerkraft-Verlag.de\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth. \n  Isaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer\nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer\nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer\nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner\nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer\nClaire Donaldson, Illusionist, Illustrator, and Graphic Designer\nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. \nWe're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, King's Forge, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria, Merchants of Araby, Go Nuts For Donuts, 10 Minute Heist), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Food Truck Champion are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content and Helper cards. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Premium English Print & Play Files", "descp": "Full-art, full-res, full-color Premium English Print & Play PDF files.\nIncludes the Kickstarter Limited Exclusive Helpers Mini-Expansion.\nINCLUDES:\nPremium English Print & Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["28 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "FOOD TRUCK CHAMPION", "descp": "Retail Version - includes all unlocked base game stretch goals.

One player takes control of all of Skynet\u2019s forces: Hunter Killer machines, Terminator cyborgs, and more. The rest of the players take the role of the human resistance, struggling against the impossible odds of the machine uprising. Each of the two game boards play differently: 2029 focuses on light troop and resource management in a lopsided battle for dominance. 1984 focuses on personal missions with high stakes and intense pacing. Missions arise through the course of gameplay, and have players make decisions in 1984 that will affect the future, erasing and adding components in real time.\nGameplay and Actions in The Terminator:\nThe Lynnvander team teaches how to play:\n  Follow along with the Rules Booklet by downloading the PDF here:\n     Press\nThe Terminator: The Official Board Game has been featured at the following outlets!\nRetailer Info\nWe understand the struggle retailers have when it comes to Kickstarter campaigns, as there\u2019s a lot of Kickstarter exclusive goodies that retailers don\u2019t get access to through their normal retailer channels. That\u2019s why Space Goat has made every Kickstarter product available to retailers while the campaign is running! If there\u2019s something we offer on the Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be able to buy it for your shop.\nWe are also soliciting the game with a number of distributors while the campaign is running, in case you want to get less than 6.\nWho We Are\nCreated in 2006, Space Goat Productions has decades of combined experience producing comic books, TV, animation, video games, commercial art, and concept design. This past year, Space Goat began production on board games for both the Evil Dead and Terminator franchises, and has since acquired The Howling along with a few other top secret licenses soon to be announced. Space Goat has transformed from the industry's premier service provider, to a highly successful comic book and board game publisher.Space Goat is also the comic book industry\u2019s premier production studio. We\u2019ve provided art and creative services for Marvel, DC, Nike, Microsoft, Universal Studios, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment.\nAbout Lynnvander\nLynnvander Inc. is a Southern Ontario based company inspired to enhance existing or create new intellectual properties. Founded in July of 2005 by Thomas M. Gofton, Lynnvander is responsible for the inception of several media initiatives including projects of film, literature, game design, and company leadership.\nLynnvander produced the award-winning series \u201cMind\u2019s Eye\u201c, the acclaimed comedy \u201cThe Gamers: Natural One\u201d and the The Gamers: Dorkness Rising sequel \u201cHands of Fate.\u201d\nLynnvander created the RPG setting \"Legacy of Mana\" before being published in Shadowrun\u2019s \u201cA World of Shadows\u201d anthology. Delving into tabletop game design, Lynnvander is responsible for \"The Legacy Series (Albion\u2019s, Neverland\u2019s and Sherwood\u2019s)\" and \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer: The Board Game\u201d as well as the up and coming 2017 releases; \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d, \u201cDragon Ball Z\u201d, \u201cThe Terminator\u201d, \u201cGalaxy Quest\u201d and \u201cDark Stalkers Vs Street Fighter\u201d board games.\nAbout Taylor Smith\nTaylor Smith designed Evil Dead 2: The Official Board Game and rumors have it that the Dark Ones have been inhabiting his mortal vessel ever since. Editor, Creative Director, and official Captain (he has the hat to prove it) at Space Goat Productions, Taylor worked behind the scenes on major projects in the worlds of Elder Scrolls, Halo, Guild Wars, StarCraft, and more. He's also made a couple RPGs and released them independently under the moniker of Whimsy Machine Games\u2014they're pretty neat.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe literally could not make a game of this scale without Kickstarter. We want to make a game that hardcore board game fans and Terminator fans will love with the coolest miniatures possible, but we can\u2019t do that without funding assistance from Kickstarter. We\u2019ve done all we can on our own, but after this point we need backers\u2019 help.\nThe Kickstarter community is amazing and we love them! With their feedback, support, and advice, we made Evil Dead 2 a way better game than if we did it by ourselves. We want backers to be part of the process, we want their ideas for stretch goals, optional buys, mechanics, etc. We may not be able to use everything you suggest, but the suggestions we do use will make it a much better game.\nWe know a lot of companies just try and use Kickstarter as an ATM, but that\u2019s not something we we want to be a part of at Space Goat. Kickstarter is a wonderful community that we\u2019re privileged to be a part of, and we want to do our best to serve that community. If people have suggestions that would improve the game, we\u2019ll try to implement them! If we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll explain why. We\u2019re happy to give you as much information as we can, to the point that we\u2019ll send you way too much on the intricacies of board game pre-press if we have to.\nShipping\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends based on actual shipping costs and is collected via Backerkit. This allows us to charge shipping fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.\nBelow are shipping estimates for the core game (estimated to be around 3lbs). These are just estimates. Costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and optional buy purchases you choose. This will be calculated by Backerkit after backer surveys are turned in. We will not be able to ship to China.\nUSA - $15\nEU (including UK) - $20.00\nCanada - $20\nAU - $35\nMexico - $35\nMost other countries - $35\nWe have customs friendly local shipping in USA, EU, Canada and Australia. We will look for the same arrangement in all locations where we have a significant number of backers.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n====== \n\nLicense \n\n======\n\nThe Terminator\u2122: The Official Board Game has been developed by Space Goat Productions with full support and license from Studiocanal.\n\nProducts presented on this Kickstarter page and during the campaign may be subject to change in order to meet the expectations of the Studiocanal licensing agreement.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you acknowledge that the final look and contents of the pledges may change and differ from what is presented at the start of the campaign.\n\nT1, THE TERMINATOR, ENDOSKELETON, and any depiction of Endoskeleton are trademarks of Studiocanal S.A.S.

There is a lot of challenges that come with designing a board game of this size and scale.\n\nIncluding (but not limited to)\n\nProduction \nShipping \nCustoms\nCreation of art assets,\nLicensor Approval\n\nSpace Goat\u2019s first Kickstarter is about to be sent to the manufacturer, and despite some learning from Space Goat\u2019s side of things, is still on track to be delivered to backers in Spring 2017. We\u2019ve made all updates public, so if you\u2019d like to see how our previous campaign (Evil Dead 2) is going, we encourage you to look at the Kickstarter page! You can also feel free to message us on Kickstarter with any questions or concerns you may have.\n\nLynnvander, who has co-designed the game with us and helping us with the Kickstarter process, has run 8 Kickstarter campaigns and they are bringing their considerable expertise to help make sure this process process runs smoothly.\n\nWe have estimated the delivery for Winter 2017 but please understand this is only an estimate. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others. We will, however, ensure a global release of any The Terminator\u2122: The official Board Game products for retailers.\n\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter, however we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.\n\n======= \n\nRefunds \n\n=======\n\nAfter the Kickstarter closes, we will give refunds for individual pledges minus Kickstarter processing fees. (We don\u2019t have that money anymore, so we can\u2019t give it back to you.) This will likely be around 90% of what you originally pledged. We can give 90% refund pledges up until the survey closes. After the survey closes, we will not be able to offer you a refund as we will have locked in everyone\u2019s pledges for manufacturing. We will provide ample warning to backers when the survey is about to close.\n\nRefunds are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. \n\nThis is a USD Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in USD for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day at which the refund is processed as detailed above.\n\n================= \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n=================\n\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm it will be treated as abandoned. We will however look at each case sympathetically and try our best to satisfy each customer.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your order as entered into the pledge management system. You are responsible for import or other duties that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. You also accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit.\n\nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project and wait for the global general release.\n\n=================\n\nAbout Creative Licensing \n\nLocated in Los Angeles CA, Creative Licensing is a full service independent merchandise licensing agency that specializes in long-term brand development.

This is an English language translation of that same game with some small enhancements to the layout and components as well as a revised two-player variant. The game, its art, and all the components are complete.  The funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign will be going directly to printing costs.\nTo be clear, upon successful funding of the project we will be moving aggressively to collecting the Dog Names and then sending everything to the Printer. Our goal is to have this game in your hands by August, 2017.\nIn Dogs, each player owns an Animal Rescue Center and wants to turn it into the largest and most comfortable shelter for city and country dogs. Each game round is divided into three phases:\nIn Phase 1 players move their trucks through two different areas of the board, Country and City, collecting various stray dogs. Certain dogs will provide immediate financial rewards, while other lost and abandoned dogs of differing breeds will need medical care and food, yielding valuable points at the end of the game. Players will be competing for the same breeds, so tactics and strategy should be carefully considered.\nIn Phase 2 players select special cards and can perform important actions in five different places: City Hall, the Warehouse, the Pet Shop, a Veterinary Clinic, and the Dog Fair. The number of players who can use each location in the round is limited so choosing the right action is crucial to bringing about good results. In addition, there are three types of resources in the game (gas, food, and medicine) and it is essential to manage them successfully in order to avoid penalties.\nIn Phase 3 players feed the dogs in their kennels, pay the salaries of assistants, and organize the board for the next round.\nUpon completion of a certain number of rounds, the kennel with the highest score wins the game!\nThe basic game is the same as the original version which was released in Brazil.  We have made some changes to the art and added new rules for the two-player game as well as some advanced options for when you\u2019re ready for even more of a challenge.\nThe two-player game changes things up a bit, there are fewer dogs and resources making decisions tougher.  Roadwork tiles are added to the bag and appear on the board randomly, costing extra valuable gas to move through.  Several new game end triggers were also added, so keep a close eye on your opponents' actions!\nAdvanced options are flexible, add in just one or select them all. Use the two-player Roadwork tiles in a 3 or 4 player game.  Limit the amount of food and medicine that can be purchased from the Pet Store.  Use one or two of the two-player end game triggers. The choice is yours.  While Dogs is primarily a family game, it also has enough depth to engage the strategy  gamer.\n  We have two reward levels.  For the Standard level, you will receive the game and all the stretch goals (shipping costs vary by country).  For the Name reward level, you get the game and all stretch goals and you also get to personally name one of the dogs!  The Name reward level is split into 12 categories, one for each breed of dog in the game.  There are 7 tokens for each breed, giving a total of 84 opportunities to name a dog.  For this option, the dog's name and city will appear on the back of chosen breed's token, as well as in the rulebook. This is a family game so we do reserve the right to decline a name that is not family friendly.  Space is limited to 12 (Latin characters only, sorry no pictographic) characters for the dog's name as well as for the city. Your dog's name will appear in all copies of this Kickstarter edition. As a thank you for putting your dog in our game, worldwide shipping is on us for these Name reward levels.\nThis project will ship around the world but we have been working with our distributors and can offer EU, AU, Canada and US friendly shipping!\n    We have three stretch goals defined with more to come if we unlock the third.\nAt the $21,000 level, we will be upgrading the cardboard worker tokens to wooden meeples.  Your workers deserve arms and legs don't they?\nAt the $22,000 level, we will be upgrading the cardboard kennel tokens to wooden dog house tokens.  Your furry friends deserve good looking kennels.\nAt $23,000 level we will upgrade the starting player token from cardboard to a wooden dog token.  This will make the starting player truly the top dog!\nWe have some other great stretch goals as well, which we will reveal as the campaign unfolds.\n     Dogs includes:\n1 Mounted Game Board\n4 Animal Rescue Centers\n20 Player Tokens\n4 Player Truck Tiles\n42 Country Dog Tokens\n42 City Dog Tokens\n9 Reward Dog Cards\n42 Bonus Cards\n24 Money Tokens\n36 Gasoline Tokes\n22 Food Tokens\n22 Medicine Tokens\n1 Action Space / Dog Fair Board\n4 Wooden Trucks\n6 Roadwork Tokens (for 2 player or advanced game)\n1 Starting Player Token\n2 Draw Bags\n1 Rulebook\n       Want to see what others think of Dogs?

Players are mad scientist in need of precious Mortals for future experiments. Rather than getting your hands dirty, your army of Campy Creatures awaits to do your bidding. Capture the most valuable Mortals over the course of three nights to win. But be warned\u2014the Mortals won\u2019t go down without a fight.\nWhat is Campy Creatures?\nIt's a ghoulish game of bluffing, deduction, and set collection for 2-5 players. Players begin each round with the same hand of creatures. Their goal is to capture valuable Mortals by outguessing their opponents. Each player has perfect information at the start so knowing what a person might do in a particular situation is key.\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nFive Creature Decks: 45 Poker-size Cards (9 Creatures each)\nThe Mortal Deck: 30 Poker-size Cards\nThe Clash-O-Meter (The Board) and Player Markers\n5 Monstrous Meeples\nThe Rules\nWe've made a component update mid-campaign and are now including small meeples in the game! This will replace the current score-trackers and sit nicely around the board. \n      Mortal Artwork Incoming\nAll Mortal cards will be fully illustrated and Josh is working hard to finish them up during the campaign. Follow along on our Instagram where we share in-progress shots to see them developed out.\nWho\u2019s Campy Creatures for?\nIf you enjoy the thrill and tension of reading people and outwitting them in a particular situation, then Campy Creatures is for you. The heart of the game is outguessing the other players as much of the time you have perfect information as to what\u2019s in their hand.\nThis would be a light-to-medium weight game. Non-gamers and casuals should be able to pick it up and have a blast within no time.  For the masters of meeples out there, we believe this could be a great starter to game night or a nice lunch-break or convention game.\nThe theme is playfully dark, but all content will be family-friendly. The box must say 14 and up, but we found the game has been enjoyed by kids as young as 8. \nA free companion app for iOS and Android will launch with the game to make it super portable\n      Download the Print-n-Play\nWe firmly believe in this game, but feel free to kick the tires first. We're giving the PnP away for free for a limited time (only during the Kickstarter). We'd love to hear you thoughts if you end up playing the game. As people found with our earlier game Control, the final components will be top-notch so we believe there's still reason enough to back the game if you PnP.\n  The download above includes A4 and US letter sizes along the rules in English. You can find other translations here:\nGerman Rules Translation\nSpanish Rules Translation\nDutch Rules Translation\nExample Gameplay\nYou can download the full rules here, or watch an example of the setup for a three player game and how a round plays out.\nVideo notes: The Mortal illustrations will be finalized during the campaign.\n      Where does Campy Creatures fit into my collection?\nCampy Creatures is in a different genre than social deduction games like The Resistance or Coup. We love bidding / simultaneous-action selection games like For Sale, Libertalia, or Eggs & Empires and Campy Creatures would fall closer into their categories. It owes a lot to these games, but we believe it stands on its own as it offers a bit more of a cerebral take on a few things.\nFirst, we wanted the game to be easily portable and affordable. Second, we wanted there to be a fun tension of doublethink present as you second-guess yourself or your opponents\u2014there's a reason all those creature eyes are watching :) Third, we wanted the game to shine at all player counts\u2014we found these style of games didn't accommodate two players, the two-player experience was just alright, or it required extra rules. We wanted to create a great two-player experience while keeping the gameplay unchanged. We looked at great two-player games like Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation and Brave Rats and sought to inject some of the fun found there into Campy. And lastly, we wanted a unique yet meaningful tie-breaker system. It was thanks to the forums on BGG discussing tie-breaker variants for Libertalia that birthed the idea for Campy Creatures' Clash-O-Meter\u2014something that's integral to the game as you'll often make decisions based on your positioning.\n  A Series of Tart Ales \nCampy Creatures not only plays great over beer \u2019n pretzels, but there will actually be a series of beer released alongside the game by Bottle Logic Brewing. This board game / beer series combo might be the first of its kind. The limited edition series will be tart ales with art from the game and each release over 2017 will feature a different creature from the game.\nCampy Creatures Posters\nEach poster is an 8 x 10 inch gicl\u00e9e prints on archival paper. In layman terms, the print is high quality\u2014almost seeming like it's been painted\u2014and the paper is nicely textured and able to hold the print for a very long time. Each creature has been updated with campy flavor text to give the posters a cinematic feel. If you click the image below, you'll go to a higher res version to better view the posters. \n  Josh Emrich (the game's illustrator) also has collector's edition movie-size posters available through his site.\n  Retailers\nWe are currently not working with a distributor, but we love providing games at a 50% discount directly to friendly local game stores. Please reach out to us here with proof of being a retailer and we can get the conversation started. Minimum order starts at 5 games. \nIt's Alive! \u2013 The Art\nWe approached Josh Emrich some months ago about illustrating and designing a creature game. Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined what's before you today. To say we're excited about the art is a vast understatement. We believe he has captured the inspired styles and era of creature features in immense detail. Josh is a mad scientist when it comes to design and illustration\u2014he has truly brought these creatures to life. \n                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our second game we have Kickstarted.

As a backer, you'll be a copilot and chef on this journey to create awesome games.\nPAST PROJECTS\nIn February 2015, we raised $36,078 on Kickstarter with our first game, Brewin' USA. This game takes place at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players auction over brewing ingredients, brew their signature line of craft beers, and compete for city and regional area control! The game has continued to grow including selling out of inventory at GenCon 2016. This project was a wonderful ride and we owe a huge thanks to our backers.  \nBrewin' USA (Kickstarter)\nBrewin' USA website\nBrewin' USA (Amazon)\nMEET THE DESIGNER\nFrom Ryan Lambert - I started gaming when I was little, especially with my Dad. We played the standards like Monopoly, Risk, Pay Day, and Careers. Eventually, we discovered games like Catan and Agricola and the collection has gotten out of hand since then. My favorite game right now is Pandemic Legacy. It\u2019s cliche, but the experience is just too good. A close second would be Imperial Assault or Blood Rage. \nI started designing games a couple years ago because I love to create and explore themes and mechanics. Truck Off started with theme. Food trucks are abundant in the Twin Cities and the idea of owning one has always appealed to me. After so many iterations, I love how clean the design of Truck Off ended up with a good mix of strategy and luck. It\u2019s a great casual game that scales well for groups and I hope you have as much fun with it as I have.\nMEET THE PROJECT CREATOR\nStill a small outfit, Adam and Chris from Adam's Apple Games are eager to continue to grow in the gaming industry.  We're engaged in this community, and will continue to deliver awesome projects and give our commitment and energy back in return. We write our final rules in as a female lead player. Check us out from Gen Con 2016, and we're pumped to announce we'll be back at Gen Con 2017! \nMEET THE ARTIST\nJohn Ed de Vera on Instagram\nJohn specializes in a unique paper craft artwork style.  This means literally cutting paper and then photographing his work.  This is a super unique style that captures depth and shadows making his pieces look unbelievably real.  He is a master at his craft, hands down.\nMore artwork on the way soon!\n SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AVATARS\nPlace these in your profile picture on Kickstarter or as your profile pic on social media to showcase your support!  \n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing.\" This is one of those things, but making new things is also tough!

Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they\u2019ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you\u2019ve seen your friends\u2019 loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

But be careful who you trust; someone claiming to share your loyalty may stab you in the back and steal your hard-earned treasure.\n  Use Event cards during the game to help your team get treasure, or to maroon members of the opposite team to the island of Tortuga.\n  Use Vote cards during the game to secretly impact Attacks against the Spanish, Mutinies against your Captain, and Brawls against your fellow pirates.\nREWARDS\nWe're not big into confusing reward levels or expensive add-ons.

But I love this game. -Tessa\nTortuga is a game full of surprises! Each round brings with it new and intriguing events that ultimately make you the master of the sea or scum of Tortuga. It all depends on how proficient you are at finding your team and making that knowledge count. -Alex R.\nI have played this game basically every week for the last couple of months. I have loved it every single time and never been bored. It\u2019s a great game to play with friends and really makes you think. -Abigail S\nI love this game!!! No game is ever the same, and it's always exciting. You never know who is going to do what or if you are trusting the right person. Everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it too. -Alex W.\nTortuga is a great social deduction game and it looks great on your game shelf too! Love the game even though sometimes it makes me question my friends and family. -Brett A.\nA game where I can deceive and be called Captain is a very good game indeed.\" -Derek H.\nTortuga is unique in the fact that it allows the perfect amount of deception for those that enjoy tricking and deceiving others, but it also provides the opportunity to work off of pure logic and reason for the other players that do not particularly excel in manipulation. I have had the opportunity of playing this game numerous times with many different crowds, and every game is completely different because of the different strategies and techniques that people can utilize. -Levi H.\nPRESS\nDice Tower News: http://www.dicetowernews.com/facade-games-welcomes-you-to-tortuga-1667-on-kickstarter/35996\nGeek & Sundry: http://geekandsundry.com/tortuga-1667-kickstarter-brings-treacherous-pirates-to-tabletop-gaming/\nCwowd.com (French): http://www.cwowd.com/tortuga-cap-sur-bonne-esperance/\nBeasts of War: http://www.beastsofwar.com/tortuga-1667/command-ship-secure-treasure-tortuga-1667-ks/ \nViva Veltoro: http://www.vivaveltoro.com/2017/02/tortuga-1667-pirate-game.html\nTabletop Gaming: https://www.tabletopgaming.co.uk/board-games/news/tortuga-1667-is-a-gorgeous-social-deception-game-with-pirates \nDDO Players: http://ddoplayers.com/2017/01/22/tortuga-1667-a-pirate-game-on-kickstarter/\nClub Fantasci: http://www.clubfantasci.com/kickstarter-week-tortuga-1667/\nBoard Game Stories: http://boardgamestories.com/news/party/no-pirate-trusted-tortuga-1667/\nIf you have an article about Tortuga 1667 or this project, please message us so we can have it featured here.

Complete rules, including tips & tricks, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, event card descriptions, and character biographies are not shown in the video, but are all included in the game rulebook. If you'd like to look at the complete rules now please visit the links below: \nEnglish \nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish \nDutch\nItalian\nPortuguese\nHungarian\nTurkish\nPlay the game as 1 of these 9 actual pirates from history. Biographies of each pirate are in the back of the rulebook.\n  Each player has a secret loyalty card. This is your team. Part of the game is deciphering who is your teammate and who is your enemy.\n  The Tortuga playing board. Teams win if they have the most treasure in their team's treasure holds when the Spanish Armada card is revealed.\n  Players choose to perform one action on their turn. One potential action is to reveal one of five available Event cards.\n  Be careful about which Event cards you reveal! Some may maroon you or your teammates to Tortuga.\n  If you reveal one of the three treasure maps, you must give it to someone you trust. If you reveal the Spanish Armada, the game is over.\n  During the game, Captains can call for Attacks, First Mates can call for Mutinies, and the Governor of Tortuga can call for Brawls. When one of these votes is called for, use your Vote cards to secretly cast your vote!\n  Depending on the player count, you'll need to rely more heavily on certain skills to win the game. We love the flexibility and variability of Tortuga 1667 based on the player count!\nTORTUGA CREATION PROCESS\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\n1. Mechanics\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.\nA game in progress.\n  2. Theme\nTortuga, a small island off of Haiti, was an important pirate settlement and hideout during the golden age of piracy. British, French, and Dutch pirates lived together on the island in a loose alliance and formed a pirate government known as \u201cThe Brethren of the Coast.\u201d Rich from its support of piracy and protected by the Brethren, Tortuga was full of taverns, gambling houses, and prostitutes.\nThe French and British governments, in an attempt to weaken the mighty Spanish, would often legalize piracy by giving pirates letters of marque. These gave pirates permission to unofficially plunder Spanish ships and towns. Many of the pirates on Tortuga chose the privateering life over full-blown piracy, which was illegal. Loyalty to country was fleeting, though, and pirates often walked the line between patriotism and rebellion.\nTortuga 1667 aims to capture the atmosphere of these loose alliances and shifting political loyalties.\nAll parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!\n3. Design\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players deep into the world of privateers and pirate life. We used textures consistent to what pirates would see on an everyday basis: wooden planks and tables, canvas sails, and weather-torn maps.\nAll pieces of the game were carefully chosen for their color and aesthetic contributions to the theme. The burlap bag conjures images of a pirate's bag of possessions. Many of the cards use a canvas background like the sails on a ship. The playmat rolls out and looks just like an old treasure map. The faux book is worn and colored a piratey brown, dark maroon, and black.\nSome of Sarah's initial sketches and process for creating the beautiful illustrations in the game.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nBecause we've reached the following milestones, we will be adding 8 \"game-changer\" cards to every copy of the game! When setting up, players will add 3 of these game-changers into the Event deck. These cards have the potential to turn the tide in your team's favor! Cards will now also all be given a high-quality linen finish, 2 and 3-player setup rules will be added to the rulebook, a \"Captain's Helm\" illustration will be added to the blank Mutiny sections on the Vote cards, 2 \"double-vote\" Vote cards will be added to each copy of the game, a wooden explosion token will be added to each copy of the game, Brethren of the Coast cards will have player action lists on the back of them, the Treasure map will include a compass rose and map legend, and we're adding a Quick-Start/Certified First Edition card to every copy of the game!\n  WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Tortuga 1667. We already have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go! As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our last game, Salem. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible.

The locals of the islands, fearless themselves, have learned how to use different combinations of local ingredients to transform the island's animals into delightfully scary monsters. Though harmless, the monsters are used by the natives to keep the outside world afraid and away from their tiny island paradise.   \nAs tradition dictates, the natives compete to capture the best creatures, feed them the right foods, and win scare competitions to determine who can earn the job of Island Protector. Can you and your fellow players take on the role of island natives and raise the scariest creatures?\nWelcome to the Isle of Monsters!\n    Limited Edition backers will get a hand-numbered sticker included with their game. Only 500 copies will have the Platinum Level Backer Sticker, so back now! \nEarly delivery to your door! Backers will get this game several weeks in advance of the release date, or even earlier! \nSavings! We expect the game to retail for around $30 or more, so you're getting the game at a discount off of the retail price.\nCheap Shipping! We're subsidizing the shipping for all of you so shipping is extremely affordable.\nGreat stretch rewards, including improved components and stickers for the food tokens!\n                                        Mayday is offering Limited Edition stickers to Platinum and Early Monster level backers. Be one of the first 500 backers to back Isle of Monsters at Early Monster or Platinum level and get a hand numbered Platinum sticker with your game!  \nThese stickers come separately with your game so YOU can choose what to do with it. Inside of your box? Sure! On your box so your gamer friends know you supported this game on Kickstarter? Why not?!  \nAs copies disappear, additional levels will open up; including gold, silver, and copper at 500 copies each. Once all of those are gone, too, the unlimited copies won't come with any limited edition stickers.\n                Click here for the PDF of the Isle of Monsters rulebook. \n                                                          Note: Isle of Monsters as designed is a well-rounded game with little room for crazy stretch rewards. To that end, we're keepin' the bonuses straightforward for this campaign.\n We're also featured In the Casual Game Crowdfunding Roundup!\n  Shipping is calculated based on your country, so please pledge and enter the country you want your rewards delivered to.\n   Zone 1: $4 shipping. USA, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan\nZone 2: $6 shipping. Canada, EU \nZone 3: $8 shipping. Rest of the World  \nThe game is lightweight and durable so the game will fit easily into a bubble mailer. We are also shipping all the rewards outside of the USA directly from our fulfillment warehouse in China to you. That means the rewards will get shipped quickly and efficiently.\nNote that shipping will be from the USA for all US backers and all other rewards will ship directly from our fulfillment warehouse in China. We will state the direct manufacturing replacement cost on the customs form for all non-USA shipments, which means that even on a 2-pack shipment that your reward will fall well below the VAT/CUSTOMS/DUTY thresholds for you.  \nWe've fulfilled several other projects in this same manner and our backers have happily had no issues getting their rewards duty-free due to the low cost of our games.  \nShipping policy for incorrect addresses  \nIf your address is incorrect when we ship to you due to you moving and not updating your address, we can re-ship to you, but you'll need to pay the shipping balance (and only the shipping balance) again. We'll be sure to give everyone plenty of notice before we start shipping and locking down Pledge Manager entries.\nWill my shipment be traceable? I want a tracking number when it ships.  \nNo, your shipment will not be traceable, it will show up as a first class package through your post office and those do NOT have tracking numbers. We can say that your reward will arrive in 7-30 business days after it ships. We can send you a screen shot of the shipping notice and confirm that it went out if it doesn't show up, but there is no tracking number. That is how we are able to offer such low shipping rates. \nIf you want a tracking number, you can pay a little extra on your shipping service to get a tracking number. Here are the rates: \nTracking Number Add On: \nZone 1 (See countries above): +$1 more \nZone 2: +$1 more \nZone 3: +$2 more \nI want my game shipped in a box instead of a bubble mailer. \nWe're quoting very cheap shipping because of the weight, and this specific game comes in a nice sturdy box. It's tough and we expect it will be able to handle the rough ride through the mail. Shipping the game in a box will add about 150 grams and another $0.30-0.60 in packaging to the cost of your shipment.\nIf you want your reward to ship in a box rather than a bubble mailer, here are the rates: \nShipping Box Add On: \nZone 1 (See countries above): +$2 more \nZone 2: +$3 more \nZone 3: +$4 more \nI want both a tracking number and a box for my shipment. \nNo problem, just add both the costs for the shipping box and the tracking number. The totals to add on are: \nZone 1: $3 more \nZone 2: $4 more \nZone 3: $6 more\n  We've had a lot of previous successful Kickstarter projects in the past. You'd think by now that we'd be set and not need to run such a project any more, right? Well, not so much. While Mayday has been successful, we're still very small with our cash is tied up in other projects. In fact, if you look at Mayday's early publishing history, we introduced just three new games in 2010 and 2011 before we discovered Kickstarter.  \nSince utilizing Kickstarter, we've launched over 30 new games, and that is ALL thanks to backers like you. By using Kickstarter, we're able to gauge interest and get the game made in much larger quantities and with cheaper prices to our customers. This is a large part of why we were able to offer our last few projects at such a low price point. With this much stuff in the game and such a small company, this would only be possible with the support of the Kickstarter community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd project, and it doesn't have any risks to speak of if we meet our goal.

In THE WALKING DEAD: NO SANCTUARY, you have to work together to win. One player becomes the Leader and tries to get the others to follow his or her Approach. If the other players defy their Leader, Trust falters and Stress builds. This can result in a new Leader taking over and in Group Tension, which can reduce Morale. If Group Morale hits zero, you all lose. Likewise, if one of the survivors dies, the entire team loses. In other words, you better find a way to work as a team!\n\nPLAY\n\nIn the game, each player picks one of four Survivors, each of whom comes with unique character boards and card decks, allowing him or her to perform abilities that directly reflect the character\u2019s attributes on the show. Players must cooperate with their teammates to overcome six different Scenarios, which draw from the show\u2019s storylines and consist of several objectives each.\n  The endlessly riveting gameplay will take you right into the world of The Walking Dead, as you experience all the horror, action, and drama of the TV show!\nCheck out our Rules Primer here!\nCheck out details on Solo Play!\nTyreese (not final and subject to approval)\n\nThe miniatures in the game are 35mm and utilize a 95-degree PVC process, making them sturdy and highly detailed, yet not brittle.

The end result? A better game. And the more support we get from everyone out there, the more amazing stuff we can add to the Kickstarter versions of the game. Get ready for some EXCLUSIVES that are so awesome they may reanimate the dead!\nCheck out the different tiers and add-ons and get the version of the game you want.  \nSHIPPING  \nWe\u2019re proud to announce that Shipwire will be our fulfillment partner for The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary. Shipwire is an Ingram Micro Company with over $50 billion in annual revenue that partners with over 20,000 companies and utilizes 132 distribution centers worldwide. They have a proven track record that makes us confident that you\u2019ll get your games, stretch goals, and add-ons as fast as humanly possible.\nTheir global network of warehouses are conveniently located in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Because of this global footprint, the first copy of the game and the last copy will all be delivered in the same 30-day window, no matter the size of the package for your order.*\n*Some countries in South America and Africa may fall outside this window, but they will still receive a timely delivery.\nEverything will be delivered to you in consistent and highly secure packaging, ensuring your game arrives in the same condition it was first shipped. In the very rare case that something does arrive to you with a problem, getting answers and replacements will be straightforward and easy. There will be a single customer service source for all backers without any mixed messaging or confusion.\nWe have saved the best for last: Everyone will receive a tracking number. When your game is ready for delivery you will receive at least two emails. The first will have your tracking number and a notification that your order is being prepared. The second email will arrive shortly thereafter and will let you know that your package has left the closest Shipwire warehouse and is headed directly to you.\nAll of this boils down to one thing: The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary backers will get their games before it is sold at retail!\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign ends through our Pledge Manager. The amount charged will be based on the ACTUAL cost required to ship you your games, stretch goals, and add-ons. Depending on where you live, we\u2019ll either ship from the EU, Asia, Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), or here in the States (backers in the U.S.A. and the rest of the world).\nTo give you a sense of shipping costs, it will likely cost around $10 to ship to the U.S., $15 to Australia, $15-$25 to the EU and Canada, and $50 to South America and certain parts of Asia. Please remember: These are rough ESTIMATES, so the cost of shipping may be higher or lower depending on the stretch goals unlocked, the tiers you specify, the add-ons you select, and other choices you make.  \nYou have our guarantee that we will do everything to get you all your rewards as quickly as possible and before it hits retail. The most exciting part of backing the game on Kickstarter is that you\u2019re going to get a special version of the game at a special price, with exclusive items you can\u2019t get anywhere else!  \n\nThis game is AUS, CAN, and EU friendly.

He recovered the wood from the original Evil Dead 2 set and will be signing the certificates of authenticity.\n More Add-Ons will unlock as the campaign goes on! To buy these Add-Ons, simply increase your pledge amount by how much is listed. After the campaign ends you will then be able to select your options through your Backerkit survey.\nYou'll play as your favorite Evil Dead 2 characters (and Jake) as you explore the cabin for missing pages of the Ex-Mortis. If you find all of the pages, you can open a portal to banish the Kandarian Demons and win the game.

Now we\u2019re doing the same with the official-licensed board game. Space Goat is also the comic book industry\u2019s premier production studio. We\u2019ve provided art and creative services for Marvel, DC, Nike, Microsoft, Universal Studios, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. You can be sure that this premium box of Deadite-slaying goodness is in good hands.\nKickstarter is a fantastic tool not just for funding great projects, but for helping fans become aware those projects exist while getting them involved with the creative process. That\u2019s what we hope to do with our Kickstarter campaign. Plus with the help of Evil Dead fans and Kickstarter we can add more bad ass miniatures, game play expansions, and extra Evil Dead greatness that we would never be able to offer without their help.  \nAdditionally, we want to reward hardcore Evil Dead fans by offering exclusives to Kickstarter backers, like a deluxe edition of the game with an Ex-Mortis box, which has miniatures of combat Ash and Deadite Henrietta. We want to make the best, most official Evil Dead 2 game possible, and we can only do that with your help.\nSome of the top game and horror press outlets like Comic Book Resources, Deadites Online, HorrorFuel, iHorror, Bloody Disgusting, Popcorn Horror and MovieWeb have covered the game, and here's what other press has had to say about it:\n\"Our dream of giving deadite scum a fistful of boomstick from the comfort of our own living rooms is about to come a reality.\" - Dread Central\n\"An 'Evil Dead 2' card game is coming\u2014and it looks super groovy\" - The Daily Dot\n\"...an official tile and figure based survival game that every Evil Dead fan is going to want to own.\" -GoresTruly\n\"Much like a more bad-ass, interactive version of Clue..\" - Wicked Horror\n\"[With} the idea that the players are working together but they can turn against their friends and you have an interesting concept for a game\" - Beasts of War\n\"Smells like a cash-in.\" -Some guy on Reddit\n\"As unappealing as any form of game is to me at this point in life, I\u2019d jump at the opportunity to pick this one up...I\u2019m certain a great deal of genre fans would strangle a Deadite to get their hands on this beauty!\" - HorrorFreak News \n\"Here\u2019s one that, I\u2019m sure, will get a lot of people going, 'Oh, I\u2019m soooooo going to be backing that!!'\" - Tabletop Gaming News\n\"[It] looks like it will be a frightening twist on family game night.\" - Daily Dead\nHere's a listicle from our boss you can read and share around social media.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends based on actual shipping costs and is collected via Backerkit.

We are also shipping all the rewards outside of the USA directly from our fulfillment warehouse in China to you. That means the rewards will get shipped quickly and efficiently.\nNote that shipping will be from the USA for all US backers and all other rewards will ship directly from our fulfillment warehouse in China. We will state the direct manufacturing replacement cost on the customs form for all non-USA shipments, which means that even on a 2-pack shipment that your reward will fall well below the VAT/CUSTOMS/DUTY thresholds for you.\nWe have fulfilled several other projects in this same manner and our backers have happily had no issues getting their rewards duty-free due to the low cost of our games.\nWill my shipment be traceable?

We can send you a screen shot of the shipping notice and confirm that it went out if it doesn't show up, but there is no tracking number. That is how we are able to offer such low shipping rates. \nIf you want a tracking number, you can pay a little extra on your shipping service to get a tracking number.

It's tough and we expect it will be able to handle the rough ride through the mail. Shipping the game in a box will add about 150 grams and another $0.30-0.60 in packaging to the cost of your shipment. \nIf you want your reward to ship in a box rather than a bubble mailer, here are the rates: \nShipping Box Add On:\nZone 1 (See countries above): +$2 more\nZone 2: +$3 more\nZone 3: +$4 more\nI want both a tracking number and a box for my shipment.\nNo problem, just add both the costs for the shipping box and the tracking number.

You'd think by now that we'd be set and not need to run such a project any more, right? Well, not so much. While Mayday has been successful, we're still very small with our cash is tied up in other projects. In fact, if you look at Mayday's early publishing history, we introduced just three new games in 2010 and 2011 before we discovered Kickstarter.  \nSince utilizing Kickstarter, we've launched over 30 new games, and that is ALL thanks to backers like you. By using Kickstarter, we're able to gauge interest and get the game made in much larger quantities and with cheaper prices to our customers. This is a large part of why we were able to offer our last few projects at such a low price point. With this much stuff in the game and such a small company, this would only be possible with the support of the Kickstarter community.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 31st Kickstarter project, and it doesn't have any risks to speak of if we meet our goal.

We've already invested a lot of love, time and resources in the game and now with the support of backers we've hit our funding goal and the game will be made! \nWe'd love you to be a part of the project too, and in appreciation we're discounting the game, and we've already added a load of fun and free bonuses for being part of the campaign! We also want everyone that would like the game to know about it, and have a chance to be a part of the campaign, so spreading the word on social media is a great help. You can find out a lot more information below, including ways to buy multiple copies, stretch goals, reviews and art that is being created during the campaign.

That said, there is always a possibility that a project may be delayed for some reason, and of course, vice versa, should the games arrive before the estimated delivery date, we will send them out as soon as we receive them.\n\nWe're so confident that you'll enjoy Planetarium that we're backing it up with our Game Salute Guarantee.
