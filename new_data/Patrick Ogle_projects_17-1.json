{"story": "THE LEIGHTON EXPLOSION is a poetry/prose/poetry book I've written through my entire teenage and adult life.  The book will also include a collection of foreword by Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull fame.\nThis Kickstarter campaign runs through March 27, which is my father's birthday.  I'm doing the Kickstarter campaign to publish THE LEIGHTON EXPLOSION with a Canadian company who promises to get it into the schools.  I'll be performing my poems in five markets in addition to the Bronx and Manhattan:  Buffalo, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and possibly Canada, so I'll be hooking up with a Bronx area musician.\nI'm updating my blog at http://workinggalrockandroll.blogspot.com/ with poetry, and writing up real simple videos where you get to see the glam and glitter of my home-- where I write most of my poems, and you'll also get to meet my cats. \nThis campaign is a lot of fun for me.  One of the cool rewards is we get to talk on the phone or on SKYPE and then I'll write a poem for you, and perform it on an MP3 and CD, and mail it to you.

And then they tell me about someone they know who has anxiety, and I thank them.\n\nLast year I was sobbing and having panic attacks on the streets AND in wide open spaces including sidewalks, even when other people were helping me--I've come a long way.

Thanks to all of you, Horror Fans and Tikiphiles and readers and fans of all stripes, all over the world, this project has been successful. Now I'm going to buckle down and start getting you what I promised; a gorgeous eldritch tiki mug and ephemera. I will continue to post updates through the manufacturing and shipping process.  \nFor more info on this and future projects, also visit http://www.horrorinclay.com and http://www.facebook.com/HorrorInClay \nTHE PROJECT\nThe Horror In Clay is a large tiki mug, inspired by my love of the works of H.P. Lovecraft and his Cthulhu mythos, and of the classic immersive restaurants and lounges commonly called tiki bars.\nThe Production Edition funded by this kickstarter campaign will probably be in the 7.5in, 30oz neighborhood, and will come in a solid green glaze.\nThe Limited Edition available at the higher donor levels (probably fewer than 20 will be made altogether) is 8 inches high with a 3 in diameter. It holds about 36oz, or 16oz of drink with ice.\nBoth tiki mug editions are food and alcohol safe; ready for you to carry them over hill and over dale, through convention hall and through regional Burn, merrily seeking dark secrets. \nThe mug has already been commissioned, sculpted, molded, and slipcast from the final mold in a limited earthenware edition which was used to produce a bisque master and glaze tests.  It is beautifully horrific.\nAfter funding is successful, the bisque master will go to the factory.\nProduction turnaround is 90 days, so I should begin shipping these out in Oct.\nFor this project I want to mass produce both the physical object and the backstory or mythos surrounding it; in effect creating not just an awesome drinking vessel, but all the supporting artifacts that lend it an air of authenticity.\nI intend to order a production run of at least 500 of these foodsafe, monstrous mugs.  As I said, I have the master completed; this project is to pre-sell enough of these bad boys to recoup all of the R&D and mold-making costs, have the run produced and shipped, and of course to make the rewards and pay relevant fees, etc.\n\nTHE REWARDS \nAs incentive, the rewards are not just cunning bits of practical design (matchbooks and the like), but all of the rewards house clues and hints about the origin of the mug and the idol on which it is based.  A lifetime of tabletop RPGs and short horror fiction led me to design an entire history for the Horror In Clay tiki mug. The tale is told through ephemera, coasters, and matchbooks.  I even tied them into other horror works.  Oh, and I have a colophon if anyone asks.  I will be posting all kinds of information about creating the mug, short videos, hints about the back story, and whatever else I think of as updates through out the kickstarter, so stay tuned!  (Among other things, I have the outtakes from the video shoot which are pretty funny in their own right).\nReally, my hope is to get these in the hands of people who will enjoy them, and maybe to eventually see one in use out in the wild somewhere. \n***NOTE: EDITED THIS BUT CANNOT CHANGE SIDEBAR - YOU DO NOT NEED TO COMMENT WITH YOUR SHIRT SIZE...THAT WILL BE HANDLED AT THE EXIT SURVEY.)\nThank you all!\nHorror In Clay Series 2 Limited Edition Concept art\nReward D\nReward E\nTHE CULPRITS \nThe Horror in Clay was conceived by Jonathan \"Atari\" Chaffin,\nan Atlanta-area graphic designer who has lived with this project every day for about the last year, designing things, researching typefaces, (all the type for all the artifacts is historically accurate, or close), and running down production costs etc.  He did things that didn't even make it into the project (The Horror in Clay skateboard sticker? The Horror In Clay tshirt? Even, help me lord, the Horror In Clay aloha shirt.) jonathanmchaffin.carbonmade.com has a brief overview of his professional work.\nThat said, it absolutely could not have happened without the talented\nKristina Lucas Francis, who brought the mug to glorious, 3D life.\nKristina is an exquisitely talented realist sculptor.  She shares a deep love of tiki and sci-fi with her husband, Paul. In addition to toy prototyping, designing, and building models for competitions and television, Kristina specializes in producing highly-detailed ceramic figures of animals. She completes the entire process herself, entirely by hand: sculpture, moldmaking, casting, cleaning, and glazing. http://www.lucasfrancisstudio.com/animalart/ Kristina will be the one casting, glazing, and firing the American limited run of mugs.  They are hauntingly gorgeous.\nTHANKS\nIn addition to Kristina sculpting the mug, there are a few other people I'd like to thank for helping me in my work designing the ephemera.\n\u2022 Most of all, thank you to my wife Allison and daughter Charlotte (who loves her \"khufuwoo\" shirt) for their never-ending support and patience, and who are going to have to live with me in a world of boxes if this works.\n\u2022To Pauli for pushing me to shut up and do this, and for producing my recorded promotional efforts.\n\u2022To Alan Stoll for video editing http://onegaistudios.com/\n\u2022Mike \"ShadowInk\" Alberghini ( http://shadowink.net/ ) for his talent behind the camera and Scarlaa    (http://www.modelmayhem.com/1202278), Joe Hunt, and M.F. for their talent in front of it.\n\u2022Thanks to Alex, Jamie, and Pynk for copy-editing and general cussedness.\n\u2022Thanks to Carol for historical cartographic consultancy.\n\u2022Thanks to Dr. Alice Phillips, PhD., for showing me how to properly catalogue a museum entry (also for the french translation)\n\u2022Thanks to the Losers Club of 1958 for helping perfect the cocktail recipe which comes with level 4.\n\u2022Thanks to Lady and the Krunk for the excellent song \"He Waits\"; possibly the only tiki mug to have specifically inspired a blues song.\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ladyandthekrunk\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/ladyandthekrunk\n\u2022 Thanks to the BookHouse Pub and anywhere else that still serves tiki drinks the right way; in a frosty ceramic mug.\n\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 174, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jchaffin/the-horror-in-clay-cthulhu-tiki-mug-production-run", "project_name": "The Horror In Clay Cthulhu tiki mug production run"}}, {"backer": "Patrick Ogle", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We made it this far, thank you all!

The ~Archive will enable easy electronic access to out-of-print or hard to find academic texts.   \n-- How Your Money Helps -- \nYour money will help to fund our three phase, proof-of-concept plan.  In Phase 1, we procure and reproduce a single pre-1923 book whose copyright status is not in question.  In Phase 2, we procure and reproduce a single book published after 1923 whose copyright status is questionable.  In Phase 3, we procure and reproduce an out-of-print book with clear copyright ownership and that is unlikely to be printed again in the near future. \nOkay, the ~Archive is a tool. How does it work?\nIt happens every day. Mostly to academics, journalists, and other knowledge professionals, but also to anyone who is conducting independent research or simply trying to figure out something that's just beyond the reach of Google, Wikipedia, or even the local library. You find a reference to an important but impossible to find text. It could be old. It could be out of print. It could be rare. All you know is that you need it and you can't have it. These are not the old books you can already get for free on your Kindle or iPad through Project Gutenberg, or what you can find, sometimes incomplete, on Google Books. We love these services and wonder how we ever lived without them. We are talking about a lot of other stuff. Stuff that fell through the cracks. Works that history forgot to record, except for a tiny reference in an essay or a newspaper review.  Books that are crumbling in an archive or private collection, which normally couldn\u2019t be reproduced without permanent damage. And that's where our ~Archive comes in. \nBut let\u2019s back up a minute. We\u2019re the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research and we are creating new spaces, new tools, and new possibilities for scholarship in the 21st century. We teach classes, run a podcast series, and support researchers and scholars in the strange new world of the 21st century academy. One of the tools we realized that we and a whole lot of other people need is a way to get access to these kinds of texts. And we wanted to find a way to open up this access to anyone else who needs them, too. At the same time, our good friends at Singularity&Co were developing some of the physical and legal technologies to rescue old science fiction books that were out of print and often in legal limbo, and to recreate them as e-books, all without destroying the original books and while striving to compensate authors for their hard work. They agreed to lend us some of their technical and legal expertise to help get our project off the ground. But we need your help to get us not just over, but miles past the finish line. Here is our proposal, outlined in concurrent phases.\nPhase 1: A single pre-1923 book (Estimated Cost: $2000+): 6 Months\nIn Phase 1, we get off the ground. We procure and reproduce a single book published before 1923. This avoids copyright complications and allows us to focus on getting our servers up and running; to evaluate the feasibility of the physical process for the kinds of materials we will be reproducing; to develop easy-to-share software to display the works, redeemed and fully searchable, in the ~Archive; and also to allow for separate e-book authoring in more convenient formats. While the full content will always be available online for free, these e-book versions, whether for iPad, Kindle, computers or other devices, would be available for a small fee to help keep the project sustainable and scalable. \nPhase 2: A single post-1923 book with questionable copyright status (Estimated Cost: $2500+): 8 Months\nThis is where things start to get tricky. In Phase 2, we procure and reproduce a single book published after 1923 whose copyright status is in question. This means not only carefully researching the copyright status of the desired work, but also navigating the choppy waters of copyright law as it applies to academic works and pertinent existing institutions. This phase also potentially involves negotiating a fair and respectful arrangement with an author or other copyright holder. This may prove to be difficult, time-consuming, and costly. But it is also worth it: if we want to make these methods replicable on a meaningful scale, to benefit a diverse community of users, it will be necessary to develop bodies of knowledge, strategies, and relationships that can be easily shared and repeatedly utilized.\nPhase 3: An out-of-print book with clear copyright ownership (Estimated Cost: $3000+): 12 Months\nThis is where things get really difficult. In Phase 3, we procure and reproduce a single book, which is simply out of print and not likely to come back into print in the foreseeable future. Costs could potentially skyrocket here. But this phase is a crucial step toward the goal of producing an easy-to-share and self-sustaining tool. The technologies and methodologies we will develop in the first two phases will hopefully allow us to make an enticing and equitable offer to a copyright holder who might not otherwise be interested in reproducing the book electronically, let alone issuing a full-on physical reprint.\nPhase 4: Beyond! (Estimated Cost $????+)\nWhat? I thought we were supposed to be finished at $7500? In a sense, we will. We will have procured and reproduced our three proof-of-concept books and honed our technologies and methodologies. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. We would love to push our tool to its absolute limits. For example, we would love to produce new dual-language, or even multilingual, editions of texts, to develop the technology to show not only the original language and a translation in clearly connected and easy-to-navigate ways, but to legally procure and display multiple layers of translations all in a single e-edition. Imagine the excitement of an edition of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason that displays all the most prominent English translations juxtaposed with the original German. Okay, so that might excite us a bit more than it does you. But imagine other possibilities that are more to your tastes. In fact, please, tell us about them! What's more, we could give scholars who hold the permission to reproduce their own work -- anything from monographs to data sets to book reviews and essay collections -- a platform not only to make their work widely available and easily searchable, but also to be able to earn some money from those who download their work in the more convenient formats. \nWe have already begun the hard work of experimenting with new ideas and modes of teaching and conducting research in the 21st century, in ways that respect learning, respect scholars, and respect scholarship. We are working to help bridge the gap between \"the public\" and \"the ivory tower.\" Our ~Archive is the next step in this project.\nWith your support, our ~Archive can help to preserve and spread knowledge in a way that both democratizes access to it and respects the rights and hard work of authors. With the proper backing and development, it can become an indispensable tool in the lives of countless people.
