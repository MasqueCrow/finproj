I learned to read long before I went to school and began devouring books as soon as that happened. As an effort-induced asthmatic I was often housebound as a kid, so I read more, and began writing my own stories or drawing them (badly) at the age of six or seven. A large amount of my reading was science and nature, from then until young adulthood; these days I read a lot of scientific and technical stuff as part of my work.My love for grand-scale space opera, which ultimately led to the Arenaverse, began when my sixth-grade teacher handed me a battered, cigarette-burned copy of E.E. \"Doc\" Smith's _Second-Stage Lensmen_, and continued through the rest of Doc's work, the works of Jack Williamson and James Schmitz and Van Vogt and later of Vernor Vinge, Lee and Miller, and Bujold, as well as -- naturally -- through a certain little film called _Star Wars_.Of course, I have a far more general love for science fiction and fantasy in nearly all its forms and I've read literally thousands of books in the genre. I'm also a very long-time roleplaying gamer (since 1977) and I've been an online geek for even longer (first email sent in 1976).Educationally I've gotten degrees in mathematics and science (AS), psychology (BA), and information science (MSIS), yielding a fairly eclectic mix of education from three separate colleges; I've worked as a burger slinger, cashier, bookseller, bank check reviewer, project manager and QA overseer, game design consultant, store shift manager, and now as a research and development coordinator, plus other jobs I'm sure I'm forgetting.I began dating my wife Kathleen in 1990 and married her in 1996, though we'd known each other for a long time before that. We have four wonderful children, one poodle, and a number of chickens, and a large number of stuffed and action figure ponies, dragons, Z-Warriors, ninjas, and others.", "websites": ["grandcentralarena.com"], "name": "Ryk E.
