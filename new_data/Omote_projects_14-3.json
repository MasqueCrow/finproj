The Grand Duchy of Reme is the region home to classic adventures released by Necromancer Games for D20/3.x and Frog God Games for Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry and Fifth Edition. \nMore than 10 adventures have brought life to the Grand Duchy of Reme. The Lost Lands Campaign Sourcebook funded in January is expected to be over 700 pages and all of them are full of information. By necessity each region was described broadly, but there are still a wealth of history, politics and other details to be explored, experience and expanded in the Grand Duchy of Reme. \nThe Grand Duchy of Reme is a system neutral hardcover volume designed to be useful for campaigns independent of system preference. Specific details that affect the characters in the Lost Lands there are System Encounter Books. These companion volumes are softcover (or PDF), that contain reference stats for use with the Region book along with detailed encounter tables for the region.\nAdditionally, 3 classic adventures previously unavailable for Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry, and Fifth Edition are back. These are offered as either softcover add-ons in backerkit or as free stretch goals in PDF (see reward sidebar).\nMock-up of Grand Duchy of Reme. Final release will differ slightly\nThe city of Reme itself is ancient, with world-spanning trade \u2014 the eternal citadel of the Loreclans, where the ashes of legendary barbarian kings reside. This land lies near the slow collapse of the nearby Empire of Foere, and the rise of Bard\u2019s Gate to the East. The Rhemish watch these events with cold eyes rather than concern, for they live in vast regions that devour invaders. Their land is eternal; their people can be forced back to the plains, but in the plains they can abide for as long as need be. They are \u2014 as a people \u2014 the ultimate hunters. The fall of Foere is like the fall of an antelope upon the plains; the rise of Bard\u2019s Gate is little more than the stepping-up of jackals before the body. The Grand Duchy of Reme simply waits and watches \u2014 for Reme is the dwelling-place of the world\u2019s wolves.\nReme is a unique fantasy civilization whose structure is determined by the one overriding fact of its geography \u2014 the country is a vast, grassland plain. The realm is dominated by the culture of the ancient Loreclans: the urbanized and settled ones, and the nomadic clans of the interior. The Loreclans owe a certain fealty to the Dukes of Reme, who are the final arbiters of the ancient law of the plains, but between the Loreclans and the Dukes there are also the mysterious Pashtars: arbiters, judges, and mediators who roam the plains where their service takes them.\nThe city of Reme, of course, is one of the wonders of the world of the Lost Lands, home of powerful spell-casters and perhaps the greatest mercantile and war fleets of the Crescent Sea. It is also, however, steeped in the culture of the vast plains of the interior. It is a place where assumptions are dangerous, for it is no standard fantasy environment \u2014 it is a culture that will be entirely new and foreign to your players, a place to truly explore as well as adventure.\n***NPCs & Loreclan stretch goal(s) PDF rewards will be fulfilled as a single PDF volume as they are unlocked***\n$15,000 - Funded!\n$17,500 UNLOCKED- The System Encounter Book, the Tower of Jhedophar, the Grey Citadel and the Siege of Durgam's Folly will be added for Pathfinder version 1.0 as add-ons at additional cost.\n$20,000 UNLOCKED-  A detailed regional non-player character presented in an illustrated one-page PDF, for use in Reme.

The tower is guarded by a massive labyrinth filled with deadly traps, vicious adversaries and unlikely allies. Who among the brave may wrest the Mandrake Staff from Jhedophar\u2019s bony grasp? Remember heroes, dragons and liches do not let loose their treasures lightly!\nJhedophar is about to take your party through his welcoming tower. Art by Adrian Landeros.\nWill the adventurers take the dragon's deal and attempt to slay Jhedophar in his fortress of evil or take the Lich\u2019s deal and rid his tower of the pesky squatter Exeterus once and for all? Designed for characters of 13th-15th level, the Tower of Jhedophar offers just the right mix of fast-paced action and clever role play. \nThe Grey Citadel $14 PDF, $24 Softcover plus PDF in same version as print)\nAdventure in Dun Eamon: Demons roam the streets of the city of Dun Eamon, criminals rule the night and an important local power figure has gone missing. Can your heroes unravel the clues that lead through every social element of the city, into the hearts of its inhabitants and far below its streets in search of answers?

These ship separately from the main reward at no extra charge for backers pledging $40 or more.\nThe city awaits.\nSpecial Note to the Temple of the Frog Pledge\nThis premium pledge requires some explanation. First of all: All shipping costs are included with this pledge level. The Temple of the Frog Pledge gets you an invite to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2020 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2020 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a game game run by Frog God at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con! \n\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). PLEASE NOTE! The POD option for this books is a softcover book and is NOT library bound. That being said, it is significantly less expensive to ship if you live outside the US. \nThe Grand Duchy of Reme will be included in the Frog God Games World Anvil project slated for 2020 release. This reward was unlocked in the Lost Lands World Setting funding project along with opportunities for commercial use.\nWorld Anvil is the ULTIMATE Worldbuilding Toolset & RPG Manager Created for Writers, Gamemasters, & Creatives.\n...and with it you can...\n-Build the complete, living world behind your incredible novels, games, and art.\n-Showcase your worldbuilding, novels, characters, campaigns, maps, and timelines to perfection, and invite your fans and players to explore!\n-Secure.

Click the Join a Server button and copy and paste this into it https://discord.gg/GaXW2TX \nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw, or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit, and Paypal.  \nOverseas Shipping\nThis hardcover book likely will cost around $60 to $80 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. Due to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70, or even $100 to reship. We discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. We will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books \u2014 and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. We hate to do this \u2014 but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction.

Includes full rules for sentient swords. This book contains all magic items from the Basic/Expert game.\nRules for sentient swords\nFor those who prefer all of their RPG rules in one book, rather than divided into modules \u2014 this is what you've been waiting for! Everything that's in the Black Box, combined into a single 256-page, A5 (Digest sized), hardcover tome.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules plus all of the classic fantasy genre content, all in one meaty hardcover book. This book is a complete restatement of the Basic/Expert rules, meticulously edited and laid out for maximum usability and ease of reference.\nSpecial Kickstarter Price!\nBackers can get the Rules Tome at a reduced price of \u20ac25. The final retail price will be \u20ac30.\nThere's Also a Super-Deluxe Limited Edition!\nIn conjunction with our manufacturer, we're delighted to be able to offer a super-deluxe and highly limited edition of the Rules Tome, only available to backers of this Kickstarter!\nThe limited edition book will be wrapped in luxurious black leatherette, and foil stamped with the Old-School Essentials logo plus a design based on the cover illustration. (We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

The Lost Lands contain locations now legendary in the annals of roleplaying, from the depths of the massive dungeons of Rappan Athuk, to the city of Bard\u2019s Gate, the Desolation of Tsar, the Blight, the demon-tainted Sundered Lands, the chaotic tumult of the Borderland Provinces, and the fabled Northlands. These publications offered hints of the sweeping scope, deep history, and epic grandeur of the Lost Lands.  But only hints.\nFor well over a decade, a Lost Lands campaign world has been our customers' most requested project...\n...and the time of the Lost Lands has now arrived!\nThe Primary Reward\nOver 42 years in the making, this is the definitive guide to the world of the Lost Lands!\nThis massive volume includes the history of the Lost Lands, a wealth of detailed maps, cultural information about its nations and peoples, and a huge gazetteer containing descriptions of the world's countries, cities, waterways and geography. For the first time, readers can explore the length and breadth of the great continent of Akados, including regions never before described, and far Libynos, home of the Desert Kingdoms and many ancient cultures alien to the folk of Akados.\nThe book weighs in at approximately 700 pages in full color, with maps by award-winning cartographers and beautiful, original artwork to place you directly into the world itself in all its glory and terror.\nEntirely system-neutral, the guide can be used with any game system you choose.\nThe Lost Lands are the setting for a tremendous array of over 150 individual adventures and sourcebooks already published by Frog God Games and Necromancer Games, many providing statistics in multiple game systems. All of this material is available to provide an almost inexhaustible resource of ready-made adventures and epic quests! Future Frog God Games products set in the Lost Lands will be built into the ever-growing canon finally revealed in this volume.\nAbout 4000 example pages of Lost Lands Adventures Pictured Above\nA small sample of some of these already-existing adventures include Rappan Athuk, Sword of Air, Slumbering Tsar, Bard's Gate, Necropolis, Cyclopean Deeps, The Borderland Provinces, The Blight, and Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms.\nAuthors of adventures which have, over two decades, explored the Lost Lands include Clark Peterson, Ed Greenwood, Bill Webb, Gary Gygax, Matt Finch, Jim Ward, Morten Braten, Jeff Harkness, John Stater, Bill Kenower, Nate Paul, Dennis Sustare, and Alex Kammer.\nThe authors of the guide to the Lost Lands include Bill Webb, Greg Vaughan, Matt Finch, Vicki Potter, Pat Lawinger, Anthony Pryor, Rhiannon Louve, Tom Knauss, Mark Greenberg, Ken Spencer, Casey Christofferson, and Thom Wilson.\nShipping\nInternational shipping on a book this size may be quite expensive. If you are a non-US customer, please read the shipping information below. We anticipate shipping to be $80 to $100 for most countries, and could even be more. Shipping for the tapestries (and only the tapestries) is calculated into their price for Canada, the UK, the EU, and Australia. \nSpecial Note to the Temple of the Frog Pledge\nThis premium pledge requires some explanation. First of all:\nAll shipping costs are included with this pledge level.\nThe Temple of the Frog Pledge gets you an invite you to join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2019 in June or at Gamehole Con in November 2019 (your choice of 1). At this event, we will pay for your:\nConvention badge \nHotel room \nMeals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention! Shipping is also FREE, anywhere in the world! This is where you get to hang out with us behind the scenes, eat dinners with us, play in our games during the day, and generally stay up late without your parents telling you that it's bedtime. Ask any of our fans that have bought this pledge before, it\u2019s truly a wonderful experience! This reward also includes automatic entry into a Tegel Manor game run by Bill Webb at North Texas RPG Con or at Gamehole Con (this session is on Halloween, and is not open to general registration) in 2019!\nBackers may add any of the following to their pledge for the indicated additional cost, in addition to the standard rewards for the tier pledged:\nExtra Poster Map--An extra copy of the 6-panel poster map of the world setting: $20.\nMap Super Pack--An estimated 12, 6-panel posters of the world map (so on a dramatically larger scale than the regular poster map): $50.\nTapestry Map--A 71 x 72 inch cloth tapestry map of the world setting: $140. This item will ship separately and will ship free to the US, Canada, the UK, the EU, and Australia! Shipping is still charged for all other products. \nLeather Book--Real cowhide leather edition of the hardcover book: $300.\nPathfinder Addendum--An addendum book providing rules for including the Lost Lands in a Pathfinder game, including things like cleric domains and deities, as well as archetype character classes: $40 color softcover book, $20 PDF.\n5th Edition Addendum--An addendum book providing for rules for including the Lost Lands in a 5th Edition game, including things like cleric domains and deities, as well as archetype character classes: $40 color softcover book, $20 PDF.\nSoftcover Print Copy of the Lost Lands Developer Notes--Copy of the developer notes for the world of the Lost Lands, comprising over 100,000 words: $50, softcover book.\nWe decided to do something a little different this time for stretch goals. We feel that everyone at a tier above the $1 level ought to benefit from hitting those goals, and it so happens that we've got lots of ready-made digital adventures that take place in the Lost Lands. So when each goal is hit, expect a new adventure to be added as a PDF file (your choice of Pathfinder, Swords and Wizardry or 5th Edition) to all pledges of $15 or more. That's right! You get adventures to get started in the game world for FREE!\nPlease note these are PDFs only. Dead tree versions are available on the FGG website.\nHours of entertainment in the Lost Lands.\nUNLOCKED!! $55,000 -- The Missing Pin by Alex Kammer (for 4 to 6 characters from 2nd to 4th level) \nA valuable ruby pin has been stolen under strange circumstances, and its owner is willing to pay capable adventurers to track it down and return it. It will not (of course) be that simple. Nothing in the Lost Lands is as it seems. What looks like a heist perpetrated by a rival family in fact turns out to be an inside job. Reginald Reed, the very person who initially contacts the party, stole the valuable pin himself because he has fallen under the sway of a fey being who lives in a backwater marsh a few miles upriver. And then, things got worse. \nUNLOCKED!! $60,000 -- Nightstone Keep by Ed Greenwood (for 4 to 6 characters from 4th and 6th level)\nThis location-based adventure is centered on a ruined, long-disused stone keep in a wild forest. The characters will be able to explore the ruins of the keep, which have become a plant colony, and attempt to wrest a powerful treasure from the clutches of the araunglyd, a gigantic sentient fungus. \nUNLOCKED!! $65,000 -- The Covered Bridge by Kevin Wright (for 4 to 6 characters of 4th to 6th level)  \nAre the characters up to the challenge of solving the centuries-old murder of a historic hero? Within the adventure, the characters are caught up in the haunted memories of the ghostly knight and help him to accomplish his heroic deeds. While doing so, the party becomes familiar with his world and the murder suspects, picking up clues to their motivations and actions along the way. At the end of the adventure, an enraged spirit confronts the characters and demands that they name his killer. If they can do it, they are richly rewarded; both in treasure and the knowledge that they let a good man finally find rest. If they fail, they must face the chilling wrath of the deathless phantom.  \nUNLOCKED!! $70,000 -- A Midnight Council of Quail by Lance Hawvermale (for 4 to 6 characters from 3rd and 5th level)   \nThe Archdruid Cadrryn is so old and mystical that his very presence often affects the natural world around him. Over the years, his close association with the region\u2019s quail population has bestowed upon the birds a sentience uncommon to normal avians. With slightly advanced intelligence, the quail now act as local sentinels, reporting back to Cadrryn on all matters that transpire in his domain. But the druid has been away for more than a fortnight on business of the Druidic Order of Oescreheit, leaving the quail to decide on important events without his wise hand to guide them. When the birds learn that a sinister force has infiltrated the nearby village of Eorls Gedreas, where many of them roost upon the thatched rooftops, the quail convene to determine a way to fight back.\nUNLOCKED!! $75,000 -- Lost Lands Commercial License and a Community Resource Hub for Backers/Supporters\nThe Lost Lands are opening up! At $75,000, Frog God Games will set up a license agreement that, at no charge, allows third-party publishers to commercially publish adventures, supplements, fiction and other written material set in the Lost Lands. Frog God Games material older than 18 months is available to expand upon and use as a springboard for your stories and adventures. Rights to third party-created content are retained by the creator and can be sold through any gaming or fiction marketplace determined by the creator. Simple guidelines apply (no indecent material, no harassment or encouragement of harassment of actual persons, no *-cist or *-phobic, no real world intrusions into fantasy games, etc.). Want to create new levels in Rappan Athuk? Go right ahead. Wish to reunite the Sundered Kingdoms? Great. Desire to expand upon otherwise unexplored locations? By all means! Want to go into the past and explore ancient times? Go forth and conquer!\nExample of the thousands of illustrations and maps that will be available for 3rd party publishers or really awesome Game Masters.\nWhat is more, Frog God Games is currently developing a community hub that will contain resources like reference materials, a published adventure directory and access to almost 2,000 illustrations that have appeared in Frog God Games and Necromancer Games products, all for use by creators. The Hub will be free to backers for at least 3 months and will have a very minimal fee thereafter (only to pay for maintenance and compensate the coordinator behind everything).\nOther details will be forthcoming in updates and other channels as they are developed. \nUNLOCKED!! $80,000 -- MCMLXXV (1975) by Bill Webb\nThis module is intended to show how old school roleplaying provides enhanced descriptions and provides not only storyline and encounters, but creates a feeling of \u201cbeing there\u201d. 1975 is meant to take you back to that time the \u201cold-timers\u201d talk about with a look of wistfulness in their eyes. Join us as we all travel back to 1975. The other members of Frog God Games would like to go on record that we did attempt to change the title, but Bill Webb is the one who approves printer proofs.\nUNLOCKED!! $85,000 -- Grimmsgate by Matt Finch (for 4-6 characters of 1st Level)\nDeep in the wooded wilderness, the village of Grimmsgate is an outpost town on a seldom-traveled trail, right at the edge of nowhere. The village\u2019s half-ruined temple of Law, dilapidated inn, drunken blacksmith, exiled trader and a few fur-trappers are enough to keep the bloody-minded denizens of the dark forest at bay, but nobody really expects the village to still be there in another ten years. The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road. Grimmsgate is an introductory adventure for the Swords & Wizardry tabletop roleplaying game. \nUNLOCKED!! $90,000 -- Rogues of Remballo, by Matt Finch (for 4-6 characters of 1st Level)\nA city adventure set in the Borderland Provinces, the City of Remballo immediately gets first-level characters embroiled in strange plots, sinister intrigue, and fierce battles. Is the thieves\u2019 guild of Manas encroaching on the territory of the Remballo guild? What is hidden in the sanctuary-courtyard known as the Four Corners? How is the powerful banking house of Borgandy involved with all of it? What starts as a straightforward mission actually involves a host of complications \u2014 some of which can be deadly if the characters don\u2019t play their cards right. \nUNLOCKED!! $95,000 -- The Riot Act by James Spahn (for 4 characters averaging 2nd level)\nThis adventure highlights several locations in Bard's Gate, especially those in the Bridge district. A mixture of encounters includes roleplaying, investigation, dungeon crawling, stealth, and combat. The adventure does not require any specific classes or races, though bards and rogues may be useful given the nature of their special abilities. It is assumed that the PCs are sympathetic to the Lyreguard or other agencies that serve the interests of Bard\u2019s Gate \u2014 or at the very least that their loyalty can be purchased for a few gold coins.\nUNLOCKED!! 1000 Backers at $15 or more -- Bard's Gate\nBard's Gate is a full color, 500+ page city supplement, detailing the city and lands nestled in the shadow of Stoneheart Valley. Hundreds of shops and merchants populate the city, and adventure lurks behind every corner. Full-color illustrations of Bard's Gate's notable inhabitants, along with beautifully illustrated maps and a 6-panel poster map enhance the sense of wonder the city brings. Bard's Gate also features eight different adventures in and around the city, taking characters from 1st level to 10th level or higher.\nUNLOCKED!! $100,000-PDF Copy of the Borderland Provinces Gazetteer free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $105,000-PDF Copy of the Players Guide to Barakus free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $110,000-PDF Copy of Players Guide to the Sundered Kingdoms free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $115,000-PDF Copy of the Player's Guide to the Northlands free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $120,000-PDF Copy of the Player's Guide to the Blight free to all pledges of $15 or more.\nUNLOCKED!! $125,000-PDF Copy of the Player's Guide to Bard's Gate free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $130,000-PDF Copy of the Borderlands Provinces Journey Generator free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $135,000-PDF Copy of the Tales of the Lost Lands Volumes 1-3 (short fiction) free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $140,000-PDF Copy of the Tales of the Lost Lands Volumes 4-6 (short fiction) free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $145,000-PDF Copy of Bill Webb's Book of Dirty Tricks free to all pledges of $15 or more!\nUNLOCKED!! $150,000-Isle of the Angry Apes, brand new adventure by Ken Spencer, more details soon.

PDF is free to all pledges of $15 or more, a softcover module a softcover module will be available for a $15 add-on!\n$180,000-???\nBook Quality\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).  \nPLEASE NOTE! There is no POD option for this book like we have offered to overseas customers on smaller books--this thing is just too big to glue bind. It would fall apart and you would be unhappy. \nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter, Backerkit and Paypal. \nOverseas Shipping\nThis book likely will cost around $80 to $100 to ship to non-US customers. We continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out.\nWe actually have considered not even selling books overseas due to the complaints about postage. That being said, we have a number of long term customers that we want to be able to get our stuff. But this postage stuff is not for the faint of heart. \nDue to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. \nWe discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. \nWe will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all overseas shipments. The shipping of the map only (6 panel map, no additional materials) will NOT incur the insurance charge, however postage will be charged at cost. \nWe hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. \nWe are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (23!)

It has been a fantastic run and far exceeded our expectations! Trollzah and thank you again!\nCastles & Crusades: Raglesborg Den of Iniquity is the next installment in the Inzae adventure series by the co-creator of Castles & Crusades: Davis Chenault. Raglesborg Den of Iniquity is an  80+ page adventure module that plunges you into that city of thieves. With over 60 encounter areas, a hundred+ NPCs, and hundreds of adventure ideas, Raglesborg is a true treasure trove for your gaming table. \nWhy Kickstarter\nThree Years and Running thanks to your support! With this Kickstarter, we intend to bring to all fans of Castles and Crusades and especially those who have ravaged through the Death in the Treklant, Bergholt: By Shadow of Night, and Bergholt: Beneath the Black Moon series another installment in the line to more fully flesh out the Inzae setting. We proudly bring to you, the most dangerous city in the world, Raglesborg: Den of Iniquity.\nFurthermore, all that content, needs its own box. With this Kickstarter we intend to raise funds to manufacture a box designed to contain all the Inzae material. Called Crucible of the Dragon, this box set will be large enough to hold Death in the Treklant, By Shadow of Night, Beneath the Black Moon and Raglesborg, as well as the world map and primer!\nThe City of Raglesborg\nLocated on the coast near Bergholt and south of Halpveg, Raglesborg is hidden in those deep and treacherous fjords of that untamed and brutal land, the Urstin Peninsula. Raglesborg, like the wild and treacherous lands about it, is a city like no other in the known world. \nPeopled with pirates, cutthroats, brigands, thieves, murderers and worse, this is a horrid city. Most of the wretched seafarers who pirate the turgid waters of the Interzae, the cruel bandits who roam darkened roads, and the malicious outlaws who prey on the weak eventually make their way to this city of thieves. They come to trade in ill-gotten goods, revel in sins with the plunder of their criminal labors or hide away from those who seek to impose upon them the laws and rules that bind other men together. Raglesborg is not for the faint of heart. Danger abounds! \nMountains of gaming material, NPCs and adventure hooks.\nRaglesborg is a completed manuscript. Its ready for editing and a little art. All we need to do is raise the funds to make it all happen.\nAbout the Crucible of the Dragon Box\nThe Crucible of the Dragon box set is the adventure arc that begins with Death in the Treklant and ends with Den of Iniquity. The box will be a sturdy game box and large enough to contain the adventure books Death in the Treklant, Bergholt: By Shadow of Night, and Bergholt: Beneath the Black Moon, Raglesborg: Den of Iniquity, the World Map and Inzae Primer.\nThough the box has not been made yet. It will follow the form and design of our previous Aufstrag and Canopy of Green boxes. Check out the video to see the quality. \nDo I need Inzae to play Raglesborg?\nNot at all. Though all of Davis\u2019 material is created and written for Inzae, it is easy enough to port to any homebrew or other setting. \nDo I need the other three books to play Raglesborg?\nNot at all. Raglesborg is only loosely tied to Death in the Treklant, By Shadow of Night and Beneath the Black Moon. Use it or ignore it as you see fit.\nDo I need the Castles & Crusades Rules Set to play Raglesborg?\nThat would probably be a good idea, however, C&C is an attribute-based RPG created in 2004. It is very similar to other RPGs on the market today, including the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s most popular RPG.\nWhat do I need if I want to start playing Castles & Crusades?\nThe cornerstone book for the GM (our CK) and the player is the Players Handbook. Scoop up the Monster book (any one of the three) and you have all you need. Check out all 100+ Castles & Crusades titles in our store here! \nWhat comes in the $10 Pledge level? Do I get the encounters?\nThe $10 pledge level comes with the Raglesborg book and any and all pledge levels that are included in that book. For instance, each of the Encounter Areas added via stretch goals are included in that level.\nWhat about an All Digital Level?\nIts already there! Pledge at the $10 level and add on the digital content from the list below to build it. For instance, if you want to add the Digital version of Death in the Treklant, choose the $10 pledge level and add $10 to that for a total of $20.\nI have some of these books but not all. Where do I get them?\nUse this list to ADD-ON to your pledge.  For those not familiar with Kickstarter, you simply increase your pledge by whatever amount you choose for the add-ons.  Then when the survey comes out, you will let use know what the extra money is for.\nADD ONS\nDeath in the Treklant, Digital: $10\nDeath in the Treklant, Print & Digital: $30\nBergholt I: By Shadow of Night, Digital: $10\nBergholt I: By Shadow of Night, Print & Digital: $30\nBergholt II: Beneath the Black Moon, Digital: $10\nBergholt II: Beneath the Black Moon, Print & Digital: $30\nRaglesborg: Den of Iniquity, Digital: $10\nRaglesborg: Den of Iniquity, Print & Digital: $30\nDamnation & Desecration, Digital: $5\nDamnation & Desecration, Print & Digital: $10\nCaverns of Ambuscadia, Digital: $5\nCaverns of Ambuscadia, Print & Digital: $10\nBurning Firmament, Digital: $5\nBurning Firmament, Print & Digital: $10\nA Princely Heritage, Digital: $5\nA Princely Heritage, Print & Digital: $10\nInzae Primer, Digital: $5\nInzae Primer, Print & Digital: $10\nWorld Map, Digital: $5\nWorld Map, Print & Digital: $9\nSTRETCH REWARDS\n$1,000 Raglesborg Funds: FUNDED!If we hit our goal you'll receive this Den of Iniquity.\nEARLY BIRD ENDS: Back 128\n$5,000 Additional Encounter Area: UNLOCKED!

We asked Dog Might for a design that would pair well with the Dragon d20 and their team stepped up with a beautiful, custom version of their Dragon Sheath dice box for us. It came out fantastic! These boxes are utterly gorgeous and Dog Might's reputation for quality speaks for itself. These are exclusive to Black Oak Workshop's Dragon d20 project and will not be available again after the project has completed!\nThere are two variations of the boxes.

Of course we have to credit Clark Ashton Smith...but our roleplaying roots lie in Tegel Manor.\nTegel Manor was mind-blowing in 1977 and it remains cool today.\nFirst published in 1977, Tegel Manor is the oldest of \u201cHaunted House\u201d adventures in fantasy roleplaying, and probably the very first megadungeon ever published. The Manor is a sprawling edifice of 250+ rooms filled with tricks, traps, puzzles, monsters, and situations both humorous and horrific. The huge manor house has been the curse of its owners, the Rump family, for generations \u2013 no matter how many times they have tried to get rid of it, the ownership manages to come back to them. \nTegel Manor is a full house...\nThis intertwined and sinister relationship between the house and its chosen family is a history of horror, evil, and greed. There is a lot for the characters to learn about the curse, and their knowledge might just keep them alive long enough to tell the tale.\nThat scar is the smallest one in the Rump family!\nIf you\u2019ve already seen the 1977 version of the Manor, there\u2019s a lot more for you to learn in this updated and expanded 5E version of the classic. This printing contains expanded descriptions of the rooms, new areas, new monsters, new magic items, and much more, all with spectacular color illustrations.\nAt the start of the Kickstarter, the book will be a perfect bound softcover, but if we get 250 backers purchasing an edition of the book, it will be upgraded to hardcover, free of charge!\nIn addition to the Manor itself, this book contains:\nA 4-level dungeon under the Manor, fully detailed.\nThe Temple of the Frog and the Monastery of Garm, as well as a full length new adventure-The Sanctum of Madness!\nA detailed handling of Tegel Village, the wilderness area, the black dragon lair and even the pirate lair and tower along the seacoast.\nAll 100 members of the Rump Family are described and detailed, and many even have portraits done!\nOver a 15 new monsters and dozens of never before seen magic items!\nand one more thing...\nThe Map of Tegel Manor\nThe map was revolutionary to gaming when it was introduced.  Our cartographer is the famous Alyssa Faden \u2014 we\u2019ve gone all-out on quality for this project.\nA reproduction of original 1977 map.\nWith this new release it is getting a bit of an upgrade...\nAlyssa Faden, map goddess and Frog God favorite, has been working on making the Sine Qua Non of Fantasy Gaming Maps. Using details from both the original and the newly written material each room now reflects the chaotic, creepy and often violent nature of the Manor. This is done at an incredibly high resolution which will keep the minute details she captures visibly pleasing when zoomed beyond what is normal in online games or projection based set-ups.\nSo just how big is it?\nExpect to be amazed at the poster map included with all book pledges (except PoD, see below). Six panels, full-color and high resolution will be awesome when printed on a poster over 2 feet wide, truly beautiful.\nThe larger tapestry map will be immersive and useful; a true showpiece that enhances the table-top experience itself. The nearly 6' wide cloth map is a worthy tribute to the famous 1977 map utilizing the technology of 2018.\nHuge-resolution that can print a landmark dungeon map to 6' wide? Awesome.\nBut it even gets more awesome than that. The map file is designed to be printed in sections at resolutions ready for 28mm scale. With enough battlemaps minis could be used throughout the Manor letting your players utilize the eye-popping map details in their adventures. \nYou are making 28mm battle-maps of Tegel Manor!!!??\nNope.\nBattlemaps, even 50 of them, just are NOT ENOUGH for Alyssa's map. We are using her masterpiece to create something truly unique and previously unavailable - at least not for general sale. What Alyssa is delivering (and we have prototyped) is a 28mm scale representation of Tegel Manor. Frog God, as a company, already has plans to roll out the 144 square foot map of the Manor at conventions (and some of our homes). \nThe Dawn of Time...\nWhat do we mean by \u201can edition?\u201d Isn\u2019t it just for 5e? Not to worry, old-school gamers, if you prefer the old-style rules we\u2019re also printing another version of the Manor for the 0E rules using Swords & Wizardry.\nTegel, like the City State, began as a small booklet and a few loose maps as \u201cInstallment Material.\u201d Bob, of course, placed it into his Wilderlands world-setting, but in time it grew to stand on its own as an adventure module. \n\u201cTegel Manor, like Fortress Badabaskor, is what I call \u2018first gen JG.\u2019 It was written before we had the huge influx of the creativity that the Dungeoneer crew brought to us. It was before the help of Jaquays, Hinnen, and Sering. It was pure Bob and Bill, drawing from their own talents and the input of their original gaming group.\u201d - Bob Bledsaw II.\n\u201cIn the early 80\u2019s, Dad gave me the Tegel Original Playtest Map that he and I had worked on all those years ago. To him is was a functional blueprint, but to me it was a work of art. I framed it as such, and it hung in my home, usually above my desk. Maybe it is because I always saw myself as simply a Guild Artist. Very little of my own work at the Guild ever made it into words written.\u201d - Bob Bledsaw II.\nSeveral fun tidbits have been uncovered since the early days...\nFor example, Bob\u2019s unpublished notes on Tegel\u2019s Entrance and Library included the following:\nButler Bertalan, a Balrog Ghost is accompanied by Maid Applesauce, an Amazonian Vampiress. He asks to take wraps and cloaks. He will indignantly leave through the West wall if refused, sarcastically telling you to \"Be that way!\" The Maid Applesauce will wink at any party-member before taking bat-form and flying out the North entrance.\nThe windows are of yellow, orange, and white colored magical glass panes; giving the room a golden hue during daylight hours. These Magical Panes cannot be broken and have the following magical property: during daylight hours, they will drop intelligence of characters by 1 every 3 turns, and the wisdom of males by 1 every hour, until they are reduced to blithering, drooling idiots. \nWelcome to the thrills and chills of the granddaddy of all haunted house adventures \u2014 the quirky and terrifying masterpiece that is Tegel Manor!\nWhy is Frog God doing this project?\nWay back in 1977, this kid discovered the realms of wonder that are Fantasy Roleplaying while travelling to camp in a motor home. Years later, that kid started has written or produced hundreds of books to support the game. That kid was me, and 42 years later (the day this launched!), I still remember the magic that Tegel Manor inspired. \nTegel Manor was where, for me at least, it all began. First as a player, and shortly afterwards as the Game Master. I will never forget that first session\u2014my poor, 1st level cleric was the only one who made his saving throw for some fear effect, and was left alone to face a dozen skeletons. I made my turn roll\u2014and managed to finish off the final two horrors that could only in my mind be the terrible creatures that I remembered from Jason and the Argonauts.\nLater that session, I recall moving the right arm of a statue and it spitting out a magic scroll! It was all fun and games for me until I was robbed by Roughneck Rump the Rotund on the way back to town. \u201cStand and Deliver\u201d he said. We were far outmatched by him and his icky goblins with bows\u2026ah well, we survived (except Richard\u2019s magic-user). \nThat birthday, all I wanted was this game. My parents obliged me by purchasing a white box set (at of all places Nordstroms!). I returned a couple of sweaters I got that year and used my money to get two sets of dice (I still have them!), a copy of Outdoor Survival (yep\u2014still have it too), and a single module\u2014Tegel Manor. Being the youngest, I was immediately elected Game Master (so the older guys could be players). They thought they could take advantage of the little kid\u2026well, they quickly learned from that mistake.\nFor the past 42 years, I have been running the same campaign, set in a mix of the Wilderlands and my own creation. Tegel Manor figured prominently in the foundations of my game. I still pull it out now and again and run it for my kids, at conventions (3 TPKs at one convention two years ago). \nOver the years, I was fortunate enough not to just meet, but actually work with, Bob Bledsaw Sr. While at Necromancer Games, we were able to complete the Wilderlands of High Fantasy, the City State of the Invincible Overlord and even Caverns of Thracia. We had just started working on Tegel when Bob fell ill, and the project was never completed. I had even figured out how to make a map (impossibly big for 2007 technology) that would accommodate 28mm figures for the entire manor itself. I was grief stricken when we were unable to continue with the first love of my roleplaying life.\nThen, two years ago, Frog God and Judges Guild agreed to revise and revisit Tegel Manor. I took charge of the project myself, and with help from several friends, we have created what I believe is an expanded version worthy of the modules legacy. No longer are the Monastery and Temple just boxes on a map. The single lines of the town are revised and expanded to detail each location, and the wilderness areas are filled out as well. Lots of those \u201cblank rooms and rat tunnels\u201d now have contents and lead places. After all, I spent 42 years running this module\u2014I added a great deal of content in that time. \nThat being said, the whole remains true to the snarkiness and tongue-in-cheek puns of the original. This book is to me, canon, and all revisions were checked to ensure they met my standards for the look, feel and smell of the historical book.\nI was finally able to get a way to create a full scale 28mm map of the manor (see premium pledges), and the artistic cartography of Alyssa Faden and Robert Altbauer will not disappoint. Artem Skukyav\u2019s creepy, almost gothic art was chosen specifically to capture the haunted house look of the place, and overall I am extremely proud of the work my team did to create this masterpiece.\nBW\n112318\nPledge Levels\nThe Frog God's Palace is posh and there are many formal events!\n$1 or more\u2014Skeleton\u2014Thank you for your support!

In his teens, Halloween led to Dad's only run-in with the law. He was pushing over outhouses (still a common sight in our neighborhood) when he slipped and fell into the dung-pit. His band of hooligans abandoned him when the owner emerged from his house with a shotgun. Dad was arrested for vandalism and had to ride to the police station on the fender of the squad car (a sickening embarrassment he never forgot).\nTegel Manor has its share of pits. \nOnce it was decided to make Tegel the October 1977 Installment, Dad asked me to create a cover for it, and asked for some art to include in it. At the time I was a pencil-artist. I was very accomplished with a pencil, but wary of ink and pens. That is why the Flying Turkey (the Company Logo) had to be inked over by my father. The same became true for the Tegel cover. Dad inked over my very detailed pencil drawing to make it print-ready: this explains the oddities of the details in that first cover, which was really a half-cover or thick banner taking nearly half of the booklet top. \nThe instruction from Dad was, \"I need a drawing of a Haunted House this size,\" and gave me the dimensions. The drawing did little to illustrate the enormous castle-like complex that became Tegel, but it did have a Halloween feel. My own inspiration came from the opening credits of Saturday-Morning's Scooby-Doo with bats flying by, but I had nothing but memory to draw from (video tape being a rare commodity in 1977). \nIn 1985 the Guild went into self-imposed hibernation, but interest in Tegel resurfaced. Colonel Lou Zocchi (of Avalon Hill and Gamescience fame) loved the module, and partnered with Dad to release a revised and expanded version through Gamescience in 1989. Lou had been one of the Guild's earliest distributors, and he and my Dad had shared a long mutual respect. Dad contributed little to this project, as Zocchi employed the skills of author Niels Erickson (Wizard's Realm) for the expansion. As previous versions of Tegel had all been for D&D, Erickson stripped out the mechanics to conform to a Universal or Generic System. \nOver the next decade, the Gamescience Version was the last word on Tegel, but then shortly before Dad's death in 2008, fans began coaxing out a Tegel for the D20 game system, and the online bulletin boards began to drum up interest in seeing it come together. Dad passed away in April of 2008, and after a month of grieving, I reluctantly stepped into his shoes. One of the first things I had to do was find out what was owned, what could be published (with or without royalty agreements) and the status of each title. Three of Dad's longtime friends, each a little worried for what might become of the Guild, offered personal assistance and advice: Bill Owen (Dad's longtime friend and Guild founding partner), Dave Arneson (author of Blackmoor and First Fantasy Campaign), and Colonel Lou Zocchi.\nIn the Guild's archives was two partial manuscripts on Tegel, both from the Guild's Sunnyside Days. One was a play-tested Tegel II, which seemed more of an expansion to the story line, while the other was a cruder more humorous (with adult content) pitch with the working title Rump Romp. As Lou had published the last version of Tegel, I asked him what he thought might be added or revised. He said there were some mechanical problems with the portals in his Gamescience version, and that he and my father wished to expand to include the rooftop. They had agreed on the use of four imps to be encountered there, named Aquis, Fortis, Gingis, and Vitus... and several jokes followed. Lou has long been an accomplished magician, but he has real talent at comedy too.\nDave Arneson too had some input on a Tegel Sequel. He told me Dad had devised a storyline (possibly shooting for a Christmas release) wherein Tegel would be encountered but all doors and windows blocked as if by magic, the manor aglow in a strange light. The only way to enter was via the roof and chimney (the chimney working as a time-portal) shooting you back in time, the soot tagging your date from which you came). The goal was to free a certain Elf named Kringle who had mistakenly come down the wrong chimney, landing amid the fiendish Rumps of Tegel Manor. This I tied to the folder Dad had the materials in, on which he had written the title Night of the Living Rumps. \nIn 2017, I was at the North Texas RPG Con speaking with Bill Webb, who was instrumental in keeping the Guild alive over the last two decades. He brought some of the Guild's best works to glorious hardback grandeur, keeping Judges Guild in the ears of the industry, while introducing our line to a new generation of gamers.  Bill let me know how much Tegel meant to him personally, and so we agreed to make this happen. I sent the original Tegel Playtest Map to the Webb Family as a gift to Tegel's biggest fan, and for all he has done to help the Guild along.\nBook Quality\n All Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\"  That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use.  After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way).   \nBackerKit\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward! \nDigital Reward Shipping\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through BackerKit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\nWhen the BackerKit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during BackerKit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nOverseas Shipping\nWe continue to see cost increases and damage increases on overseas shipping. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. \nDue to the handling of our products when we mail them tens of thousands of miles, we have noted a significant increase in damage as well. One package sent overseas can cost $50, $70 or even $100 to reship. \nWe discussed this internally, after spending several thousand dollars in excess postage over the past year. While we take great care in packing, we still have about 2% of our shipments get damaged en-route. What we decided was that we would start double boxing overseas shipments, and also that we needed to charge insurance costs on the postal service. \nWe will continue to honor our policy of 100% resend on damaged books--and after much deliberation, we will be adding a $15 USD insurance and handling charge on all non-POD overseas shipments. The shipping of the map only (6 panel map, no additional materials) will NOT incur the insurance charge, however postage will be charged at cost. \nWe hate to do this--but conditions have simply become untenable for us to continue to lose large amounts of money shipping books overseas. From now on, we will be offering anything that is practical as overseas PODs, this book included. What this means is that smaller books/modules/maps may not be available as POD products (there is a set up fee that is substantial for each book, and we have no way to do weird shaped products (like maps) via this service.\nWe are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (22!)

Best of all, domestic backers are guaranteed to receive these stockings in time for Christmas 2018!\nThis will be a short and direct Kickstart. There will be no stretch goals, but every backer receiving rewards will receive a set of dice which will be included in their shipment in addition to the items from their selected reward level. This should help 'kickstart' your stocking stuff efforts in style! See The RPG Sets section for more details.\nThe Dice Stocking is our highest quality and largest dice bag to date. That's right! It can serve as both a sturdy stocking to hang from your mantle and also as a dice bag complete with drawstring! These stockings are as tough as Yukon Cornelius and strong as the Bumble. They can hold a whopping TWENTY FIVE standard sets of RPG dice and the loop can take the weight. These are not the cheap stockings found on most store shelves - they are built geek tough and will last for many years!\nThe green exterior is a soft, low pile velvet material - not the stiff velvet you see in a lot of small dice bags. The red interior is smooth satin like all our bags. The red drawstring stays tight when pulled and the loop can take the weight. Put these out for the holidays and Santa will surely reward you and yours with loads of geeky goodness!\nAnd for those of you with a sharp eye, that glowing, oversized d20 on the mantle is made by none other than Jolly Blackburn over at Amber's Secret Cove. Check out their line of great products!\nThe stockings come in two distinct designs that backers can choose from during the pledge manager process. You can choose from the The Dice Stocking or The Geek Stocking for each bag you receive! Although the retail on these stockings will be $15, backers of this project will be able to purchase additional stockings in the pledge manager for $13.\nMany Uses!\nHere are a few of the uses we thought of!\nThe Reward Levels\nThere is a reward tier for each reindeer! More directly, there are 5 distinct reward levels of which four have an early bird level. This has led to more reward levels that preserves the theme and gives our backers greater opportunity to get a deal!\nThe RPG Sets\nThe dice are standard sized RPG sets consisting of 7 dice per set and each of the options feature a 'pearlescent' design that shimmers in the light. They are good quality and we are offering ten different color mixes that backers can choose from as part of the pledge manager process. You can pick the color for each and every set that you back for from the available colors! These are great dice and perfect for backers who like to customize their dice by re-inking.\nEvery backer receiving rewards will get one of these sets included with their rewards to help start the stocking stuffing properly! As with any set backed for or purchased in the pledge manager, backers can select the color option for this included set from the ten offered on the project during the pledge manager.\nThese dice will not not be offered by Black Oak on our web store - we are only offering them as part of this project. Backers will have the option of adding additional sets as part of the pledge manager at a cost of $5 per set.\nAdd Ons\nAll Black Oak Workshop products currently in stock will be available for purchase during the pledge manager, so you can be sure to pick up some extra geek and dice goodness to fill your new stocking with!\nRetailers\nWe would love to earn your business retailers! Verified brick and mortar stores are welcome to back at the single bag level and then contact Black Oak through the project or through our website here. Retailers receive a 50% discount with a 10 stocking minimum order. You can expect to receive your orders well before Christmas (just as all backers will). This will mean there will be enough time to get these in front of your customers!\nShipping\nWe have an excellent success rate at meeting or even beating delivery goals from all of our previous projects so you can count on these making it in time. If you back, you will receive these by Christmas of 2018. Our only exception here is international backers. We cannot guarantee shipments to international backers will arrive by Christmas. However, we can guarantee they will ship the first week of December which should allow plenty of time, but there is no way we can provide any assurance for those backers outside of the USA.\nThank you for checking out our project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

All our Dungeon Tiles use 1\" squares.\nWe will also be able to produce these sets without the lamination, for people that want a matte finish to their tiles!\nThey have also been designed (where possible) to be as location neutral as can be, so you can mix and match sets and create dungeons for any part of your campaign world. We are launching with three sets of tiles but depending on funding and stretch goals there will be more to choose from.\nThe current Stretch Goal will unlock large wilderness battlemats that are each the equivalent of a single set of tiles. There will be three wilderness battlemats (plain grasslands, a single road and a fork in the road). They can be laminated or cloth topped and will be 27 1\" squares by 17 1\" squares. \nAdditionally if we hit this stretch goal, the KS exclusive detail tiles will be double sided and feature an alternate version of the same detail on each side, allowing for multiple colours and designs.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nEvery Backer will recieve the following tiles in the same format of their pledge (digital/physical).\nOne 4x4 Spell Circle Room\nEight 2x2 \"Extra Detail\" Tiles\nDungeon Realm Sets\nDepending on your pledge you will get to select 1 or more of the following Dungeon Realms sets. All Squares are 1\".\nThe Base Set: Everything you need for a basic Dungeon.\nThe Expansion Set: Larger rooms with unique details, perfect for adding interest and flavour to a basic dungeon.\nThe Sewer Set: Send your adventurers into the dark, dank depths of the sewers...\nThe Prison Set: This set adds plenty of extra rooms and passageways including Prison cells, a torture chamber, guard rooms and more. This set also works as a great addition to the base set allowing you to layout a huge Dungeon!\nThe Mansion Set: This set adds enough tiles to create the floor plans for an old mansion or town house. There is a mix of stone floors and wooden floors, allowing for these tiles to be mixed in with all our existing sets for maximum potential.\nLaminated Neoprene or Cloth Topped Neoprene? \nEveryone has seen playmats that are used almost ubiquitously for wargaming now. Essentially large-scale full colour printed mouse-mats, these have enabled gamers the world over to have beautiful looking gaming tables without the mess of trying to model one themselves. \nNeoprene is a wonderfully non-slip material when placed your tabletop (or many surfaces for that matter) and for me this is incredibly important. Gone is the need to tack or tape cardboard tiles down or worry that a small breeze or errant limb will knock the tiles across the table. \nCloth topped neoprene gaming mats are usually quite matte with only a hint of shine from the printing process. By choosing a laminated finish instead you add a very definite shine but this creates the perfect \u2018dry-wipe\u2019 surface for your dungeoneering needs.\nDue to the lamination process tiles with this finish do naturally have an ever so slight curl at the very corners as you can see in the pictures. I have found that this is almost completely unnoticeable when using the tiles on your tabletop during a game, but is accentuated when viewing photos online, taken at oblique angles... \n Hoe does Laminated Neoprene Behave?\nPLAY\n\nIndividual Tiles?  \nA conscious decision was made during design that we wanted each tile to be an individual room or passageway, so that the Dungeon Planner would have maximum autonomy in designing their layout. With squares tiles containing a selection of rooms you often have to lay the tiles out in a grid that makes everything feel just a bit planned and lifeless (imagine the twisting Gothic streets of Bruges, versus the gridded layout of Milton Keynes in England).\nTile Sets  \n All dungeon tile sets will be available as add-on items:  \nCore Set: \u00a330  \nSewer Set \u00a330  \nExpansion Set \u00a330  \nPrison Set \u00a330\nMansion Set \u00a330\nIndustrial Fantasy Set \u00a330\nFurther sets will be added here as they are unlocked.  \nDice Trays\nWe also have a small range of Dice Trays featuring our Dungeon Tile artwork. These are printed cloth topped neoprene with poppers at each corner to assemble. The trays are 8\"x7\" when lying flat. \nDice Tray: \u00a315\n All rewards will be set as standard shipping via Royal Mail.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the small nature of this Kickstarter the risks and challenges are also minimised. The design of the sets is near complete, the test prints have been successful and the manufacturer is more than capable of the workload.\n\nThe supply chain for this Kickstarter is also small, with less links in the production line turnaround time will also be reduced and allow me to react to any issues very quickly.

These are our most generic tiles, designed to be the foundation that all other sets build from.\n2. The Sewer Set\nEveryone needs a good sewer to go adventuring in. This set was designed to let you build some dark, dank sewer encounters, maybe as part or a larger dungeon or as a dungeon in and of itself!\n 3. The Encounter Set\nThis set is designed to add a flourish to your dungeon with unique rooms and spaces. These tiles are far more decorated and detailed adding interest to your dungeon.\n\u00a35000 - 1 x Free Spell Circle Feature Room (LOCKED)\nThe first stretch goal is a free 4\"x4\" tile that can be used as a small room by itself or layered with many other rooms to create a new or different feature.\nAll backers of physical tile sets will receive one of these tiles, digital backers will receive a digital copy.\n\u00a37500 - 4x Free 'Small' Feature Tiles (LOCKED)\nOur second stretch goal is a set of smaller 2\"x2\" tiles each with a small feature that can help drive your adventurers on to new goals or simply create an interesting feature. We have a mysterious trap door, a ornate pool of holy water and two as yet mysterious tiles...\nAll backers of physical tile sets will receive one of these tile sets, digital backers will receive a digital copy.\nFurther Stretch Goals\nFurther stretch goals include new Add On items like a room expansion set, a passageway expansion set, a mansion tile set, a grungy sci-fi tile set, an industrial fantasy tile set, a second encounter set with new 'boss rooms' and if we get there a Japanese style tile set. There will be more news on these as the campaign progresses.\nLaminated Neoprene?  \nEveryone has seen playmats that are used almost ubiquitously for wargaming now. Essentially large-scale full colour printed mouse-mats, these have enabled gamers the world over to have beautiful looking gaming tables without the mess of trying to model one themselves.\nNeoprene is an incredibly non-slip material when placed your tabletop (or many surfaces for that matter) and for me this is incredibly important. Gone is the need to tack or tape cardboard tiles down or worry that a small breeze or errant limb will knock the tiles across the table.\nNormally neoprene gaming mats are printed onto a cloth top so despite a slight metallic sheen, are usually quite matte. We have been able to add a layer of laminate to our tiles, removing the metallic sheen, enriching the colours and most importantly creating the perfect \u2018dry-wipe\u2019 surface for your dungeoneering needs.  \nIndividual Tiles?  \nA conscious decision was made during design that we wanted each tile to be an individual room or passageway, so that the Dungeon Planner would have maximum autonomy in designing their layout. With squares tiles containing a selection of rooms you often have to lay the tiles out in a grid that makes everything feel just a bit planned and lifeless (imagine the twisting Gothic streets of Bruges, versus the gridded layout of Milton Keynes in England).\nFinally... \nNeoprene tiles are much easier to store than any 3D tiles and yet with the laminated colour print still have a visual appeal on the same level (or better) than most 3D sets.\nTile Sets\n All dungeon tile sets will be available as add-on items:\nCore Set: \u00a330\nSewer Set \u00a330\nExpansion Set \u00a330\nFurther sets will be added here as they are unlocked.\nDice Trays\nWe also have a small range of Dice Trays featuring our Dungeon Tile artwork. These are printed cloth topped neoprene with poppers at each corner to assemble. The trays are 8\"x7\" when lying flat. \nDice Tray: \u00a315\nAll rewards will be set as standard shipping via Royal Mail. \nPledges for larger numbers of sets may need to be sent via Courier and so will usually be more expenisve than the listed prices here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the small nature of this Kickstarter the risks and challenges are also minimised. The design of the sets is near complete, the test prints have been successful and the manufacturer is more than capable of the workload.\n\nThe supply chain for this Kickstarter is also small, with less links in the production line turnaround time will also be reduced and allow me to react to any issues very quickly. I will be personally checking each order as it is dispatched for quality control.\n\nOur first Kickstarter, for card game playmats featuring Sumi-e artwork smashed its funding goal and was delivered on time without any issues!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "David Robotham\n3 created \u00b7 19 backed\nI'vebeen gaming for more years than I care to remember and have been actively producing design content for almost every game I have...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Level 1", "descp": "At level 1 you will receive any one Dungeon Realms set of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "All-In Digital", "descp": "At the 'All in Digital' level you will receive a high resolution digital copy of every Dungeon Realms set we are able to produce through this Kickstarter along with a digital versions of all stretch goals unlocked.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "Level 2", "descp": "At level 2 you will receive any two Dungeon Realms sets of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a380 or more", "title": "Level 3", "descp": "At level 3 you will receive any three Dungeon Realms sets of your choice, plus any free unlocked stretch goals.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign closes, through our pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Skulls and Flames!", "update_content": "Good morning everyone,\nI thought it would be fun to show off a few images of the Encounter Set rooms as they have some great details.\nFirst up we have the aptly named Skull Room, great when you want to add an extra layer of foreboding to the Dungeon..."}, {"status": [{"Project is canceled": "OCTOBER 15, 2018"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 9, 2018"}]}], "comment_no": 4, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022259695/dungeon-realms-dungeon-tiles-for-tabletop-rpgs", "project_name": "Dungeon Realms - Dungeon Tiles for Tabletop RPGs (Canceled)"}}, {"backer": "Omote", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Ballista is a new line of adventures and gaming material published by Arcana Creations. The books in this series are all about providing a basic, rules-light, gaming experience making it easy to get into and start playing.\nWith our CA $3500 reached, we are producing an additional adventure to the original 5. All backers who pledged CA $6 or more is entitled to a copy of this 6th (as yet unrevealed) Ballista release matching the formats of their pledge level.\nOn top of that, we have also reached our 74 backer goal unlocked access to the BETA copy of the Ballista Rules Companion to all backers once it becomes available.\nArcana Creations is a small hobby-publisher that has produced material for the Castles & Crusades role playing game from Troll Lord Games, as well as material for Swords & Wizardry from Frog God Games. We have collaborated with other publishers such as Brave Halfling Publishing in the past, but now mainly focus on growing and increasing our own product output. 2017 saw the launch of the Arcana Elements imprint to produce non-gaming related books as well as the launch of the new Ballista line in 2018.\nThe concept behind the Ballista line has changed a lot from inception to implementation. The purpose of this campaign is to properly launch a new gaming line which is compatible with various editions of the world's most popular RPG as well as its relatives and simulacra. With that in mind, the goal of this campaign is the publication of FIVE gaming modules which will need very little additional rule books to actually play.\nIt is important to stress that Ballista is not a new game system. As written, these modules are compatible with systems like Castles & Crusades, Swords & Wizardry, and many others. However, included in every book on the inside cover is a basic rule set to allow you to run the adventure WITHOUT the need of a rule book if one isn't close at hand. All you would really need beyond the book are some characters, dice, and some friends!\nWhen Arcana Creations started out, in partnership with Brave Halfling Publishing, we released three modules for Castles & Crusades and two of those were subsequently released for Swords & Wizardry in electronic format. These were The Secret of Ronan Skerry, The Ruins of Ramat, and A Trick on the Tain. When they were first released, they were well received but the release was small and limited.\nThese three modules have been updated and, in some cases, overhauled for the new Ballista line. In addition to these three, we are releasing two new, never-before-published, adventures to round up our selection of five adventures. These are Mystery at Morfurt and Hide in Plain Sight.\nThe great news about the production of the modules is that the majority of the work is already done! The first three modules are finished and ready to go. The last two modules have already had extensive editing work done on them and are in various stages of layout. Here are print samples of the first three modules:\nWith your help, we can add the final two modules to the line and get all of these out into the hands of gamers and into wider distribution!\nFor all the modules being produced, we offer both PDF and physical printed books. The format chosen for these are 6x9 inches and the finalized page count for the first three are 20 pages each. Page count for the last two haven't been finalized yet but they will not fall below 20 pages. In fact, it is probable that Hide in Plain Sight will exceed this page count.\nThe 6x9 size format was chosen for a few reasons. In terms of the digital format, it is usable on 7\" tablets though optimal on an 8\" tablet for reasons of portability. The physical format makes it smaller than a conventional book which, along with the softcover nature of the module, makes it light and easier to ship. In fact, all five modules will be shipped in a small box (to better protect the books), and the combined size and weight of the package makes shipping to elsewhere in Canada, the United States, or abroad reasonably affordable. After the exchange rate, it will cost less than $10 USD to ship to anywhere in the continental United States as an example. Prices are similar when shipping to Europe or Australia though it will admittedly take several weeks to reach their intended destination.\nEach print module comes with free PDF version of it as well and each module has a MSRP of CA $12.50 each (which works out to no more than about $10 USD). They are printed locally in Montreal, Canada in Pacesetter Silk 80 lbs paper.\nTHE SECRET OF RONAN SKERRY\nThe Secret of Ronan Skerry was written by Michael Davis and takes place on an island. It is an adventure which is largely overland and geared towards a party of lower level characters. In it, the party is called upon to investigate the disappearance of a group of monks who man the lighthouse on the other side of the island.\nTHE RUINS OF RAMAT\nThe Ruins of Ramat was written by John Adams and this version (based on the original C&C version) was expanded. It now offers additional and optional content in greater depth than the scenario's original concept of a group of adventurers out to help a little girl to rescue her pet and explore a local dungeon. While this version of the scenario can be run as originally intended, making it great to play with your kids, the added content adds more depth and throws a twist making it worthwhile to explore further. It is primarily a low-level dungeon crawl.\nA TRICK ON THE TAIN\nA Trick on the Tain was written by Keith Hackwood and is primarily a local-area overland scenario. The adventure takes place over a broader region and can firmly be classified as a low-level wilderness adventure taking place in a tundra environment. There are enough ideas in the pages of the module giving plenty of room for a creative GM to flesh out and expand if they wish leading to a larger campaign in the region.\nMYSTERY AT MORFURT\n Mystery at Morfurt was written by Todd Pote and deals with the children of the village of Morfurt that have suddenly gone missing. Fearing a great evil is responsible, the Earl of the region dispatches a party of adventurers to investigate. It is written as a low-level scenario with a mixture of overland and cave/dungeon exploration.\nHIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT\nHide in Plain Sight was written by Bill DeFranza and starts with a party of adventurers hired to rescue an Earl's kidnapped daughter but they soon realize that all may not be as they appear. It is written as a low-level scenario and is primarily dungeon-based.\nA NOTE ON THE SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe recently found a limited amount of old stock that was remaining from the Castles & Crusades version of The Secret of Ronan Skerry and A Trick on the Tain. This is a limited reward option and once these are gone, they will not be reprinted. If you are a C&C collector or fan, this might be one of your last opportunities to add these to your collection.\nUpon funding... all backers (CA $6 or higher) will receive an additional adventure becoming the sixth title in the Ballista Adventures line. The format of this additional adventure will match the format available in your pledge level. Title to be revealed later.\nUpon reaching 74 Backers... Each backer will receive a PDF copy of the Ballista Rules Companion (BETA). This reward will be delivered regardless of the success or failure of this project.\nNo significant stretch goals have been announced at the start of the campaign but that doesn't mean there aren't a couple surprises in store once we surpass our funding goal! There are things we have planned however, any stretch goals that may happen will be offered as digital options only. The choice is, in part, to keep the shipping costs on any physical rewards unchanged. If a physical version of a stretch goal is possible, an option to have this as a purchased add-on will be made available in addition to the free digital version.\nIn addition to the Ballista modules we have here, we are offering the three current titles published through our Arcana Elements imprint. Simply add the cost of the item to the existing pledge level. For example, if you pledged at the $48 level and wanted to add a copy of Mother of Mortals to your pledge, you would add $20 to the $48 for a total of $68 plus the shipping for your region. Add-Ons will be specified to us once the campaign is over and surveys go out.\nMother of Mortals ... CA $20\nStar Rover ... CA $16\nQuebec's Distinct Paganism ... CA $30\nAdditional Print Ballista Module ... CA $10\nAdditional Digital Ballista Module ... CA $5\nPlease note that, depending on stock levels and shipping destination, any the books could be shipped separately from the Ballista modules. If they do ship separately, they are likely to ship earlier than the rest of the rewards in this campaign.\nIn the Fairy Forest illustration \u00a9AtelierSommerland - Can Stock Photo Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the material written and the majority of the editing complete, we do not foresee any issues in fulfillment nor do we expect any. Electronic copies will be distributed online via Driverthru RPG (RPGNow) and the modules are produced locally at a reputable printer we've worked with before for other projects. The physical copies will be mailed out from Montreal, Canada.\n\nWe've done the necessary research regarding shipping and printing to know that there will be no cost overruns. With regards to shipping, while we managed to keep costs at reasonable levels, the time it will take to deliver packages will take longer if you are located overseas. Shipping can either be inexpensive or fast; it can't be both. For those who would like to expedite their shipping, this can be arranged at a higher cost. Please contact us through through Kickstarter to make arrangements.\n\nThe time for fulfillment, given where we are at in the production of these modules, is generous to anticipate any issues we couldn't otherwise foresee. The expectation is this will happen earlier than stated in order to complete this within the specified time frame. In the event that this campaign is more successful than anticipated, there will still be enough leeway to complete fulfillment on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 3 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Want to support Arcana Creations and the new Ballista line but not interested in any of the current offerings?

Thank you all for backing this collector's set and helping us create a new, contained boxed set for Castles & Crusades! Thank you all! Be sure to check out Backerkit to adjust your pledge levels and add rewards.\nClassic Castles & Crusades. A Role Playing Game.\nCastles & Crusades is a rules light fantasy RPG, powered by a simple mechanic called the Siege Engine. First published in 2004, the game quickly became a staple in the RPG market, leading the way and influencing a whole generation of RPGs. The Castles & Crusades Players Handbook, the cornerstone of the game, is on its 7th printing and headed toward an 8th. The line itself consists of a host of source books, monster books, setting books, and adventures. (For a brief overview of how to play, see the bottom of this page).\nToday, more than ever, people are enjoying the pure joy of role-playing games. New players by the scores, and older players who are rediscovering the fun of role-playing games.\nWe want to introduce them, and you, to Castles & Crusades. To do that we want to make an affordable, fun to use, and fun to have entry point into the game.\nIf this project funds we\u2019ll produce Classic Castles & Crusades as an affordable introduction to the genre and the game, bringing you the true spirit of Role Playing, in a simple, fast-playing and fun attribute-check-based rules system. \n In this Kickstarter we are offering up THREE special collector's products for fans of the game. These three products are as follows: \n C&C Classic Basic Boxed Set: This digest-sized boxed set is an \"old school\" presentation of the game, in a white box just like the original D&D rules, with saddle-stitched booklets containing a complete, but streamlined version of the game, with four character classes, four races, and magic to take your game all the way to level 10. Plus, a complete introductory adventure module! This box will be different than the Advanced and it will not be exclusive to the Kickstarter, it will eventually land in retail shops.\n C&C Classic Advanced Boxed Set: A True Collector's set, this limited, signed and numbered set will include everything from the Basic set, plus two additional books of character classes, equipment, monsters and gods; a full set of dice; character sheets; a pencil and more. This box will be different than the Basic box, sporting  a wood grain cover similar to the original OD&D box. It will be available in this Kickstarter and any left over from the very limited print run will be put in our store.\n C&C Complete Digest Rulebooks: These are the complete rulebooks for our seven core books: the Player's Handbook, Monsters & Treasure, Castle Keeper's Guide, Codex of Aihrde, Player's Guide to Aihrde, Adventurer's Backpack, and Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde. Each is the complete rulebook, exactly as you'd see it in full-size hardcover, but shrunk to digest size, softcover and printed in black and white. You can build your own set or buy all 7. \nHere's more information about each individual product, in detail. \nPRODUCT ONE: Classic Castles & Crusades Basic Box Set\nEach book in the set is 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched (stapled) with b/w covers and interior. Each book below includes streamlined extracts from the full, complete version of the game. Much of the flavor text will be removed for space reasons, and options will be limited, but it will still present a complete game that you can campaign with for years. Each book will be laid out in a fashion that best fits its size. The box will be a standard white box and eventually it will be available in retail stores.\n Classes & Races: a book that teaches you how to create a character and advance that character to 10th level\n Eldritch Enchantments: a book of magic rules and spells through the 5th level\n Monsters & Treasure: a book filled with monsters and treasure\n Adventures in the Wilderness and Underworld: a book on how the game plays and the famed Siege Engine\n An Adventure: a new, if presently unnamed adventure.\nThe below picture is of the C&C Black Box we did a few years ago. The Basic Box will look similar to it, final cover and image to be determined. The books as well.\nPRODUCT TWO: Classic Castles & Crusades Advanced Box Set\nEach book in the set is 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched (stapled) with b/w covers and interior. Each book below includes streamlined extracts from the full, complete version of the game. Much of the flavor text will be removed for space reasons, and options will be limited, but it will still present a complete game that you can campaign with for years. Each book will be laid out in a fashion that best fits its size. The box will sport a wood-grain print cover that pays homage to the original D&D box set. It will be available in this Kickstarter only, aside from any unsold from the limited print run, which will eventually be available on our store.\n Characters & Magic: a book that teaches you how to create a character and advance that character to 10th level\n Eldritch Enchantments: a book of magic rules and spells through the 5th level\n Monsters & Treasure: a book filled with monsters and treasure\n Adventures in the Wilderness and Underworld: a book on how the game plays and the famed Siege Engine\n An Adventure: a new, if presently unnamed adventure.\n Adventurers Backpack: excerpts from the recently released ABP, some classes, backpacks and other material\n Of Gods & Monsters of Aihrde: A second look at the gods of Aihrde.*\nCharacter Reference Sheets\nDice\nPencil\n*This book will contain different material than that which appeared in the original Black Box.\nThe below picture is the wood grain look that we will strive to replicate.\nPRODUCT THREE: Castles & Crusades Complete Digest Rulebooks\nBUT that\u2019s not all! We want to pay homage to the full and complete game. And what better way to do that than to release digest sized complete rulebooks for the game! In the pledges to the right you\u2019ll see digest versions of each of the core C&C books as well as the Setting material and books written by Stephen Chenault (CEO and lead author at Troll Lord Games\u2026. Jason Vey might dispute the lead author title).\nEach of the digest books is a shrunk down version of the hardcover copy of the latest printing (the CKG will sport the new cover). They are printed in black and white. Each set will be cut and trimmed to match a perfect set for your book shelf.\nWe\u2019d love to redo each of these books with special layouts for digest form, but that is two steps from impossible. If we took this approach, each of the books would require three times the pages, which would make the larger books like the Castle Keeper Guide unwieldy and weak in the spine. \nSo do keep in mind that these highly collectable books are shrunk down versions of our wonderful game. They are the same books, same page counts, same layout, etc. They are just smaller. On the left you'll see the regular Players Handbook, on the right the digest size Players Handbook.\nThe titles in the set include:\nCastles & Crusades Players Handbook (7th Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure (5th Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Castle Keepers Guide (3rd Printing Cover)\nCastles & Crusades Adventures Backpack (1st Printing)\nCodex of Aihrde (2nd Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Players Guide to Aihrde (1st Printing)\nCastles & Crusades Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde (2nd Printing)\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nWe are offering several pledge levels.

There are six main attributes: strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, charisma and constitution. There are standard classes like wizard, fighter, rogue, etc. and races like human, elf, dwarvf, gnome and halfling.\nWhen designing your character, you roll 3d6 six times for your attributes (this is one method) and assign the totals to each of the six attributes however you desire. You then assign each attribute a primary or secondary status. Humans have three and demi-humans 2. These attributes are the cornerstone of the Seige Engine. You will use them to solve any problem or overcome any challenge except for combat. To do so the Castle Keeper will ask you to roll an attribute check. You will roll a d20, add your level and you attribute bonus to the number rolled and tell the CK the total. THAT number determines whether you succeed or fail. Primary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12, secondary attributes a base chance to succeed of 18. The CK will adjust that with a level of difficulty, or challenge level, and you must beat that number. \nExample: You want to swim a river. The CK asks you to make dexterity check. Dexterity is a prime, you are 3rd level and have a +1 due to attribute bonus. You roll a 14+level+attribute bonus. You inform the CK that you rolled an 18 prime. Because it\u2019s a prime, she knows the base is 12. She has assigned a challenge level of 4 to it. Meaning you need 12+4 for a total of 16. You made it. HAD dexterity been a secondary ability you would have failed, as the base chance to succeed is 18+4=22. You would have missed by several points.\nThat\u2019s the Siege Engine in a nut shell. Its very versatile, easy to use and adapts to ANY style of play. The true hidden joy of the SE is the CK controls what attribute you roll. Swimming a river? That can be ANY attribute the CK desires: dexterity, intelligence, strength etc. \nThe mechanic is designed to tailor to YOUR game.\nPlay it. You\u2019ll love it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's always difficult to create collector's material. Items meant to be displayed, not used. Determining whether enough people are interested or not is no easy matter. Kickstarter offers the perfect vehicle for that.\n\nHowever, creating digest books is always a challenge.

Featuring high-quality art from the book.\nNote from the CEO\nAll Frog God Games hardcovers are stitched into 16-page packets, the packets are sewn together, and then all the packets are sewn to a cloth backing, creating a book block that is glued to its cover. This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\" So, what does this mean to you? Well first, you will note that our books cost a little more than others. That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. We feel strongly that book production quality is king. After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). It costs us a lot of money to do this, and our margins are somewhat lower than they could be as a result. Frog God Games stands behind our product (and sometimes on top of it when we need a ladder), and believe that the improved quality and durability of our work is well worth it.\nBackerkit enables us to get you the rewards you want both faster and more reliably than we could otherwise. No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!\nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through Backerkit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.\nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system. Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping. It is during Backerkit checkout that your shipping cost is calculated and charged.\nNOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive, expect to pay between $50-80 to ship your reward. This cost is based on the ACTUAL SHIPPING COST plus $5 and is calculated in Backerkit.\nBuilding the City of Brass\nClick the image to watch!\nIt has become traditional for Matt Finch to make a model of some part of our bigger adventures while the Kickstarter is live, and then make a video in which you see the model from miniature's eye level, walking through the adventure and seeing it through the eyes of the adventurers. Matt, Zach, and Jim are making one of the city's Black Magic Bazaars as the model for this Kickstarter. Keep track of their progress as the Kickstarter rolls forward. Here is a link to the first video, with special guest star Casey Christofferson, the author of the book! There will be lots of \"secret\" information about the city coming out in these videos, as well as tips for painting minis and terrain and how to make good scenery for city adventures! Don't forget to subscribe to Matt's channel if you want to get notifications of each video's release.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (19!)

Its wildly popular supplement, the Advanced Edition Companion, adds all of the \"advanced\" first edition options for Labyrinth Lord, all while keeping compatibility with the B/X basic fantasy game.\nFor the first time, Labyrinth Lord and the Advanced Edition Companion will be seamlessly combined into one volume! Fans have been asking for this for several years, and it is my pleasure to make it happen! All of the basic and advanced options, magic items, and monsters will be brought together under one cover for easy reference.\nHere are some facts about the combined book:\nThis is not a new game.\nThis is simply a combined book.\nYou will still be able to separate \"basic\" from \"advanced\" game options.\nMuch interior art will carry over from the original books, but new interior art will be featured in addition.\nThis combined book does not replace the current separate books. Those books will remain in print.\nCover Options and Realms of Crawling Chaos\nThere are 4 cover options available to backers.

The printing and shipping expense comes later when you order your print products. The PDF eBook will be delivered by download link.\n\nWHEN YOU PLEDGE\nSelect your reward. If you would like to add one or more copies of the limited hard cover edition of Realms of Crawling Chaos, add $25 to your pledge per copy.\n\nIf you would like to buy more than 4 copies of rule books (any combination of covers), select the Rule book x 4 option, and add $25 to your pledge per additional book.\nStretch Goals\nPeople familiar with my crowd funding projects know that I like to keep them simple. It is easy to over commit and cause unforeseen difficulties in fulfillment. However, I have two reasonable stretch goals in mind as the project launches.\nFunding Level\n\n$8,000 - A solo adventure will be added to the rule book!\n$12,000 - Three full-color landscape art panels!

Enter the world of Harvesters, where badgers, rabbits, squirrels, and otters launch into adventures of epic wonder. Here, the smallest of creatures take on the roles of the greatest heroes: Knights, Druids, Clerics, Rogues, Wizards, and Fighters. Together, they tackle the greatest of exploits, from rescuing the princess to finding lost treasure. You'll find no humans here, only animals. They live their daily lives and do work just like humans do in your world. You may find a rabbit as a local constable, or a squirrel as a baker or a mouse as a black smith.\nArt by Jim Holloway!\nChose from one of five animals to play: rabbits/hares, squirrels, badgers, otters, and mice. Each can be a fighter, wizard, rogue or more!\nHarvesters is a game for all ages. It uses the time honored Siege Engine, an insanely easy to learn game system that focuses on story over mechanics. It generally takes only 15 minutes to pick the how's and why's of a Siege Engine RPG.  \nIf you are familiar with any of our other games (Castles & Crusades, Amazing Adventures, Victorious) you'll be able to pick it up and play it immediately. You can even bring your characters over from one world to the next, and play that star-finding and slightly funny and a little obnoxious racoon in your own game!\nMore on the Animals!\nYou can choose from the following classes: fighter, ranger, rogue, cleric, knight, wizard and druid. In its current edition you can play 1 of 5 animals (More have been added to the game, see stretch rewards below). They are: Badger, Rabbit, Squirrel, Mouse or Otter. Each comes with their own special abilities. VERY Briefly they are:\nBadger: Along with your CLASS abilities, the badger has twilight vision, digging, enmity toward wolverines, primal fury and special languages.\nRabbit: Along with your CLASS abilities, the rabbit has twilight vision, burst of speed, unarmed combat, camouflage, and special languages.\nSquirrel: Along with your CLASS abilities, the squirrel has climbing, fall, camouflage, special languages and is highly skilled with the bow and sling.\nMouse: Along with your CLASS abilities, the mouse has twilight vision, move silently, enmity toward rats and special langauges.\nOtter: Along with your CLASS abilities, the otter has swimming, twilight vision, underwater weapons and special languages.\nHarvesters is a role playing game specifically designed for family play. Using the wildly popular and easy to use Castles & Crusades Siege Engine, players choose any one of the listed animals to play, in any of the classes provided. Designed for children ages 6 and up, Harvesters is the perfect game to bring everyone together. Children delight in taking on the roles of their favorite animals and parents find the role of Castle Keeper easy and fun!  \nWHAT YOUR PLEDGE EARNS YOU\nWe have only two pledges: a digital version or the full boxed set!

It is the heart of a country that includes The Quacking Woods, Black Midge Swamp, Linden Forest and so much more. Here you can wander the wilderness in search of adventure, glory, fame or gold! It all takes place on the western banks of the lake.\nWheat Hollow: The starter adventure begins when we learn that old Farmer Thistledown's farm has been burgled by an unknown beast that haunts the environs of Wheat Hollow. Plunge into the wilderness to face down the villains who bring terror to the good creatures of Wheat Hollow.  \nLost Fang's Gold: Over the last many seasons, the Southern Road has been plagued by the Long Fang rat gang - they have been hijacking goods and stealing every little bit of gold that has passed their way. The surrounding communities have been trying to track them down without any luck. All the clues lead to the Linden Forest, but nobody is overly eager to step foot in it \u2013 beside the Long Fang gang, there\u2019s been tales of nasty critters and the ghost of a long lost wizard. Anyone who is stalwart enough to enter the woods will be richly rewarded - for to find the hideout and all the gold that has been taken will make that person wealthy indeed.\nBlack Tim's Prize: Pandin and his crew sailed north, carrying a map that charted the treasures of Tamias the mad fox squirrel of legend. But the map was not Pandin's, it belonged to a pug-nosed pirate named Black Tim. And Black Tim is none too happy.

Only the most gifted students received instruction within its walls.\nIn time, HighFell was deserted and fell into ruin. Its towers, battlements, citadels, and catacombs became home to all manner of wandering monsters. Adventurers and dungeon explorers began making the dangerous trek up the mountain in search of arcane lore and magical treasures.\nIn recent months a strange green light was seen emanating from the ruins at midnight. The light slowly intensified until a great explosion rocked the Dwimmerhorn. HighFell pulled away from the mountain and now slowly drifts - and occasionally phases in and out of place - over the Great Steppe of The Northern Reaches.\nAre you brave (or foolish) enough to explore the ruins of HighFell - The Drifting Dungeon?\nWHAT IS HIGHFELL?\nThis Kickstarter campaign is designed to support the creation of a new megadungeon adventure called HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon.\nHighFell is designed for Labyrinth Lord but can be played with any Old School Role-Playing Game (or their clones) from the 70s and 80s such as B/X, First or Second edition, OSRIC, or Swords and Wizardry. This scenario can also be played with the DCC RPG with conversions.\nThis new megadungeon adventure is designed to support a medieval fantasy campaign lasting months and years. HighFell will support low-level to high-level play.\nI estimate the final draft to be between 180-250 pages and approximately 500-600 encounter areas. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete, that project was 259 pages in a two-column format (cover to cover). Forbidden Caverns, my follow-up project, was 293 pages, PDF poster maps will be done in both black and Old School blue.\nHighFell opens with a gazetteer that outlines the region in which the adventure takes place. This includes a cultural history as well as the detailing of several small villages that can provide a base of operations for an extended campaign. Like the mounds in Barrowmaze, or the caves in Forbidden Caverns, HighFell also provides some low hanging fruit above-ground to get (wise) players started. The dungeon proper will be leveled in a traditional style, albeit in a floating dungeon context with twists and surprizes. This approach merges my own particular vision with inspiration drawn from modules like The Village of Hommlet, Dragons of Desolation, and The Ghost Tower of Inverness.\nRemember prices are in Canadian Dollars so there's AWESOME SAVINGS for all my peeps in the United States and abroad. If you are unfamiliar, the 2017 average conversion for the year was $1.00 USD = 71 cents CAD. (citation: bankofcanada.ca).\nHere are some past layout samples from Barrowmaze Complete with the cover by ex-TSR artist Erol Otus. The cover and page samples represent the style you can expect with HighFell: The Drifting Dungeon\nCover and Layout Samples\nWHO AM I?\nMy name is Dr. Greg Gillespie. I am an Associate Professor of Popular Culture at a university in Ontario, Canada. I regularly teach a senior undergraduate course entitled The History and Culture of Role-Playing Games (for realz). I am also the author/designer of two very popular Old School megadungeons called Barrowmaze Complete and The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia. You can read widely about Barrowmaze on the internet or on rpgnow.com. Through my professional expertise, I know how to create, manage, and deliver outstanding game projects on time.\nART AND THE OLD SCHOOL\nIn my opinion, crafting an OSR dungeon is about much more than creating an adventure. It is about celebrating the origins of the hobby, the classic fantasy gaming experience, and understanding that dungeon crawling isn't supposed to be about long exhausting combats but rather an equal mix of exploration, combat, and role-play. These values are very important to me and find expression in my design and aesthetics. Just like Barrowmaze and Forbidden Caverns, HighFell will place a premium on amazing art. I will get the band back together including the talents of Cory Hamel, Stefan Poag, Peter Pagano, Trevor Hammond, Stephen Thompson, and others.\nSimilar to past projects for Labyringth Lord Rules, every monster in the monster section will have its own illustration. In the past I have worked with former TSR artists Erol Otus, Jim Holloway, and Tim Truman. I hope to work with these and other TSR illustrators again on this project for a colour cover and also interior art. Erol has already agreed to illustrate the cover for HighFell. We will ensure the colors and aesthetic chosen compliment Barrrowmaze and The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia (so they will all look super swank on your shelf).\nIn terms of mapping, those of you will a close eye will notice my published dungeons are slowly filling in a certain old school wilderness board game map that serves as the basis of my Northern Reaches homegame (we affectionately call it...Greghawk lol). HighFell will continue this tradition as a tip of the cap to Gygax's original homegame.\nCory Hamel and Peter Pagano have created some fantastic preliminary illustrations to give you an idea of the aesthetic we have in mind for a few of the monsters. There's more to come!\nTHROW-INs and ADD-ONS\nLike my other projects HighFell will be detailed, provide depth of engagement, have old school charm, and be super fun for your gaming group. There is no list of stuff to add persay, rather the more funding the campaign receives the more I can invest into and develop the final product. I have an excellent reputation across the interwebs for value-added projects. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete or Forbidden Caverns of Archaia, you already know what to expect.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always potential challenges to any large project.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome!

See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due.

We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

Once enabled, the app plays a soundtrack that randomly and periodically plays three different sounds. If a sound plays while it's your turn, you suffer the corresponding penalty.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

Gamers of all ages!  \nGoing down?\nFrog God Games is proud to present Rappan Athuk, THE DUNGEON OF GRAVES! The Granddaddy of all Megadungeons is back for Fifth Edition! \nMock-up hardcover with actual cover design.\nCharacters will test their mettle against puzzles, tricks, and traps a-plenty; test their grit and steel against monsters and foes lurking around every corner; and at the end of it all awaits the Big Daddy himself, Orcus. These are truly adventures worth winning. \n\u2014 \u201cI once killed a man, just to watch him die\u201d \u2013 a Man in Black \n\u2014 \u201cHold my goblet\u201d \u2013 Orcus\nInterior mockup with actual pages from Rappan Athuk for Fifth Edition.\nRappan Athuk is back for Fifth Edition. Not just back though, it is reloaded with all kinds of new extras including:\nAll new, full color artwork\nThree new levels of the Dungeon itself  \nThree new Wilderness locations, including a three-level castle\n A new three-level satellite dungeon\n A sea-cave of terrible shark-men! A Kickstarter exclusive level released from the Vault of Tsathogga! \nUpdated color maps, available as separate PSD files for online play, are included for all levels\nScores of NPCs and Monsters, dozens of Magic Items and Spells, and the legendary Dung Monster await you! \nArt comparison between 2012 and new edition.\n\nWeighing in at over 500 pages, Rappan Athuk for Fifth Edition is an instant classic in the Mega-Dungeon genre, featuring 100+ keyed and color mapped areas with over 56 dungeon levels, several satellite dungeons (almost 20 additional levels!), the village of Zelkor's Ferry, 22 wilderness areas (ways to die before you ever reach the dungeon) and seemingly countless groups of bandits and monsters that prey on those fortunate enough to escape the halls and caves of Rappan Athuk with treasure in hand!\nWith decades of playtesting and use in campaigns across the globe, the Dungeon of Graves can be a foundation of any campaign or eviscerated into pieces and blended into any campaign!\nMap comparison between the two editions.\nOnce upon a time, there was an idea\u2014an idea formulated by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in 1974 and published in a little paperback book called Underworld Adventures. The idea was simple: it is a lot of fun to go into a dungeon and kill evil monsters. Why is the dungeon there? No one knows. Why do the monsters usually fight rather than talk? We aren\u2019t really sure. Why are there 16 trolls in a cave with a jug of alchemy? No one cares. What do all the monsters eat? We don\u2019t know that either (although \u201cadventurer\u201d probably tops the list). And we don\u2019t have to know these things. This isn\u2019t an ecology experiment, it\u2019s a dungeon\u2014the quintessential setting for pure swords and sorcery adventuring.  \nThis adventure pays homage to that original idea. True, there are opportunities for role playing, but most of this module is dedicated to \u201croll playing.\u201d Hopefully, while exploring the halls of Rappan Athuk, you will recall the thrill of discovery, the terror in your heart when you fought your first skeleton, the joy of rolling your first natural 20, and the despair you felt when that 1 came up for your poison save. This module, Rappan Athuk\u2014The Dungeon of Graves, is nothing more and nothing less than a good, old\u2013fashioned, First Edition dungeon crawl updated for the 5th Edition Roleplaying Game. Very difficult, it should strike fear into the hearts of the most stalwart adventurers. It offers an abundance of traps, tricks, and monsters. We hope that you find this module as fun and exciting as those thousands of players who have ventured into (and not as often out of) the endless caverns and mazes of Rappan Athuk\u2014The Dungeon of Graves. Rappan Athuk is a difficult dungeon. Even the upper dungeon levels should not be attempted by a party of less than six mid-level characters.\nOnly truly veteran players should attempt this dungeon with lower level characters. In light of this, we added the satellite dungeons, including Bill's very first work (from 1977), Tunnels of Terror! This 9-area dungeon was used as the introduction to his campaign and led his players to Rappan Athuk through play. \nRappan Athuk for Fifth Edition has a number of pledge levels to choose from, but be aware that the main pledge levels to get yourself a copy of Rappan Athuk are the $45 for the PDF and $95 level for the hardcover book plus PDF.\nThe pledge levels for this project are:\n$5 Farmers & Shopkeepers -- Show your support and get all the free digital stretch goals that are unlocked PLUS get the opportunity to purchase add-ons in Backerkit! \n$15 Rappan Athuk Upgraded! --Get the PDF file of the new levels of Rappan Athuk that are not contained in the 2012 hardcover release for either Swords and Wizardry OR Pathfinder!

This is what we mean when we say \"library binding.\" So, what does this mean to you? Well first, you will note that our books cost a little more than others. That being said, after a myriad of book-binding issues both recently and dating back to 2nd Edition, there is nothing we hate to see more than someone investing in an expensive game book and having it fall apart on them after only a short period of regular use. \nWe feel strongly that book production quality is king. After all, you guys spend a lot of money on your books! Second, if a Frog God hardcover book ever falls apart (we have tested this with baseball bats and very rough use, by the way), we will replace it at no cost assuming we still have one in stock. Yes, that means if you call me in ten years, and your book binding has failed you (failed us really) through regular use (please no bulldozer roll overs), just email me and if the book is still in stock, we will mail you a new copy for free. Nothing I can do for you if they are all sold out though (but email me anyway and I'll hook you up in some way). \nIt costs us a lot of money to do this, and our margins are somewhat lower than they could be as a result. Frog God Games stands behind our product (and sometimes on top of it when we need a ladder), and believe that the improved quality and durability of our work is well worth it.\nIf you are a technology person but still find real tabletops to be the sine qua non of role-playing games then, thanks to Fat Dragon Games, we have exactly what you need!\nThese guys are the first name in nerd 3D print files!\nIf you have have been to either NTRPG Con 2017 or GameHole Con 2017 you may have seen the set-up.

No reward is eligible for shipment without Backerkit checkout. You will be asked to create a Backerkit account to select your reward. This process verifies both reward selection and your correct shipping address. PLEASE complete the Backerkit process in a timely fashion so we can deliver your pledge reward!  \nPDF Reward Distribution\n We will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers or will be provided through Backerkit. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.  \nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards, and checkout through their system.

Even though we had Joe Dever\u2019s detailed descriptions from his books, his elaborate sketches and detailed input, it took a lot of time to get them finalized. Much thanks to the attention to detail by Francesco Mattioli and his beautiful penmanship. The style, the architecture, the flavor of each city is unique and carried through in his beautiful hand drawn maps, inspired by an old medieval map of Bologna.\nWe decided early on to make the maps justice by printing them in poster size. Holmgard is the most detailed map, and thus the largest of the ten. Some, like The Kai Monastery is considerably smaller. However, they all came with the same challenge. How do you keep them as gorgeous as they deserve when packed? Our solution was the specially made map tube. That allows us to roll up the maps instead of folding them, which makes them all so much more beautiful and easy to hang on a wall.\nThe Sommerlund City Maps contains the following 10 maps in full color \u2013 and with the most gorgeous illustrations on their back:\nHolmgard\nToran\nTyso\nAnskaven\nMoytura\nRuanon\nSilvershore\nSommerlund with Detailed Information\nThe Kai Monastery\nThe Sommer Isles\nHolmgard (90 x 66 cm)\nHolmgard was one of the first major settlements established in Sommerlund and became its capital during the reign of King Braern I (MS 3445-3472). In ancient Sommlending, the word Holmgard means \u2018Strong of Heart and Mind\u2019. Holmgard was built with the blood, sweat, and tears of its people as countless battles were fought to secure the lands against marauding bandits from the Wildlands and incursions by raiders from the Darklands. King Braern I chose a perfect location for the Sommlending capital. It had a natural protective harbour, fertile arable farmland, a temperate climate and a reliable source of fresh water. In MS 5000, Holmgard is the seat of power for the King of Sommerlund, King Myranar III. There are two river gates and five grand gates in the encircling city wall. The gates permit easy road access into the capital from all four compass points, but they can be locked down and made totally secure during times of war. The two rivers that enter the city are wide enough to be navigated with ease.\nAnskaven (70 x 50 cm)\nThe City of Anskaven prides itself on being the oldest settlement in Sommerlund. In MS 3434, it was here that the Sommlending made landfall after their Great Voyage across the Northern Void from their ancient homeland islands of Tay Solobo. In MS 5000, Anskaven has the most expansive docks and quayside facilities of any Sommlending city, boasting three dry docks and several shipbuilding and refitting yards. It is home to the Northern Fleet, has a large fishing fleet and processes the cargoes of merchant ships.\nToran (70 x 50 cm)\nThe City of Toran is undeniably beautiful, a marvel of Sommlending architecture and design, a perfect combination of elegance and strength. The foundations of its curtain wall were laid in MS 3448 and completed in MS 3455. It is located on the northern coast of Sommerlund, on the east side of the Toran Sound, at the point where the River Tor flows out into the Kaltesee. It is dominated by a vertigo-inducing tower that serves as the seat of power for the Guildmaster of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star.\nTyso (70 x 50 cm)\nTyso is a flourishing city port situated on the eastern seaboard of Sommerlund, north-east of Holmgard and south-west of Anskaven. Two major overland routes connect it to these cities, and road traffic of all kinds passes regularly along them. Tyso has a thriving fishing industry and benefits greatly from the production of grain and arable food crops in the fertile plains due west, north and south of its coastal location. Tyso has long been a vital base of operations to protect the Holmgulf from attack by sea.\nMoytura (50 x 35 cm)\nThe principal town of the Southland Marches, of significant strategic and economic value to the Crown. The strong stone wall was constructed following the Drakkarim occupation and the Battle of the Pass of Moytura in MS 3799. Moytura is situated on the East Border Turnpike and benefits from the natural protection afforded it by the Wildlands Range to the east, and the Southlund Hills to the north and west. It is within sight of the permanent encampment of the Army of the South.\nRuanon (50 x 35 cm)\nThe principal town and trading centre of the Baronial Province of Ruanon. Originally, it was sited close to the Baron\u2019s Castle. In MS 4552, following the discovery of gold in the Maaken Mines, a mass exodus occurred. Nearly all of the inhabitants of the old town moved east and settled near to the mines. An underground river was discovered and a new town sprang up and rapidly expanded, fuelled by the migration of prospectors and entrepreneurs looking to make their fortune in the mines.\nSilvershore (35 x 50 cm)\nThe first Sommlending settlement on the Kirlunidin Isles. The early settlers subsisted on fishing, sheep-farming and agriculture. The discovery of mineral resources prompted fierce rivalry and led to outbreaks of violence, until a lasting peace was achieved in MS 3470. Silvershore grew steadily over the following centuries. A small fleet was created, made up entirely of caravels. The protective wall has proved its worth, assisting the townsfolk to defend their home from pirate raiders and attempts at conquest by the Vassagonian Empire.\nSommerlund (50 x 70 cm)\nThis is more than just a map over Sommerlund. It also contains a multitude of detailed information about the nation. In the frame, you will find mini maps containing historical maps of Sommerlund down the ages, information on the Kai Protectorate, flags and emblems showing the political hierarchy of the Kirlundin Isles, Southlund Marches, Barony of Ruanon, The Baronial Confederation of Toran, Barony of Anskaven, County of Tyso and finally a Political Map of Magnamund.\nKai Monastery (50 x 70 cm)\nA detailed map over the Kai Monastery, where all young Kai selected get a chance to enhance their gifts and train under the supervision of their teachers. This is the very first location you get to know during Flight from the Dark, and it is the home of the Kai when you play the multi player game of Lone Wolf.\nSommer Isles (50 x 35 cm)\nA map of Tay Solobo, the ancient homeland of the Sommlending that undertook the Great Voyage across the Northern Void. Here you will get a chance to see all of the isles the sommlending stem from, and even get some translations of their language.\n\u00c5skf\u00e5geln is the Swedish publisher of Lone Wolf (Ensamma Vargen in Swedish), so we will not only make this gorgeous map collection available in English. It will be printed in Swedish as well, for all who so wishes. The translations can take a few extra weeks, but we have the best team possible on the project. Choose the Reward Level of the language you want.\nAlla ni som \u00e4lskar Ensamma Vargen och hellre vill ha era kartor p\u00e5 svenska ist\u00e4llet kan sj\u00e4lvfallet f\u00e5 det. Vi kommer att g\u00f6ra v\u00e5rt b\u00e4sta f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 ut de \u00f6versatta kartorna s\u00e5 fort som m\u00f6jligt, men det finns en risk att det tar n\u00e5gra veckor extra f\u00f6r Francesco att l\u00e4gga in alla \u00f6vers\u00e4ttningar i sina kartor.

We only got four different Reward Levels to choose from. Here you can see what is included in each of them.\nWhen your Reward includes one or maps in print, you will get the same maps in PDF as well. If you only select the map of Holmgard, you will get Holmgard in PDF. If you select The Sommerlund Cities, you will get those seven maps in PDF. Finally, if you select the Complete Collection, you will get every map included in PDF as well.\nThank you so much for backing this Kickstarter Campaign. Francesco Mattioli\u2019s maps are gorgeous artwork, made by a skilled cartographer paying attention to details. The extra value stems from Joe Dever\u2019s dedication to Lone Wolf and the world of Magnamund, where all fans of Joe Dever\u2019s epic Lone Wolf saga will recognize the iconic places we present here. We were fortunate to work with Joe on this map project, and the result is in our mind stunning.\nYou get out gratitude for being part of making this beautiful map project take the last step from a wild dream to full color poster size maps in print.\nWe will send you the largest map of this entire campaign. Holmgard is the capital of Sommerlund, and the biggest and most detailed map of them all. It is also well known to all who played the very first book in the epic saga of Lone Wolf.\nThis collection consists of the 7 city maps included in this project, delivered in a special map tube printed for this product. All of the cities have their own style and flare, and the architecture will vary some between them, due to everything from local resources to tactical position, fires, etc. The maps are all printed on separate posters, but the sizes vary. Holmgard is 90 x 66 cm, Toran, Tyso and Askaven are all 70 x 50 cm, while Moytura, Ruanon and Silvershore are 50 x 35 cm.\nThis Kickstarter special Reward Level includes all of the ten maps, delivered in a special map tube printed for this product. Holmgard is 90 x 66 cm, while 5 of the other maps are 70 x 50 and the last 4 are 50 x 35 cm. All of these maps are delivered in a map tube specially made for this project, printed with a unique cover made for The Sommerlund City Maps Collection.\nThe better this campaign goes, the more good stuff we want to send your way. Since this is primarily a campaign to show some of the beautiful art developed for Lone Wolf and Magnamund, the Stretch Goals will come in 3 major types:\n1. Additional maps from Francesco Mattioli \u2013 these are typically smaller maps \u2013 A4, previously made for the Swedish Lone Wolf Roleplaying game. Will be sent to you with the maps\n2. Artwork by Lukas Thelin \u2013 typically printed in A4, still in the same movie poster quality as the maps of Sommerlund Cities. Will be sent to you with the maps.\n3. Commitment to develop new maps for the future. These will not be included in your reward, but you will have something to look forward to.\nAfter receiving some questions on how to go ahead and order more copies of the maps, we have decided to go ahead and make the following add ons available. If you have any other particular thing you would like to see, feel free to contact us and we will see what we can do.\nAdd the total amount for extra maps to your Pledge. After the campaign you will be able to tell us exactly what you want (which maps and language) in survey we send out to you.\nHolmgard Map \u2013 150 SEK\nSommerlund Map \u2013 125 SEK\nKai Monastery \u2013 125 SEK\nSommerlund Cities (7 maps + the special map tube) \u2013 500 SEK\nComplete Collection (10 maps + the special map tube) \u2013 750 SEK\nIf you decide to up your pledge from the Holmgard map to more, please increase your pledge amount with 50 SEK for the additional shipping cost.

We have been active in Swedish roleplaying games since the dawn of time, and involved in a multitude of successful games and magazines over the years, mostly in Swedish. 2018 is the year \u00c5skf\u00e5geln has marked for Creative Fireworks \u2013 the year to launch all of those great gaming titles that have been brewing for a long while. The Sommerlund City Maps are one part of the Creative Fireworks.\nFrancesco Mattioli\nFrancesco Mattioli is a cartographer and illustration artist best known for his work on Lone Wolf and various board games over the years. He is also the lead cartographer for \u00c5skf\u00e5geln\u2019s product line Freeway Warrior \u2013 the four choose your own adventure books by Joe Dever, as well as an upcoming roleplaying game in that post apocalypse setting.\nJoe Dever\nThe acclaimed author and game designer Joe Dever had a lot of gaming titles under his belt, but he is best known for the epic saga of Lone Wolf in choose your own adventure kind of play. The Sommerlund City Maps are all from that wondrous setting Joe Dever created, based on his texts, ideas, sketches and not least detailed discussions as Francesco made the map drawings. Joe Dever will not be around to see these maps in print, but we know for certain that he loved the result and was looking forward to them. Now both Joe Dever and his creations belong to the ages.\nVincent Lazzari\nWhen we at \u00c5skf\u00e5geln started our collaboration with Joe Dever back in 2013, he described Vincent as a real life Indiana Jones. That is a both cool and apt description for a man that has the responsibility to uphold the integrity of all things Lone Wolf. Every detail is fact checked, in order to be consistent with all descriptions from official Lone Wolf material from all platforms. We are fortunate to have Vincent aboard as part of our Lone Wolf team.\nOlle Sahlin\nOlle is one of the true icons of the Swedish Gaming Scene. He worked as an editor at \u00c4ventyrsspel, the company that made roleplaying games as hit in Sweden as Dungeons & Dragons made them in the rest of the world. Before Olle took on the full time gig of editing all of their prestigious titles, Lone Wolf included, he was tagged for the translation of the choose your own adventure books for Lone Wolf that Joe Dever conquered the world with back then. Now Olle has gone full circle, translating Lone Wolf for \u00c5skf\u00e5geln. But rest assured, almost any high profile Swedish gaming project is bound to have Olle somewhere in the credits. He is one of Sweden\u2019s best and most beloved translators, LARP photographers and so much more.\nLukas Thelin\nEven though The Sommerlund City Maps at its core is all about the maps Francesco Mattioli creates for Lone Wolf, we would be amiss not to mention Lukas Thelin. Lukas is an integral part of \u00c5skf\u00e5geln and has been our in house lead illustration artist for many years now. He has made so many stunning illustrations for Lone Wolf over the years that we might just include a few of them as stretch goals or add ons during this campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project the risks are primarily time related. The good news is that the maps are already drawn and the English editions are ready for print, and we have a good idea of how long it will take, from the printer to your home. The Swedish editions will take a few weeks longer, since they require attention to detail when Francesco makes the changes in the text layers. \n\nWe are aware that add ons and stretch goals are possible time sinks, so we will make sure not to add anything that will require a lot of additional extra work at this stage. Since we do not want to slow the delivery down in any way, you will instead be facing possible add ons in the form of additional maps or artwork, already made and thus just as ready for print. Or, if this campaign goes really well, our commitment to stay focused on producing more gorgeous city maps for other parts of Magnamund in the future. If we do, those stretch goals will not affect what you receive for backing us this time around, but it will give you something to look forward to!\n\nThis project is basically printer ready. We are so close to print that we are even prepared to jump the gun if we are off to a flying start. It would be spectacular to give all who come to the GothCon gaming convention in Gothenburg, Sweden, the chance to get their maps signed by Francesco Mattioli. He is our Guest of Honor at the convention.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 10 or more", "title": "Support", "descp": "You want to support the maps being done.

For some reason it is not the hour long one.  You can view that HERE.\nRundown #14: THANK YOU ALL for your support! Each of you has made this a far better project than we ever hoped and shown once again that Castles & Crusades is the go to RPG! This turned into a fantastic success! Now to get to work! Lots of hard, wonderful work. Thank you again!\nBONUS: This past Saturday we did some warehouse/mailroom cleaning and we have a few hundred Classic Monsters left. Everyone who pledges $75 or more, receives one in your package!\nCastles & Crusades has enjoyed 14 years of continuous publication. In that time, you\u2019ve seen a mountain of books, adventures and supplements roll across your table. Of them all, two stand out as essential (four if you are a die- hard fan): The Players Handbook and Monsters & Treasure. We recently reprinted the Players Handbook (seventh printing) and now, Monsters & Treasure is up for its fifth printing.\nThis time we would like to do something a little different, but to do that, we are going to need your help.\nIn our 14 years together, Castles & Crusades has created a mountain of monsters, and a smaller mountain of treasure: the majority of which lie in published works outside Monsters & Treasure. This makes playing the game a little more challenging, and sometimes, just a little aggravating. CKs (GMs) have to struggle with a veritable mountain of books to track down and find the monster they seek. Some have entered the digital age, using these books on a tablet, or phone or on the TLG Portal and are able to access them a little quicker, but for many the hunt has become time consuming and distracting. Too many RPG books makes for difficult play.\nTime to Tighten Up the Game!\nOur goal is to tighten things up just a little and make one massive reference book for you to use at your table. To do that, we need to round up all the monsters from the extensive C&C library and bring them into one book. This is what we have in mind: Monsters & Treasure, Classic Monsters, Mystical Companions, published adventures like Shadows of a Halfling Hall (looking at you, Bag-o-Bones!), Amazing Adventures Manual of Monsters, Codex Celtarum, Codex Germania, Codex Nordica, Codex Classicum, Codex Slavorum, Haunted Highlands and all the other manifold publications where monsters creep and crawl, fly and charge from the pages and put them into one monstrous Full Color book.\n But Wait? Aren\u2019t you Missing Some books?\nWhat about the Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde? This book will remain its own publication. Though the monsters in it are designed for everyday use, it is tied to the massive Aihrde world setting (Codex of Aihrde and the Players Guide to Aihrde). These need to remain in a book with ease of access for those who brave to adventure in the Lands of Ursal.\nWhat about Tome of the Unclean? This book will also remain its own stand-alone product. We prefer to keep the filth of hell and unhinged chaos of the Abyss in their own realm, to be pulled out when your table slides into the madness of those insane worlds.\nSo why do we need your help? Aren\u2019t you going to reprint the Monsters & Treasure anyway?\nYes. There will be a fifth printing, no matter what. However, we don\u2019t want to simply reprint the book. We want to make it better.\nThis is where you come in. This is going to be a massive task. Right now, Monsters & Treasure is a color book, and needs to remain one. However, all those monsters that we want to include in it are black and white, we need them to be given the full color treatment. This means lots of work for several artists. Monsters that are duplicates or near duplicates will have to be reconciled. This is a lot of work for content editors. Everything will need to be laid out again. This is lots of work for graphics guys! And we want to include more art, some of these pictures need replaced, others need art!\nAll this added content will increase the Monsters & Treasure, 5th printing to a whopping 350 pages, at least.\nIts going to be a herculean task. And to bring it to pass, we are going to need your help!\nTo that end we are calling for a muster of Knights, Gamers, Enthusiasts, Grognards, Trolls and all the great hosts from all across the community to join us, pledge and help us make your game even better!\nWhat Rewards Your Pledge Reaps!\nPledge $19 and Receive\nMonsters & Treasure, 5th Printing, 350 pages (est.), Full Color.

Well, not entirely, as you\u2019re still in the good old days! Brought to you by Castles & Crusades, the first RPG that worked to capture the essence of play that Mr. Gygax and crew managed to do back in the 1980s! Well, we are following in his footsteps again with the C&C Monsters & Treasure Compendium/Binder. This 3\u201d binder will reflect the same quality that all TLG products do, and be manufactured of stout board, with 2\u201d slant d mounts that will hold up to 480 sheets of paper! Its going to be a keeper!\n A Note on the Special Collector's Books\nThese are highly crafted books, with dual embossed foil stamps, raised hubs on the spine, page marker, \"onion\" type page insert, with your names stamped on the front cover. Some of you may have picked up the Players Handbook in the PH7 Kickstarter, for a little less than we are asking here, but as you know from that Kickstarter we ended up upgrading from a different style of book.\nYou can see more about what this book will look like here in this video. You can purchase them here (there are only a few left).\n  We know diving in and supporting the 5th printing of any book\u2026even one that is going to be double its normal size\u2026is a tough decision and a heavy commitment. So, we want to make this worth your while. If you pledge now, and help us spread the word, as soon as we exceed out target goal, we\u2019ll include the following items!\n$10,000: Monsters & Treasure: Achieved!

A digital copy for $45.00 backer level, print and digital for $75+ backer levels.\n $500: Encounter Challenge: 17 Encounters Achieved! For every $500 we raise from this point going forward (starting at $20,000), we will take one monster from the Monsters & Treasure and design and write an encounter for it. We'll compile these into a PDF and release a digital version to everyone at the $19 level and above. If there are enough of them, we'll print it and ship it with your book for those who pledge $45 and above! Each encounter will be 1-2 pages long, include lead-up to, events surrounding, the monster and its peculiar habits, treasure and experience point value.\nBonus Book: Achieved! This past weekend we cleaned out the warehouse and mail room (way overdue) and have found that we have a few hundred Classic Monsters book left. As this book is being absorbed by Monsters & Treasure, we will discontinue it. So everyone who pledges $75 and above receives a free copy of Classic Monsters. It is hardback, black and white and will be on a first come, first serve basis, while supplies last. IF you have already pledges at 75 and above, you are already getting one!\n$22,000: Monster List Supplement: Achieved!

If you are, the quick down and dirty is this: Castles & Crusades is an easy to learn, fast paced, table top role playing game that allows you to play one of 13 classes and any one of these races; dwarf, human, elf, halfling, half elf or half orc. It's stream-lined attribute check system (the SIEGE Engine) is the driving mechanic that allows your character to try almost anything they want to try with a simple role of a d20! It's fun for all ages, requires almost no set up and playable by anyone, almost anywhere (we wouldn\u2019t recommend playing on a surf board for instance).\nIf you want to know more follow this link: Castles & Crusades!\nYou can also join the Society and the Knights of the Crusade by following this link: SOCIETY.\nYou can also download the quick start rules that we released at ReaperCon last year.

(Pledge manager will be available for backers.)\nWe at Black Scrolls Games are working on our products because they make our work easier as a Game Master, and game sessions are more enjoyable with them. We\u2019ve forged all of our experience and knowledge we collected as Game Masters and 3D artists in the past years into these tiles and we hope you will enjoy them at least as much as we enjoyed working on them. If you still have questions, please read the FAQs or write to us in the comment section, we will try to reply you as soon as we can.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nAlthough we funded Black Scrolls Games, our own company, a year ago, we have eight years of experience in the tabletop game business. We know that making a set takes time and releasing a new product is very risky for a small business like us. With the help of Kickstarter, it will be easier for us to manage our work and our other processes because we will see how many customers are interested in our gaming tiles and how many pieces we have to produce exactly. Also, with the help of the comment sections, we will know what you need.\n\nShipping \nIf you select a reward level that contains printed physical tiles, too, then there will be a shipping fee on the tiles. Although the best option would be a free shipping, unfortunately, these tiles are not lightweight things. We use the printing and shipping service of OneBookShelf (we worked with them many times before), that is why we can keep our price low and provide you the best quality in the meantime. \nBecause the tiles will be printed in the U.S., the fee will be the lowest for U.S. and Canadian customers, and a little bit higher for everyone else. If you select a higher reward level and/or more add-ons then we will ship the sets together and shipping fee will be lower per set (compared to separate shipping). \nWe have wider space to manage our revenue with the digital releases, so we can offer free shipping to the U.S. and even Canadian customers (and lowered shipping to everyone else) at higher reward levels!\n  We hope that with your help we can make those products you deserve as a Game Master.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe already released 25 larger and smaller products as Black Scrolls Games since we started our company one and a half year ago and more than 100 products working with other publishers in the past eight years. We managed long projects, too, (some of them were 2 years long) and learned how to deliver on time and how to develop a product from scratch. Our experience of publishing and releasing products will help us to bring these products to you after this Kickstarter campaign. \nFrom the other side, we are working with proven printing and shipping service together which guarantee that there will not be any problem with the fulfillment process. \nMany of the elements of this project are already tested and designed and because of this, we don't see any reason for delay. If anything comes up we will let you know and tell you how we will handle and solve it. \nWe would like to tell you while this is our first self-run Kickstarter project here, it is not the first we helped to design and manage, so this process is not unfamiliar to us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE WATCHER", "descp": "Welcome aboard!\nSelect this reward level if you would like to support this campaign.

You have made the book far more than we ever had hoped! Trollzah!\nWHAT IS TOME OF THE UNCLEAN?\nTome of the Unclean is a monster source book for Castle & Crusades that includes a host of evil creatures. Divided up along the traditional lines of demons and devils, the Tome includes all your favorites and more. From the Demogorgon to Asmodeus and all the cohorts of hell and the abyss. Also included are a host of devils and demons from the world of Aihrde.\nAll with the amazing art of Jason Walton and Peter Bradley.\nSpecs: Right now the book stands at 112 pages, with about another 10 pages of monsters forthcoming and will eventually retail, in hardcover format, for $29.99.\nPURPOSE OF THE KICKSTARTER\nRight now, we intend to print this book in house as a softcover book. However, we would love to see this book join the rest of our books in the C&C line as a full hardcover book and expand aspects of the book we never intended, turning it from a simple monster book into something much more (see below).\nWHERE WE ARE TODAY\nThe book is largely written and much of the art is finished. We have only a dozen or so monsters to add. Creatures like the Lemure, the Solicitor and others. These will all be added to Tome regardless. One a day for each day of the Kickstarter (weekends might get muddled).\nWHAT WE WANT TO ADD\nSteve took up work on the Tome about mid-stride, while he was re-writing the Codex of Aihrde. What unfolded in the Codex opened up new vistas for him while thinking about the Tome. It occurred to him that the Twin Planes need to be more approachable, to allow players to dig into them and CKs to run them like never before. With that in mind, he's penned notes on just how to do that:\nThe Twin Planes both need to be expanded, with appropriate descriptions and the role of demons and devils that dwell there. We would like to expand on the roles, armies, designs and fortifications of the major devils and demons of both planes.\nJust surviving in the Twin Planes is never easy. How does one find food, water, or shelter? What are the mundane physical aspects of the Twin Planes.\nThe Flora of the Twin Planes, with a discussion on druids.\nClimate and Environs.\nTraveling.\nHow encounters might unfold and what it's like to adventure there. How to bring the chaos, madness, and suffering of hell to the game table.To include effects on the abyssal chaos.\nIt was suggested to him by multiple people, including Mark Sandy and Torsten Olafi, that the book needs a random demon generator, allowing for the chaos of the Abyss.\nWith another great suggestion, Torsten Olafi suggested expanding on the role of demons/devils in the campaign, what are their motivations, how to integrate these highly intelligent creatures into the game.\nPlayable Map of hell.\nABOUT THE TOME OF THE UNCLEAN\nTome of the Unclean has been available in a digital format for some time, or at least sections of it. The book originally penned by Kim Hartsfield and was released in serial digital format. Stephen Chenault (C&C PhB, CKG, all things Aihrde) took over the writing last year, adding a host of demons and devils, some traditional, others of his own creation (echoes of his dreaded campaigns in Aufstrag). He is presently going over the Tome revising monsters (making them a little more powerful), adding content and reorganizing some of the entries.\nMINIATURES\nThis is the prototype of a series of downloadable miniatures designed for your 3D printer, that we are working on. They are based on monsters from Tome of the Unclean. It has a ways to go, but we will get there. This Kickstarter is the perfect place to showcase it and the other nefarious beasts of the Twin Planes! It is available in the $59 and $125 pledge levels.\nLEATHER VERSION\nWe've altered our process from the previous leather versions. We are now included embossing, stamped, marker and more. Our first and recently shipped turned out beautiful. Tome of the Unclean will receive a similar treatment. The $125 level only.\nSUBSCRIBERS AND OBS BACKERS\nCheck your email. Check your email.

You\u2019ve heard about the plan to provide game specifics (\u2018crunch\u2019) for 10 game systems. But what IS the Setting really? What\u2019s there now, and what\u2019s happening soon? Good question. It\u2019s complicated. For the long version click HERE; summary below.\nHistory: This continent is the original home of all demi-humans, who know how to get along with each other and with nature. Humans arrived, tried to conquer the place, but were forced to compromise because they didn\u2019t have an edge. Their realm, Empyrea, has evolved for 3 centuries. Their kings followed a three-prong strategy of cooperation: Minimize technology, promote magic (obeying the gods), Work with nature and the planet for long-term stability and health, and Support knowledge, the arts, and quality of life; avoid misuse of wealth and power.\nPlace: Empyrea is a rectangle. The left side is a coast with sea monsters. Mountains north, with giants. East is blocked, impassible terrain. Deepwood south, with creatures, then tribes, then evil armies -- and they\u2019re planning to visit soon.\nBelow is the primitive digital map that has been available to online players since 1992. Darlene is now rendering it in her unique style, Anna is transforming that into 3D imagery, and Alyssa is detailing cities and towns. Guest authors are detailing locations... Inns, ships, shops, and more.\nOnline campaign map 1992-present\nPeople: The dwur claim the land below, but most dislike sunlight, so noniz handle their surface business. The olve claim the woodlands, and many hobniz are in the gourmet trade near towns. Other \u2018niz (brownies and sprites and many more) are about, as are the Others, various odd monstrous races and variations.\nAction: Upcoming issues of the realm will emerge as time passes. The call to arms will sound, and the fate of the realm will be decided \u2013 perhaps by your characters! Will you run and hide, or are you a real Hero?\nHow To Play\n\nStart: Either your characters grew up here, or they popped in from another place. We\u2019ll provide guidelines for both, and three kits for suggested local character backgrounds (urban, farm, borderlands). In a starting adventure the characters meet and head out seeking fame and fortune.\nYour Stuff: You bring your characters, your game system, your style. Magic, monsters, gods? Use whatever you like. Empyrea will be the backdrop to your stories, just some new names at first. More is there when you\u2019re ready for it.  \nYou seem to be a serious hobby gamer. Consider this a useful tool, a 'second home'. This is a complicated fantasy campaign world, and we can only describe a small part of it in advance. So if you have questions, please post them on any of several sites available. We\u2019re still building that part of things, so bear with us, and help us grow!  \nQueen Nuana and King John IV\n  With the Quick Start Guides (presenting character backgrounds from city, farm, and wilderness life) and starter Adventures, you\u2019ll be playing immediately and learning fast.

As you begin to step onto the trail, you hear a guttural and deep laughing sound followed by a scream.\nAnd thus with such simple beginnings, the characters find themselves embroiled with deific wars which have raged since the fall of the Dragon.\nAn adventure designed for 3-5 player characters between levels 4 and 6.\nWhat is Beneath the Black Moon?

At which point do the pawns control the board or fall, as sacrifice, to protect bishops, knights, kings and queens. Navigating the miasma of Bergholt\u2019s avaricious and power hungry denizens is a precarious balancing over pits of fire and brimstone. Tread carefully for every friend is an enemy and every enemy a friend.\nYour Game, Your World, Inzae, Aihrde\nDavis has created the world of Inzae. This is where all of his adventures take place. Much of that material was released in the first Kickstarter and the primer is below, you can download it for free. Beneath the Black Moon takes place in the city of Bergholt. BUT if you want to play Beneath the Black Moon in your home brew world or even in the world of Aihrde, all you'll need is a city to move the adventure to...but it should be a pretty violent city.\nThe series so far:\nDeath in the Treklant\nBy Shadow of Night\nBeneath the Black Moon\nAbout the Inzae Castle Keepers Screens: These screens are made with our signature board, and consist of 2 two-panels screens.

Forefront is the home of the Agleburstin Konzern. A wooden sign has been hammered upon the lintel above the door. Upon this are painted a shovel and pick, crossed and poised over a talus mound. A row of windows stretches up above the door, all shuttered, as if several one-eye beasts sat atop one another and shut their eyes to the world.\nMinfrit de Balgusser had been expecting someone to answer his request.

Taken completely by surprise, the town\u2019s soldiery scrambled to action, manning the walls, calling the citizens to arms and setting their defenses in order. The desperate actions of these brave soldiers prevented the city from collapsing immediately and the walls and gates were held. But before the sun set, the flaming kettles of oil descended upon the city like a fiery rain. Panic ensued!\nThe characters are caught in a hellish inferno!

Magic and the supernatural laid waste to the creations of humankind, with unearthly beings seeking to take our world for their own. Around every corner hid a new terror to devour the helpless and prey upon the weak. Humanity nearly ceased to exist.\nHeroes rose from the ashes of the old world. Some used magic. Others had advanced technology (sometimes alien in nature), while some unleashed the power of the mind, and still, others wielded dark forces. A mighty kingdom, greater than any other, rose to stem the tide and crush the monstrosities: the Coalition States (CS). Under their banner, humanity labored and fought to stamp out the Rifts-born menaces and carve out a chunk of North America for humans. A domain free from the grip of magic, the supernatural, and the inhuman. They built a towering fortress-city near the ruins of old Chicago, to wall out the magical and monstrous, and called it Chi-Town.\nAll around the mighty edifice grew a massive slum of cobbled together hovels and decrepit shacks, as those seeking the protection of the Coalition States (CS) flocked to the new empire, only to find that the Coalition\u2019s doors were closed to nonhumans and magic users, and unable to accommodate the human multitudes seeking protection. But even here in the lawless slums, life is better than in the savage wilderness all around. So in the \u2018Burbs they wait, with hopes and dreams of entry into the great city.\nAs happens all too often in history, the Coalition States (CS), the self-proclaimed saviors of humanity, armed with high ideals and good intentions, soon turn into a tyrant regime armed with advanced robotics and technology. The Coalition now alternates between exploiting the residents of the \u2018Burbs and persecuting them.\nWith their legions of faceless Dead Boys, armies of killer Skelebots, and packs of terrifying Dog Boys, the Coalition rules the \u2018Burbs with an iron fist. Coalition purges flush out and slaughter D-Bees, magic users and other \u201cenemies\u201d of the Coalition States. They may even raze to the ground entire sections of the slums. Such is Coalition justice.\nWho would dare to stand up against such a power?\nYou!\nIn the Rifts\u00ae Board Game, you and your fellow heroes strive to outwit, outmaneuver, and take down the Coalition forces persecuting one of the \u2018Burbs. You must prevail against overwhelming odds to defeat the campaign of tyranny being run by the CS Mission Director.\nRifts\u00ae the Board Game comes with 20 finely detailed 32mm miniatures depicting the Heroes of Lazlo and Coalition Forces of Dead Boy and Dog Boy squads. Included are all the character cards, tokens and dice required to play, and a unique board game approach featuring a 24 by 30 inch double-sided combat map with a 1 inch grid instead of the traditional, hard game board, allowing you to play on any commercially available map!\nThere are also unique, set-on objective buildings and additional cardboard set-on terrain pieces, and variable maps to provide players an endless array of possible setups. Rogue Heroes Publishing is passionate about games, so we like to offer unique and layered gaming experiences that provide you with options and leave you wanting to play again and again.\nThe Rifts\u00ae Board Game offers three distinct modes of play:\n1. Campaign Mode: 1-5 players take on the roles of the Heroes of Lazlo, a group of valiant champions who defend the innocent and struggle to break the Coalition\u2019s stranglehold on the \u2018Burbs. And one, single player acts as the CS Mission Director, who strives to keep the peace in the violent, lawless slums and take down troublemakers like your heroes.\n2. Skirmish Mode: Two players in pitched competition against each other\u2019s rival squad. Pit the Heroes of Lazlo against the Coalition Army, or a squad of heroes against heroes, or CS forces against CS forces to see which commander is the superior leader.\n3. Head to Head Mode: Two players do away with the board and miniatures to compete in a vicious, face to face card game to see who comes out victorious. A fun, fast, abstract card game that is easy to grasp and takes only 15-20 minutes. Can be played almost anywhere.\nHeroes, can you defeat the forces of the Coalition States?\nCoalition patriots, can you stamp out all resistance in the \u2018Burbs?\nPlay the Rifts\u00ae Board Game and find out!\nHere is the first of the gameplay videos we will be posting to this Kickstarter. A quick overview of the game's core mechanic\n  Rifts\u00ae fans take note:\nIf you have enjoyed playing Rifts\u00ae at any time in your life, you will love the Rifts\u00ae Board Game. Not only do the detailed miniatures feature many of your favorite, iconic characters in dynamic action poses, but the rules, artwork, and method of play truly capture the look and feel of the Rifts\u00ae role-playing game. When you are done with a game, you will feel like you just played the Rifts\u00ae RPG, and in about 90 minutes! Fun to play. A must for collectors and fans of the RPG, and anyone who enjoys an immersive, board game experience.\nThe Rifts\u00ae Origin Story\nRifts\u00ae is a popular pen and paper role-playing game that exploded onto the scene in 1990. It's multi-genre blend of science fiction, fantasy and horror set in an alien, post-apocalyptic, future Earth made it an instant hit. An overnight sensation, the initial press run of 10,000 copies sold out in three weeks. The Rifts\u00ae RPG has since become known to millions of gamers, spawned more than 90 RPG titles, and has been optioned by Walt Disney Pictures for development into a live action movie by Jerry Bruckheimer Films.\nNow, for the first time ever, Rifts\u00ae is being made into a miniatures board game. Brought to life by game designer Carmen Bellaire, long-time Rifts\u00ae fan, and his top sculptors from around the world.\nThis game is endorsed 100% by Palladium Books and Rifts\u00ae creator Kevin Siembieda. \u201cI cannot think of anyone better or more qualified than Carmen to bring Rifts\u00ae to life as a miniatures board game. I have loved everything I have seen from Rogue Heroes. This game is amazing and I hope Rifts\u00ae fans support and spread the word about this labor of love. The Rifts\u00ae Board Game is everything I could have hoped it would be. Best of luck to Carmen and his crew.\u201d \u2013 Kevin Siembieda\n  Based on my experience and research, we will be charging shipping after the conclusion of the Kickstarter based on the actual costs incurred to ship the rewards. We will collect your shipping information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is done to accommodate each of our backers and tailor the shipping cost to each individual backer, as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nDon\u2019t get caught by surprise later \u2013 look up your region now and add the estimated shipping cost to your pledge! That way, the extra funds will show up in the pledge manager and can be applied to shipping once we know the exact amount it will cost to ship your rewards.\nWhenever we can, we will ship your rewards at our own cost to international hubs who will ship your orders from there. For example, we will ship to our hub in the UK who then ships to our EU backers.\nBelow is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4 kg dimensional weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on the weight and size of your package, and variables such as unlocked stretch goals and more items than just the game and a few Add-Ons.\nUSA: $12-$15 to most States. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 (to most cities)\nUNITED KINGDOM and most of the EU: $15-$30\nEASTERN EUROPE (Poland, Bosnia, Croatia, etc.): $40-$60\nGREECE & TURKEY: $70\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nBRAZIL: $75-$95\nLATIN AMERICA and MOST OTHER COUNTRIES: $50-$80\n*SORRY, WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely mean increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally due to the size of each package.\nPlease note that while we will do our best to get your Kickstarter rewards to you in a very timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before everyone else, or before the product makes it into distribution in your own country, or before it is made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We expect the majority of backers will receive their rewards before the general release, but we cannot guarantee that to 100% of our backers. There may be some who do not. It could take longer for some packages to arrive at one location than another. We hope that the stretch goals, exclusives, and rewards you can get during the Kickstarter help to make up for any such possible delivery issues. If this is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project. Wait until the items are available at retail. We appreciate your support and thank you for your understanding.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges, click HERE.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat makes us different?\n\nWith all Kickstarters come some risks and challenges. While this is the first Kickstarter for Rogue Heroes, I have been an avid backer on Kickstarter since the beginning, either as Rogue Heroes or under my own name, and have seen both the successes and failures in the process. I have also done lengthy research into other Kickstarters as well in an attempt to minimize your risks. The primary areas of risk are:\n\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Our hope is to deliver far sooner than this, but we want a good margin for error in the process. We have taken as many steps as possible to mitigate any potential delays before they happen. Having a large portion of the game assets completed before we launched the campaign (much of which we previewed on our Facebook page), with the rest in development, will allow us to move to manufacturing in a timely fashion. And having the manufacturing and shipping organized, and the costs well in hand, should keep unexpected surprises from cropping up during the process. Please note that due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different parts of the world may receive their rewards sooner or later than others. I hope you understand.\n\nWe have gone to great lengths to ensure reliable manufacturing options, and we set what we believe is a realistic timeline. We at Rogue Heroes believe in sticking to deadlines, and have an even greater belief in transparency. As such, we will ensure our backers are informed about our progress and any challenges we may face every step along the way.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe are happy to refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, you are committed to backing the Rifts\u00ae Board Game. Please remember, you are backing a project, not buying a product. We are a start-up company, so once we have a successful Kickstarter with your help, those funds are committed to paying artists, sculptors, manufacturers, etc., and we will no longer be able to offer refunds.\n\nThis Kickstarter project is being funded in USD, and any refunds will also be paid in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter project, you acknowledge and agree that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change, and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active. We do not anticipate this to be the case, but we reserve that right.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that Rogue Heroes has fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our sole discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us at a later date and we are able to confirm your pledge even though the 8 week window has expired. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and shipping, which can lead to delays, so we need your cooperation and prompt response in confirming your pledge. We do not intend to delay this project, so if your pledge confirmation arrives to us too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nWhen you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your pledge rewards as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for said shipment, and that you are responsible for any and all import duties or any other duties and fees that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring that the address you provide is deliverable by normal methods. Please note we are not able to ship to P.O. boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project. Wait for it to be released to retail outlets.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHTS AND TRADEMARKS\n\n\u00a9 2017 Palladium Books, Inc. All rights reserved, worldwide.

You\u2019ve probably played several of them, if not a veritable host of them. You\u2019ve hacked your way through the simple, and you\u2019ve trudged your way through the complex. They all offer a little something, it's why you keep playing.\nAs you know, all FRPGs are driven by some mechanic. Some are highly intricate, others very simple. You use them to establish the game you want to play. From fast paced to high tactical combat rules to opposed checks on interactions with NPCs. It\u2019s all part of the gaming landscape you\u2019ve helped create.\nI\u2019m the same as you. I\u2019ve tried a host of games and a host of rule sets. My game of choice was always AD&D\u2026I played it even after we released Castles & Crusades. I only stopped my AD&D game when the designers (both regular players at my table) revolted and said no more AD&D until I at least tried C&C once. I reluctantly agreed.\nI\u2019ve never gone back.\n*The above photo was taken at All Things Fun in West Berlin, New Jersey, a fantastic store! Check it out if you are in the area.\nIt\u2019s Your Game! Take it!\nYou\u2019ll find with C&C that the game is easy to play, but more importantly is its versatility. You can take your house rules and drop them right on top of the C&C mechanic (the Siege Engine) and keep on playing. You are in control. Take the advantage/disadvantage system from 5E and use it with C&C. There\u2019s nothing stopping you.\nWhat\u2019s even better, because the whole game is driven by attribute checks that have only loose guidelines, the game master chooses what attribute check the player rolls. If they want the wizard to swim better, make the character roll an intelligence check to swim the river. It\u2019s your game. Take it.\nHow does the Siege Engine Work?\nYou are already familiar with Castles & Crusades.\nYou\u2019ll find the same classes, races, attributes and many of the same monsters as in most other games.\nTo succeed at any action, you need to make an attribute check (unless the CK deems it doesn\u2019t need one)\nThere are two types of attributes: Primary & Secondary\nPrimary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12 on a d20. Secondary have a base chance to succeed of 18. The CK adds a challenge level based on hit dice and other circumstance. The character adds their attribute bonus and level to their roll.\nYou are playing C&C.\nIt's fast, versatile and open. Allowing you to make it as complex or as simple as you desire.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIt\u2019s easy to use for the whole community. This cuts out you having to set up accounts on the TLG website. Reserve your copy today with one easy step.\nENJOY PETER BRADLEY'S ART? Check out his coloring book! On Kickstarter NOW!\nCollector's Cloth Edition\nWe are going to print a collector's edition, signed and numbered on onion skin inside the book. Produced with a Skivertex Vellin Cloth Cover, with Embossed titling. Also has an embossed silk screen depicting art from many editions on the cover, a ribbon marker and your name stamped on the front cover!\nAbout the Alternate Cover\nWe are going to give Jason Walton a shout and to do a new, alternate cover for us. He's the guy who brought you this cover:\n What is Castles & Crusades? \nCastles & Crusades is one of the longest running Table Top RPGs on the market today. Castles & Crusades is a fantasy role playing game where players create characters based on the very simple easy to follow rules of the C&C Players Handbook and conduct adventures run by a game master, the Castle Keeper. It's fun, easy, and offers countless hours of entertainment from role playing to magic wielding and sword swinging...all from the comfort and safety of your dining room table! Learn more HERE!\nA Little Background\nThirteen years ago, in 2004-2005, we launched what was then a ground-breaking fantasy RPG. Going against a decade of game design, that saw fantasy RPGs develop ever more intricate rules systems, we decided to turn the horse around. Desiring a simple, fast-paced game we developed an attribute check system (first called the EGG system, but later renamed to the SIEGE Engine) that was just that. Everything non-combat related was solved by attribute checks, frequently chosen by the Castle Keeper (GM). What followed was an insanely easy game, that one could learn to play in a matter of minutes. It allowed for rapid play, particularly in combat situations, but more importantly by releasing the constraints of rules it opened up the table to the imagination of all concerned. Now, anything was possible.\nSix printings later\u2026not including the starter sets, White Box, Flip Books and countless digital copies sold\u2026Castles & Crusades is going stronger than ever.\nWe\u2019ve sold out of the 6th printing and moving on to the 7th printing.\nThis book will go to print in the next few weeks, but we are here offering it to the Kickstarter community for as low a price as we can manage. This allows our old guard to pick it up if they desire, and new people to buy in if they\u2019ve always wanted to or are just hearing about us. It\u2019s our way of thanking the gaming community all for these years of support!\nWHAT\u2019S CHANGED?  \nThat is the inevitable question that many long-time fans are going to ask. Almost nothing. We\u2019ve corrected a few typos, put some class lists in alphabetical order and moved a little text. But beyond that this book will be the same book as the 6th printing. The cover itself is part of a larger 4-panel piece that includes the Castle Keepers Guide, Monsters & Treasure and Adventurers Backpack, so changing it is not in the cards.\nHowever, to mark this momentous occasion we are offering an all Cloth Edition of the book.

Please Note: We try to keep shipping costs at a minimum. While this is mainly a book oriented Kickstarter, any add-ons or extra books or merchandise (if any is offered) may cause the shipping price to rise, especially if the order is international (out of the US). Please contact productsupport@trolllord.com if you have any questions about shipping before you pledge.\nTrack the Players Handbook on Kicktraq!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLarge books such as this one are hard to print and bind and we have to choose our printers with care.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges we face is creating such a large book and maintaining the quality of the printing and binding. In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in. This will cost more than the usual printing so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves.\n\nWe are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Show Support", "descp": "Show your support for bare-knuckles role playing!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "PH with Standard Cover", "descp": "A print and digital copy of the Players Handbook, 7th printing, with the standard cover (the one on there now). *Shipping charged at end of Kickstarter if applicable.

Like their predecessors, the highly acclaimed Dunes of Desolation and Fields of Blood, Mountains of Madness and Marshes of Malice are black and white, 225+ page supplements that build upon real world details and their gaming applications to provide all of the essentials and extras to run campaigns set in one of these remarkable biomes.\nThese huge Tomes are all well-researched and use real-world information tailored to meet fantasy roleplaying rules that create a feel of \"really being there\" in each terrain type. For example, we engaged a professional mountain guide, Nate Paul, to work with us on Mountains--so the travel and skill rules were in part developed by a real-life mountaineer!\nThe two new books include:\nMountains of Madness\nMountains of Madness naturally focuses its attention on mountains, the mighty, stone behemoths that soar into the heavens. In particular, it details the Stoneheart Mountains, renowned as the spine of the Lost Lands Campaign Setting and the backdrop for other legendary adventures including The Slumbering Tsar Saga and Sword of Air, all from Frog God Games. \nMarshes of Malice\nMarshes of Malice examines the semi-aquatic world that straddles the open seas and the wholly terrestrial with special emphasis on previously unexplored or underdeveloped regions in the Lost Lands Campaign Setting. Both supplements introduce new natural and manmade hazards, innovative feats, equipment, alchemical substances, magic items, spells and archetypes that can aid or hinder brave mountaineers aspiring to conquer the majestic peaks and intrepid adventurers endeavoring to tame the feral wetlands. Wondrous illustrations accompany the frightful, new denizens that call these lands home. \nWhat you get inside\nMountains of Madness features an expansive prologue that describes the rustic town of Miners\u2019 Refuge along with four interconnected adventures that take characters from 3rd to 9th levels and flesh out the Stoneheart Mountains region with extensive details about the fabled Dwarven strongholds of Erod Flan and Tyr Whin. Although designed as an adventure path, the quartet can be run independently as well. \nMarshes of Malice, on the other hand, include three completely autonomous adventures that take the characters on terrifying journeys into the depths of the bleakest swamps and the bottomless chasm of the darkest souls. These horrific tales occur in the dreaded Dyrgalas Fens, which appeared in the Quests of Doom adventure \"Death in Dyrgalas\", the Dragonmarsh Lowlands, which is touched upon in Rappan Athuk and the introduction of the previously unexplored Wytch\u2019s Bog. Despite the fact that the adventures take place in locales that appear in the Lost Lands Campaign Setting, the extensive scientific and game mechanics regarding these two environments can be applied to all mountainous and wetlands campaigns regardless of their setting. Likewise, with a few minor adjustments, the adventures can be effectively run anywhere.  \nWith the release of these two sourcebooks for Pathfinder, GMs and players alike can incorporate a wealth of knowledge and groundbreaking ideas to breathe fresh imagination and insight into any excursion to the summits of the highest peaks and the bowels of the dreariest swamps. All it takes is one courageous first step. \nSo pledge to today help Frog God Games provide your players some unsafe spaces!        \nADDED BONUS\nAt funding all backers get a the PDF that started it all, Glades of Death!\n\nA Druid's Revenge Can your PCs make it through the forest on the way to their final destination? Will they be ensnarled in the mystery of dreaded ghoul wolves, or become entangled in a battle between druids and insects that is slowly destroying a small logging village in their way? Are your PCs strong enough to enter the Canyons of Arcuri? Perhaps, they are even bold enough to enter the private, forested demiplane of the mad druid Niavark.  \nRead the Leaves Make PCs fear the forest! Glades of Death\u2122 contains new spells, new feats, and a new look at skills and how to use them in the wilderness. Guidelines for the rapid creation of new fantasy forests are also provided along with new monsters and four generic forest-based adventures designed to help bring a campaign out of the dungeon and into the wilderness.  \nGetting Your Rewards\nPDF Reward Distribution  \nWe will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your pdf; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via email to backers. Our process is what gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment.  \nShipping for Physical Products \nThe shipping is collected in Backerkit. When our backerkit site for the project is ready you will receive an email. This is a separate communication than the Kickstarter survey. In that email you will receive the link to the site where you will be asked to verify your shipping information, your pledge rewards and checkout through their system. It is during this checkout that shipping cost is calculated and charged. \nAdd Ons\nOther books from the Perilous Vistas seemed appropriate, so we decided to discount the existing ones!\nFields of Blood-$25 hardcover and PDF, $10 PDF only add-on.\nThe endless fields of waving grains and scrub brush\u2014many see them as featureless wastes, places to be crossed in a journey with little to catch the eye or divert the attention, but these vast seas of grass play home to many terrible beasts, deadly challenges, and amazing tales all hiding just beneath the thin veneer of featureless expanses. Fields of Blood takes a close look at these lands often taken for granted as realms of excitement and mystery and injects them with new life.\nWith cultural elements and traditions taken from the American Great Plains, the African Savannah, and the Mongolian Steppes, Fields of Blood provides new rules for plains environments, hazards, travel, skills and feats, equipment, monsters, deities, spells, and archetypes. In addition, Fields of Blood includes three ready-to-play adventures for introducing your players into the endless expanse of the grassy sea with \u201cFeast of Fury\u201d, \u201cRed Wedding\u201d, and \u201cMadness Grows\u201d.\nFields of Blood provides rules and options for any plains campaign. While its adventures can easily be set in any plains campaign, they are, however, official Lost Lands setting adventures intended for characters of levels 1\u20137+. They include plains terrain, dungeon, and village encounters and are written for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nDunes of Desolation-$25 hardcover and PDF, $10 PDF only-add-on.\nIn a land where the sun relentlessly bakes its sandy surface, water is king. In the desert, the life-sustaining fluid is more valuable than the most precious metals, desirable gems and mightiest weapons. Most adventurers believe that the scarcity of water makes the desert an\ninhospitable place devoid of life, riches and challenges.\nThe incessant glare of a distant, roiling inferno, the intolerable heat of day, the monotonous expanses of sand and the fierce winds are enough to break the will of any man or beast, but natives and experienced adventurers know that the dunes conceal many secrets and treasures. Scratch a few feet beneath the surface and the wondrous ruins of lost cities miraculously come to life. Some of these settlements succumbed to the natural forces of the desert, while vengeful deities, demons or spirits condemned others to an eternity beneath the dunes.\nMarvelous oases abounding with life and mystery also dot the forbidding landscape. Those fortunate enough to discover these refuges are delighted to find fresh water, but danger often lurks amid the lush vegetation or beneath the surface of the water. Those intrepid souls hardy enough to brave the elements and explore the wonders of this harsh terrain are well-rewarded for their efforts.\nDead Man's Chest \n($40K stretch goal for hardcovers to be unlocked)-$28 Softcover/$10 PDF unless we hit the hardcover stretch goal!  \nNo place offers more adventure than the ocean. No dungeon is as deep, no jungle as full of exotic and dangerous life. Most folk spend their entire lives on dry ground, unaware that entire civilizations thrive beneath the waves, sometimes far more ancient and steeped in mystery than any on the world's upper surface. Though player characters (PCs) have long grown familiar with the air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed existed. The ocean offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing. Strange things exist down there, as perilous as they are compelling. Dead Man's Chest lays bare the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Within these pages are detailed rules for ship movement, as well as guidelines for underwater exploration, and three complete maritime adventures. At last there is a comprehensive source for sailing and the sea-packed with over 100 new magic items, monsters, feats, prestige classes, and spells.\nRazor Coast Party Pack Plus Dead Man's Chest!\nThe Razor Coast Party Pack (includes the softcover Pathfinder Dead Man's Chest) - $120\nIncludes the following-\nRazor Coast Hardcover Book  \n4 copies of the Freebooters Guide to the Razor Coast  \nHeart of the Razor Hardback Book\nPLUS Softcover Dead Man's Chest (this is Kickstarter exclusive and does not come with the party pack at the web store for the same price)\nFire as She Bears  \n$9 Hardcover, $5 PDF Add-on\nBuilding on the winning entries of a contest to create new rules, authors Lou Agresta and John Ling, with contributions from James MacKenzie, wrote a book to empower players and GMs to fight cinematic \u201cMaster and Commander\u201d style ship battles in Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry that stay true to the spirit of history and Age of Sail realities. This complete 96 page subsystem of ship-to-ship combat, includes over 35 new magic items for characters and ships, new feats, new uses for familiar skills, new weapons and equipment, new spells, and best of all? Roll up and equip an Age of Sail warship just like you\u2019d design a new character \u2013 in as little as 30 minutes.\nStoneheart Valley $13 Hardcover/$10 PDF\nFrom Bill Webb and Clark Peterson's home campaign comes the old-school setting of The Lost Lands: Stoneheart Valley. For over a decade, fans of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games have been asking to see the world behind the adventures. And at long last, here is where it all began, in the Stoneheart Valley near the town of Fairhill. This mini-campaign was originally presented to the fans of Necromancer Games in three separate modules: \"The Wizard's Amulet\", \"The Crucible of Freya\", and \"The Tomb of Abysthor\". Frog God Games has taken the full series from the 3E version plus supplemental material previously available only online, and converted it all to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous Kickstarter programs in the past, including projects involving printed cards.

I started with the 1982-1994 carded figures (which can be viewed on the Yearbook page) and then moved into documenting the vehicle boxes, catalogs and offers, books, newsletters, puzzles, posters and more. All are accessible via the print and licensed tabs at 3DJoes.\nOnce the art is photographed and scanned, we digitally restore these files by removing creases, tears, price tags, hand writing and the like to create as clean an image as possible.\nDigital Art Restoration\nEnter 3DJoes posters.\nBefore long, I had collected and documented enough carded figures to start making posters. Back in 2014 I ran a kickstarter and funded printing of 3 new posters! These posters are still for sale, and proceeds help cover the $1,750 a year it costs to run 3DJoes. You can pick these up for $10 each through this kickstarter!\nEnter Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe, Volumes 1 \u2013 3!\nI fielded countless requests for a G.I.Joe art book since the first carded figure poster debuted. Most often people tell me they love the posters but they are running out of wall space. So, over the last two years I ran three kickstarters to print Accufoil Softcovers of Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 1 (1982-1983), Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 2 (1984-1985), and Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 3 (1986-1987)!\nCollecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volumes 1\u20133 (1982-1987) with Accufoil covers\n We delivered all three volumes on time as promised, thanks in large part to some fantastic print vendors and my local Triangle Joes who pitched in and helped me with fulfillment.\nTriangle Joes to the rescue!\nNow it\u2019s time for Collecting the Art of G.I.Joe, Volume 4!\nFlash forward a few months and thanks to Chad Hucal, we are ready to go to press with Volume 4! Volume 1 featured 62 unique pieces of art, Volume 2 featured 95, and Volume 3 featured 126. Volume 4 is bigger than ever, featuring 147 unique pieces of art! You can preview the entire book here. \nThe cover will once again be card stock with an AccuFoil print, and the 80# pages will be saddle stitched, so the two page 11x16\u201d spreads can lay flat and art will not be lost to the gutter! You\u2019ll be glad to know the price hasn\u2019t changed, we\u2019re holding the line at $35 for the Accufoil Softcover.\nCollecting the Art of G.I.Joe: Volume 4 (1988\u20131989) is ready to print!\n  The 3DJoes poster series continues!\nNow that all of the 1988-1989 artwork has been restored, it is time to continue the 3DJoes poster series! We will produce two new 24\u201dx36\u201d posters, one featuring the figures and another featuring the vehicles.\n1988-1989 Vehicles and 1988-1989 Figures\nHow about some pristine Catalog Art posters too?! \nThese two posters are very special. They feature the 1986 and 1987 catalog art like you\u2019ve never seen them before! We were able to secure two original Kodak Ecktachromes of the original catalog paintings. These are basically two super high resolution transparencies used back in the analog 80s to deliver high resolution artwork. We\u2019ve scanned these Ecktachromes and restored the scans to remove dust and any other unintended artifacts. The resulting posters will be a centerpiece of your collection.\nCatalog Art from 1986 and 1987!\n  STRETCH GOAL! Blast-off with a life-sized Defiant!\n Blast-off with a life-sized Defiant offset lithograph print! \nMany of you have asked for a life-sized Defiant box art print, so that's what we are going for next! The life-size Defiant print will measure 28.5\u201dx47\u201d just like the original box art. It will cost $4,558 to print. Add in 25% for shipping and 10% for Kickstarter fees and we'll need to raise another $6,276.25 to get there. Oversized lithographs are terribly expensive, but we are happy to try to make this happen. If you want to see this poster come to life, add $30 to your poster pledge and tell all of your like-minded friends about this project. Thanks and Yo JOE! \nPROJECT EXPENSES:\n$7,605 Volume 4 (offset interiors, foil cover, bagged, 650 copies) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $10,456.88\n$5,792 Four 24\u201dx36\u201d posters (1000 of each) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $7,964\nGOAL: $18,420.88 \n$4,558 Life Size 28.5\u201dx47\u201d Defiant (1000 prints) + 1/4 shipping + 10% Kickstarter fees = $6,276.25\nSTRECH GOAL: $24,688.13\n*Surprise* Your reward for scrolling to the end is the stretch goal spoiler! I'm setting the goal for this Kickstarter at $18,420, and have offered rewards featuring the first goal's deliverables. If we approach the third goal, all poster backers will be allowed to add a life sized Defiant poster to their order for just $30!  \nPlease have a look at the rewards, back this project today, and tell your friends to jump in too.\nThanks and Yo Joe!\nCarson", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges \nI have already successfully produced the Volume 1 book and six 24\u201dx36\u201d offset posters with two very reliable local vendors. I do not foresee any issues with getting all three of these new posters and books produced quickly and to the highest quality.\n\nTo see the progress of a previous poster, have a look at this album: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/3DJoes/photos/?tab=album&album_id=569139369809294\n\nA note about quality: these posters, like the six previously produced, will be professional grade. You will not be disappointed! Check out the specs below and my eBay feedback.\n\nPaper details: All 3DJoes posters are printed on 65 lb. sterling premium gloss paper stock. According to my printer, 65 pound paper is the thickest you can use and still roll them without creasing or damaging. It wont easily crease, pinch, or wrinkle. These posters are definitely frame worthy, but the paper is thick enough that if you just want to tack them up, that will work too.\n\nPrinting details: We use a four color printing process (CMYK), not digital. Four color prints are much higher quality than digital laser prints. To see behind the scenes at the printer, check out my \"3DJoes of the 80s\" album on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/3DJoes/photos/?tab=album&album_id=488035281253037\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "\"1988-1989 POSTERS\" (vehicles+figures)", "descp": "The 3DJoes poster series continues!

However, one night the situation changes when a storm wrecks a vessel near the island, with a human infant being the only survivor.\nIn this child the Shianti see a chance to help the people of Magnamund without breaking their vow to Ishir, and they raise the boy in the arts of magic, giving him the name Grey Star: the star as the symbol of hope, and grey for the white-grey streak the boy has in his dark hair.\nOnce his training is complete, Grey Star is sent out to retrieve the Moonstone, an ancient Shianti artefact, from the Daziarn, for only with its power can Shasarak be defeated.\nSOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 1) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\nThe first book of the series details Grey Stars travel to the Shadakine Empire and his desperate attempt to find a guide to lead him to the Shadow Gate.\n\nNow, more than 30 years later, this first gamebook is back with this deluxe, enlarged, hardback Collector's edition by Megara Entertainment we hope to fund on Kickstarter.\nAs the original pocket-sized interior 1985 illustrations by Paul Bonner could not be retrieved from the original publisher or from Paul himself, we decided at Megara Entertainment (with Joe Dever's blessing) to contact the mythical (and original) Lone Wolf artist Gary Chalk to re-illustrate the whole gamebook at a higher resolution (the Collector's Edition being larger).\nTo our pleasure, he agreed to re-illustrate entirely the book with all-new  interior drawings and a brand new cover for this Collector's Edition.\nThe result is truly amazing.

We have added a special bonus gamebook adventure at the end of this Collector's Edition, written by Scriptarium and approved/revised by Joe Dever & Ian Page.\nSo, to sum up, our deluxe gamebook will have the following features:\nLarge book size (same than for our other gamebooks previously published on our webstore or on Kickstarter) : 17 cm x 24.4 cm\nHardcover 105 gsm interior paper\nBrand new black-and-white interior illustrations by Gary Chalk, including fillers\nBrand new cover by Gary Chalk\nA brand-new bonus adventure.\nAll the up-to-date revisions of the gamebook text by Joe Dever, Ian Page and his team of experts, included in this ultimate edition.\nThank you for your support!\nYours,\nMika\u00ebl Louys\nGeneral Manager & Founder, Megara Entertainment\nSOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 280) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  SOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 18) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  SOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 350) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 61) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 119) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 220) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 259) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  SOLD - NO LONGER AVAILABLE - New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 161) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n  New Collector's Edition interior illustration (section 200) by Gary Chalk for Megara Entertainment\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMegara Entertainment has a solid experience of publishing Collector's hardback gamebooks, with already many released gamebooks and more soon.

Leather copy of the book\nWhat is the Adventurers Backpack?\nThe Castles & Crusades Adventurers Backpack represents the largest expansion of the Castles & Crusades RPG since its inception with what is essentially a second Players Handbook and a deck of Equipment Cards.\nThe Castle Keepers Guide delivered a voluminous amount of gaming material to the CK. The Codex of Aihrde and Players Guide to Aihrde brought the world of Aihrde to life in amazing detail for all players.\nBut now The Adventurers Backpack is presented to the player with content to match -- if not exceed -- that of the original Players Handbook.\nNew classes include:  archer, avatar, oathsworn, magic user, thief, urban ranger, primal druid, milesian bard and more!\nNew spells, for all classes whether in the ABP or the PH, based on an old twist. Equipment revisited. Other notes and observations all designed, we hope, to speed up your game. With the main game book come the Equipment Cards, all designed to speed things up and make game play all that easier.\nFunding Goals: This project has already funded and will appear as a 150+ page full color hardback book. If we hit $26,000 then we'll expand the Equipment Deck by 2 Joker Cards, these will be signed and personalized with boons and discounts on them (Kickstarter backers only). $59.00+. \nNever  Played C&C?

Trollzah!\nMore on the Adventurers Backpack\nThe Adventurers Backpack first appeared in the C&C Black Box on the 40th anniversary of Dungeons and Dragons. In it we presented some new spells, and some new classes. This was only a teaser for future endeavors.\nThe future has arrived. Stephen Chenault finalized the content for the ABP September, 2016 and enlisted Peter Bradley to begin working on the art. What the book holds, and promises, is both a massive expansion of player-based content (classes, spells and more) as well as a new look at equipment and with this new look comes a new tool: the equipment cards.\nWhat is in the Adventurers Backpack?\nBack in the day, we played AD&D like there was no tomorrow, often 2-3 times a week. When the AD&D Unearthed Arcana came out, it gave our game a rush of adrenaline. The new content\u2026classes, spells, equipment, etc\u2026offered just what we needed, just when we needed it. That is the goal of the Adventurers Backpack. Castles & Crusades has been out for 12 years, and as good as it is, it could use a jolt of adrenaline.\nThe Adventures Backpack will include the following\n13 new classes\nNew Non-derivative spells\nA new approach on counter spells and canceling spells\n34 different backpacks offerings an easier and faster way to equip\nA fresh easier to use approach to Unarmed Combat\nMagic Items for classes who have few to choose from\nA look at the Archetype\nThe End Game, why old characters never die\nA note on the spells. The spells presented in the ABP will be non-derivative spells (all new, not based on others) and many will follow the level-growth concept that drives the SIEGE Engine. In other words, there will be far more spells that spell-casters can use at lower levels, but that grow in power as the caster grows in power.This gives the spell-caster far spells to use when they begin, making play much more enjoyable.\nWhat are the Equipment Cards?\nDuring the creation process equipping a character can be a time-consuming task. To speed the process up, the ABP will include 34 different backpack options that include basic and expert dungeon backpacks, basic and expert overland backpacks and class related backpacks. Each backpack comes equipped with what your character needs to plunge into a world of adventure.\nFor ease of access, we\u2019ll supply a deck of cards (34 right now) with all the backpacks and their contents set before you. All you need to do is buy weapons and armor, and a backpack and your character is equipped and ready to go! There will be multiple of some cards, allowing for repetition between players.\nPLEDGE LEVELS AND REWARDS\nPledge Levels\n$1: Join the fun.\n$20: PDF of the Adventurers Backpack\n$40: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack\n$59: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch\n$150: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch, Backpack, lapel pin, t-shirt, water bottle, digest version of the book\n$200: PDF and Hardcover copy of the Adventurers Backpack, your name in book, Deck of Equipment cards, Dice Pouch, Backpack, lapel pin, t-shirt, water bottle, digest version of the book, Leather copy of the book\nPledge at $59.00 and above and receive this dice pouch:\nPledge $150 and above and receive this back pack and the contents within:\n   STRETCH REWARDS\nSTRETCH REWARDS EXPLAINED!\n$11,000 Print ABP: Achieved!

But what does their future hold? To escort the royal envoy to the Horasian Empire, the heroes must plan the travel route, but are the roads passable at this time of year, or should they risk a voyage by sea? The Cyclopes possess ancient secrets of the forge, which they sometimes share with fellow smiths, but would a curious dwarf be welcome on their island home? The last of Borbarad\u2019s lieutenants has been defeated at tremendous cost, but does this mean the heroes may safely explore the Shadowlands, or does some malignant force still hide there, biding its time and waiting for the world to grow complacent once again?\nThe Aventuria Almanac answers all these questions and more!\nChapters explore such topics as the land and the various races that dwell therein, the means of travel by road and water, the tumultuous history of Aventuria, the distractions of peace and the horrors of war, the trade routes and economies that support the wealth of empires, and the omnipresent faith of the gods, which so strongly shapes the lives of everyone on the continent. New monsters crawl forth from their lairs to claim the unwary, and the archdemons, the implacable enemies of the Twelvegods, finally show their true faces.\n  The fantastic world of The Dark Eye has been evolving for more than 30 years, and much has changed. Explorers have even discovered a few new continents, but Aventuria was where it all started, and Aventuria remains the centerpiece of the game. The Aventuria Almanac is your passport to this exciting world.\nThe Aventuria Almanac gives your roleplaying group a common starting point for adventure. It allows new players to quickly get their bearings in the game world, while the comprehensive index and clear organization let experienced players catch up on current affairs and rediscover a long-cherished game setting. With one exception, players may read freely, making this the perfect sourcebook for players and GMs alike!\nAs a GM, let this book serve as the foundation for your campaign and a springboard from which to create new adventures. Game masters will appreciate the Almanac\u2019s special GM-only chapter, which includes game stats and introduces new mysteries and locales for the heroes to explore.\n  Fans of The Dark Eye know to expect deep content and evocative art from our books, and the Aventuria Almanac more than lives up to expectations. Highlights include the following:\nChapter 1: The Continent of Aventuria takes a closer look at the geography of Aventuria, the effects of weather, and the rigors of travel by sea, land, and even magical roads.\nChapter 2: Races explores the nature of the dominant intelligent races dwelling on the continent, namely humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and lizardfolk. This chapter also offers a tantalizing peek at beings that prefer to remain elusive.\nChapter 3: The Land and People goes into great detail on the many kingdoms and realms of Aventuria and their greatest cities. This chapter also takes a look at other continents, such as Gyldenland, the ancestral homeland of the Thorwalers, and Uthuria, the mysterious jungle continent that is sometimes referred to as Land of 12,000 Gods.\nChapter 4: Culture and Science explores the many languages, writing systems, and secret tongues encountered all across Aventuria, as well as the origins and use of common idioms, superstitions, and forms of greeting. Peruse the calendars and dating systems by which most Aventurians measure time, plan for holiday celebrations and feasts, study the origin myths of the world, learn the stars and constellations in the night sky, and find your place in the feudal system (or try to purchase the rights of a free citizen). Join the army and serve god and monarch, play a round of cards, darts, or other games of chance at the local pub, invent a new telescope and dare to look up at the realm of the gods, compose a new opera and gain the favor of the crown, seek knowledge in the incredible libraries of Hesinde, plumb the depths of alchemy, and learn to recognize and treat deadly and fearsome diseases before its too late.\nChapter 5: Trade and Commerce examines the coinage of the various realms, policies of international exchange, and a new invention called the Promissory Note. Make plans to attend the local trade fair or market, but first, brush up on your knowledge of weights and measures to ensure you get what you pay for. Last but not least, this chapter takes a closer look at taxes and levies, two of the most important aspects of life in the realms.\nChapter 6: Flora and Fauna explores the myriad creatures that live in the waters, forests, mountains, and deserts of Aventuria. Entries include ancient enemies such as orcs and ogres, lurking threats such as cave spiders and crypt louses, the deadly krakennewt, feared by sailors above all else, and also several mundane (but by no means harmless) creatures such a giant black bears and wild boars. Plants get their due as well, as these pages delve into herb lore that some agencies have tried to suppress.\n Chapter 7: Gods and Demons takes a look at the mighty Twelvegods, exploring their histories, creeds, Churches, and relationships with the other religions of Aventuria. Not to be ignored are the archdemons, the eternal enemies of the Twelve, and the entity known as the Nameless One, perhaps the most dangerous foe of all.\nChapter 8: Magic and Witchcraft delves into the nature and history of magic and its many forms, and introduces the workings of the secretive sumu, sometimes referred to as druids. Topics include new Traditions, magical artifacts, magical creatures, and the role of magic in everyday life.\nChapter 9: Fame and Infamy introduces the reader to some of the most famous and infamous personalities in Aventuria, ranging from the exalted Empress Rohaja of Gareth to the dreaded night elf sorceress, Pardona. The voices of power and wisdom speak from within these pages, and it would serve you well to listen\u2026\n Chapter 10: Myth and History covers the history of the world of Dere and the continent of Aventuria. It starts by examining various creation myths and what little is known of prehistoric times. The chapter then discusses the first human kingdoms, the rise and fall of the Empire of Bosparan, and the realms and events shaping the world today. The capstone is a summary of the extraordinary and earth-shattering Starfall, which heralds a period of change that will shake Aventuria to its foundations.\nChapter 11: Mystery and Arcana is for GM-eyes only, so we won\u2019t spoil anything here. Suffice it to say that, if one were to look within these pages, one might learn much about the hidden servants the Nameless One and the secret history of Borbarad. This chapter expands on the material from other chapters and contains stats, secrets, and mysteries enough to keep your games running for years.\nA Look Inside\n(Keep an eye on the Ulisses North America blog for more detailed page previews!)\nSupport the Aventuria Almanac Kickstarter today and get ready for adventure!\n  Our intention with the pledge levels is to keep them as straightforward as possible.

Talanian (Castle Zagyg, Charnel Crypt of the Sightless Serpent, Mystery at Port Greely). It is a role-playing game inspired by the fiction of Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith, with rules descended from the original 1974 fantasy wargame and miniatures campaign rules as conceived by E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. \nThe heroes of an AS&SH game delve dungeons filled with horrifying monsters, lethal traps, and bewildering puzzles; they explore savage wilderness frontiers and hostile borderlands; they probe ancient ruins and investigate cursed tombs; they match steel against sorcery and sorcery against steel; and they plunder for gold, gems, and magical treasure.\nAS&SH art by Johnathan Bingham\nHYPERBOREA is the default campaign setting for Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea. This \u201cflat earth\u201d realm is hemmed in by the mystical boreas (\u201cNorth Wind\u201d), and under the scarlet light of a bloated, dying sun, its roiling seas spill eternal over the world\u2019s rim.

These are inspired by pulp fiction, mythology, and history.\nAS&SH art by Del Teigeler\nFor What Awards Has AS&SH Been Nominated?\nAfter the original boxed set edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea was released in 2012, it was nominated for several awards.\n   North Texas RPG Con 2013, Three Castles RPG Design Award\n   ENnie Awards 2013, Best Game\n   ENnie Awards 2013, Best Production Values\n   ENnie Awards 2013, Product of the Year\nTell Me More about This New Edition!\nThe Second Edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea will be presented in sturdy hardback format, with Smyth-sewn case binding and cardinal red end sheets. The cover will be full colour, interiors black and white. The pages will be thick, durable 70# paper. Current estimates range from 420\u2013500 pages. This will be an all-in-one presentation, a single tome containing the following volumes:\n     VOLUME I: Swordsmen & Sorcerers\n     VOLUME II: Sorcery\n     VOLUME III: Adventure & Combat\n     VOLUME IV: Bestiary\n     VOLUME V: Treasure\n     VOLUME VI: Hyperborea Gazetteer\nMock-up picture of AS&SH 2nd Edition hardback\nEach book will include a 32 \u00d7 40-inch full colour map of HYPERBOREA, folded to an 8 \u00d7 8-inch square and tucked behind the cover. The map was hand-created by Glynn Seal of MonkeyBlood Design. Glynn drew the map to actual size\u2014a massive undertaking. He penciled, inked, and coloured the entire thing. Then, he used graphics software to render final embellishments.\nMap of HYPERBOREA by Glynn Seal\nThis is the whole of HYPERBOREA, an hexagonal \u201cflat earth\u201d realm hemmed in by the mystical boreas, whose seas spill to the infinity of the Black Gulf. It is attended by oddly shaped moons, and its sun is a red giant that sheds little warmth. Saturn is prominent in the sky, and celestial phenomena are often. At the centre of the realm rises Mount Vhuurmithadon, an extinct, treble-peaked volcano said to be home to d\u00e6mons, monsters, and gods.\nAdditional Art!\nWe have brought in several new artists whose work will join the well-received art of Ian Baggley as published in the original edition of AS&SH. Some of these artists have worked with us before on other projects, and others are new to AS&SH. New artists include Daisey Bingham, Johnathan Bingham, Charles Lang, Peter Mullen, Russ Nicholson, Glynn Seal, Val Semeiks, Jason Sholtis, Logan Talanian, and Del Teigeler. \nAS&SH art by Russ Nicholson\nSo, What\u2019s Different about This \u201cSecond Edition\u201d?\nOne of our slogans for the Second Edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea is \u201cSame Game, Same Rules, More Content!\u201d\u2014and we really mean that! In the words of editor David Prata:\n     \u201cThe hardcover Second Edition includes new classes, spells, monsters, and magic items. Errata have been incorporated, and ambiguities clarified, but no substantive rules changes have been made. This Second Edition is not a wholly new game to be learnt; it remains fully compatible with the AS&SH original edition boxed set.\u201d\nIn other words, one can bring his original edition boxed set to a game of AS&SH, and it will work seamlessly with the new Second Edition hardback.\nPledge Level Rewards\n$1 TIP JAR.

If PayPal is not a viable option for you, please don\u2019t be deterred from pledging. We have other billing options, such as Square. Here is a breakdown of estimated shipping fees in the USA, Canada, and the rest of the world. (See note below on estimates.) You must pay your shipping fees in order to receive your item(s)! \nAS&SH 2E BOOK (Standard or Blue Foil Edition) ESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES\n- USA SHIPPING = $6 (Media Mail) or $12 (Priority Mail)\n- CANADA SHIPPING = $45\n- REST OF THE WORLD SHIPPING = $56\nAS&SH ORIGINAL ART ESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES (must ship in separate container; does not include shipping for book)\n- USA SHIPPING = $25\n- CANADA SHIPPING = $40\n- REST OF THE WORLD SHIPPING = $50\nOriginal art pledges are packaged separately and insured. \nESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES FOR ADD-ONS\nWe will attempt to work with you as best as possible. If you are in the USA and you wish to order, for example, an extra book and a T-shirt, you will not need to pay any more than the basic $12 Priority Mail fee, because we can put these items in the same box and send them at Flat Rate shipping. Other items (like an unfolded map) must be sent in a separate container. Note that shirts cannot be sent media mail, but books can. \nSimply put, add-ons add weight to your package and in many cases will affect your shipping rate. If you have concerns, do not hesitate to contact Jeffrey Talanian of North Wind Adventures through this Kickstarter page or through www.HYPERBOREA.tv.\nWe can, however, accurately estimate the cost to ship an unfolded map or a canvas map, because these require their own separate (triangular prism) container to ship.\n\nUNFOLDED / CANVAS MAP ESTIMATED SHIPPING FEES\n- USA SHIPPING = $13\n- CANADA SHIPPING = $35\n- REST OF THE WORLD SHIPPING = $45\nNOTE ON ESTIMATED SHIPPING: The above shipping fees are estimates based on current USPS rates. We reserve the right to alter these fees if USPS implements a new pricing structure before we ship.\nFINAL COMMENT ON SHIPPING FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: North Wind Adventures is a small company run from the home office of Jeffrey Talanian, the creator of AS&SH. Our products are not in the distribution chain at this time, and we do not have global print partners. We do short print runs on all our gaming products, here in the USA, and we have a hands-on approach, aiming for the highest quality in production values. We understand and sympathize with the concerns of our international customers: Shipping is dreadfully expensive, in some cases more than the cost of the product itself. The AS&SH Second Edition book will weigh over 4 pounds. This means it cannot be shipped First Class International; it must be sent Priority Mail International.\nOur advice to international customers who can\u2019t afford the shipping fees\u2014or who simply can\u2019t justify the expense\u2014is this: Pledge at our PDF level. Print the PDF, have it hole-drilled, and place it in a three-ring binder. We intend to explore the prospects of print on demand (POD) in foreign countries, but it is not something we intend to pursue at this time.\nFinal Word!\nThank you for considering pledging your support to the Second Edition of Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea. I hope you enjoy the game. Maybe we will have the chance to roll some dice together at a future gaming convention.

Indeed, it is going through various revisions: New classes, spells, monsters, and magic items have been added, and some of those monsters and items are still in progress, but 95% of the writing is complete. In fact, a good third of the editing already is done, too. We waited to launch this campaign until the bulk of the art was in, and the map was complete. These benchmarks have been accomplished.

We can\u2019t name it specifically, under the rules of the license we used to reproduce the rules, but you know the game we\u2019re talking about.\nWe\u2019re starting to run low on our stock of the 2nd printing, and it\u2019s time to print some more. We didn\u2019t just want to do an exact reprint, and the history of the changes here date back a while ago to when we were talking with designer Stacy Dellorfano about the fact that many OSR games have a physical appearance and presentation that really targets the 40 year old guys who\u2019ve been gaming since forever, and doesn\u2019t have nearly as much appeal to younger or female gamers of the generations following that first wave of players from the 1980s. In point of fact, old-school games, with their light-rules aspect and emphasis on a game master\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d interpretation of situations, are actually a really good tool for anyone who feels like rules-lawyers may be spoiling the game by trying to be over-authoritative or even overbearing with a GM. But if the appearance and presentation make the game look like it\u2019s purely a throwback and not a modern tool for good gaming, then there\u2019s a real obstacle to the game\u2019s push into the mainstream gaming community.\nAs a result of this analysis, we engaged Stacy as a designer to produce an edition that\u2019s no less appealing to older male gamers, while being MORE appealing to younger and to female gamers. Stacy put together a team, all women, to address this dual objective. We think her team has done an awesome job, and when you see the design results, we think you\u2019ll agree.\nUnfortunately, we think there may be some controversy about the fact that the design team here is made up entirely of women. We\u2019ve already heard a couple of comments that generally turn on the idea of \u201cWhy restrict the project to women designers? Shouldn\u2019t the objective be to pull the best talent whether male or female? What a gimmick.\u201d We\u2019d like to address that out front, rather than have it turn into a back-channel controversy in the halls of the internet. The missing piece of information is this: there are so many different directions that a project can take that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cthe best talent.\u201d Given our goal of making the game more accessible, we hired \u2013 through Stacy \u2013 talent that coordinates with the goal. We asked Stacy to put together an all-woman team not as a societal goal, but because she had the chops to assemble the kind of team we wanted. This isn\u2019t a \u201cpink\u201d edition of the rules. It\u2019s the more-accessible next printing that we are targeting toward the mainstream market. It has always been our goal to get the open-ended rules of 1974-78 gaming into the mainstream, and this is our objective here. We think that Stacy\u2019s team has hit this goal out of the ballpark, and we think you\u2019ll agree.\nStacy writes: \"I am Stacy Dellorfano, the Project Manager for Frog God Games on this project. I\u2019m going to lay out this Kickstarter by walking you through what we\u2019ve done, why I\u2019m passionate about it, and why this work is important. I\u2019ve gotten a great deal of support and advice from Bill Webb, the main force behind Frog God Games, and the author of Swords & Wizardry, Matt Finch.\"\nOur cover artist, Kaos Nest, painted the cover by hand - in ink, watercolor, and ballpoint pen. I asked for something abstract, dark, and gothic, giving her hints like thorns and blood and bones and leaves.\n  For the interior, Frog God wanted to keep the artwork black and white like it is for the current printing of the book. Kaos also provided us with plenty of the in-book artwork, adding in more of her killer pen work. Kaos hails from a small town in Italy, and travels the world picking up new skills and working on her illustrations (many of ours were done while she was visiting Ireland). Though her work has graced the covers of fantasy novels, Swords & Wizardry was her first tabletop RPG project, but surely not her last!\n   A total of seven illustrators put together all the artwork you\u2019ll see in the book. Wherever possible, we had the same artist handle all the illustration for a particular area. For example, Abigail Larson, whose most recent work is a fully illustrated version of H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s \u201cThe Cats of Ulthar\u201d, added her gothic ethereal look to our class illustrations.\nGennifer Bone, who\u2019s worked on OSR titles before, did all our monster illustrations. She specializes in monsters, and runs a Patreon where she creates gaming illustrations each week. Her beautifully hideous monsters grace the pages of the monster section, which opens with a full-page all-out monster brawl also illustrated by Gennifer.\nJenna Fowler, whose work has graced the pages of many RPGs since she started her freelance career in 2010, did a fantastic job illustrating our spell section as well as adding several other illustrations to the book\u2019s interior.\nAnother newcomer to RPGs, Angela Rizza, illustrated a few of our full-page images, and created 10 separate inside borders for the pages - a different border for each section of the book. Her classical storybook illustration style provided rich depth to our borders, and her attention to detail means you\u2019ll see something new every time you look at the page.\n          For layout design, Sydney-based illustrator and graphic designer Leigh Tuckman has taken the reigns. Of the many things she\u2019s created for us, my favorite by far is her re-creation of the character sheet. We were able to make a PDF you can get for free including ten versions of the PDF - one of each border as they appear in the book only set as a frame for a full page.\nWhat\u2019s Different?\nJust the artwork and layout! The text of the book is exactly the same as it was in the 2nd printing save for some minor adjustments to the gameplay example.\nWhy The New Design Team?\nThis project came out of a discussion largely about how to get more women interested in OSR games, and evolved into a request to create a product that would appeal to all genders and challenge the idea of what an OSR game should look like. For many of the women who illustrated the book, this is their first foray into freelancing in the tabletop RPG industry. By participating in this project, we\u2019re raising their visibility and adding more female voices to the industry.\nWhat this is not is an \u201cRPG for women\u201d. This is Swords & Wizardry the same as it\u2019s been for the last two printings, just with new artwork and layout for the new printing.\nAdd-Ons\nBut Wait, There\u2019s More! In addition to redesigning the book for the 3rd printing, we\u2019ve designed two whole new adventures that utilize the same layout and features more of Kaos Nest\u2019s fantastic work.\n$12 Softcover ($6 PDF) of The Five Maidens by Elizabeth Chaipraditkul - Liz brings us this fantastic city-based adventure set in a unique fishing village caught in a perpetual nightmare of a storm. The people there have lost the capability to dream, and it\u2019s been gone so long they can no longer even remember dreaming. Now, a sleeping sickness has swept over the city, and it\u2019s up to you and your party to find out what\u2019s going on and tackle the beasts, storm, and sickness to save the city\u2019s inhabitants. The Five Maidens is half mystery, half city-crawl. Figure out why the inhabitants are suffering, decide what to do about the problem, then fight your way through the consequences.  \n$12 Softcover ($6 PDF) of Zaya\u2019s Promise by Stacy Dellorfano - Buried under miles and miles of twisting vines and poisonous thorns lies a long-forgotten city destroyed in a long-forgotten war. Beneath the city\u2019s ruins there reportedly lies a vast maze of rooms and corridors containing wonders never seen before, and treasure beyond description. The only problem is that for as long as anyone remembers, no one who has gone in seeking said wonders and treasure has returned. This adventure is more of a classic dungeon crawl, themed around the accidentally terrifying dreamscape of an elven girl trapped in a nightmare of her own making. The dungeon shifts and exits move about as the party explores, making each run through the dungeon a unique experience and allowing for infinite replays of the same adventure. \n$30 Swords & Wizardry Complete Rulebook (2nd Edition Printing) - Limited Quantity Erol Otus Cover Book\n$50 Monstrosities Hardcover ($25 PDF) - The perfect companion to the Complete Rulebook!\n$12 Deck of Treasures - Treasure items to use in your S&W games!\n$10 Hex Crawl Chronicles 1-7 Softcover ($4 PDF) - each sold separately, collect the entire set!\n$9 Bill Webb's Book of Dirty Tricks Softcover ($4 PDF) - Learn all the secrets of Dungeon Master Bill Webb with this excellent Softcover which can be utilized for all RPG systems! \n$15 Bill Webb's Deck of Dirty Tricks - 52 cards to aid your players during the most perilous adventures, written by Bill Webb himself!\n$7 Grimmsgate - What great evil and what fabulous treasures are to be found in these lands?

The body is a medium/heavy weight functional 300g/m2 fabric made from a Cotton/Polyester blend. The hood is lined with a extremely soft black flannelette. \nADV3NTURE HOODIE LIMITED\nADV3NTURE HOODIE LIMITED series (\"Herringbone\" and \"Black Camo\") have all of the features of the ADV3NTURE HOODIE and are made with premium fabrics (the same weight as the Adventure Hoodies) and have black zippers and accents.\n\"Black Camo\" Adventure Hoodie Limited\nADV3NTURE HOODIE LIMITED \"Black Camo\" has four printed colors and is dyed using a reverse osmosis process which reduces the amount of fading when the garment is washed. The body is a medium/heavy weight functional 300g/m2 fabric made from a Cotton/Polyester blend. The hood is lined with a extremely soft black flannelette.\n\"Herringbone\" Adventure Hoodie Limited\nADV3NTURE HOODIE LIMITED \"Herringbone\" is made with woven (not printed) yarn-dyed fleece. The body is a medium/heavy weight functional 300g/m2 fabric made from a Cotton/Polyester blend. The hood is lined with a extremely soft black flannelette.\nADV3NTURE JACKET\nThe All-Weather ADV3NTURE JACKET is water-resistant and lined. It has the same features of the other Adventure Hoodies, but is made with a DWR (durable water-repellent) fabric and lined with incredibly soft Sherpa fabric in the body, hood and the outside wall of the side zippered pockets.\nAll-Weather ADV3NTURE Jacket\nThe All-Weather ADV3NTURE JACKET is made with a black waterproof treated Polyester/Spandex shell with a weight of 120g/m2. Along with the waterproof treated exterior, there is also an additional permeability film that provides additional water-resistance and insulation. The body, hood and side zippered pockets are lined with incredibly soft (like, baby bunny soft) black Sherpa fabric. The combined weight of the shell and lining are 360g/m2.\n  POCKETS & FEATURES\nThere are nine (9) pockets and fourteen (14) features that are seamlessly incorporated in the ADV3NTURE HOODIE. We set out to create a hoodie that is full of innovations, but is primarily a stylish high-end hoodie that you will want to wear every day.\n The ADV3TURE Hoodie is being praised for its incredible pillow conversion. Pat O'Brien from Access Hollywood called the pillow feature \"pure genius\".\nThe ADV3NTURE Hoodie converts to a super-soft pillow in seconds!\nNINE (9) POCKETS\nThe ADV3NTURE HOODIE has nine pockets. While each pocket was designed for a purpose, what you use it for is up to you. Each person and each adventure is unique, so use our descriptions as suggestions. And if you find any other uses for the pockets, let us know (hit the CONTACT button at the top of this page)!\nZIPPERED SIDE POCKETS (2) - Unzip to warm your hands, or zip up to secure your belongings. They zip up (not down), so the rubber zipper pull tucks behind the pocket flap. (In the All-Weather Jacket, they're lined with incredibly soft Sherpa material)\nFRONT CARGO POCKETS (2) - These pockets are essential to the ADV3NTURE HOODIE. They\u2019re convenient enough to drop things into (camera, phone, wallet, maps, cash, change, etc), and big enough for odd-sized items (big headphones, maps, granola bars, children's toys, crayons, etc). And they are secured with two plastic-covered metal snaps.\nZIPPERED PASSPORT POCKET - You\u2019ll never fumble for your passport (or wallet, or cash, or I.D.), because you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s secured close to your chest in a zippered pocket. This pocket has a rubber zipper pull.\nINSIDE WATER-RESISTANT POCKET - Adventure is about an element of uncertainty. You never know when a water-resistant inside pocket will come in handy, but it certainly will! This is the perfect pocket for your phone and earbuds.\nNEOPRENE KOOZIE POCKET (1) - The neoprene koozie pocket is designed to hold a standard bottle or can. It is sealed at the bottom, and is the perfect size for a phone (Android or iPhone 6+). It provides a padded pocket for your cell phone OR is an insulated place to hold your beverage, while also keeping it chilled.\nARM POCKET (1) - This is also a carry-over from the Drinking Jacket, but we switched arms to make it more convenient to 90% of the population (right-handed people - not that south paws can\u2019t use it!).\nMINI-PEN POCKET (1) This unique pocket holds a mini-pen, because you never know when you\u2019ll need a writing implement. The pocket holds pens up to 4\" long. There are several inexpensive mini-pens that fit in this pocket.\nADVENTURE HOODIE - Pockets & Features\nFOURTEEN (14) FEATURES\nThe ADV3NTURE HOODIE has 14 distinct features, although it could be argued that it actually has more. While each feature was designed with a specific purpose in mind, we know you'll come up with other use for them. If you find any other uses for the features, we'd love to hear about it!\nSUNGLASS HOLDER - People most often lose their sunglasses when day turns to night or sunny skies turn cloudy and they don\u2019t have anywhere to put their sunglasses. With the sunglass holder, you have a place to easily store or access your sunglasses, so you don\u2019t leave them on a table, in a car, or wherever you would have put them down.\nPictured : Sherpa-lined ADV3NTURE JACKET\nPILLOW CONVERSION - You never know when you\u2019ll need a pillow! Missed a flight, long car ride, boring lecture, or maybe you just want to lay on the grass with your four-legged friend? Your adventure hoodie easily folds up into a pillow (way more effective than the chintzy ones they offer on airlines) that provides a substantial place to rest your head. It\u2019s also a convenient way to transport your hoodie, when you don\u2019t need it. The pillow converts both ways, so you can have a super soft pillow (with the lining on the outside), or a more durable pillow (with the lining on the inside) if you don't want to get the lining dirty in public places.\nBOTTLE-OPENER ZIPPER - The top zipper is a bottle opener, because you never know when you'll need one!\nREFLECTIVE CABLING - There is reflective cabling sewn into the front button pockets and on the hood (from the front to the back). They are covered with a thin body-color material to make it barely visible during the day. But work well even in very dim light.\nREFLECTIVE LOGO - The Monkey (Pleepleus) logo on your hoodie is reflective. We used a tinted reflective ink to make our logo subtle and blend in with the fabric color (of all of the ADV3NTURE HOODIES), but it still its reflective properties.\nFOLDABLE GLOVES - The cuffs of the hoodie fold out to serve as gloves. They\u2019ll provide a cozy home for your hands when the weather turns cold. They\u2019re also handy for keeping your beverage cold and your hands warm.\nBEVERAGE GRIPS - The pattern on the gloves provides grip when holding a beverage. But they also add more grip for times when you didn\u2019t know you needed it.\nRETURN HOME FEATURE - OK, it's not as much a sophisticated electronic GPS component as it is a place to write your phone number or email address, but it's arguably just as effective. Write your info in the jacket and, if you leave your ADV3NTURE HOODIE somewhere, the finder will know how to contact you!\nUNDERARM VENTS- The subcutaneous fat in your body acts as a natural insulator. You have less fat in your armpits, which makes them serve as the your torso\u2019s cooling center. So, a simple vent has been added under the armpits to allow your body to remove excess heat.\nVENTILATION ZIPPER - The addition of a bottom zipper enables you to cool off, without having to take off your hoodie. Unzipping just the top zipper can also work, but it may cause your hoodie to slip off your shoulders. By unzipping the bottom zipper, you can cool off, while keeping your hoodie in place.\n OVER-SIZED HOOD - The hood is 5\u201d larger than a standard hoodie, and is lined with super-soft fabric. This enables you to pull the hoodie over your eyes, to shut out the light and help you sleep.\nADJUSTABLE HOOD SNAPS - The hood is over-sized so it can cover your eyes when you want to take a nap. But, there is a button in the back of the hood that let's you adjust the size, so it doesn't cover your eyes other times that you're using the hood.\n EXTRA SOFT HOOD LINING - The hood is lined with extra soft fabric which adds and extra level of insulating. When you're traveling, it creates a nice, soft, home-away-from-home.\nDRAWSTRINGS - Use the drawstrings to adjust the hoodie, as well as blocking out the light, while you pull the hoodie over your eyes for a nap.\nThe All-Weather ADV3NTURE JACKET is made with DWR (Durable Water-Repellent) Fabric. The outer \"jacket\" material is made with a water-resistant treatment to repel water. There is also a thin inner-membrane that also helps to keep out water.\nThe All-Weather ADV3NTURE JACKET is lined with incredibly soft Sherpa fabric in the hood and body. What is Sherpa fabric? It is a super-plush \"fleecy pile\" which is most often used to make stuffed animals, blankets and pillows. It is, in a word, luxurious.\n   ALL-WEATHER VERSION FEATURES\nSHERPA-LINED JACKET - The body of the jacket is lined with Velveteen Sherpa fabric that is as soft as a baby bunny (we actually tested it, which may have just been an excuse to go play with baby bunnies). It provides a layer of insulation and a layer of luxurious softness.\nSHERPA-LINED HOOD - The hood is lined with the same Sherpa fabric as the body. When you pull it over your head, it envelopes your head in softness.\nSHERPA-LINED SIDE POCKETS - The zippered side pockets are lined in the same Sherpa material to provide an extra soft place to warm your hands. Your cold hands will thank you.\nQUILTED ARM-LINING - The sleeves are lined with a quilted in a soft cotton/polyester blend that provides a cozy and warm place for your arms, even if you're wearing a T-shirt underneath and have bare arms.\nRIDICULOUSLY SOFT PILLOW CONVERSION - The ADV3NTURE HOODIE and ADV3NTURE JACKET quickly and easily convert into a pillow. Roll the jacket into the oversized hood and snap it shut. If rolled inside-out, it creates a super-soft pillow. If you roll it outside-in, your jacket becomes compact to fit in your bag.\nALL-WEATHER ADVENTURE HOODIE - Fabrics\n  \u2014- IMPORTANT STUFF -\u2014\nSURVEY - THIS IS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK! 1-2 days after the campaign is concluded, you will be emailed a link to a Kickstarter survey. It's incredibly simple. You'll click a few buttons as you select your size(s) and style/color choice(s). Then you'll provide us with your address, so we know what to send you and where to send it.\nSIZING - We're offering Men's and Women's sizes of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie and ADV3NTURE Jacket. The sizes for Men's and Women's are comparable to a standard hoodie. To find your perfect size, grab your favorite hoodie (soon to be your second favorite hoodie!) and lay it on a flat surface. Grab a tape measure and measure the dimensions that you see in the image below. Then find the size that most closely matches it from the 22 sizes we offer. If you have a question, let us know. We'd love to hear your input!\nUS & Imperial Measurements\nMetric (\"International\") Measurements\nQUALITY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT - We are working with one of the top apparel manufacturers to produce the ADV3NTURE Hoodie and Jacket. They produce top-quality garments, and this garment is no different. We have chosen premium fabrics for the hoodies, and they are being sewn with premium threads and stitching. We have not found the cheapest solution. Not even close. But, we have found the best solution.\nTEMPERATURE RANGE - The ADV3NTURE Hoodie CLASSIC and LIMITED are medium-weight hoodies which are ideal for cool days 48\u00b0F (9C)\u00b0 to the high 69\u00b0F (20\u00b0C). The ADV3NTURE Jacket is made with a water-resistant shell and Sherpa lined body, hood and pockets, along with quilted fabric in the arms. It's ideal for temperatures from 33\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) to 64\u00b0F (18\u00b0C). However, with proper layering underneath, the Jacket could be worn in temperatures below freezing.\nSHIPPING - As soon as the campaign is over, you\u2019ll be mailed a link for a survey. Inevitably, there will be people who will not fill out their survey on time. Last time (with The Drinking Jackets) we waited until 85% of the surveys were in (which took 45 days!) before we began manufacturing. That caused everyone to get their hoodies late. We won\u2019t let that happen this time.\nFor the ADV3NTURE HOODIE, we\u2019re going to start manufacturing the first production run 10 DAYS after the campaign is concluded. Anyone who is later than that will still get their hoodie, BUT it will just be in the second production run, which will be 30-45 days after the first run.\nRETURNS - Most Kickstarter campaigns do not have return policies. We do. If you find a manufacturer\u2019s defect, or received the wrong size, you have 30 days to exchange the hoodie. Just follow the directions on the packing slip. If, once you receive your hoodie, you wish to change the size/color (and an alternate is available), there is a $15 fee (per Hoodie) inside the US (international rates vary per country, please contact the email address provided on your return form included in every package) to cover us shipping you a new hoodie. All of the details and customer service email on a packing slip included in your order.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, so we know to get these hoodies made on time and in the high quality that you should expect. The Drinking Jacket campaign presented many challenges, but it was an amazing experience that we learned from and have applied those lessons to this campaign.\n\nHOLIDAYS - We know that many of you would like to give the Adventure Hoodie as a gift. We expect to be shipping out the hoodies in the beginning of January. Depending on the number of orders, it may take several weeks to fulfill all of the orders. So, we cannot guarantee that you will receive your hoodie prior to the holidays.\n\nSURVEY - Fill out your survey as soon as the campaign is over. 1-2 days after the campaign is concluded, you will be emailed a link to a Kickstarter survey. There you\u2019ll provide us with your size(s), color choices(s), and address, so we know what to send you and where to send it.\n\nQUALITY - We are working with one of the top apparel manufacturers. We have chosen premium fabrics. The hoodies are being sewn with premium threads and stitching. What else?\n\nSHIPPING - As soon as the campaign is over, you\u2019ll be mailed a link for a survey. Inevitably, there will be people who will not fill out their survey. Last time (with The Drinking Jackets) we waited until 85% of the surveys were in (which took 45 days!) before we began manufacturing. That caused everyone to get their hoodies late. We won\u2019t let that happen this time.\n\nFor the Adventure Hoodie, we\u2019re going to begin manufacturing ONE (1) WEEK after the conclusion of the campaign. Anyone who is later than that will still get their hoodie. It will just be in the second production run, which will be 15 days after the first run.\n\nRETURNS - Most Kickstarter campaigns do not have return policies. Being that this is apparel, we do. If you find a manufacturer\u2019s defect, or received the wrong size, you have 30 days to exchange the hoodie. Just follow the directions on the packing slip. The packing slip will have a customer support email address and phone number, so you will be able to get a response from a real person.\n\nIf, once you receive your hoodie, you wish to change the size/color, there is a $15 fee to cover us shipping you a new hoodie. Just fill out the exchange form included with your shipment and ship your hoodie back to the address indicated on the exchange form. All exchanges must be made within 30 days of receiving your hoodie. Exchanges cannot be processed after 30 days of receipt.\n\nIf this is a gift for the holidays, don\u2019t wait to inspect your hoodie. Open it when you receive it, so you can make sure it is the correct size, and that there aren\u2019t hoods sewn onto the arms. OK, that hasn\u2019t happened. But weird things do occasionally happen.\n\nSIZING - For The Drinking Jacket campaign, we used the American Sizing Standard for production of the hoodies. The problem is that (1) there is not standard LARGE PERSON. A Large man (for example) could be 5\u2019 5\u201d 250lbs or 6\u2019 1\u201d 185. We did our best. This time we've done better! Check the sizing charts above against your current garments and you should be able to find exactly what you need.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

We\u2019re running this campaign to fund the final development of the book, and we need your help raising 10,000 dollars, which will cover the final development costs for the book.\nThe  manuscript is finished. All that\u2019s left is to begin final layout and art direction, proofing of the finished book, and this puppy will be ready for release! We anticipate the final book to 400+ pages in length!\n   Interface Zero 2.0 is a cyberpunk setting\u2026Sort of. Interface Zero is inspired by a plethora of sources including novels such as Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, Altered Carbon, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Snow Crash.\nAnime such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Battle Angel Alita and Appleseed help to round out a vision of our world, incorporating eastern and western influences on the genre.\nThe result is a setting that echoes other popular cyberpunk games, but focuses more on geopolitical intrigue and action rather than the familiar roles of megacorporations as the major antagonists. That doesn\u2019t mean that corporations aren\u2019t powers unto themselves, with their own agendas, both altruistic and nefarious, however.\nThe characters you play in Interface Zero take on a variety of roles. Hackers, drone jockeys, government agents, bounty hunters (just to name a few) generally act as private operators; people with the skills, ability and will to do jobs nobody else can. The jobs often skirt the edges of legality, and can push your moral compass away from true north, if you let them.\nAlternately,  you might work exclusively for a corporate entity, a world government, or even as special operations teams similar to Ghost in the Shell\u2019s Section 9, working to protect the citizens of the sprawl, or even corporate assets. For the military-minded player, characters might become mercenaries working in war zones with occupying armies or resistance movements.\n  Set in the year 2090, Interface Zero 2.0 peers into a dark future, imagining a world changed by Eco-terrorism, unimpeded global warming, and nuclear war. Chinese imperialism has erased national boundaries from Eastern Russia all the way down to Vietnam and Thailand. The world has seen the rise and fall of global super powers. China, Brazil and the Central African Union have risen to global prominence, while the United States has disintegrated, splitting into five new nations; Atlantica, the Great Lakes Union, the North American Coalition, the Republic of Cascadia, and the Republic of Texas.\nIn this grim reality, we have colonized the solar system and sold it to the highest bidder. Colonies and orbital habitats on other planets, while claimed by nations on earth, are in truth the property of massive, multi-planet corporations. Commonly known as \u201czeroes,\u201d many people living in the reaches of space have seen their adventurous spirit, their hopes for an exciting life beyond the confines of Earth, crushed under the weight of indentured servitude after signing on with these corporations. The corps promise to pay relocation expenses and living expenses, and then use technicalities and clauses in the contracts to recoup those expenses.\nThe corporation owns everything; even the air zeroes breathe comes at a cost, deducted from their weekly paychecks. There are those, however, who have found ways to survive, and even thrive in the outer-reaches of space, living on the fringes of law and civilization. Will you join them?\nScience has hacked the genome, unlocking the secrets of DNA to facilitate the creation of new breeds of human; genetic hybrids, human 2.0, and even simulacrum\u2014a slave race grown in amniotic vats and sold on the open market.\nCybernetic technology has reached the point where those with the credits and the will to do so, can become living machines.\nComputer science has grown rapidly as well. Dubbed Interface Zero by those who created it, the Tendril Access Processor\u2014or TAP\u2014downloads the Global DataNet and Hyper Reality directly into the minds of billions of users across the solar system, bringing the world an unparalleled level of inter connectivity, and danger. Malware plagues the Deep, and black hat hackers manipulate the Tendril Access Processor to upload malicious Virii, steal secrets, and even the identities of the unwary.\nWelcome to the future. Let's hope you survive it.\n This project has been in development for two and a half years, and we believe the new rules for hacking, combat, and piloting drones are innovative, uniquely reflect the setting and highlight the power of the Pathfinder game system. With 16 character classes, seven races that redefine what it means to be human, new feats, tons of gear and cybernetics, your options for character creation are endless.\n   Starfinder is coming next year, and we can\u2019t wait to see the awesomeness that the Paizo crew are developing! But what does that mean for Interface Zero? Greatness, to be sure. You can rest assured that once the rules for Starfinder become available for licensed publishers, we will work to ensure that Interface Zero: Cyberpunk action for Pathfinder is fully compatible with that rule set. Indeed, this book is already compatible with the Technology Guide.\nThe only question is exactly how to go about it. We are, of course, printing Interface Zero. Logic would dictate waiting until we can update the book with the new rules, but I don\u2019t want you to have to wait to get your rewards until after Starfinder has been released. That leaves me with another option; releasing a conversion document that gives you everything you\u2019ll need to make characters with the Starfinder rules.\nThe conversion document will initially be a free PDF that you\u2019ll all get standard with your rewards, and depending on how things go, I may offer it as a Print on Demand product at DrivethruRPG. I haven\u2019t decided yet. Either way we\u2019ll have you covered!\n  In this book you'll find:\nA detailed look at the dystopian future that is Earth in the year 2090.\nSeven core races, including androids, cyborgs, and the genetically superior human 2.0.\nSixteen core classes. Dominate combat with the mysterious cybermonk. Use the hacker to lay bare the secrets of corporations and governments. Play a zeek and use your psionic powers to wipe out your enemies, or steal their thoughts.\nA streamlined alternative combat system based on the rules in Ultimate Combat that offer a gritty, cyberpunk play style.\nNew rules for hacking and dealing with Hyper Reality, a virtual overlay of the real world you can use to hack the world around you.\nA plethora of high-tech gear for your characters. Guns, armor, vehicles, cybernetic implants and more are available, if you've got the creds.\nRobots and other technological horrors, designed by RPG Superstar Mike Welham.\nRules for drones, and remotely piloted robotic armaments.\nWe\u2019re keeping this project very simple. To start, we\u2019ll have four pledge levels you can choose from, but as the kickstarter progresses and we unlock more stretch goals, I\u2019ll add special pledges which allow you to back for extra stuff and become a part of the setting!\n           Here's a list of the available add-ons: If you want to grab these, just add the extra dollar amounts to your pledge.\nPrint book: You can get an extra copy of Interface Zero: Cyberpunk Action for the Pathfinder RPG for 20.00\nMiniatures: You can grab a mini for 4 dollars a piece.\nPrint Vouchers: Print vouchers allow you to get a copy of the Print on demand versions of any books we unlock in our stretch goals. Here's how it works:\nBy pledging an extra 10 dollars, you get a Print Voucher to buy the book at cost +shipping. Once it's ready for Print on Demand, I'll send you a discount link you can use to get your copy. At 90 pages, the books will cost $4.61 (plus shipping) to print in full color, soft cover.\nHere are the available books we have so far.\nThe Golemmech Creation Rules: This book will give you everything you need to use battle mechs in your game. We'll have combat rules, customization rules, plenty of mechs to choose from, and possibly even a character class: The mech pilot.\nThe Malmart Catalog: This book will provide tons of new gear, weapons, armor, drones, and vehicles for use in your Interface Zero campaign.\nThe Zero's Guide to the Solar System: This book will flesh out the solar system, providing tons of information on colonies, orbital habitats, and the people who live on them.\nThe New York Reclamation Zone: Once the greatest city on earth, New York was abandoned in 2038 after terrorists blew the levees protecting her from rising sea levels. Forgotten by America, the Big Apple became soggy, slowly rotting away, with only a brave few remaining within its bounds, refusing to give up their once-proud home. Yet in the half-century that followed, New Yorkers proved time and again just how adaptable they could be in the face of disaster, natural or otherwise.\nNow, the waters may still hold the Big Soggy hostage, but its denizens reject any notion of surrender. The city has changed, with flooded streets and ancient subways teeming with aquatic predators while human colonies scrape out a brutal existence on those skyscrapers that haven\u2019t collapsed into the sea. As corporations turn their hungry eyes on the forgotten city, it\u2019s time to rediscover the Big Soggy, where new territory is being fought over, new hybrids are emerging from the waves, new technology is being manufactured in the blackest labs, and new secrets are being dug up from the ocean floor\u2014or buried there.\nThreats of 2090: This source book will give you tons of new threats to include in your game.\nOur stretch goals are designed to improve the quality of the book, add more artwork, and more content, including source books for the setting! Here\u2019s an outline of what we have planned.\nAdversaries: Need I say more? RPG Superstar Mike Welham will create more threats to use in your games!\nHot Spots: Hot Spots introduce a unique location to a given city across the world. They provide you with places to go, new NPC\u2019s to meet, and sometimes even special items, like weapons, tech, or even cutting-edge cybernetics! Each Hot Spot will also provide adventure seeds. Hot Spots will be available for backers as individual pdfs to start, but once we get enough (minimum 24 pages worth of material), I\u2019ll compile them into a single printed book. All backers at 40.00 or higher will get a print copy of the book!\nSource Material: We're going to be doing source books, and rules supplements that give you more content!\n     Shipping costs to regions outside the United States can be extremely high in most cases, which makes it tough to successfully fund a kickstarter or hit stretch goals. I completely understand the dilemma International backers face. You love the project, and want to pledge, but you don\u2019t want to take out a second mortgage on your home just to pay the shipping costs.\nI\u2019ve been doing my due diligence, and I\u2019ve found a solution: Gamesquest!\nHere's their bio:\nGamesQuest is one of the fastest growing Fulfilment companies in the EU, offering a great a service for a competitive price. At GamesQuest we pride ourselves on being hobbyists, with a real passion to see the industry grow and prosper. With years of experience shipping games and collectables worldwide GamesQuest are committed to offering a reliable and safe shipping solution for Kickstarters large and small alike!\nJames Mathe, of Minion Games, recently reviewed us as:\n\"These guys have been very friendly, very responsive, and obviously, speak very good English.\" \"Their customer service dealt with customers directly in a timely manner and they helped quickly resolve the issues we caused ourselves.\"\nBacker Kit\nFor this kickstarter, I'm going to be using Backerkit to collect shipping fees after the kickstarter ends. The reason is simple. Kickstarter has not yet found a way to separate the funds that actually go towards the money we need to raise, and the shipping costs needed to send out the finished product.\nThe result from this oversight, is an artificially inflated \u201ctotal\u201d amount of money raised, which causes huge problems when determining which funds go where. Money which is dedicated towards the development decreases because we suddenly find ourselves compensating for shipping and handling. As an example, the Interface Zero Savage Worlds kickstarter lost over 16,000 dollars because of shipping costs, which resulted in a reduced budget! It hurt me financially as I struggled to compensate for the lost funds.\nBy using Backerkit, I can avoid this by keeping the shipping fees held separately until I'm ready to ship. Once I'm ready to ship you will be charged for shipping one last time, and rewards will be sent.\nClick here for more information about Backerkit.\nCheck the following chart to see the estimated costs for international shipping. The estimated costs for shipping, based on a 3lb package (1.36 kg). All prices for countries outside the United States are in British Pounds.\n   Digital Titles will be fulfilled through DrivethruRPG!\n  Andreas R\u00f6nnqvist\nAndreas R\u00f6nnqvist, co-owner of Dreamscarred Press has spent more than 10 years writing and designing RPG books for a variety of systems, lately focusing on Pathfinder and their own Dawnborn RPG. Amongst his books are Psionics Unleashed, Ultimate Psionics, Path of War and many more. He has worked on the psionics rules for Interface Zero Pathfinder Edition.\nDavid Jarvis\nDavid has been working in the table top industry for just over 11 years. During this time, his company\u2014Gun Metal Games\u2014has produced over 140 books in both print and PDF. Interface Zero was nominated for an ENNIE in 2015 for Best Interior Artwork, and in 2011 it was nominated for Best RPG of the Year at the U.K games expo. He\u2019s successfully funded three previous kickstarters, and has learned from each of them. Two have seen fulfillment of base rewards, and the last one will be fulfilled before the end of 2016!\nJeff Lee\nJeff Lee has been a freelance writer for RPGs for the last four years. He has an extensive list of writing credits with Frog God Games, Kobold Press, Legendary Games, Louis Porter Jr. Design, and Rogue Genius Games, among others.\nMike Welham\nMike Welham been gaming off-and-on for over 30 years but only recently gave back to his beloved hobby. He has freelanced for Kobold Press, Paizo, Raging Swan Press, and Rite Publishing, and he won Paizo\u2019s RPG Superstar contest in 2012. Mike lives in Kernersville, North Carolina, with his ever-patient wife, a puggle, too many cats, and a turtle. He believes the solution to his current empty nest syndrome is to allow more creatures of his imagination to make themselves at home. He was delighted to have the opportunity to design bizarre technological horrors for the Interface Zero project.\nRobert Hudson\nRobert H. Hudson Jr is a two-time ENNIE nominee game developer and writer who has worked in the industry since 2005. Besides his work on the Interface Zero 2.0 Pathfinder project, he has done work for Green Ronin, Misfit Studios, Kobold Press, Danny O\u2019Neill\u2019s The Grande Temple of Jing, HERO Games and others. He lives in Alabama, where he works, runs games, writes, and ponders the mysteries of the universe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs someone who has been publishing role-playing game supplements since 2005, I can attest to the fact that things don't always go as planned. Writers and artists pull out of projects, or turn in manuscripts and illustrations late. Editing and revisions sometimes take longer than anticipated. The proofs for books come back from the printer with errors that need to be fixed.\nThese things can happen. It's a part of the publishing business. But I've been around the block, and I know that a large part of dealing with issues like the ones I mentioned above is communication.\nI have regular conversations with everyone involved in this process to ensure that I know things are progressing the way they should be, and if they aren't, I roll up my sleeves and work with my team to find the best solution to a problem before it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a backer, you'll receive regular status reports from me about this project.

By Zhu Bajie\nINTRODUCTION\nLong ago, an ancient people, the Archians, built a thriving civilization in the shadow of a great mountain. Among their many accomplishments, they studied the dark mysteries of arcane energy. Through knowledge of the cosmos, they harnessed their innate magical abilities. They also created new types of magic and created extraordinarily powerful, and sometimes unpredictable, spells.\nFor a thousand years the Archians ruled their world. Until a great cataclysm befell their civilization. Some say they became reclusive, selfish, and lost themselves within the eldritch energies they studied. Others say that some Archian sorcerers grew in power and challenged their gods. One thing is known for sure -- their grand civilization came to an end. Lightning wracked the city from above and great earthquakes split the ground from below. The quakes swallowed the city into the ground and created a labyrinth of canyons and sunken ruins where a thriving civilization once stood. Finally, the great mountain exploded in an erruption of fire and brimstone that bombarded the city ruins and turned the once fertile region into a barren wasteland.\nIn the centuries that followed, the land remained lifeless.\nRecent rumours suggest the desolate expanse around the lost city of Archaia has become a home for bands of orcs, goblins, and worse. They use the ruins to strike at nearby villages and raid caravan routes. Others think there is more to these groups than meets the eye...\nAre you brave (or foolish) enough to enter The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia?\nWHAT IS THE FORBIDDEN CAVERNS?\nThis Kickstarter campaign is designed to support the creation of a new megadungeon adventure called The Forbidden Caverns of Archaia (Forbidden Caverns or FCA).\nForbidden Caverns is designed for Labyrinth Lord but can be played with any Old School Role-Playing Game (or their clones) from the 70s and 80s such as B/X, First or Second edition, OSRIC, or Swords and Wizardry. This scenario can also be played with the DCC RPG with conversions.\nThis new medgadungeon adventure is designed to support a medieval fantasy campaign lasting months and years. FCA will support first through high level play.\nI estimate the final draft to be between 180-250 pages and approximately 500-600 encounter areas. If you are unfamiliar with Barrowmaze Complete, that project was 259 pages in a two-column format (cover to cover) and well over 600 encounter areas (excluding the barrow mounds). PDF poster maps will be in both black and Old School blue.\nForbidden Caverns opens with a gazeteer of the region in which the adventure takes place. This includes a cultural history as well as the detailing of several small villages that provide a base of operations for an extended campaign. Like the mounds in Barrowmaze, Forbidden Caverns also provides some low hanging fruit above-ground to get wise players started. The project includes a large outdoor map of the canyon ruins with individual encounter areas broken down. The dungeon proper will be leveled and connected to the great mountain that looms on the horizon above the canyon ruins. This approach merges my own particular style with inspiration drawn modules like the Caves of Chaos and Night's Dark Terror.\nMy local gaming group is playtesting this adventure.\nRemember prices are in Canadian Dollars so there's AWESOME SAVINGS for all my peeps in the United States and abroad. If you are unfamiliar, the 2015 average conversion for the year was $1.00 USD = 70 cents CAD. The average for the last year (June 2015 to June 2016) was $1.00 USD = .67 cents CAD (citation: bankofcanada.ca). \nHere are some samples from Barrowmaze Complete with the cover by ex-TSR artist Erol Otus. The cover and page samples represent the style you can expect with The Forbidden Caverns of the Archaia:\nBarrowmaze Complete Samples\nWHO AM I?\nMy name is Dr. Greg Gillespie. I am an Associate Professor (Tenured) of Popular Culture at a university in Ontario, Canada. I regularly teach a senior undergraduate course entitled The History and Culture of Role-Playing Games (for realz). I am also the author/designer of a very popular Old School megadungeon called Barrowmaze Complete. You can read widely about Barrowmaze on the internet or you can find it here.\nI have a very successful, crowdfunding track-record. I completed three crowdfunding campaigns over the last four years either on-time or ahead of schedule. You can find them on Indiegogo. Through my professional expertise, I know how to create, manage, and deliver outstanding game projects.\nART AND THE OLD SCHOOL\nIn my opinion, crafting an OSR dungeon is about much more than creating an adventure. It is about celebrating the origins of the hobby, the classic fantasy gaming experience, and understanding that dungeon crawling isn't supposed to be about long exhausting combats but rather an equal mix of exploration, combat, and role-play. These values are very important to me and find expression in both gameplay and aesthetics. Just like Barrowmaze, Forbidden Caverns will place a premium on amazing art. I will get the band back together including the talents of Cory Hamel, Zhu Bajie, Stefan Poag, Peter Pagano, Trevor Hammond, and Stephen Thompson.\nSimilar to Barrowmaze, every monster in the monster section will have its own illustration. In the past I have worked with former TSR artists Erol Otus, Jim Holloway, and Tim Truman. I hope to work with these and other TSR illustrators again on this project for a colour cover and also interior art.\nCory Hamel has created some fantastic concept illustrations over the time we have worked together to give you an idea of the aesthetic we have in mind for a few of the humanoid monsters. There's more to come!\n  Troll by Cory Hamel\n  Bugbear by Cory Hamel\n  Orcses by Cory Hamel\n  Owlbear by Cory Hamel\nPLAYTESTING\nHere's a pic from our recent playtesting session. The group had their two men-at-arms killed on the way to the canyon and so had to fight off these skeletons down a couple sword arms. I painted all the figures (Cleric by Otherworld), bases by Dragon Forge Designs, and terrain (Dwarven Forge):\nPlaytesting Forbidden Caverns\nMINIATURES\nThe miniatures package add-on includes five old school froglings, three turtle shields, and two bricked-up walls. Bases are not included. The froglings appear in both Barrowmaze and in Forbidden Caverns and are reminiscent of an old Saturday morning cartoon from the 1980s. The miniatures will be cast in metal by RAFM. All sculpts are complete and in-hand.\nFrogling I\n  Frogling II\n  Frogling III\n  Frogling IV\n  Frogling V\n  Bricked-Up Walls\n  Scale with Citadel miniatures\n  The Greens\nSo the full miniatures package includes what you see above: 5 froglings, three shields, and two bricked-up walls. Each miniatures package is $50 CAD (approximately $38 USD) and the price INCLUDES shipping around the world.\nThis add-on is open to all backers and you may add as many as you wish. The miniatures will not be sold individually. A miniatures only pledge level is available at the same prices noted above.\nTHROW-INs and ADD-ONS\nThis project will be detailed, provide depth of engagement, and be super fun for your gaming group. There is no list of stuff to add persay, rather the more funding the campaign receives the more I can invest into and develop the final product. I have an excellent reputation across the interwebs for value-added projects. If you are familiar with Barrowmaze Complete, you already know what to expect.\nORIGINAL JIM HOLLOWAY COVER ILLO\nThis is TSR-ex Jim Holloway's original \"Mummy Attack\" from Barrowmaze II. This piece of art was beautifully and tastefully framed. I spared no expense. See rewards.\nThe Mummy Attack by Jim Holloway\nSUMMARY\nForbidden Caverns is my next sandbox-style dungeon adventure. Similar to Barrowmaze, FCotA will employ the fun (and lethal) design principles essential to the Old School Renaissance. Of course, you can expect the unexpected in my design style and the continued emphasis on traps, tricks, puzzles, logistics, resource management, time, and mind-teasers that make the game worthwhile...and drive your players crazy.\nThank you for taking the time to read this campaign. Those of you who supported Barrowmaze in the past know that it was a labour of love and can expect the same level of enthusiasum and creativity in The Lost Caverns of the Archaia. If you have any questions leave a comment or get in touch. Please be sure to spread the word via your social networking outlets - blogs, forums, facebook, twitter, G+, etc. The grapevine is the best way to spread the word to the OSR community.\nThank you, Greg \\m/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always potential challenges to any large project.

Hundreds of shops and merchants populate the city, and adventure lurks behind every corner. Full-color illustrations of Bard's Gate's notable inhabitants, along with beautifully illustrated maps and a 6-panel poster map enhance the sense of wonder the city brings. Bard's Gate also features eight different adventures in and around the city, taking characters from 1st level to 10th or higher.\nThe city of Bard\u2019s Gate sits at the heart of the The Lost Lands campaign setting. From here trade routes connect to the north, south, east, and west and gold flows through the fingers of the corrupt and the righteous. A city of artists, thinkers, and innovators, Bard\u2019s Gate stands at the very forefront of civilization and is seen as a shining example of human endeavor by some ... and as a stinking cesspool of greed and manipulation by others.\nSometimes known as the City of Thousand Gods, Bard\u2019s Gate has no less than two High Altars to major deities of the Lost Lands, yet both are in decline, and small shrines or street chapels to countless other deities, some of whose rise to popularity has put them on par or even ahead of the old gods of the city. At the same time some of the most powerful cults of evil deities and demon lords thrive within the city under the very noses of their bitterest enemies.\nKnown alternately as the City of Bards or the City of the Lyre for its famous Bard\u2019s College, many of the greatest heroes of the lands got their start in Bard\u2019s Gate or at least passed through it at some point in their careers. And the many bard\u2019s tales and songs that were first penned within the city prove the truth of these claims.\nIf Rappan Athuk has been the foundation and Barakus the bricks of the Lost Lands from its beginnings with Necromancer Games, then Bard\u2019s Gate is the mortar that has held it all together and given GMs the means to both connect the many, many adventures and game products of the last decade-and- a-half and from which to launch many a campaign.\nNow with the release of The Lost Lands: Bard\u2019s Gate, the original Bard\u2019s Gate book by Necromancer Games is updated to Pathfinder, Swords & Wizardry, and 5e rules and is greatly expanded with new city areas, new adventures set in and around the city, and a ton of new background information including internal and external politics, military influence, and a Lost Lands timeline of the area that extends back almost 10,000 years and firmly cements numerous Frog God Games and Necromancer Games publications into their place in the Lost Lands.\nAdd Ons\n$12 B&W Player's Guide\n$12 Bonus B&W Modules #1\n$15 Full Color Vellum Map of Bard's Gate (LOCKED)\n$40 Full Color PDF\n$100 Full Color Hardcover Book\n$200 Full Color 77\"x71\" Bard's Gate City Map\n$325 Full Color Leather Book\n$1750 Full Color Metal Book - Custom Blacksmith Forged Cover on your full-color Bard's Gate book: add this to your pledge and you'll receive one of our incredible custom blacksmith forged cover which are hand sewn bound with thick rough leather bound spine.

We have decided to collect shipping fees through BackerKit for the following reasons:  \nCollecting shipping fees during the campaign artificially increases the funding level of the campaign. \n Collecting shipping fees through BackerKit prevents our backers from having to pre-pay for shipping months in advance. \n By collecting shipping fees shortly before fulfillment, we will be able to most accurately determine shipping costs based on actual book weights instead of estimating.\n All backers are required to pay additional shipping charges beyond their pledge. Please refer to FAQ at the bottom of the page for estimated shipping charges. These charges will be assessed for payment upon completion of a BackerKit survey which will sent after the successful conclusion of this Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only foreseeable risk is if our production facility gets backlogged or if there is a production delay. Our printer is a large producer of college text books and yearbooks, so depending on the time of year they can have a suddenly busy production schedule. We have been using them for our big books for the last 5 years, and they have always been reliable, but if our order gets caught in a text or yearbook crush it can cause delays in the printing. This has not been a problem to date but is always a remote possibility.\n\nA production delay could include lost files due to a computer crash (we have backups), or if one of our key people suffers real-life difficulties such as illness, etc. The books are already written, so this risk is mainly at the layout and shipping phases.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "New Humble Bundle for Pathfinder", "update_content": "FGG has just opened the 2018 PF Humble Bundle.

Trollzah!\nWHAT IS MONSTERS & TREASURE OF AIHRDE?\nA bone stomping, flesh grinding, blood splattering monster book, filled with all manner of creatures, from lesser dragons to eldritch goblins, from the whip wielding weevil to the devil lord mogrls. It's a veritable host of death and destruction.\nMT of A has over 150 monsters and a small mountain of specialized magic items that originated in the Troll Lord's Aihrde campaigns. Each entry is a complete monster, playable in any setting, but is followed by an \"In Aihrde\" section for those who wish to know more about it in the World of Aihrde. This book was originally release in 2011 as a softcover book. It was re-released as a hardcover book in 2012. The original print runs at 176 pages.\nNOT FAMILIAR WITH CASTLES & CRUSADES? SEE BELOW\nNOT FAMILIAR WITH WORLD OF AIHRDE? SEE BELOW\nIt's plain and simple. If we hit our goal of $2,500.00, we'll re-print this book in softcover form (perfect bound). A small hop and a skip to $5000.00 and we will print it in hardcover; $15,000.00 and we'll do a full color version. Furthermore, if the project grows we'll add more monsters (some new, some from other Aihrde sources), more magic and monster player character classes.\nWe are down to a few scant copies of this book and we want it to stay in print. We really want to expand it, make sure it stays in hardcover, include monster player classes, more monsters (new and from other sources), magic and if possible, if we can get enough backers to bring it out in full color.\nMonsters & Treasure of AIhrde was written by Stephen Chenault of Troll Lord Games. One of the three original partners of TLG, he took over the helm in 2003 and has been General Manager ever since. You may have met him an any number of gaming conventions from Gencon to Garycon!\nHe is the author of a host of RPG material and books: The Andanuth, Codex of Aihrde, Mortality of Green, Shades of Mist, Giants Rapture, Castle Keeper Guide (with others), Monsters & Treasure (with Robery Doyel), Players Handbook, and a host of other adventures, articles and short stories.\nSteve will write any additions to the MTA that the Kickstarter may call for.\n$2,500 UNLOCKED: We print the book as is in soft cover format. The book will be 176 pages.\n$3,500 UNLOCKED: We will add an additional 20 monsters to the book. Some of these will be new, others taken from other sources from our book line. The book will be 200+ pages.\n$5,000 UNLOCKED: We will print the book in black and white, but in hardcover.\n$6,000 UNLOCKED: We'll make two playable classes derived from the monsters in the book. These will appear in an appendix in the book. Probably the Ungern and the Koth.\n$7,000: SECRET DOOR REVEALED! Monster cards. We'll produce 10 cards with all the relevant stats on them. Digital copies available to $20 and $25 dollar backers. An exclusive signed and numbered deck to $40, $45, $65, $75 backers. Five exclusive and signed decks for Retailer Sponsors.\n$7,000: More Monsters! If we reach 7K, we will add 1 monster to the book for every $100 dollars pledged! \n$7,500: Monster musings by Steve Chenault. He'll put in a 20 odd page appendix that covers where many of the monsters came from, whether fevered dream, something he saw on the back of cereal box or his anger at the powers that be. Informative and amusing (well, to Steve anyway). The book will be 220+ pages.\n$9,000: We will add an additional 10 magic items to the book. Some of these will be new, others taken from other sources from our book line.\n$11,000: We will add an additional 10 magic items to the book. Some of these will be new, others taken from other sources from our book line.\n$12,000: We'll make two more playable classes derived from the monsters in the book. These will appear in an appendix in the book. The book will be 230+ pages.\n$13,000: We will add an additional 20 monsters to the book. Some of these will be new, others taken from other sources from our book line. The book will be 250+ pages.\n$15,000: We'll print the book in full color.

These immortal creatures were created in the early days of the world by Ornduhl, the Red God. In their youth they were dwarves, twisted and bound to a path of the Red God's choosing. They became goblins. Though immortal, each was cursed, and their immortality laid bare by one particular action. For instance the thief Arcnur was struck by a blade that pierced his throat, and as he died the Red God found him and gave him new life. But he knew that if any pulled the dagger free it would kill him. But to do so requires a critical hit (natural 20) on a strength check. Read his complete story on THE PORTAL (Free 10 day Trial).\nWe are offering you a chance to create your own goblin and submit it. All the submissions will be compiled in an Appendix in the back of the book. You will be given writer credit as well. Name them how you will and make up their story as you desire. (All content subject to approval). Here is your chance to leave your mark on Aihrde, C&C and the gaming world at large.\nABOUT CASTLES & CRUSADES\nCastles & Crusades is a fantasy role playing game with countless possibilities. Designed for use with multiple players, Castles & Crusades puts you in charge of the adventure path. Included within are all the rules of play, how to get started in your very own role playing game, how to run the game and play in it. It\u2019s an easy to learn, attribute-based rules system that allows players to choose among 13 archetypal character classes and 7 races to create their characters. Spells, equipment, fast-paced combat rules, and all essential information needed to play a game of Castles & Crusades are in the Castles & Crusades Players Handbook. The MT of A enhances the game you are going to love to play.\nWant to know more about the game? Check out this page on our website.\nABOUT THE WORLD OF AIHRDE\nAihrde is a complete world and campaign setting for your favorite RPG game. An in-depth history, mythology, descriptions of all the races of the world, from dwarves to giants and elves to orcs, a case by case study of all the relevant kingdoms and peoples and the geographical regions. The world is complete and can be enhanced with a 18 x 24 inch map in the main book, plus maps in tubes, spring rollers and more. \nREAD MORE HERE. For a review scroll to the bottom of that page.\nShipping costs will be assessed during our survey, which will come from BackerKit soon after the Kickstarter closes.  Please Note:  We try to keep shipping costs at a minimum.  While this is mainly a book oriented Kickstarter, any add-ons or extra books or merchandise (if any is offered) may cause the shipping price to rise, especially if the order is international (out of the US).  Please contact productsupport@trolllord.com if you have any questions about shipping before you pledge.\nTrack us to our goal and beyond!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoving a product line from black & white to color is a huge risk. The costs associated with the improvement are large. The interior pages need redesigned, the art converted from black and white to color, the whole of it needs to be integrated. Paper concerns in the actual printing play a role, as some papers absorb color better than others. The cost of printing the physical books is large as well, usually double what it costs to print in black & white.\n\nTo bring all three main C&C books out in color is a large leap for TLG and will take a pretty penny to do so.

We want you all to recover from the fall 2015 lineup, and decided to produce a smaller book this time around. Our focus this time around is on 5th Edition and Swords and Wizardry.\n\nWith pride and fanfares of trumpets we introduce Quests of Doom 3, another volume of adventures worth winning, from the incomparable and brilliant minds behind Frog God Games. (That\u2019s us! See what we did there?). With this trove of places and challenges, you can explore the perils of the Maighib Desert, or the druid Niavark\u2019s forested demi-plane of vengeance, and many other locations where only brave-hearted adventurers would want to set foot.\n\nEach chapter of the book is a stand-alone module that can be placed anywhere in your own campaign world, wherever you need it. The adventures are not a series, and are not linked to each other. So pick and choose them in whatever order you want, switch them up, break them into parts and reassemble them \u2014 this is a free-form resource for the resourceful game master!\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Lost Lands world setting by Frog God Games, each chapter contains information about where it is located in the world. Like we said, though, don\u2019t feel constrained by the way we organize our campaign world, because we\u2019re talking about your campaign world.\n\nThe adventures are converted from ancient manuscripts written in the arcane languages of Pathfinder or 3rd Edition and we have converted them to 5th Edition and Swords & Wizardry, re-crafting them as if they had been written with the 5th Edition and Swords & Wizardry rules from the beginning. We convert adventures for the system, not just by the numbers, and we\u2019re very proud of the results here. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy running these adventures as much as we enjoyed writing them.\n\n\nThis new book is a hardcover compilation of 6 adventures for $32 (retail later is $35). These include:\n\n1) King of Beasts\u2014by Tom Knauss\n2) Child's Play\u2014by Tom Knauss\n3) Canyons of Arcuri\u2014Jeff Harkness and Gary Schotter\n4) Madness Grows\u2014by Tom Knauss\n5) My Blue Oasis\u2014by Tom Knauss\n6) Niavark's Revenge\u2014by Patrick Lawinger\nStretch Goals\nAt $12,000, we will add a 7th adventure to the main book, at no additional cost to you! Red Wedding by Tom Knauss. Red Wedding is a 4th-level adventure of forbidden passion and its unintended consequences. Though love creates life and beauty, its denial sows anger and hate. When young lovers are forever separated, one turns to a dark power for vengeance, and the other rises from the netherworld as a frightful monstrosity.\nAt $15,000, we will add an 8th adventure to the main book, at no additional cost to you! Howl of the Wolf, by Bill Webb and Clark Peterson. The Howl of the Wolf is a short adventure designed for 4 to 6 characters of 3rd to 5th level, but can be modified to accommodate higher- or lower-level characters by using the \u201cScaling the Adventure\u201d sidebar.\nAdd-Ons\nQuests of Doom 1, Volume 1\u20145e $30\nQuests of Doom 1, Volume 2\u20145e, $20\nQuests of Doom 1 (volumes 1-2)\u2014SW, $45\nQuests of Doom 2\u20145e, $20\nBook of Lost Spells\u20145e, $40\nFifth Edition Foes\u20145e, $40", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only foreseeable risks are if our primary production facility is unable to fulfill our order.

The crooks are a little ticked off to find out that Bean's flat rate fee accounts for almost all of the proceeds, but business is business.\nShe's gonna need a bigger stun-gun...\nThe next day, Bean and his heavily-armed assistant, Rally Vincent (deadly with both gun and frying pan), receive a visitor with a young girl in tow.\nMinor character Morris gets Majorly Messed Up\nThe visitor barely has time to beseech them to return the girl to her father before a hit-team swiss-cheeses Bean's apartment. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't have Bean's taste in clothes (all Kevlar, including his underwear!)\nProfessional Driver... Do not attempt!\nBean and Rally bundle little Chelsea into the car and make tracks. Alas, what they don't know is that the kidnappers have already made off with the $2,000,000 ransom, leaving them to take the rap. Will Bean discover the ruse in time and get the money for himself? Will he be able to evade the relentless pursuit of Inspector Percy? And most importantly, how much will the Chicago P.D.'s insurance company raise their rates?\nThis limited-edition Blu-Ray release is a \"High Octane Edition\" for a reason. We will be using the same uncompressed HD transfer as the recent Japanese release, but using a BD50 instead of BD25 for a higher bitrate. It will contain both the original Japanese soundtrack and the English dub, plus English subtitles in multicolor, greyscale and SDH variants (or you can watch with no subtitles if you prefer). The disc will not be region-coded, and we can ship it anywhere in the world except for Japan, China and Taiwan.\n(possible poster image; backers will vote on which one we use)\nOther bonus materials include a 9-panel insert sheet with mini-poster, printed program notes and other cool stuff, as well as color artwork, line art (settei), after-recording script, and more. As much as possible, everything will be available both on the disc and online. And of course, all backers will be credited on the disc!\n(Actually, we prefer credit cards and PayPal)\nThe High Octane Edition will only be sold via crowdfunding and direct sales on our website. It will never be available for less than the crowdfunding price. While we currently do not intend to release a regular commercial version of Riding Bean on Blu-ray, if we do it will be in different packaging and will not include any extra physical stretch-goal bonuses.\nRegular Reward Levels\nDigital backers ($5) get access to the data archive, which includes high-resolution graphics, settei, and the original after-recording script.\nRegular backers ($25) get the basic Blu-ray in a premium transparent Amaray case with a reversible sleeve, so there will be two cover variants to choose from, and a 9-panel printed insert with liner notes and a mini-poster. It also includes a custom embroidered patch. There is no \"early-bird\" level because everyone is getting early-bird pricing -- we don't want anyone to feel like they missed out.\nPatches we did for the first two kickstarters\nPremium backers ($50) get everything in Basic, plus a packaging upgrade to a chipboard case with new original art by Mr. Sonoda and an artbook (approximately 180 pages in color and black&white) that fits in the case with the Amaray.\nSupreme backers ($75) get everything Premium backers get, plus a keychain designed by Mr. Sonoda and a personalized on-disc \"Rally Vincent Gun Safety Course\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code.\nThe embossed keychain we did for Bubblegum Crisis\nHere's a demo of how the custom easter-egg works on Otaku no Video:\nNitrous-Injected backers ($110) get everything the Supreme backers get, plus two additional rewards: a 30mm-scale polyurethane garage kit of Buff the Roadbuster, and a personalized on-disc \"Bean Bandit Offensive Driving School\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code. Note that Nitrous-Injected backers get both certificates!\nOriginal design drawing of Buff the Roadbuster\nPatron backers ($200) get everything Nitrous-injected backers get, plus their name also appears on a startup screen every time the disc is played (as part of the copyright screen; you can skip right to the menus).\nInspector Percy backers ($300) get everything Patrons get, plus they will receive one of the actual production check discs to test and keep -- and thus, be the first to see the (hopefully!) finished Blu-Ray.\nNote about Extra Copies: If you want an extra copy or two, don't worry; we will make addons available after the campaign ends (it's just simpler to do it that way rather than have a ton of different reward categories).\nSimilarly, we will be able to provide a limited number of assembled and painted car models -- and since we're making a 3D model as the first step in the production process, we may be able to do some custom 3D prints as well.\nSpecial Limited Reward Levels\nWe also have several special support levels that will gradually go down in price until someone snaps them up.\nCel backers get everything a Patron gets, plus one of 9 original Riding Bean production cels. Here are the cels:\nCel #3 was signed by Mr. Sonoda in 1996! (Click for larger version)\nSonoda Sketch backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they get a sketch of their favorite Riding Bean character or scene -- personally inscribed if desired.\nHere's an example of one of the sketches Mr. Sonoda did for backers of the Bubblegum Crisis set. Note that these kind of rewards will be shipped from Japan and customs duty may apply.\nIllustration backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they also get a full-color B4-size (250 x 353mm / 9.8 x 13.9\") original illustration Mr. Sonoda is creating for this release -- personally inscribed if desired. The number of rewards in this category will depend on what stretch goals are chosen and achieved -- see below for more details.\nHenchmen backers get everything Patrons get, plus have characters in Mr. Sonoda's manga modeled after them. Similarly, Innocent Bystanders have background characters modeled after them.\nAnd finally, the Criminal Mastermind backer gets everything a Patron gets, plus he/she gets listed as the Criminal Mastermind on the packaging! And we'll include 4 extra sets as well.\nOur shipping department will treat your rewards with great care...\nShipping Details\nOn this project, we're charging a shipping fee on all orders, as opposed to giving US backers \"free\" shipping (which isn't really free, it's just bundled in). One reason we're doing this is because it helps establish the correct customs value for international shipments.\nCustoms costs, VAT and \"processing fees\" are a major annoyance for international backers, and we want to do everything we can to minimize or eliminate this hassle. That's why we're pleased to announce that this project is EU and Canada-friendly.\nThis means that we'll be shipping copies directly to fulfillment houses in Canada and the UK (who will then reship to backers in the EU). The extra cost of doing this (and the customs fees we pay upfront) have been baked into the shipping charge on a country-by-country basis:\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $5 shipping.\nEverywhere else: $15 shipping.\nPremium Sets (and higher levels or multiple sets):\nUS: $7 shipping.\nCanada/UK/EU: $20 shipping.\nElsewhere: $25 shipping.\nShipping costs have had to rise since our previous projects because of increased costs. In particular, USPS First Class Mail International rates have hugely increased for packages over 8oz (and the Premium Set will be over 1lb).\nNote that the shipping cost is a flat rate; if you later add on extra sets or other goodies, the maximum shipping cost is the Premium Set cost.\nWe will ship to non-CA/EU international backers directly from the USA using USPS International First Class Mail. Backers in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway should not have any extra fees because the price of the basic set ($25) is below the personal exemption for those countries.\nWe will check into possibly doing local fulfillment for countries with significant order sizes (based on previous projects, the most likely candidates are AU/NZ). Whether or not it is cost-effective depends on a lot of factors, but if it can save some money we'll either refund the difference or give credit that can be used for addons.\nWe have created a Customs Estimator spreadsheet that backers in other countries can use. If your country is not listed, we would greatly appreciate it if you could research how costs are calculated in your country and let us know so we can update it.\nYou can help tune this project...\nCrowdProduction\nAs with our previous limited-edition releases, there are going to be opportunities for you to get involved in the actual work of producing the set. Backers who do substantial work on the project will get credit on the packaging and on the disc, an IMDb listing, extra copies of the set for family and friends, and a special CrowdProduction bonus item.\nCrowdProduction opportunities include (but are not limited to):\nCleaning up and curating the images.\nTranslation of the commentary track(s).\nSubtitle proofreading.\nPackaging, Disc Art and Logo design.\nLiner Notes Research.\nArtbook Design.\nContact us when the project makes its basic goal if you're interested in taking on the challenge.\nHow it feels to manage a crowdfunding project...\nAchieved Stretch Goals\n$40,000 - REACHED IN 2 HOURS! New Sonoda artwork for the Amaray case sleeve. Mr. Sonoda will create a new cover illustration for the Blu-ray case. This stretch goal unlocks an \"Illustration\" reward that delivers the original artwork.\n$60,000 - REACHED IN 8.5 HOURS! New Riding Bean Manga. Mr. Sonoda will create a new 4-page manga ministory for the insert and artboook. This stretch goal unlocks 3 \"Henchman\" rewards -- backers will be used as models for characters in the manga (and knowing Sonoda, will probably die horribly) -- these rewards will go live at 4pm ET on Monday, March 7th.\n$90,000 - REACHED IN 3.1 DAYS! Japanese Commentary Track featuring Mr. Sonoda and 1-2 other Japanese commentators.\n$110,000 - REACHED IN 21 DAYS! Expanded Sonoda Riding Bean manga - 8 pages instead of 4; unlocked additional \"Henchman\" rewards\nRemaining Stretch Goals\n$130,000 - English Commentary Track with Anime Historian Gilles Poitras\n$135,000 - Reprint of Riding Bean Manga (in both digital form and in the artbook) - Reduced from $140k as a special thank-you!\n$170,000 - New Riding Bean Song by David Garfield and Phil Perry!\nYou've got questions... we've got answers...\nCan I sign up using PayPal?\nNow that the campaign has reached its basic goal, PayPal signup is available on our website. We ask that people only use this if they cannot back the project via Kickstarter.\nWhat about subtitles in other languages?\nA major reason the Bubblegum Crisis set had authoring delays was that it had so many subtitle tracks (6 languages x 2 variants) that it caused the authoring system to crash! So we'd prefer to keep it simple(r).\nCan I order extra copies?\nWe will make additional copies available (at a discount) as an add-on after the campaign ends.\nWhat about doing a Challenge Coin?\nWe love the challenge coin we did for Bubblegum Crisis, and we'd like to do one for Riding Bean as well, but we think it's best to do it as a separate add-on. After the campaign is over, we'll poll people to figure out how many would like a coin, and if it is feasible, we'll do one. Note that we are definitely doing a keychain, and the Bubblegum Crisis one came out great!\nCan I get one of the previous Limited Edition Kickstarter Blu-rays?\nYes! We still have a few of the Bubblegum Crisis Utimate Edition sets left, and you can still sign up for the Otaku no Video Otaking Edition, which is about to go into production!\nWho is running the project?\nRobert Woodhead is one of the founders of AnimEigo, one of the original wave of Anime releasing companies. Over the years AnimEigo has released hundreds of Anime and Samurai film titles in both dubbed and subtitled form. He's the creative and technical guy.\nUEKI Natsumi is Robert's wife and partner. She's a level-headed businesswoman who describes her career as \"a quarter-century of successfully preventing Robert from bankrupting the company.\"\nTrivia: Okada Toshio of Gainax once told us that \"Everyone wants to be the second person to do business with you.\" Riding Bean was the first title AnimEigo licensed directly from Japan; its success paved the way for everything that came later.\nCredits: Thanks to Google, Freepik, Vaadin, Dot on Paper, and Flaticon.com for icons used in the campaign graphics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are confident that we will be able to meet or beat the December release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays.

Its modular design is tremendously influential among game designers, and it's great to see it roar back onto the scene.\" - MIKE SELINKER, Designer of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Co-Designer, Betrayal at House on the Hill\nI conceived Battlestations in 1999 as a unique tabletop experience: It's the first and only board game/RPG hybrid of its kind, and the absolute best tabletop experience in the genre of fantastical sci-fi. This is space opera done right: a board game with rules to accommodate almost any decision you could make, but it's simple and logical enough to quickly jump into a campaign. The scope is as big as you want it to be, and there are already hundreds of missions and a community of thousands of Battlestations players all around the world.\nInside this box is an infinity of alien worlds to explore, rickety spacecrafts to upgrade, and a rowdy crew of lifelong comrades to adventure with. Join us!\nBattlestations is a multi-map board game that simultaneously features ship-action in space AND the events on board the ships involved in the conflicts. Several video games like FTL have emulated this concept, but Battlestations is still the true original, and still the only board game that puts you on board a starship with ongoing adventures for your characters learn from and grow.\nThe game rules are very simple but they allow for complex RPG-like imaginative choices like teleporting to an enemy ship, hacking their helm controls and steering their ship towards a black hole before ejecting yourself out the air lock.\nI love Starfleet Battles for the space combat but it doesn't depict what is actually happening on board the ships. Space Hulk and several other games allow for movement around a ship, but the ships themselves don't move. So in 1999 my brother Jason Siadek and I planned to develop a video game, which proved too expensive, and so Battlestations the board game was born.\nBattlestations has been slowly building a loyal community over 16 years and I've been hard at work preparing this brand new edition. It is the full realization of my ultimate vision, and the culmination of my abilities as a designer, writer, and wide-eyed adventurer.\n4 Zoallan aliens\n4 Tentac aliens\n4 Xeloxian aliens - help us choose the weapons or tools\n4 Silicoid aliens\n2 Human (standing pose)\n2 more Human (standing pose)\nWe've redone the rulebook from scratch, using a tutorial method to teach the Enemy player new rules in each mission. Once you know the core rules and have played the first few missions, you'll be ready to delve into our Advanced rulebook with 300 pages of new weapons, aliens, missions, and deeper abilities like psionics.\nDownload the QuickStart Rules (Draft v2) or Sample Characters\nGerman Quickstart Rules. \nThese links are out of date.

Peacetime advancements released the vast resources of a sea of stars like a cosmic pi\u00f1ata. We need capable explorers. The more dangers that present themselves, the more opportunities for lowly travelers to ascend to become true heroes. There are thousands of stars and hundreds of living planets. Do well by the cosmos to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity. And if you die trying... well, there's a confused naked replacement you, waiting back at base!\nThe universe of Battlestations has been growing for 16 years. The flavor and mythology of the world has been embedded into the missions themselves, so players can discover new aspects of this future for themselves. There's a lot of emergencies happening on board your starship. Will you be a hero when the time arises?\nComplete Art Overhaul and Miniatures: Finally the game is getting the look it always deserved, and the game will come with at least 38 plastic 28mm miniatures with 1 inch square bases. (The new rules are still compatible with your old components for the most part.)\nNew Rulebook: First Edition was successful and received critical praise, but the rulebook left a lot to be desired. We've tightened the rules into a strong, robust system that will survive any adventure you throw at it, and we are redesigning the rulebook from scratch to better serve the fans.\nImprovements: In Second Edition we sped up the starships, reduced ship sizes and balanced Special Abilities and weapons \u2013 boosting or bundling the weaker ones and adding a lot of exciting new ones! The grid spaces on the ship maps are now 1 inch and we've increased the size of our miniatures from .7 inches to 1 inch as well. Miniatures come with snap-on colored bases so you don't have to go hunting for a yellow (pilot) Silicoid \u2013 now you can just grab a Silicoid and add the yellow base.\nIn addition, there are mysteries and surprises inside this box... I hope you'll allow yourself to fall deep into the world and characters contained within. This is not just first edition with an art upgrade. This is a complete top-down rebuild, keeping the good and ditching the bits we didn't like.\nBonus Content and Missions: We will be adding stretch goals throughout the campaign to make each box better. This Kickstarter version is the most complete version of Battlestations yet released, and we will specifically offer bonus missions and updates to our Kickstarter backers on an ongoing basis.\nNone of the components are exclusive but the Add-ons like bonus stretch goal minis or the Whaloid may not be immediately available post-Kickstarter. So if you want more than 1 copy of the stretch goal minis, get the Add-ons now.\nAlso, during this campaign Kickstarter backers save money off the retail price, and we'll ship them the games a few weeks prior to retail (in most cases). The more support we get now, the better the game will be when it comes out. \nWe will use a Pledge Manager post-campaign to handle shipping and the cost is added at checkout. Buying multiple copies reduces your shipping to $50 max for all copies you order.\nDomestic shipping is FREE for retailers, so if you can convince your FLGS to buy copies, you will save on shipping.\nThese costs assume the weight of the advanced rulebook is included.\nUSA, CA, FR: $17 USD. \nWESTERN EU, CN, HK, TW, PR: $30 USD\nPH, TH, JP, KR, MY, AU, SG, & VN: $33 USD\nNZ, CH, NO, MX, HR, IS, ID, and CENTRAL EU: $42\nAnywhere Else: $50\nNo backer who orders multiple copies will pay more than $50 TOTAL for shipping, even though I'll have to eat some of the cost to some countries. So partner with friends for the double-copy tier if you live in far away lands.\nIf for some reason you are not satisfied with the cost of shipping at that time, you can receive a full refund (minus Kickstarter and Stripe fees). We hope this transparency is acceptable to you - it makes things less stressful on us and it prevents the common problem of some backers over paying for shipping while others under pay. Let us know if you have questions or comments about this.\nSome states require sales tax. We're very sorry. Shipping to Central EU is crazy expensive and I'm sorry. But the game will be worth it.\nWestern EU is Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal,Spain, Sweden, and UK. Central EU is Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Thank you Jamey for letting us appropriate some of your work on this.\nFree Local Pickup Shipping Option\nWhen completing your backer survey post-Kickstarter, you'll be able to select local pickup for Southern California, Origins (Columbus, OH), Gen Con (Indianapolis, IN), BGG Con (Dallas, TX) or at the Spiel convention in Essen, Germany 2017.\nPRESS KIT\nPRESS KIT\nYou have permission to reproduce any portion of this page for content that promotes it.

New archetypes, paths, colleges, circles, domains, traditions, oaths, origins, pacts and schools - in most cases, these are how your character gains a familiar or other companion. \n7. Bestiary with a wealth of new monsters and animals for your campaign. \n8. New Feats and Advantages - a new form of special ability that works in a similar manner to feats but represents more supernatural abilities. \n9.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game you've been waiting for! Play as one of the four turtle brothers (and some of their trusted allies), and defend New York City from thugs, ninjas, and of course the Shredder!\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shadows of the Past is a story-driven adventure game for two to five players who will duel it out street by street and mission by mission to save (or conquer) New York. The game is based off of IDW's ongoing comic book universe and features missions taken straight from some of the series' biggest moments. Designed by the legendary Kevin Wilson (Descent, Arkham Horror) with input from Kevin Eastman and IDW's entire TMNT creative team, this highly thematic adventure features incredible mechanics and gameplay. You've seen dice-chucking combat, but this is dice-nunchucking at its finest!\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nThis campaign's going to allow us to take a great game and make it amazing through the addition of a set of stretch goals we're incredibly excited to reveal and\u2014with your help\u2014unlock!\nMore importantly, with a game this involved, it's great to have an opportunity to interact with the fans.

THIS SIMULATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hero Combat System:\nEach Hero player in the game receives their own custom set of dice and Special Move cards uniquely matched to their character's fighting style. \nWhile it's fun to have your own unique dice and moves, what really sets this game apart is the shared dice mechanic once combat begins.\nEach round, every Hero player simultaneously rolls their dice then lays them out in front of their play area, strategically positioning their dice from left to right in order to lend help to their fellow players. \nThis means that on the active player's turn, they'll have access to their own dice and their teammates' closest dice on each side of their character. This innovative system helps save players from useless rolls and thematically expresses how closely knit the team is. The only way to defeat the Foot Clan is to truly fight as one. It's the ultimate co-operative system.\nLeonardo Hero pack\nEach hero has their own sheet with unique stats, a set of special moves, and custom dice that highlight their specific fighting style.\nShredder Villain pack\nThe Villain player will build a custom deck of action cards depending on which characters they have access to during the scenario.\nThe Villain deck will be used to activate minions or leaders in combat with play alternating between heroes and villains each turn.\nORIGINAL ART TIER\nFor the original art tier, Kevin Eastman is illustrating completely unique images on blank hardcover books!\n*ART SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY LICENSOR*\nKICKSTARTER ECXLUSIVITY\nAll assets label with the Kickstarter Exclusive button will only be given to backers of this campaign.

At its core lie the descriptions of pantheons for the main races and cultures of the Great Caldera, their individual deities, their mythologies, alliances, and foes. Each chapter reveals the history of the ancient peoples who summoned these gods into existence and established their cults. A significant part of this compendium details special powers mortal followers and priests can earn, based on the strengths of their piety. \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d goes on to flesh out myriad servants of the gods, demons, demigods, divine cabals, the politics of pantheons and their internal rivalries, the bond between tribal shamans and Calidar\u2019s World Soul, the spirit lords of the Dread Lands, secret societies and knightly orders among mortals, right down to death and what lies beyond. This book provides quite a lot of mechanical bits to enhance the game in addition to mythologies, secret plots, and the floor plans of temples and secret brotherhood lairs, each an invitation for encounters and adventures.\nMuch like those of ancient Greece, gods interact with mortals and epic heroes in game of chess reaching past nearby planets and outer planes. However powerful they are, they face a world of dangers including another universe whose monstrous deities seek to devour all: from the masses of mortals to their divine patrons. They will not relent until, perhaps, they gobble the World Souls themselves\u2014the magical core and the source of life of the planets in Soltan\u2019s ephemeris. As bleak as Calidar\u2019s future may seem, the gods fear that their deaths aren\u2019t the worst of fates. This aspect of their peril-fraught existence is one element contributing to the dynamics of this fantasy setting, as it directly affects the players\u2019 heroes and the realms in which they go on adventuring. This compendium is crucial as it will influence all future titles published in this series.\nAll told, this book includes a minimum of 220 color pages, up to 260 with all stretch goals unlocked, approx. 8.5\u201d x 11.5\u201d. Text comes close to 200,000 words, tightly fitted. It provides at least 10 geographic maps showing the extent of cults in the realms of the Great Caldera, 10 full-page floor plans depicting the temples of leading deities, 11 more floor plans for the lairs of secret societies, and 8 diagrams detailing the personal relationships of the gods within their pantheons. A team of illustrators stands at the ready to produce matching illustrations, which is the main purpose of this crowd-funding effort. The more successful it is today, the more art will grace the pages of this compendium, with an end goal of one illustration for each of 89 gods.\nImportant: Ownership of the first title, Calidar \u201cIn Stranger Skies,\u201d is recommended to better enjoy this book (see add-ons, later on this page--the PDF is available there for just $6). \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d does not demand any specific role-playing game system, as all provided materials are designed to be easily converted.\nWant to know more? Click here for a detailed overview of \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d\nDirectly inspired from the Princess Ark\u2019s popular medieval-fantasy stories, adventures in the World of Calidar focus on a flying skyship and its heroic crew as they became stranded in Stranger Skies. Much like TSR\u2019s original D&D Gazetteers, the first Calidar book fleshed out the wayward crew\u2019s new home, the Kingdom of Meryath. It was nominated for the 2014 RPG Geek Awards\u2019 Best RPG Supplement. It also is a top rated RPG accessory on EnWorld.  A number of gazetteers are intended to follow, each depicting a realm of the Great Caldera, Calidar\u2019s \u201cknown world.\u201d\nFrom Neuroglyph on EnWorld: \"In Stranger Skies is a really fascinating and unique world setting offered to the gaming community by a veteran RPG designer. The details about the Soltan Ephemeris and its planets and moons really transports the heroes to a wondrous new world where the sky is no longer the limit, and multiple worlds offer potentially unlimited exploration and questing opportunities.\"\nFrom the Other Side blog: \"In a sea of \"grim dark\" settings Calidar brings back magic, fantasy and adventure to \"D&D\" and any game you care to use it with.\"\nFrom Dreamlands:  \"It is a very successful introduction to a setting, and a brilliant way of conveying the mood and feel of the setting that Bruce is aiming for much more compellingly than a mere description could.\"\nFriedrich Ulf R\u00f6hrer-Ertl \"They are too beautiful. The cloth map of [Thorfinn's] work is the main reason I will back the Kickstarter at Admiral level.\"\nMany thanks to the original backers of \u201cIn Stranger Skies,\u201d who made this world come to life! Thank you!\nOur objective today is to commission quality art for the cover and internal illustrations, as well as editing and layout. Text is already written. Maps and diagrams are done. As stretch goals are met, more art will be added with the final ambition of one illustration for each of the gods, pushing the book\u2019s page count to 260. Subject to the success of this crowd-funding effort, several artists have stepped forward to illustrate \u201cBeyond the Skies.\u201d\nDen Beauvais is one of the most prolific and versatile artists in the field of Fantasy/Science Fiction today or in any venue he passionately explores. He has won numerous awards for his cover art for books, magazines, game boxes , comics books and a host of other mediums. His artwork is widely sought after by collectors and has graced classic book covers by such renowned authors as Isaac Asimov, Margaret Weis, Piers Anthony and Gordon R. Dickson. Den\u2019s imagination knows no borders. Today, he is a highly sought after artist in the field of fantasy and Science Fiction art.\nJoe Garcia -- \"Hey everyone! I'm a family man, sequential artist, and published gaming illustrator from Henderson, Nevada. I specialize in high contrast, grayscale, pencil drawings, and pen and ink line-work. I took some general high school art classes, however most of my training came from emulating the styles of comic and fantasy artists who could tell a story with a single image. As much as I love illustrating, I always aim to be a storyteller first.\"\nEric Lofgren was born and lives in Western Canada. He's had a long history of working in one graphic field or another. Beginning with two years working in a commercial sign shop and 10 years running his own sign business. Also one year as a digital photo-retoucher, a year full time as a landscape painter and two years as a tattoo artist. And finally, a recognized freelance illustrator in the RPG and CCG markets since 1999.\nBradley K McDevitt -- A 25 year veteran of the gaming industry with over 500 published credits, having done artwork work for WotC/TSR, Goodman Games, Atlas Games, and many more. Additionally, he has been an Art Director for GDW, Dark Skull Studios, and currently works with FASA on the Fading Suns TTRPG. He lives in Ohio with his wife Jessica, and when not drawing monsters, enjoys a wide variety of styles of music, surfing the 'net, as well as writing short stories and role-playing games.\nSimon Todd --  The British artist and writer, Simon Todd, has been involved in fantasy role playing games since he first encountered a box set of Dungeons and Dragons in a post office on Rhode Island in 1979. Although trained as a sculptor specializing in large scale wood carving, Simon turned to writing and illustrating in 2002 and is currently busy developing his own company, MontiDots Ltd, producing new adventures, game settings and board games. Simon has already worked for the likes of GP Adventures and Dungeon Crawl Classics and is becoming a regular feature at Gary Con. Simon lives in Yorkshire with his family.\nThorfinn Tait:  \"I'm a Brit living in northern Japan. My association with Bruce Heard began with my hex maps of Mystara, for which I am well known in the Mystara community. Just over two years ago, he asked me to take charge of Calidar's maps, and I have been assisting his work on Calidar ever since. I have a great passion for maps of all forms, both real and fantasy, which I am now applying with great earnest to my mapmaking efforts.\"\nAlso key in this book\u2019s success are editorial guru and mistress of scrolls, Janet Deaver-Pack, along with website wizard and fearless father of fireworks, Leland Schaidle, without whom many a thing might have fallen apart.  To Leland's credit also are this page's presentation video and its animations.  And yes, there is an author (the guilty party hiding behind everyone)\u2014you might have heard of me as the lead creative and manager of Mystara\u2019s D&D Gazetteers in the 80s and 90s. I also authored the \u201cVoyage of the Princess Ark\u201d series in Dragon Magazine during that time. Luckily, most of my job\u2019s already done! \nImportant: The \"Stranger Skies\" PDF add-on is available with any pledge level.

It brought me to TSR in my twenties. Today I do what I do because it is what I wish. Leaving a few more things behind to be best remembered by is my purpose. A rich man I am not, but an older one certainly. If you can help make my dream come true, then I say to you, \u201cBless your heart, my friend, and happy gaming!\u201d\nJust like all of you, we are fans of the product we are designing, and we stand behind it.

The link to the first project is located in the author's bio.\n\nDesign and Editing:\n\nThe book itself is written and awaiting final editing. Those of you who have backed my first venture (thank you) are familiar with my writing style and design abilities since the 1980s. The writing in the first book was clean and solid. My long-time partner in life, Janet Deaver-Pack, is a published author and a professional magazine contributor. She has produced and edited a number of anthologies along with much of what I\u2019ve been writing during the past decade. We\u2019re confident that \u201cBeyond the Skies\u201d will be as good as \u201cIn Stranger Skies.\u201d\n\nArt, Maps, and Layout:\n\nAll artists involved in this project are long-time professionals in the industry. A substantial part of funds raised in this Kickstarter are intended to finance their work. Thorfinn Tait has already produced geographic maps in his own outstanding style. Thorfinn will also handle the final product layout as he has done already and quite well with the first book. I\u2019ve completed floor plans and diagrams. Leland Schaidle will also bring to life more than a hundred color symbols, badges, and coats of arms which I\u2019d originally drafted. The video on this page speaks highly of Lee\u2019s professional skills.\n\nPrinting & Shipping\n\nAs with the first book, printing will be handled by DTRPG, ensuring the same quality and choices that \u201cIn Stranger Skies\u201d offered. The publisher\u2014me\u2014will handle fulfillment personally, as I did for the first book (successfully I might add). This also means that core rewards for backers in the USA may be bundled with their add-ons, save for the PDFs. All rewards will be printed in and mailed from the United States or the UK. Depending on the contents of rewards, especially at Admiral level, Priority Mail is possible. Hardcover books are intended to be packed in rigid mailers for better protection (an improvement from the first book).

The book also includes a player-friendly, full-color poster map of the city to enhance everyone's enjoyment of the place.\n*No new classes for the Swords & Wizardry version: Matt said \"no.\"\nFrog God Games will be produce the book in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, Fifth Edition, and Swords & Wizardry versions.\nBe wary on the streets at night; not every lamp receives a pyre-beetle after dark...\nOh, and one more thing, The Blight is dark...so very dark. A landscape of desperation and depravity, The Blight takes the usual no-holds-barred gritty adventure style of Frog God Games and cranks it up another notch. The Blight does not violate the restrictions of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Compatibility License and never abandons good taste, but it is gruesome and it does not paint a rosy picture. Consequently the materials of The Blight may not be suitable for some audiences below the age of 13. Forewarned is forearmed, and we always advocate that game products be purchased wisely and age-appropriately.\nThe Blight is a City of Despair, Urban Fantasy Horror, and High Adventure by a Master of the Genre\nIt\u2019s Clark Ashton Smith and China Mi\u00e9ville, Lovecraft and Dickens, Shelley and Carroll all in a festering brew of toil, tears, and injustice just screaming for heroes to clean up the streets (more likely to die\u2014or worse\u2014trying) or anti-heroes to clean up the streets (or at least a little corner in which to set up their own rackets). The Blight is a city that never sleeps but is never fully awake, living in the shadow of its own dark dream. An insane royalty, a corrupt judiciary, a decadent aristocracy, and a half-living proletariat all jumbled together amid a thousand thousand monsters\u2026some of them not even of the human variety.\nThe Blight is also an urban campaign setting that can be lifted as a whole or in part out of the Lost Lands and placed into your own campaign world as needed for those times when you need a thoroughly decadent and corrupt urban environment but don\u2019t have the time invent one from whole cloth. Portability was a primary concern in the creation of the Blight. Even a little corner of the Blight will provide you with hundreds of ideas and opportunities for enthralling urban adventures in your fantasy roleplaying campaign. \nThe Blight is the Return of The Styes from the Late Days of Dungeon Magazine\nThe Blight is over a decade old and has gone by many names. If you\u2019re familiar with Richard Pett\u2019s work, then you may recall a series of adventures that he wrote for Dungeon Magazine set in a decadent urban center called the Styes. A fan favorite, in the final print issue of the magazine, \u201cThe Styes\u201d was chosen as the Top All-time Adventure Location to ever appear in the magazine's hallowed pages. However, when the magazine\u2019s license was not renewed, its print run ended and Richard lost the rights to the setting that was not only his invention but was the setting of his home campaign. Traces of the Styes have appeared here and there over the years, in the Pathfinder adventure Carrion Hill from Paizo, in Rich\u2019s own novel Crooked from Broken Eye Books, but never has he been able to commit the full setting to publication\u2014because of its immensity and because of the fear that he could lose the rights to it once again. \nHowever Frog God Games, working in close cooperation with Richard Pett, has brought the Blight to the Lost Lands where it could shine in all its own grimy glory and through extensive development work with Greg Vaughan make it work seamlessly as a part of the larger world that is the Lost Lands setting. And just as was done when Frog God Games resurrected the long-thought dead-and-buried Razor Coast and brought it finally to print, with publication of The Blight we have finally been able to bring it in all its dank majesty to publication and yet enabled Rich to retain the rights to his brain-child as well.\nThe Blight is a Lost Lands Campaign Expansion\nLest you think we've just turned over the keys of the kingdom to Richard and let him have his way with the Lost Lands (we'd never do that, the cad!), rest assured. The Blight is pure Richard Pett genius, but as with Razor Coast, Sword of Air, and old Necromancer Games titles like Gary Gygax's Necropolis that were not written with the Lost Lands as they currently exist specifically in mind,we've taken what was written and made it very much our own. Greg Vaughan, Bill Webb, and Matt Finch of Frog God Games have extensively reviewed and reworked The Blight to both keep its original Richard Pett flare and yet fit seamlessly and organically into the Lost Lands canon and geography. No rough shoehorning here. The Blight is Lost Lands, and the Lost Lands includes the Blight, and always has...\nThe City-State of Castorhage\nSince the earliest development of the Lost Lands, there has been a city-state called Castorhage sitting upon its rocky, coastal island surrounded by murky tidal waters and the stench and effluvia of its over-burdening population. Part City-State of the Invincible Overlord, part New Crobuzon, and part a surface-world version of Erelhei-Cinlu, Castorhage was where I placed the Styes for my home campaign and where, in my heart of hearts, I always knew the Blight should sit. When the opportunity arose and I approached Richard, he loved the idea and immediately saw Castorhage as the perfect landing pad for his long-wandering city. Don't get me wrong, you can place some or all of the Blight anywhere you like, but in the Lost Lands canon, it is more formally known as Castorhage.\nWelcome to the Blight.\nExcept bodies, you can totally throw bodies down the rocks\nHow the Pledge Levels Work  \nWe learned a thing or two from our previous Kickstarter with the Borderland Provinces, and one of those things was that if we made backing the Kickstarter easier, then it's a win for everyone. As a result, we've organized the pledge levels for this book in the same way: the pledge levels over on the right are organized like a buffet. You don't have to scroll around forever looking for the exact combination you want. Instead, right now, all you have to do is pick the number of hardcovers you want. When you get the BackerKit after the Kickstarter, that's when you tell us which rules-version you want.\nSo right now, it doesn't matter if you want a copy of The Blight in Pathfinder, 5e, or in Swords & Wizardry. Those are the same pledge. You don't have to tell us any more than that until the BackerKit survey. Just pledge for the book at this time, you don't have to specify which one. The same holds true of any of the add-ons below; you just add the dollar amount to your pledge to cover those add-on titles, and then in the BackerKit survey at the end tell us how you want that money allocated between titles and in which versions, where applicable. Please note: Some titles only have a Pathfinder version since they deal with Pathfinder-specific rules that do not have analogs in the 5e and Swords & Wizardry game. But in cases like that, it will be clearly stated in the product descriptions below.\nThe base price for a single volume of The Blight for any rules-version in this Kickstarter is $135. Yes it's steep, but at an estimated 900 pages of campaign and adventure, including a full-adventure path and campaign materials equaling over 550,000 words, it's the equivalent of more than 3 Paizo adventure paths of material for less than the price of 1 -- along with the addition of the pdf for free. Plus with an extra-long Kickstarter campaign that extends through Christmas, we wanted everyone to have plenty of time to back even if they just can't commit the funds right now. The Frogs are well aware that the price of this kind of product is high, and we want to make it as easy for you as possible if you want in.\nAdd Ons Available Now\nFor the prices listed below, you can add these additional products to your pledge. Just designate how you want the extra pledge dollars applied and which version of the product you want (if applicable) on BackerKit at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\n$10 The Blight Poster Map - This is the player-friendly city map that comes with the book available for purchase separately here as well if you only bought the PDF of the book but would like a physical copy of the map to use or just want an extra copy of the map to have around.\n$20 softcover/$8 PDF - The Blight Player\u2019s Guide: Including a copy of the player-friendly poster map of The Blight (above), this book provides information to players about the city, its environs, its various districts, its peoples and personages, and some of its known rumors and hazards.

(Projected retail $29.95)\n$16 softcover/$7 PDF - The Crucible (available in Pathfinder, 5e, and Swords & Wizardry versions): Don\u2019t go to sleep. Some say dreams of fire are haunting the night, and that if you dream of burning, you awaken on fire.\nPeople in the Blight begin to awaken at night burning with an all-too-real fire. Most of them die horribly, spouses or lovers staring in shocked horror at their sudden death throes in the grip of consuming flames. A few of the truly unlucky actually manage to survive -- if living in such a state can be called survival. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the victims of these incinerating dreams, as those among the high and low fall victim to its touch, and the locals each pray that he or she will not be next.\nNow no one dares to sleep.\nBy renowned author and creator of the Blight, Richard Pett, The Crucible is a 7th-level stand-alone adventure of urban horror set in his own crooked city of the Blight. This adventure may not be suitable for children below the age of 13. (Projected retail $19.95)\n$16 softcover/$7 PDF - Bloody Jack (available in Pathfinder, 5e, and Swords & Wizardry versions): All the children of the Blight know the nursery rhymes about Bloody Jack Carver, cautionary tales for naughty or overly inquisitive children to mind their manners and obey their parents. However, their parents know the true horror of those times 30 years ago when the lunatic serial killer known as Bloody Jack Carver stalked the fog-shrouded streets of the Blight and abducted children to murder and mutilate. The killing spree finally ended, though not before the number of dead and missing children had reached into the scores, but the perpetrator himself was never caught or identified. The parents and the Watch gave a collective sigh of relief, hoping that one of the haunted city\u2019s other horrors of the night had perhaps claimed the life of the blood-drenched psychopath and ended his reign of terror once and for all. \nWhen the PCs are deputized and called in to assist in a homicide investigation, though, they find terrifying clues that point to the three-decade-old Bloody Jack killings and signs to indicate that they were just the beginning. Now the PCs are in a race against time across the breadth of the decrepit and deteriorating city that is the Blight as they attempt to stop a killing spree by the child murderer before it can start anew. The PCs\u2019 investigation takes them from the halls of the Capitol and the seedy streets and alleys of Toiltown to the garish carnival piers of Festival and the pollutant-crusted banks of the Great Lyme River. Only they stand between the children of the decayed city and new nursery rhymes being written in their blood. \nBy Frog God Games Creative Director Greg A. Vaughan, Bloody Jack is a stand-alone adventure set in the Blight is for 4th-level characters and was playtested over multiple-day game slots at PaizoCon, North Texas RPG Con, and Pacificon in 2012. All surviving players were summarily executed. This adventure may not be suitable for players under the age of 13.

Those who do soon learn that life\u2014if it can be called that\u2014within its walls is even worse than they feared and the truths that nestle within its inmates are far more distressing than mere madness.\nBy relative newcomer, yet already-well-established Pathfinder author with writing credits in Paizo Adventure Path #99, the Pathfinder Bestiary 5, and the forthcoming Paizo products Ultimate Intrigue and Horror Adventures, Alistair Rigg, Horror in the Sinks is a disturbing adventure for 3rd level characters set in one of the darkest corners of the urban dystopia known as the Blight.

Those who entered the strange doorway nestled between the cheeks of the fa\u00e7ade\u2019s gaping demonic mouth saw a decrepit theatre transformed from a macabre tavern and playhouse into a frightful portrait of the eternal torment that awaits all sinners, and few cabarets rivaled the efficiency of Theatre Infernalis\u2019 leering demonic automatons, macabre mortomatons, and spook house haunts to set patrons screaming into the streets. \nNow rumors tell of the aging and supposedly-cursed proprietor\u2019s deteriorating health and the theatre\u2019s impending sale, and the Artists\u2019 Quarter has been abuzz with those seeking one final fright with a walk through the crucible-licked walls of the infernal house of the macabre before its final curtain call. But are the theatre\u2019s smoke-and-mirrors and cheap scares hiding a truly wicked secret? What is the nature of the curse and illness that afflict the owner?

These will be things not specifically detailed in the main book or any of the adventures, though they could be drawn from any of those where they might have been mentioned in passing and otherwise expanded on. \nTo tell the truth we don't know exactly what they're going to be, because we didn't realize the Kickstarter was going to reach these heights.

These are PDFs that take little bite-size looks at the Lost Lands campaign setting of Frog God Games. They are 100% canonical for the setting and are completely unique in that each provides new canonical information that cannot be found in any other FGG product. They're our gateway product to allow an extremely low-level buy-in for customers to take a look at some of the creative materials and mechanics that the Lost Lands have to offer. But don't take my word for it. Below we've attached a link to a free PDF of one of our previously released Lost Lore article. Town of Glory describes a small frontier town and provides rules on how PCs can not only make it their home but can also grow it and influence its course as their adopted home. It is written using the Pathfinder rules, but all of The Blight: Pathologies will have Pathfinder, 5e, and Swords & Wizardry versions and will be specifically tied into people, places, and things within The Blight itself.

LOCKED\n$300,000 The Blight in Full Color - We will print the main book in full color at no additional cost to the backers who have purchased the book. The additional time needed to secure color art will delay delivery of the book to backers by approximately 3 months. LOCKED\nShipping Costs\nWe had the option of collecting shipping fees during this Kickstarter campaign or through BackerKit. We have decided to collect shipping fees through BackerKit for the following reasons: \nCollecting shipping fees during the campaign artificially increases the funding level of the campaign. \nCollecting shipping fees through BackerKit prevents our backers from having to pre-pay for shipping months in advance. \nBy collecting shipping fees shortly before fulfillment, we will be able to most accurately determine shipping costs based on actual book weights instead of estimating. \nAll backers are required to pay additional shipping charges beyond their pledge. Please refer to FAQ at the bottom of the page for estimated shipping charges. These charges will be assessed for payment upon completion of a BackerKit survey which will sent after the successful conclusion of this Kickstarter.\nTEMPLE DALLAS PLEDGE LEVELS\nThe Temple Dallas 1 pledge level gets you everything in the $440 Knight Bachelor pledge level, PLUS the convention (see below).

While having a focus on archers and crossbowman, they can be used by anyone to reflect the measure of accuracy achieved in a roll!\nConcept\nDescription\nThe Bullseye die features a custom image on each face! While this does mean added cost, it is also very cool! The quantity of arrows on each die face replaces the numerals typically featured on a standard d6. Thus, 1 arrow means a roll of 1, 2 arrows a roll of 2 and so on. The dice are standard 16mm d6s that are very common in the industry. The base color scheme of the dice is white with black coloring.\nNOTE: These dice will *not* be screenprinted. This is a relief type design as with all engraved or molded dice.\nAdditional Colors\nBased on funding levels, multiple color options may become available in addition to white. If more than one color option becomes available, backers can choose what color dice they would like to receive! Any combination of funded colors can be chosen! You can visit our website for visual representations of all the color options.\nNote that a slight color variation may be present for color options other than white. I.e., the final die may be a slightly different hue/shade than the visual image presented for the red, blue, green, etc dice.\nColors!\nIn addition to the base die color (white), additional colors are possible for this project: red, blue, green, beige, yellow, black /white coloring and black w/red coloring! At each target Stretch Goal level below, one of these new colors will become available. This color will be chosen through backer feedback during the funding period. As new colors become available, backers will be able to pick which colors they would like to receive once the Kickstart is completed (any mix of unlocked colors). This will be done through our project survey to be sent to backers once the Kickstart is complete. It's that simple!\nNOTE: ALL COLOR STRETCH GOALS HAVE BEEN UNLOCKED! THANK YOU EVERYONE!\nDagger Die!\nA new die design has been added as a Stretch Goal - the dagger die! In addition to the image below, you can see more images of this new die on our webpage here.\nHow does it work?\nIf we hit our goal for the Dagger Die, all backers from The Merry Men & Women Reward Level and higher will receive one or more dagger dice as part of their order at no additional charge for the dice or shipping. The amount of dice is set based on reward level. This is done to allow us to safely project the order size and set the stretch goal accurately so that that project fulfillment is not at risk. Backers will receive a number of dice based on reward level as below:\nTHE MERRY MEN (and Women!) - 1 dagger die\nWILL SCARLET - 2 dagger dice\nFRIAR TUCK - 4 dagger dice\nLITTLE JOHN - 5 dagger dice\nMAID MARIAN - 7 dagger dice\nTHE LIONHEART - 8 dagger dice\nROBIN OF LOXLEY - 10 dagger dice\nDagger per Arrow!\nIf we reach our $6,000 Stretch Goal, backers will each receive matching dagger and arrow die quantities! If you back at Maid Marian for instance, you will receive 50 Arrow dice (any mix of available colors that you select) and 50 Dagger dice (color to be voted on when the dagger die Stretch Goal is reached). There will be no change to your shipping costs for this!\nWhat Color?\nAt the time the the Dagger Die is unlocked (if it is), backers will be asked to vote for the color of their choice from the colors already presented in the project. Once all votes are tallied, the winning color will be announced.\nAdd Ons\nAdditional dagger and arrow dice will be available as add ons. Each add-on die will be $3. For every 10 add on dice, please ad $1 to cover the added shipping. Please adjust your pledge level to reflect your add ons and we will determine exactly what you'd like to receive via survey after the Kickstart completes!\nAs Stretch Goals are reached, we'll update the below image to show what new color has been selected by the backers.\n* Stretch Goal #1 - OUR BACKERS SELECTED RED!\n* Stretch Goal #2 - OUR BACKERS SELECTED GREEN!\n* Stretch Goal #3 - OUR BACKERS SELECTED BLACK w/WHITE INK!\n* Stretch Goal #4 - OUR BACKERS SELECTED BEIGE w/BROWN INK!\n* Stretch Goal #5 - OUR BACKERS SELECTED BLUE!\n* Stretch Goal #6 - ??

Throughout our production research effort, they have shown insight reflective of their previous experience and have demonstrated excellent communication. We feel great about this partnership!\nFulfillment Timeframe\nAs soon as the Kickstart project is complete (assuming successful funding), the fulfillment process will begin. Expected leadtime for the dice is 6-8 weeks. During that time, we will be making preparations to ship to minimize delay once the dice are in hand. After the dice are received at Black Oak, we will begin shipping immediately. Based on the number of backers, we anticipate all shipments to be handed off to the USPS within 7-10 days, but likely earlier. This means we should be shipping during the latter half of January and packages should start arriving in late January and early February.\nShipping\nWe have heard a great number of horror stories related to shipment of Kickstarter rewards. We have exercised caution and thoroughly researched shipping related to this project to ensure your rewards WILL SHIP without delay! All shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service and the default service utilized will be First Class. Tracking numbers will be recorded at the time of shipment and provided to the respective backers. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping.\nFulfillment Timeframe\nAs soon as the Kickstart project is complete (assuming successful funding), the fulfillment process will begin.

Forget everything you know about the afterlife. Good guys don\u2019t always go to Heaven and bad guys don\u2019t always end up in Hell. The multiverse is one giant amalgam of giant corporations that humans know as afterlives. Heaven. Hell. Valhalla. The Happy Hunting Grounds. Some might look prettier than others, but in the end they\u2019re all at war for the greatest commodity in the multiverse\u2026Human souls.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter much where you end up when you die; your lot in life is one of slave labor in one of these afterlives, doing whatever you might have done best (or didn\u2019t know you were best at) in life. That could be constructing buildings or architecture. It could also be mopping up in a strip club. In Hell these human souls are called Weepers. Some win their freedom and earn a meager living in the dregs of society. Others try to escape, either to join terrorist groups known as Kittens, or to get out to another afterlife or even back to Earth. When that happens, crack teams of bounty hunters called Borderhounds are sent out to the Wastelands to bring them back in. The best of these teams is known as XiBalba and is led by Brimstone, the half-demon son of Hell\u2019s Grand Architect.\nUsing the acclaimed and easy-to-learn SIEGE engine mechanic, the Brimstone and the Borderhounds RPG lets you play as Brimstone and his allies, as a new team of Borderhounds hunting down escaped Weepers and battling corporate espionage from other afterlives (or engaging in a little of your own), or play as a psychic, mystic, occult investigator or Earth-bound hero, battling supernatural incursions from the other worlds as our planet becomes a battleground in the greatest corporate war the multiverse has ever seen. Wield Helltech weapons, call upon Forza Infernis (the powers of Hell) or draw forth alien magic and psychic energies.

It's a \"pre-mystery\" board game, where players compete to kill a very lucky old man.\nKill Doctor Lucky has been through several versions and variations over the years, and it is currently out of print. To celebrate the 19.5th anniversary, we are re-releasing Kill Doctor Lucky in a special edition, with new art and updated rules.\nToday is the final day! People seem to like the new \"Accessories to Murder\" level, which has all the new KDL-related products for $85. \nAbout the Pledge Manager: Shortly after the campaign ends, we will open up the pledge manager at After the Crowd, so that you can give us your address, allocate any extra funds you might have given us, and add more if you need to. Kickstarter can take as long as three weeks to get us all the backer data, so please be patient. You'll receive an email from ATC when the manager is up and running.\nKill Doctor Lucky and all its extra rewards will ship in March 2016, and you will be able to return to change your address, until the week before we ship.\nIf you're new to the Kill Doctor Lucky campaign, please read through the updates for more information about the game and the project. And, as of yesterday, there is now a full play-through video, if you'd like to see the game in action!\nKill Doctor Lucky is a fast, easy board game. The goal is simple: to kill Doctor Lucky. You'll sneak around Lucky Mansion looking for good weapons and hiding places. To make a murder attempt, you must be in a room with Doctor Lucky where no one else can see you. And of course, he's very lucky, so he's quite hard to kill.\nSome Details:\nPlayers: 2 to 8\nPlaying Time: 30-45 Minutes\nGame Type: Light Strategy Board Game\nAges: 12 and up\nContents: Board, 72 cards, 8 character cards, 9 pawns, rules.\nDesigner: James Ernest\nArtist: Israel Evans\nFor testimonials and reviews of the new edition, scroll to the bottom of this page. Also, watch the play-through video here.\nHistory: The first edition of Kill Doctor Lucky was released in late 1996, and it won the Origins Award for Best Abstract Board Game of 1997. Kill Doctor Lucky was also listed in the GAMES 100. This great response was despite the fact that the first edition came in a white paper envelope, with cheap components and no spare parts.\nCheapass Games later released two upgraded white-box editions, including a \"Director's Cut\" with an alternate board, before licensing the game to Paizo / Titanic Games in 2006. The last of Paizo's deluxe edition sold out in 2014, and the rights to the game have now come back to Cheapass Games.\nThis 19.5th Anniversary Edition will have all-new art by Israel Evans, who also illustrated the card game, Get Lucky. It has thoroughly revised rules, which you can see in the open beta at cheapass.com.\nFor more information about what's different in the rules, check out Update #12. \nWe're keeping this campaign fairly simple, with just a few reward levels, including one level exclusively for our EU customers. \n$5: The Basics. If you don't need a copy of the game, but you want to support us in our efforts, this is the level for you. The basic level gives you access to our pledge manager, where you will be able to add items from this campaign in whatever assortment you choose. If you do order any add-ons, the total cost including shipping will be calculated by the pledge manager.\n$15: The Freebies: If you have a better way to get the game (or just want the little stuff), this level gives you the cool stuff that will come with the Kickstarter version: a \"funvelope\" with:\nA Kill Doctor Lucky sticker\nA new 39mm collector coin\nA Lucky Mansion Embroidered Patch\nPatience the Cat (a custom white gaming token)\nEight photo character cards\nEight villain character cards for use with the Secret Lair expansion\nOther free things too small to mention\n$50: The Game. This pledge level gets you a copy of Kill Doctor Lucky, along with the free stuff mentioned above. Note: if you are in the EU or Switzerland, you might consider selecting the German Edition (below). Your total costs, including customs fees, may be lower.\nThe core game currently includes the following stretch goals / upgrades:\n(At $65k) Double-Sided Character cards\n(At $70k) Improved Playing Card Stock\n(At $85k) Patience the Cat (alternate rules)\n(At 100k) A turned wooden pawn for Doctor Lucky\n(At $110k) Rules for \"Escape from Lucky Mansion\"\n(At $120k) Card with Zombie Lucky (for \"Escape\")\n(At $150k) An alternate mansion on the back of the main board\n(At 3000 backers) Full set of wooden pawns!\n$52: The German Edition. Our partners at Truant Spiele will produce the deluxe German edition, Kill Doktor Lucky, shortly after our US edition. Funds from this pledge level will go directly to Truant Spiele. These games will be produced in May or June, and will ship from Germany only to EU countries and Switzerland. They will include different freebies from Truant. (We will post the English language rules at cheapass.com, of course.) Note that we have little influence over the specifications of the German edition, so it won't necessarily match ours piece-for-piece.\n$85: Accessories to Murder. This level includes only the new items directly related to the core game. That's Kill Doctor Lucky and the funvelope (coin, patch, bonus cards, etc.) plus the Meeple Set and the Secret Lair expansion. Backing at this level might save you a bit of shipping, compared to adding those items individually through the pledge manager.\n$148: \"Everything, Almost\": This is an unlimited version of the \"Everything, I Get It\" level below, just without the limited Doctor Lucky mini. Everything else is the same as the $150 level.\n$150: \"Everything, I Get It\" If you'd like to get all the Kill Doctor Lucky-related stuff (and other unrelated stuff) from this campaign, including all the add-ons, games, freebies, and so on, this level is for you.

This is a handsome 25mm metal figurine of Doctor Lucky, sculpted by Mark Copplestone. Supplies are limited, so they are part of the \"Everything\" level, but not in \"Everything, Almost\".\nNote also that the \"Everything\" level still isn't quite everything: it doesn't include the German edition, or anything else from Truant Spiele's version. Nor does it include the Party!\nThe Closing Party. We will throw a campaign closing party on Friday, November 13. We had a level that included a ticket to this party, but we have closed that level because no one backed it, and time was running out. You can still watch the party live, if the internet cooperates!\nThe US edition of Kill Doctor Lucky will ship with some cool free stuff just for our Kickstarter backers, as described above. (The German edition is a separate thing and contains only the core game.)\nBackers may add individual items through the pledge manager at After the Crowd, which will open a few days after this campaign closes. Shipping costs are not included below, and will be added based on your total order and destination address.\nKill Doctor Lucky: Additional copies of the game can be added for $40 each.\nThe Funvelope: If one envelope of goodies isn't enough for you, you can add another for $10.\nGet Lucky Card Game: Get Lucky is the card game version of the same story. It has some similarities to the board game, but it's a simpler, faster game. Get Lucky was created in 2013 and funded via Kickstarter. Price: $17.\nGet Lucky Collector Coin: This was our very first collector coin, from the Get Lucky campaign in 2013, and a few of them still remain. It's a gold-finished 39mm coin from Campaign Coins, Priced at $5. The copper-finished Kill Doctor Lucky coin will be included in the funvelope, and you can also add extra KDL coins for $5 each.\nLucky Mansion Patch: This will be a roughly 3\" wide souvenir patch depicting Lucky Mansion. It's included in the funvelope, but you can add more for $6 each.\nDoctor Lucky Coloring Book: \"Doctor Lucky's House\" is a coloring book made with the line art from Get Lucky. Containing \"precisely 20 pages\" this is a delightfully odd collection of characters for your coloring pleasure. Price: $5.\nDoctor Lucky Meeple Set: Nine custom meeples from Meeple Source, including Doctor Lucky and eight colorful murderers, price $19. Sketches for the first four are shown above. The rest are shown in Update #10. These are their 19mm \"mega\" meeples, printed with their newest high-detail process!\nAntique Pairs Deck: Pairs is a \"New Classic Pub Game\" that you can read about here. We love doing new decks for this game. This one is an antique version of the original Fruit Deck, illustrated by Doctor Lucky himself, BJ Becker. The deck will be exclusive to this campaign, and will be printed by DriveThruCards, so it will come without a box. Price: $10.\nDeadfall: A Pairs-based bluffing game described in Update #7. This is a new card game from Cheapass Games, a full production game (with a box and rules) scheduled for release in May 2016. You can add this game for $10. \nBefore I Kill You, Mister Spy: A classic Cheapass Game in a new $10 single-deck format. Players are super-villains capturing spies and trying to resist the urge to taunt them for extra points. This will be a full production game (with rules and box) slated for release in June. Described in Update #9. You can add this game for $10.\nThe Secret Lair of Doctor Lucky: A spy-themed expansion board for Kill Doctor Lucky, where you're all Lucky's henchmen trying to kill a spy who's trapped in the place, described in Update #13. You can add this expansion board for $16.\nGerman Edition: Kill Doktor Lucky. Backers may add the German edition of the game in the pledge manager, but only if their delivery address is in the EU or Switzerland. The game will be priced the same as it is in the campaign: $52 for Germany, +$6 for shipping to other EU countries, and +$11 for shipping to Switzerland. This game will ship from Germany.\nNote: The German edition of Kill Doktor Lucky, and other products from Truant Spiele, will be available only from them, and Truant will not have access to the US-based add-ons. \nTruant Spiele also publishes German editions of Get Lucky, Pairs, Give Me the Brain, and many of our other games, and you should check them out here.\nWe've far exceeded our funding goal, and that's fantastic! Through stretch goals, we have made several improvements to the game, and added a few fun side games as well.\nA simple upgrade to the character cards: let's put an alternate character on the back! Now each pawn has two options for the bloodthirsty murderer it represents. This is an upgrade to the core game, unlocked at $65k.\nCards are a critical component in this game, and we don't want to skimp on the production quality. At this funding level, we are able to print more copies of the core game, and we can spend the cost savings on better paper: a smooth-finish 11-pt Stoplight playing card stock, the same paper found in card games like FLUXX. This is another upgrade to the core game, unlocked at $70k. \nA set of nine custom meeples, created by Meeple Source, including eight players and Doctor Lucky. These will be 19mm \"mega\" meeples, similar to the set that we made for Stuff and Nonsense (shown below). These are unlocked as a $19 add-on, and included in the Everything levels, at $80k. (The preview image is in Update #10)\nThe rules for Kill Doctor Lucky include a variant for Patience, Doctor Lucky's cat. When we unlock this stretch goal at $85k, we'll add a custom cat meeple to the funvelope, made by our friends at Meeple Source. You can learn more about Patience in Update #3.\nA Pairs Deck in an Antique Style: Illustrated by Doctor Lucky himself (BJ Becker), this Pairs deck features the themes from the original Fruit Deck but in an antique style. Pairs is a \"New Classic Pub Game\" with many different decks and variant games. This deck, to be printed by DriveThruCards, will be a $10 add-on, and will be included in the Everything levels, when we reach $90k.\nA Custom Pawn for Doctor Lucky: Our player pawns will be RolCo's large wood-filled plastic pawns, but we'd like to create a custom pawn to represent Doctor Lucky. This will be a 1.75\" high turned wood piece, resembling Doctor Lucky in his bowler and tailcoat. We can now add this piece to the core game, unlocked at $100k.\nEscape from Lucky Mansion: A game variant that takes place immediately after the main game. In Escape From Lucky Mansion, Doctor Lucky has risen from the dead, and is chasing the characters around the house. All bets are off as players can attack each other and even move Lucky into attack position. The last survivor wins! Game variant rules unlocked at $110k\nZombie Lucky Card: Specifically used for \"Escape from Lucky Mansion,\" this is a character card for Doctor Lucky, who racks up Reasons with each murder attempt that he makes! One side is just Doctor Lucky, handsome devil, but the other features a Zombie Doctor Lucky! Card art unlocked at $120k.\nPhoto Character Cards: Another bonus item for the funvelope: eight alternate character cards with photos of the actors who inspired them! Unlocked at $130k. (Details in Update #11)\nLucky Mansion Pairs Deck: This is a Pairs deck with photos from Lucky Mansion, available exclusively through this campaign. This deck from DriveThruCards will be included in the Everything levels, and will also be a $10 add-on, unlocked at $140k. (Details in Update #11)\nAlternate \"Old Consulate\" Board: We can add a second board on the back of the main board, based on the Old Consulate Inn. This board is an upstairs-downstairs layout, designed to fold in half (to hide the unused rooms) for a smaller group of players. Described in Update #13, unlocked at $150k.\nVillain Character Cards: Eight new cards for the funvelope, designed for the Secret Lair board, but also usable with the core game. These dastardly characters from Before I Kill You, Mister Spy were illustrated by Cheyenne Wright, and will be a fun alternate murderer set no matter where you do your killing. Described in Update #16, unlocked at $175k.\nAll Wood Pawns: Rather than the cheaper option of wood-filled plastic pawns, we can substitute a full set of turned wood pawns in custom paint colors, if we reach a goal of 3000 backers. So tell your friends!\nThis may seem like a long shot on the final day, but we have a backup plan. If we don't manage to get wooden pawns into the core game, we will make them available as an add-on for a modest price. (And yes, if that happens, they will be added automatically to the Everything levels, as well as the Accessories level.)\nWhat's Next? \nThis is the last day of the campaign, and we'll be broadcasting the closing party from Lucky Mansion (if the internet cooperates). \nAfter the campaign closes, we'll put all the final components through another round of playtesting, print everything, ship it to you, and get to work on more games!\nThe pledge manager at After the Crowd will open a few days (possibly a few weeks) after the campaign closes. We need to get backer data from Kickstarter, which can take two or three weeks by itself, then make sure all the pledge levels and add-ons are set up correctly in the system.\nYou will get an email from After the Crowd when the pledge manager is ready, and we'll also announce it in an update here. You'll need to log in to the pledge manager to give us your shipping address. You can also allocate any extra funds you gave us already, and you can add more if you need to. \nKill Doctor Lucky has always been an evergreen product, and thanks to your tremendous support on this campaign (and the testimonials below) we know we have a winner. You can expect a lot more great fun in the Kill Doctor Lucky series over the next months and years.\nIf you haven't done so already, please subscribe to our newsletter for all the news about Cheapass Games.\nThanks again for an amazing campaign!\nBefore the campaign, we sent out a few review copies of the beta version. Below is some of the feedback we received, and it sounds like we have a winner.\nFrom Cory Doctorow (BoingBoing): \"Man, I've had some enjoyable evenings killing Doctor Lucky! Cheapass is one of the great games companies of all time, and I love everything about this.\"\nFrom Father Geek: \"I am very pleased to award you the Father Geek Seal of Approval. This is an award we only offer to designers and publishers if their game was approved by our Child Geeks, Parent Geeks, and Gamer Geeks. These games are found to be entertaining to a wide group of players with diverse background experience and skill levels. Well done!\"\nFrom Colin O'Boyle (GeekSmash): \"Much moreso than Clue, Kill Dr. Lucky gives players a chance to enact clever strategies, to plot out their moves, and to gnash their teeth in frustration as another player heads to the room where you were planning on doing the titular doctor in. The cards are clever, the gameplay is engaging, and I can say, without the shadow of a doubt, that I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a combination of Clue and Munchkin.\"\nFrom Gameosity: \"We had a great time with Kill Dr. Lucky. The game plays fast and the cards have a great sense of humor. Some of the Failure cards in particular (used to thwart murder attempts) are hilarious in their tone and implications. We laughed our way through the game, gritting our teeth every time Dr. Lucky slipped through our fingers because of a misplaced banana or errant child\u2019s toy. It\u2019s a really good time.\"\nFrom Adventures With My Geeklings: \"All in all, Kill Doctor Lucky \u2013 the Anniversary Edition is a fun, quirky game with enough depth to stick around our game nights for a long time.\"\nFrom Robert Searing, Dice Tower News: \"Having designed over 100 games since the original Kill Doctor Lucky, James has refined the rules to make the game even more enjoyable... It was easy to teach my kids and we had quite a bit of fun.\"\nFrom Game Gumshoes: \"If you get a chance to contribute and/or buy a copy the 19.5th Anniversary Edition of Kill Doctor Lucky, DO IT!\"\nFrom Bower's Game Corner: \"I really enjoyed this game...The theme comes across really well--with the artwork, with the flavor text on the card, with the character cards...Big thumbs up.\"\nFrom Jeff at Happy Mitten Games: \u201cKill Doctor Lucky is clever, clean, and well thought-out. Both the steady pace and little downtime kept everyone engaged for the entire game.... This game is an easy-to-learn, thematic, and fun blend of social and strategic gaming. It\u2019s great to see James Ernest and the Cheapass team improve an already solid game.\u201d\nFrom Stephen Conway at The Spiel: \"The new edition of Kill Doctor Lucky is both familiar and fresh. If you love the original, the silly humor shines through even more with backstories and motives provided for each character. As a game, the pace and mechanics have been streamlined to add more tension and tactics. Put simply, you get to the fun part faster - finding ridiculous weapons like the Tight Hat or Bad Cream and trying to maneuver yourself into the perfect position for murder and mayhem.\"\nFrom Erik at Indie Cardboard: \"I\u2019m excited that almost twenty years on this game is still around as we skulk through the halls trying to put away that dastardly doctor. Kill Doctor Lucky has come a long way in the years since that original envelope, and with revised art and rules this latest edition smooths out the experience, distilling it into a refined game of cat and mouse.\"\nFrom Engaged Family Gaming: \"We loved every minute of it.... All strategy aside, the absolute best part of this game is the ongoing tension being built as the game progresses.\"\nFrom Mike at 40 Going on 14: \"I have played \"Kill Doctor Lucky\" with my lovely daughters, Katie and Sophia. I have learned that my offspring are sneaky, conniving, and spiteful when need be. I could not be more proud.\u201d\nFrom Let's Level Up: \"Cheapass Games takes an already great game and makes it better, which is a difficult process in itself. The 19.5 year anniversary of Kill Doctor Lucky brings all the fun its predecessor does but with a streamlined rule set, which will get players attempting to Kill Doctor Lucky that much quicker. A+ and a must back from the folks at Let's Level Up!\"\nFrom Dungeon Crawlers Radio: \"The new edition of Kill Doctor Lucky is a brilliantly designed game that will have you engage for an entire night of gaming while you and your friends try to attempt to Kill Doctor Lucky. You will quickly find yourself laughing at the silly humor that really shines through the character's back stories and motives. The game is fun and easy to learn. The pace and mechanics are easy enough for beginning board game players and challenging enough for more experienced game players. This is one game that you won't regret picking up for your next game night!!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our eighth Kickstarter campaign, and so far we have shipped every one pretty much on schedule.

The Borderland area connects the legendary dungeons of Rappan Athuk to the award-winning Lost City of Barakus, and also to several other Necromancer Games books from the d20 era. Not only that, it also links up the long-awaited northwest route from these areas to the city of Bard\u2019s Gate, and ultimately connects Bard\u2019s Gate to the campaign area described in Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms and the Domain of Hawkmoon.\nThe Borderland Provinces are balanced on the knife\u2019s edge of history, as a decadent, declining empire retreats slowly, clinging to power even as it unravels. Award-winning authors Matt Finch and Greg A. Vaughan weave a tapestry of high adventure in the context of a gritty, darkening region of the Lost Lands. And as with everything in the Lost Lands, all is not as it seems\u2026\nThe central part of the Kickstarter is the Core Campaign Book for the Borderland Provinces, a complete guide for running campaigns here. There are also several additional resources that can be added to the campaign book to assemble an extended kit for sandbox adventuring and traveling through the wild and tumultuous realm of the Borderland Provinces. The main campaign book contains rich descriptions of countries, cities (some with individual maps), encounter tables for road and airborne travel, several individual lairs, historical background of the area, and much more. The Adventure Book provides a set of stand-alone adventures much larger than the lairs in the campaign book, and the Journey Generator is a resource for GMing free-form traveling adventures on the stone high-roads left behind by the ancient Hyperboreans. You can pick and choose what kinds of resources you want, and put together the kit you need for your particular kind of game.\nAnd that's not all! There are two player books to introduce the campaign to players in different ways, including a copy of the poster map (don't worry -- the secret locations aren't shown on it). Plus, there's a free first-level adventure module, Rogues in Remballo, to let you get started right away! Here is the link to the Free Module (you don't have to be a backer to get a copy, it's free for all)!\nRead on about the individual parts of this campaign kit you can build on top of the core book!\nHow it Works\nIt Might Look Complicated...\nThis Kickstarter is pretty complicated because we have two main hardcover titles (The Lost Lands: Borderland Provinces and The Lost Lands: Adventures in the Borderland Provinces) in three different rules-versions (Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, and Swords & Wizardry), plus two softcover player-resource books (a Guide and a Gazeteer, for any rules-version), plus a softcover GM's resource (Journey Generator, also for use with any rules-version), plus a limited printing of the free module Rogues in Remballo. Overall, that's a total of 6 possible hardcover titles to choose from, and 4 different softcovers. Complicated.\nOur Brilliant Solution!\nSo for the hardcover books, the pledge levels over on the right are organized like a buffet. You don't have to scroll around forever looking for the exact combination you want. Instead, right now, all you have to do is pick the number of hardcovers you want. When you get the BackerKit after the Kickstarter, that's when you tell us which exact titles and rules-version you want. So right now, it doesn't matter if you specifically want two copies of the Campaign Book in different rules-versions, or one copy of each book in the same rules-version. Those are the same pledge: two hardcover books. Want only one book? You don't have to tell us any more than that until the BackerKit. Just pledge for one book at this time, you don't have to specify which one.\n\nThe Books\nThe Lost Lands: Borderland Provinces (core book for the campaign)\nAvailable for Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, and old-school Swords & Wizardry. This is the central book of the Kickstarter, containing campaign material that connects not only Rappan Athuk and Lost City of Barakus, but many other previously-published adventures from Frog God Games and Necromancer Games. Written by Matt Finch, a founder of the Old School Renaissance*, it contains the history of the Borderland Provinces region, descriptions of the countries, cities (some with maps), towns, important places, major geographical features, and extensive encounter tables for the ancient Hyperborean roads crisscrossing the Provinces. For those familiar with Lost Lands geography, the campaign book covers the Western part of our Sinnar Coast Region map, an area in great peril, located only a few hundred miles from Bard's Gate and directly adjacent to the Sundered Kingdoms. This is a hardcover book with separate versions (not dual-statted) for Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, and Swords & Wizardry. We estimate it roughly between 175-200 pages depending on which rules-version you're looking at, how we finalize the layout, and so on.\nThe Lost Lands: Adventures in the Borderland Provinces\nAvailable for Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, and Swords & Wizardry. Chief Editor Ari Marmell assembled a team of definitely-not-insane authors to add several brand-new adventures located in the Borderland Provinces. Immediately re-naming their project \"Creeps on the Borderlands,\" they retreated to their lairs, chuckling and sharpening pencils, to emerge later with a set of dastardly challenges for those who pursue gold and glory in the Borderlands. The \"Creeps on the Borderlands\" team is Ari Marmell, Eytan Bernstein, Scott Fitzgerald Gray, Gwendolyn Kestrel, Rhiannon Louve, Anthony Pryor, and C.A. Suleiman.\nBorderland Provinces Player Guide. The Player Guide isn't specific to any set of rules, so it's exactly the same book whether you're playing Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, or Swords & Wizardry. Of the two player books, this one is designed as a series of letters from several members of an occasionally-ill-fated expedition across most of the Borderlands. It's not quite the Donner Party, but players will definitely gain a sense of some of the risks involved here.\nBorderland Provinces Player Gazeteer. Like the Player Guide, the Player Gazeteer is information about the campaign, not specific to any rules. It's the same book for Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, and Swords & Wizardry. The Player Gazeteer is a detailed and flavorful \"key\" for the poster map, containing only the information that well-informed characters might know about their world. This resource lets the players come up with their own ideas and plans, and puts them right into the middle of the campaign immediately. (Includes a Poster Map of Borderland Provinces for your players).\nJourney Generator. Available in one non-rules-specific version. The Journey Generator is a resource for the Game Master, a tool for coming up with adventure hooks for journeys, destinations in the Borderland Provinces where those journeys might lead, and other useful tools for a campaign where the characters tend to saddle up their horses and travel to distant places. When the road goes ever on, this is the resource you need.\nRogues in Remballo Limited Printing. For the Kickstarter, we're printing a copy of the free module Rogues in Remballo as a special item. It will be approximately limited to the number ordered on the Kickstarter, and marked as a \"Limited Printing.\" It's at the normal price for a printed module, but a nice collector's item, proof that you liked the Borderland Provinces before they were cool, or just because you hate printing your own pdfs.\nRogues in Remballo is a a city adventure that gets first-level characters embroiled in strange plots, sinister intrigue, and fierce battles. Is the thieves\u2019 guild of Manas encroaching on the territory of the Remballo guild? What is hidden in the sanctuary-courtyard known as the Four Corners? How is the powerful banking house of Borgandy involved with all of it? What starts as a straightforward mission actually involves a host of complications \u2014 some of which can be deadly if the characters don\u2019t play their cards right.\nComplete your Collection!  \nLooking for more books from The Lost Lands?

A maimed veteran of the Wilderlands Clan War returns to the site of the final battle on its tenth anniversary only to discover that a new evil has awoken in the ruins. But what can a crippled warrior do to save a kingdom? When we reach this pledge level, the free pdf of The Walls of Broch Tarna will be a gift for all backers over the $35 level. UNLOCKED!\n$48,000 Alternative Wilderness Tables (Basic tables): Region-Level Wilderness Encounter Tables as further described below. A free PDF for all backers. UNLOCKED\nThe Campaign Book is designed for far-and-fast travel on roads rather than a hex-crawl, so wilderness encounters use what we call a \"road-and-risk\" system. They are handled as \u201cHigh Risk\u201d versions of the nearest road, with details provided in the road encounters for the different Risk Levels.\nHowever, we know that many GMs will want traditional wilderness encounter tables too. These would clutter the campaign book itself, since there's already the road-and-risk system in place, and they'd probably occupy a large number of pages. So for those who prefer traditional tables, we\u2019re going to use stretch goals to determine the interest in this as an alternative to the road-and-risk system, making them more specific to particular regions as we advance. In essence, we\u2019ll build them as we hit advancing levels of stretch goals. Once we reach the end of the Kickstarter, and have a chance to do the layout on these, we'll release the tables as a free pdf to everyone who pledged above the $10 mark.\nThe first of these goals is a set of Region-Level Wilderness Encounters. This would be a set of standard tables for Terrain Types, applicable across the Borderland Provinces, not broken out into the specific regions. This will be useful for catching the flavor of the campaign, but it will still be quite generic, involving only one table each for mountains, hills, etc.\nAs we start hitting these Wilderness Encounter Table stretch goals, Matt will start building the tables depending on what level of detail they begin to reach.\n$50,000 Stretch Goal #3:   Perilous Places #1. Specific encounter tables for those foolhardy enough to venture into the Forest of Hope or (even worse) the Creeping Mire in Keston Province. An addition to the free Alternative Encounter Tables PDF. UNLOCKED.\n$52,000 Stretch Goal #4:  Gods of the Borderland Provinces (Basic)! Pages added to the book, describing the most prominent of the region's deities. More may be added if we hit more stretch goals down the road. UNLOCKED\n$53,000 Stretch Goal #5:  \u201cEchoes from the Otherside\u201d by Jeff Provine (author of \u201cDominus Est,\u201d \u201cUnder New Management,\u201d \u201cHarsh Wyrds\u201d and the adventure The Raid).  Farmer Maroc has lived in Mirquinoc his whole life and is well accustomed to the hidden world of the fey that shares the town with its more mundane human inhabitants. But when one faerie begins to harass him repeatedly, he isn\u2019t sure what to make of it until he realizes it\u2019s trying to give him an important message from the Otherworld. Unlocking this stretch goal makes the short story PDF available on backer kit as an add-on for $2. UNLOCKED\n$54,000 Stretch Goal #6: Perilous Places #2: Specific encounter tables for the Lorremach Highhills, the Wilderland Hills, and the Duskmoon Hills. This is an addition to the free Alternative Encounter Tables PDF. UNLOCKED\n$55,000 Stretch Goal #7: \u201cHome Waters\u201d by Nathan Shank. The captain of a pirate-hunting schooner reflects on what \u201chome\u201d means as a foreigner commissioned for his job from distant Hawkmoon, commanding a ship out of Telar Brindel that isn\u2019t his own, for the city of Bard\u2019s Gate that he\u2019s never seen, on waters thousands of miles beyond that city\u2019s walls. While tracking a mysterious unknown pirate among the desolate marshes of the north coast of the Amrin Estuary he runs across more than he bargained for and discovers that other \u201cthings\u201d have their own thoughts on the meaning of home as well. Unlocking this stretch goal makes the short story PDF available on backer kit as an add-on for $2. UNLOCKED\n$56,000 Stretch Goal #8: Archeillus. The basic form of the deities appendix will contain the descriptions of Thyr, Freya, Muir, and Belon the Wise. If we unlock this stretch goal, the less-known god Archeillus is added to the appendix of Borderland deities. The increasing worship of Archeillus in Eastreach Province is causing some significant troubles there.  UNLOCKED\n$57,000 Stretch Goal #9: Yenomesh. Yenomesh is the god of glyphs and writing, and appears to be responsible for a miracle that happened in one of the towns of Suilley. He\u2019s a good patron for wizards. If we hit this stretch goal, Greg will do the research and writing to add Yenomesh into the appendix of deities. UNLOCKED\n$58,000 Stretch Goal #10: \u201cIn for a Pound,\u201d short fiction by Kevin Wright. Milo Perin has worked out of Vermis as an agent, go-between, and expert \u201cfixer\u201d for the Friendly Men for years. However, his latest assignment for an investor to meet with a new contact for a slave-smuggling operation has brought him to the ruins of Curgantium where he learns that sometimes buying in is a lot easier than getting out. Unlocking this stretch goal makes the short story PDF available on backer kit as an add-on for $2. UNLOCKED\n$59,000 Stretch Goal #11: Perilous Places #3. Specific encounter tables for the Forlorn Mountains, the Kal\u2019Iugus Mountains, the Meridian Range, the Rampart Mountains, and the eerie peaks of the Cretians. This is an expansion to the free Alternative Encounter Tables PDF. UNLOCKED\n$60,000 Stretch Goal #12: Telophus. Telophus is a very commonly worshipped deity among the peasantry, a god of farming and grain. His church is becoming more active in the face of the oppression of farmers in some parts of the Borderlands, and would be an excellent patron for clerics who like to go around rescuing settlements on the edge of the wilderness. If we hit this stretch goal, Greg will do the research and writing to add details about Telophus into the appendix of deities. UNLOCKED\n$62,000 Stretch Goal #13: Free adventure PDF \u201cVindication.\u201d If we hit this stretch goal, we will give a free pdf of the Borderland Provinces d20 adventure Vindication to all backers. Vindication is not converted from the original d20 format, so it would require a bit of work to use it directly, but it provides tons of information about the Lorremach Highhills. It\u2019s a very useful resource. UNLOCKED\n$63,000 Stretch Goal #14: Kamien and Dre\u2019uain the Lame. Kamien is a goddess of the rivers, and Dre\u2019uain the Lame is a god of industry and hard work, and his church in Keston is dedicated to re-settling the wild, depopulated lands ruined by the chaos of the Wilderland Clan Wars that took place 10 years ago. If we hit this stretch goal, Greg will do the research and writing to add details about Kamien and Dre\u2019uain the Lame into the appendix of deities. UNLOCKED\n$64,000 Stretch Goal #15: Spire of Iron and Crystal (paid). This module has already been published for Fifth Edition in its \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut\u201d format, in Quests of Doom 2. If we hit this stretch goal, we will publish the pdf of the Director\u2019s Cut for Pathfinder and Swords & Wizardry, and sell it as a $5 add-on to the Backer Kit. UNLOCKED\n$66,000 Stretch Goal #16: free PDF of Bard\u2019s Gate. If we hit this stretch goal, we will give a free pdf of the Bard\u2019s Gate d20 version to all backers. This is a very large book; it is not converted from the original d20 format, so it would require a bit of work to use it directly, but it provides tons of information about one of the key cities of the campaign area. The influence of Bard\u2019s Gate is extremely strong in the northern and western parts of the Borderland Provinces. LOCKED\n$68,000 Stretch Goal #17: free PDF of Durbenford. If we hit this stretch goal, we will give a free pdf of the Borderland Provinces d20 adventure Trouble in Durbenford to all backers. This is a very large book; it is not converted from the original d20 format, so it would require a bit of work to use it directly, but it provides tons of information about the regions just to the west of the map of the Provinces. Like Vindication (Stretch Goal 13), it\u2019s a very useful resource with many pages of Borderland goodness. LOCKED\n$71,000 Stretch Goal #18: free PDF of Spire of Iron and Crystal. If we hit this stretch goal, we will give away the Fifth Edition, Pathfinder, and Swords & Wizardry PDF of Spire of Iron and Crystal to all backers. LOCKED\n$100,000 Stretch Goal #19: Shipping Discount. If we\u2019re hitting this level of subscription, it means we\u2019re making enough of a profit to pass on a shipping discount to all backers who are ordering copies of the two hardcover books. We will absorb 10% of all shipping costs, effectively reducing the total book price. LOCKED\n$125,000 Stretch Goal #20: Additional Shipping Discount. Instead of reducing shipping costs by 10%, as in Stretch Goal #19, we will absorb 20% of shipping costs on all shipments that include copies of the hardcover books. LOCKED\n$150,000 Stretch Goal #21: Bard\u2019s Gate Fifth Edition. If we hit this stretch goal, it doesn\u2019t directly affect the rewards for this Kickstarter, but it means we become confident enough about the 5e level of interest in campaign materials for the Lost Lands, and we will produce a fifth edition version for the Bard\u2019s Gate Kickstarter anticipated to run, release, and deliver next year. This may happen anyway, but hitting this stretch goal will turn it into an action plan on our part, and work will begin almost immediately after the completion of the Kickstarter. LOCKED\nAdd-Ons\nExtra copy of The Lost Lands: Borderland Provinces Hardcover ($35)\nExtra copy of The Lost Lands: Adventures in the Borderland Provinces Hardcover ($35)\nRecommended Add-Ons\nAll the items listed below have a connection to the Borderland Provinces in some way, as designated.\n1. Poster Map of the Borderlands: because pdf maps just don't compare to a great big poster map spread out across the table, possibly held down by daggers (daggers not included). All the Borderland Provinces campaign books come with a poster map, and so does the Player Gazeteer, but you might want extras, especially if you really do stick daggers into the corners. (Add $3 for PDF, $7 for Poster)\n2. Extra Softcover Books: Extra copies of the Players Guide, the Journey Generator, and the limited printing of Rogues in Remballo are all $10 each, and extra copies of the Player Gazeteer (including poster map map of the borderlands) are $15.\nOther Add-Ons: If you want to build up all the resources located in the Borderland Provinces, we recommend the following add-ons (probably in this order of priority):\n3. The Lost City of Barakus. (PFRPG and Swords & Wizardry only)The City of Endhome is a central location in the Borderland Provinces. It is described generally in the Campaign Book, but the Lost City of Barakus contains much more detailon Endhome as well as the staggeringly awesome adventure in the Lost City itself. This is a fairly inexpensive, award-winning book. We don't have a fifth edition version, and Swords & Wizardry versions are limited. ($15 for PDF, $36 for book).\n4. Rappan Athuk. (PFRPG and Swords & Wizardry only)This massive book contains a lot of information about the eastern part of Eastreach Province, along with the legendary mega-dungeon itself. PFRPG and Swords & Wizardry versions only. ($30 for PDF, $90 for book).\n5. Cyclopean Deeps (volumes one and two). (PFRPG and Swords & Wizardry only)This is the Under-Realm below Rappan Athuk, although it can also be reached by several gates in the Borderland Provinces. These are regions alien to humankind, so deep that reality itself begins to fray. Enzeitgeist's #4 pick for best product of 2014. PFRPG and Swords & Wizardry versions only. ($15 each in PDF, $30 each for book, discount price of $25 for both in PDF or $50 for both books).\n6. Quests of Doom 1 (2 volume set for Fifth Edition buyers). Available in Pathfinder, Fifth Edition, and Swords & Wizardry. The adventure \"Perils of Ghostwind Pass\" is located in the Borderland Provinces near the town of Elet in Aachen Province. The other adventures in the book are also excellent, but are located elsewhere in the Lost Lands. Available for Fifth Edition, Pathfinder, and Swords & Wizardry. $20 for pdf(s) or $50 for book(s). Books include free pdf.\n7. Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms. (PFRPG and Swords & Wizardry only) The Sundered Kingdoms are directly adjacent to the Borderland Provinces, both on the Sinnar Coast regional map. Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms provides not only a wider scope for the characters' wanderings, but an entire adventure path of its own. ($20 for PDF, $50 for book).\n8. Poster Map of the Sinnar Coast. This is a map of the Sinnar Coast Region, which includes the Borderland Provinces and the Sundered Kingdoms. It shows fewer details than the Borderland Provinces poster map, but a larger geographical area. This map interlocks with the map of the Gulf of Akados, which is the location of Bard's Gate. (Add $3 for PDF, $7 for poster).\n9. Poster Map of the Gulf of Akados. This is another regional map, like the one of the Sinnar Coast mentioned above. Only a small part of the Borderlands shows up on this map, but it is needed if you want to see the entire route between Bard's Gate and the Borderland Provinces. The Gulf of Akados Region map was included with Sword of Air, so if you have Sword of Air you probably already have this. (add $3 for PDF, $7 for poster).\n10. Vellum Map of the Sinnar Coast.  A map of the Sinnar Coast (same as above) but printed on real vellum. It is slightly translucent and is awesome for framing (or use in the game if you want to use a really authentic prop). This is an organic material, so keep it from prolonged exposure to direct sunlight or you get a smell of the tanning materials. Price: (Add $35 to your pledge).\n11. Quests of Doom 2 (5e only). This is a hardcover book of low-level Fifth Edition adventures -- almost all previously published for Pathfinder and Swords & Wizardry. Grimmsgate is one of the adventures, located in the Borderland Provinces, so if you want a low-level starter point other than Remballo, this is your book! (Add $20 to your pledge).\nShipping Costs\nWe had the option of collecting shipping fees during this Kickstarter campaign or through BackerKit. We have decided to collect shipping fees through BackerKit for the following reasons:\n1. Collecting shipping fees during the campaign artificially increases the funding level of the campaign. 2. Collecting shipping fees through BackerKit prevents our backers from having to pre-pay for shipping months in advance. 3. By collecting shipping fees shortly before fulfillment, we will be able to most accurately determine shipping costs based on actual book weights instead of estimating.\nAll backers are required to pay additional shipping charges beyond their pledge. Please refer to FAQ at the bottom of the page for estimated shipping charges. These charges will be assessed for payment upon completion of a BackerKit survey which will sent after the successful conclusion of this Kickstarter.\nTEMPLE DALLAS PLEDGE LEVELS\nThe Temple Dallas 1 pledge level gets you everything in the $487 Leather-bound Book Set Pledge Level, PLUS the convention (see below). Shipping for the books is free anywhere in the world.\nThe Temple Dallas 2 pledge level gets you everything in the Ultimate Collector Pledge Level, PLUS the convention (see below). Shipping for the books is free anywhere in the world.\nBoth levels of the Temple Dallas pledge also mean that you join the Froggies at North Texas RPG Con 2016, where we will pay for:\nYour convention badge\nYour hotel room\nYour meals and beverages\nAll you pay is your transportation to and from the convention!\nShipping charges apply as normal for any additional purchases through Backer Kit.\n*We credit Matt with starting off  the DIY old-school publishing movement called the OSR, when he wrote OSRIC with Stuart Marshall, basically inventing the concept of the retro-clone. But we can't legitimately mention the OSR without also mentioning a host of other people who founded the 2006 surge in old-school publishing, including (but definitely not limited to) Stuart Marshall, Jolly Blackburn, Steve and Mark of Dragonsfoot, Jerry Mapes of Knights & Knaves, RPGPundit of the RPGsite, Rob Kuntz, Dan Proctor, Jim Raggi, James Maliszewski, the Troll Lords, Doug Rhea and Mike Badolato of NTRPGCon, the ex-TSR guys, and many others.

Since we do not want to infringe on other people's trademark or confuse our customers Skirmish has been renamed to Scrimish (a Middle English version of Skirmish).\nWhat is Scrimish?\nScrimish is a fast moving card game that pits player against player in an epic 10 minute battle of strategy, memory, and misdirection. Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent.

As any gamer of any stripe knows, you can never have too many creatures, for these are the grist for the mill that is our game.\nThe early days of gaming saw some of the most classic and amazing creatures; weird beasties derived from the minds of people influenced by a genre of fiction that was in its prime, when fantasy truly meant the fantastic. Castles & Crusades has touched upon them from time to time, but by and large they have remained in the background. Until now.\nKim Hartsfield, long-time veteran of classic gaming, brings many of these monsters back to life.\nWhat Your Pledge Earns You!\nClassic Monsters: This 144 page hardcover book retails for $27.99 in print and $19.99 digital.

Don't let the Norse Drink alone! Help us build the WHOLE SET!\nCastles & Crusades Mythos sets the goal of bringing 3 new books of mythology to the gaming table: Codex Germania, Codex Slavorum, and Codex Classicum.\nSeveral years ago TLG released Brian N. Young's Codex Celtarum. A year later we followed up with Codex Nordica. Both of these very successful Kickstarter campaigns insured the book's release in hardcover format and sped up their delivery. These were beginning of the Mythos series. The Mythos series set out to explore the legends and mythos of the past, to unearth the wealth of material that lies in the fantastic imaginings of a world long gone and bring them to your gaming table.\nThough we have not released one in awhile, it doesn't mean that Brian ever stopped working on them. In fact, the opposite is quite true. Along with a wealth of adventures, Brian has hammered out the complete manuscripts for Codex Germania, the third of the Mythos series, and is largely done with Codex Slavorum, the fourth in the series. He has begun compiling his notes on Codex Classicum, the fifth in the series.\nWe don't want to wait for three years to publish these, we want them out yesterday, and that is the goal of this Kickstarter. If we meet our pledge goal we'll print all three books in hardback and you'll receive them in your store or on your door step as they come available (see SHIPPING below, especially the note concerning orders outside the United States)\n                        http://bit.ly/mythosks\nGAME COMPATIBILITY\nThese books are fully compatible with Castle & Crusades. However, it is simple to port the material over to almost any other RPG, but particularly Fifth edition. These books will unleash your imagination's flood gates and leave a stamp upon your game like no other.\nABOUT THE CODICES\nCodex Germania: Here Mr. Young explores the myths of the ancient Germans, as they looked upon the world during the age of the Roman Empire. In some ways it mirrors the Northmen, but in many more, it reveals the many hidden secrets of the warriors of the dark and brooding woods of north-central Europe.\nCodex Slavorum: Often overlooked the many and diverse peoples of eastern and southern Europe believed in a vibrant world of towering gods, clever fey and wild enchantments. Beyond even the Shadows of Rome theirs is a world onto itself.\nCodex Classicum: The Greeks first emerged on the world stage 3000 years ago. Their's was a vibrant culture that spawned some of the most fantastic and enduring myths the world has ever known. Mr. Young tackles these and places them in context with their Roman and Etruscan counterparts.\nDon't Want all Three?: Easy enough, Pledge at the 1$ dollar level and scroll down to the Add On section. There you'll see each book sold separately, add the dollar amount of the books, print and digital, that you want.\nAbout the Stretch Rewards\nFund by Wednesday: If this project funds by midnight on Wednesday night, all backers from the $99 level and above gain a a FREE PRINT version of Shadows of a Green Sky, signed by the author, Stephen Chenault.

You must protect and build a city. Hire heroes and troops for defense or to delve into dangerous dungeons for loot and glory. Build towers, blacksmiths and other buildings to gain the advantage and go for the win.\nLords of the Eastern Reach is for 1-4 players and takes about 20-30 minutes per player. This is an Officially Licensed game designed by veteran game designers Chris Taylor (Lead Designer of the much loved Fallout 1), and Scott Everts (Designer on many well known computer RPGs like Fallout 1&2, Fallout: New Vegas, and Planescape: Torment). The original video game development team was actively involved in its development. It includes everything you need to play, including rules for solitaire play.\nFor a brief introduction to the gameplay of Lords of the Eastern Reach check out this video from Paul Grogan at Gaming Rules! Want more detail? Check out the Rulebook.\nBackers of this Kickstarter will be the first to receive Lords of the Eastern Reach. And with your support, we will upgrade and expand the number and type of components. Each boxed copy will include the following:\nPlayers start with an allegiance card based on one of six areas from the Eastern Reach. Each allegiance has an unique ability, balanced by limits on food and buildings.\nTurns are very interactive with all players able to build and hire. First, the active player may send his army into the dungeon or to attack another player\u2019s city.\nAfter combat, that player draws resource tokens from the bag and is the first to build/hire. If there are any remaining resources, they are passed around the table, giving each other player an opportunity to build/hire in order. More details on resources and the build/hire phase are in this Update.\nResources are used to build cards and hire troops and heroes. Buildings may give you more resources or let you manipulate them to maximize the number of cards you can play. More details on the City Deck can be found in this Update.\nYou will have to build more farms and inns to grow the food necessary for your expanding army or hire additional craftsmen to maintain more buildings.\nFinally, the active player may discard cards from their hand and all players draw back up to their hand limit. When the last player finishes their turn, an event die is rolled that usually causes a little bit of chaos and destruction.\nThe game ends when the deck of city cards is emptied. At the end of the round, players tally their scores to find the victor!\nHERO: Want the game and nothing but the game?

While many locations on the map are familiar from old Necromancer Games titles and more recent Frog God Games products, the map itself did little to tell the story of this region and even less to answer questions that it raised: Who rules beyond the Gaelon River? What hazards and ruins await south of the well-known dungeons of Rappan Athuk and Barakus? And, what has led to this land becoming known as the Sundered Kingdoms?\nAs part of the ongoing strategy of Frog God Games to take older and hard-to-find Necromancer Games products and update them not only to new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords & Wizardry Complete rules but also to incorporate them into the Lost Lands setting as a way to introduce them to fans old and new alike, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms takes three classic Necromancer Games adventures: Patrick Lawinger\u2019s Morrick Mansion, Casey W. Christofferson\u2019s Aberrations, and Dave Brohman\u2019s Crystal Skull and integrates them into a continuous plot for an adventure path that takes PCs from level 3 to 15+, perfect for the party that has finished exploring the dungeons beneath Barakus and is looking for the next road to adventure.\nBut Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms is much more than just an update of those three previously published adventures. To the adventure path it adds three new original adventures written by Greg A. Vaughan called The Beast Within, Shades of Yellow, and Vengeance in the Hollow Hills that both tie in with the three older adventures and also move the plot from one to the next to create the continuity of the adventure path. While you could play any or all of the six adventures as standalone sessions, you can also use them as a single contiguous campaign to explore a large region of the Lost Lands.\nThe First Lost Lands Gazetteer\nIn addition to the updated and expanded adventure path, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms includes a campaign guide that expands upon the regional map of the Sinnar Coast. The central portion of that regional map is called the District of Sunderland, known more colloquially as the Sundered Kingdoms. Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms includes a full-color poster map that focuses on the Sundered Kingdoms from Endhome in the north to the southern extent of the Duchy of Southvale in the south, from Grollek\u2019s Grove in the west to the farthest reaches of Ramthion Island in the east. The adventure path takes players from one end to the other with many a stop in between, but the included gazetteer details the dozens of nations, cities, wilderness areas, ethnicities, and geographic features of note within the area as well. It also provides a regional history including more global events of the Lost Lands that had a direct bearing on the area, giving the first sneak peak at the Lost Lands bigger picture hinted at and referenced throughout more than 15 years of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games products alike. This detailed history and timeline extends back more than 3,000, years telling the history of not only a significant portion of the Lost Lands but also the unknown back stories to classic Necromancer Games products.\nFinally the Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms campaign guide also includes a chapter dedicated to the 13 insidious cults that are endemic to the Sundered Kingdoms region and are, perhaps, the true reason for its centuries of strife. This guide includes not only a write up of some of the most iconic and some not-so-well-known evil powers of the Lost Lands (yes, Orcus and Tsathogga are both there\u2026along with 11 others) but also provides details of their individual cults, where they are located, and how they operate in and affect the Sundered Kingdoms as well as the rest of the Lost Lands.\nOld School Bonus!\nAnd as one more bonus for those old-time Necromancer Games fans (and new Frog God Games fans!) who followed all the releases in order to maintain a complete collection \u2014 even the hard-to-find stuff \u2014 we\u2019ve got something you\u2019ve never seen before. When Crystal Skull was first published back in 2005, a secret level was written as bonus material but was never released. We\u2019ve dug back through the Necromancer Games archives and uncovered this gem; we\u2019ve dusted it off, updated its rules, and incorporated it into the book so that it now serves as the climax of the entire adventure path! Now on the 10th anniversary of its original release, you can experience Crystal Skull as Orcus originally intended but with the bonus of it serving to cap off an entire campaign incorporating three classic Necromancer Games adventures, three brand new adventures, and a whole host of Lost Lands legends, lore, and deepest, darkest secrets.\nBe the master of your Lost Lands campaign; buy The Lost Lands: Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms and remind your players that there\u2019s more to fear in the Lost Lands than just the dungeons.\nVideo Review\nShipping Costs\nShipping costs for United States customers is included in the price of your pledge.

Now for the first time hear some of the actual stories of the Lost Lands told in these short fiction pieces. Written by Lost Lands alum Kevin Wright (The Mires of Mourning, The Northlands Saga Complete) and newcomer Lost Lands fans Arlan Bullard, Rick McCracken, Jeff Provine, and Nathan Shank, these short stories look at some of the most important and interesting characters and events in the Sundered Kingdoms and give you the official story. Each of the short fiction pieces in these Tales of the Lost Lands looks at some character or location specifically located within the Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms book to give the story behind the adventure. As a GM you can use them as plot hooks to bring in your PCs, as snapshots of the campaign to pique the interest of your players, or as seeds for your imagination as you develop your own campaign within the Lost Lands. Each piece begins with a GM Notes section that will tell how spoilery the story is so you\u2019ll know if you want your players to be able to read it or not before the campaign is underway.\nTales Pack 1 unlocked with this stretch goal brings you the pdfs of the first three of the six Lost Lands tales to be told with this Kickstarter absolutely free with your existing pledge.

It is a realm of dark chaos \u2013 for these creatures of the echoing deeps count each other as rivals and enemies. It is a place without peace, a place without virtues, a place where every countenance of evil is to be found in sluggish torpor, stirring restlessly in dreams of cruelty and hatred. These dark and deadly provinces are known as the Under Realms. \nMost named regions in the Under Realms are quite distinct from each other, whether by geological formation or by the types of inhabitants that have established themselves in strategically important areas. Characters who enter this area expecting to find drowic elves, deep gnomes, and other \u201cnormal\u201d features of the Under Realms will swiftly discover the error of their thinking. The Vaults of the Sunless Sea, located to the north of the Cyclopean Deeps, might fit that description, but the Cyclopean Deeps are a different and decidedly more unpleasant area into which the denizens of the Vaults seldom venture.\nThis series of adventures forms a mini-campaign in the depths of the earth, for higher-level characters.

The city, caught up in the ruins of time and under the heels of chaos, proved an instant hit and helped place TLG firmly in the RPG market.\nGoing out of print when TLG moved away from d20, the Lost City returned to the brothers Gygax, where it sat in quiet retirement, leaving only the memories of many blood-soaked adventure hours.\nBut now, after many years, the Lost City returns to the Troll Dens!

But it needs a far better treatment.  TLG's goals with this are to bring it out in hardcover format and to release the city map in a full color, 18 x 22 inch poster. Our basic goal is to hit a hardcover book, but the stretch rewards will build the project into so much more!\nJoin us! Join the Fray! Bring The Lost City of Gaxmoor back to the gaming table in all the glory the wealth of its adventure deserves!\nEARLY BIRD: THE EARLY BIRD OPTION IS CLOSED. The first 187 backers have locked in the EARLY BIRD. Trollzah! All early bird backers receive a soft cover edition of the Lost City of Gaxmoor. You must back the 25.00 pledge level or above.

So if you pledge 25.00 and bought 25.00 dollars in Add Ons, we counted your over all Pledge as a 50 Pledge Level. If this edged you toward the next pledge level, you earned the Stretch Rewards from that higher level. Sadly, this policy, as cool as it is, has wreaked havoc in the Dens. It's caused payment confusion, mis-shipped orders, delayed orders and overall frustration from the pledger and hair pulling frustration from the shipping department here. So with that in mind, we are, sadly, going to place the emphasis on your pledge level. If you pledge at Pledge Level X, we will only ship the Stretch Rewards applied to that Pledge Level. If you want the next Pledge Level's Stretch Rewards, bumping up your Pledge Level is easy enough. The add on list will be included in the Kickstarter, but only as an add on.

But you hit a snag...what is that thing called...that door inside a door....in the castle gate. You know there's a specific name for it, you know it has to have a name, but what is it?  Use the wrong word and you've spoiled the tone, wrecked the description and leave the reader disappointed.\nThe right word for the job.\nWhen we first conceived the Storyteller's Thesaurus it wasn't with just one book in mind. There was always a companion book, the Dictionary. Both books together were conceptualized to help the writer or game designer reference the language they need, quickly and efficiently.\nLike the Thesaurus, the Storyteller's Dictionary is specifically designed for writers, teachers, game designers, students and anyone who enjoys the creative output of fantasy, science fiction or horror tales!  Broken up by subject matter, the Dictionary allows the end user to reference material with ease. Do you want to know about castles? Reference the Castle Section. Do you want to know about types of herbs? Reference the Herb Section.\nThe Storyteller's Dictionary is there for the many challenges of writing and designing. From herbs to castles, from nebulae to pole arms, the Dictionary is a must have.\nHere are a few samples:\n\nasafoetida (\u02cc\u00e6s\u0259\u02c8f\u025bt\u026ad\u0259): n. The brownish gum resin of various plants; has strong taste and odor; formerly used as an antispasmodic.\n\nwicket gate (w\u012dk\u2032\u012dt g\u0101t):n. A small door built into a larger door or gate. The wicket gate\u2019s purpose was to allow individual foot traffic in and out of the fortification without the trouble or risk of opening the fortification\u2019s gates.\n\nstupa (sto\u035eo\u2032p\u0259): n. A domed edifice housing Buddhist or Jain relics.\n\nsexton (s\u0115k\u2032st\u0259n): n. An employee or officer of a church who is responsible for the care and upkeep of church property and sometimes for ringing bells and digging graves.\n\nA reference book with some 300 pages of defined content!\n\nEARLY BIRD SPECIALS:  They are the same as the corresponding levels, but if you pledge within the first 72 hours, you save on your level!

Take a look at how they react when hit or missed and all of the things that differentiate them from each other.\nThe Grey Lady may be shy, but she's not afraid to stop your roughhousing in its tracks. If this librarian has paid your scenario a visit, she won't go quietly! If you do manage to get her attention, she leaves you only with your thoughts, waiting to cramp your style in the next adventure! The Grey Lady will add a challenge to many scenarios, especially if playing more than one in a single session. \nSandman will include a custom scenario specifically designed for him.\nZombie Taxi Drivers are eager to take the Ecto-1 on a joy ride around town! Once one of them reaches your ride, he immobilizes it until you get rid of him, but not until he sends it speeding off, ghost rider style!\nThe Zombie Taxi Drivers will come with a scenario specifically designed for them. However, they can also be used as Class 1 replacements and companions in base game scenarios. \nNote: When differently named Ghosts share a Class, roll a d6 for each, with the higher roll making an appearance. Impossible Mode versions get +3 to this roll!\nPlayer Cards\nUp to 4 players take on the roles of the Ghostbusters and attempt to return balance between the Spirit World and ours, busting ghosts and sealing the gates from which they\u2019re invading. Completing a scenario requires teamwork, planning, and resourcefulness.  \nMelanie Ortiz keeps a watchful eye on her coworkers, and a closer eye on her targets. Her selfless acts bring her closer to knowing herself, and in turn, in how to deal with the approaching end game of the other worldly intruders.\nJanine\u2019s quick response time is her key attribute at the front desk and as a Ghostbuster! When she spots a newly summoned Ghost, she acts fast, and when she sees a fellow Ghostbuster in a tight situation, she leaps into action!\nKylie thinks things through, to the point where she anticipates what's coming! Her research into the forbidden arts has granted her insight into the dark intentions of her enemies, whose actions seem entirely random to everyone else.\nRon is always trying to prove he has the chops to be a better Ghostbuster, even if that means putting himself in danger. He's no schlub when it comes to tech and the closer he gets to a threat, the more brazen he becomes.\nPeter Venkman is a risk-taker who does his best work in close proximity to ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nRay Stantz excels at removing slime from his fellow Ghostbusters.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nEgon Spengler is a wild man with his proton pack, but learns from his mistakes.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nWinston Zeddemore aids the team by being the best at depositing trapped ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nFeatured ghosts from the movies, cartoons, comics, and toylines have unique abilities as well, in terms of how they move and react to your actions.\nThe game features 3 campaigns, each with 4 unique scenarios. It\u2019s a fast-paced game: each scenario takes approximately 30 intense minutes to play. Every campaign concludes with an epic battle against an iconic boss character.\nThe game uses dice to resolve a lot of the action, so it\u2019s never the same game twice! The three types of dice represent the proton packs and ghost traps, the unpredictable movements of the ghosts, and the chaotic activity of the gates. During each turn, players move, shoot proton streams, deposit trapped ghosts, use unique character abilities, and drive the Ecto-1 to complete objectives. \nEach scenario\u2019s map is constructed using double-sided tiles, featuring street and park imagery by the talented Robb Mommaerts. With a starter mode and a challenge mode, Ghostbusters: The Board Game will keep you enthralled for hours!\nHere is a link to a Rules Primer to give you a bit of insight into specific scenario gameplay!  https://bit.ly/1vGYVAl\nHere is an introductory video that goes through the basic elements of the game!\nPLAY\n\nThe video below features a full playthrough of one of our several introductory scenarios! \nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, here is Part 2 of the playthrough!\nTo create the best game possible, we\u2019ve collaborated with some incredible people: game designers, avid game players, and Ghostbusters fans.

Just add $15 to your pledge! Details about the screens below in Add-On section.\nHere's a podcast interview with the author!\nTroll Lord Games and author Mike Stewart bring you:\nThe latter Nineteenth Century of history exists side by side with the literary worlds of Sherlock Holmes, Count Dracula, the Steampunk Science of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and Magicks both dark and mysterious. Victorious can be scaled to meet adventure with investigators of crime, defenders of society against evil monsters, and even mad scientists foiled by masked superheroes. Its up to you to decide the story for your chronicles of Victorious! \nThose familiar with the Castles & Crusades Fantasy Role-Playing Game will find Victorious easy to understand and play. However, there are many options that give the game its own unique flair. Among these are\u2026\n\u2022 Character classes that run the gamut of Fantastic Victoriana, from Contraptionists to Magicians, to Investigators and Mesmerists and more!\n\u2022 A system to create your own unique character if none of the template classes fit the ideas of your Chronicles. Supernatural powers, Shortcomings, Victory Points to give the Good their edge in a crisis, and much more!\n\u2022 Details of life in the Victorian era, with emphasis on London and New York City. Costs of living, incomes, and a wealth of weapons and equipment are provided to give your persona what he or she needs to battle evil in all its forms.\n\u2022 Vehicle data, from the London Hansom Cabs to New York Hackneys, to automobiles trains and airships as well as rules to create your own vehicles through Science or Magick!\n\u2022 Combat in all its forms, and how the Supernatural can impact both melee and missile combat. Carriage chase rules are provided as well as combat from trains to ships to the air also are provided.\n\u2022 Details on the life and lifestyles in the Victorian Era, both its lighter and darker sides. A list of British and Americans of note that intrepid players might encounter as they adventure in the world of Victorious.\n\u2022 Guidelines for moving the historical era for those wishing either time travel or another epoch for their game. World War II, The Modern Era, as well as a 2012 that the Scientific Romances of the Victorians imagined would be are all mentioned and given rules modifications for such safaris into the Chronoscape.\n\u2022 An individualized Magick system as well as rules to use the Castles & Crusades magic spells if desired. Conversions of characters from C&C and Victorious to each other\u2019s rules are a snap and guidelines are given for such.\n\u2022 Non-player Victorians are provided as samples, from those champions of Good such as Sherlock Holmes to those of Evil such as Dracula, and even those of a Neutral bent such as Spring Heel Jack.\n\u2022 An introductory adventure where the death of Dr. Henry Jekyll is investigated and is not what it seems.\nIn short, everything a Genteel Magistrate (GM, the director of the game) needs to begin their own Adventures in the Age of SuperMankind!\nInterior art\nDiorama courtesy of Fat Dragon Games, for levels $55 and above.\nEARLY BIRDS\nA note on the Early Bird Backers.

Click the banner above to see a limited group of reward levels you can still get in on until March 13th!\nWe're back!\nThe team that brought you the award-winning Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director\u2019s Cut is back with an all new, full length standalone cyberpunk tactical cRPG set in Shadowrun's magically Awakened Hong Kong of 2056.\nHONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\nThe lure of a quick payday draws you from Seattle into the neon glow of Victoria Harbor\u2026 and into a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making. A terrifying threat looms on the horizon - a supernatural force that corrupts and consumes everything it touches. Dragged into the shadows of Kowloon City, you will need to forge new connections and gain \"face\" to survive.\nHong Kong contains fantastic elements for a new Shadowrun setting: an underworld of triads, tongs, and gangs to navigate, wild magic to harness, and bleeding edge cybertech to equip. Plus, Hong Kong\u2019s culture is steeped in \"guanxi\" - a network of influence and relationships based upon a combination of social status, and prestige. All of these elements add up to a great new setting for running the shadows.\nShadowrun: Hong Kong has everything you expect from a Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun game: strong storytelling and sharp writing, lots of morally gray choices, a crew of memorable characters with distinct personalities, challenging tactical turn-based combat, a robust character creation system, and a one of a kind cyberpunk-meets-magic game setting that\u2019s endured for over 25 years. \nOur Backers voted for Hong Kong as the next city for us to bring to life and we\u2019re excited to be working on it! \nYour New Crew\nJust as in Dragonfall, our Hong Kong story will feature a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that can only happen in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. \nAnd, as introduced in Dragonfall, you'll be able to guide your crew's advancement by choosing special abilities on their Growth Tracks to complement the choices you make for your own character. \nGobbet is an ork street shaman and a follower of Rat. Her devotion to her totem has granted her unique abilities to control the battlefield, trapping her enemies behind barriers of coruscating magic and herding them with clouds of blistering poison.\nTerritoriality Track: Focuses on battlefield control by buffing Gobbet\u2019s barrier spells (increasing damage, increasing the number of tiles affected) and planting AOE damage spells, such as Toxic Fog. She also gains the ability to destroy or consume summoned spirits, eliminating threats from enemy shamans.\nSpiritualist Track: This track focuses on improving Gobbet\u2019s control over summoned spirits. She can reduce the chance that they slip out of her control, and even seize control of hostile spirits summoned by her enemies. Progressing down this track turns Gobbet into a versatile and powerful summoner.\nWu is a veteran security expert with years of sprawl-site combat experience. He has the muscle and the weaponry to either beat his targets into submission or to break them outright, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nCrowd Control Track: Focuses on a variety of non-lethal attacks that inflict stun (-AP) effects. Progressing down this track unlocks a shock baton, tear gas grenades, and zip ties to subdue stunned enemies.\n  Lethal Force Track: Focuses on inflicting lethal ranged damage. Progressing down this track gives Wu attack abilities such as Mercy Kill, which does additional damage and has a higher to-hit percentage on targets who are close to death.\n\nIs0bel is a dwarf decker with the tools and the expertise to clear her own way to a target mainframe. Trained for combat by a cabal of hacktivists, she\u2019s as deadly in meat-space as she is in the Matrix.\n\nEspionage Track: Increases Is0bel\u2019s decking skills and her Mark Target ability. Progressing down this tree unlocks new custom programs/abilities for use in the Matrix, as well as custom Expert System Programs (ESPs).\n\nSabotage Track: Is0bel carries a sniper rifle for meat-space skirmishes. Her arsenal also includes proximity mines that she can use to create traps for her enemies. This track increases and adds to the effects caused by these weapons, unlocking higher-yield explosives and Flechettes that strip armor from enemies.\n\nWith your generous support, we're adding Racter to your crew!\nRacter is a highly specialized roboticist-turned-rigger who fights with the aid of \u201cKoschei,\u201d his custom walker-form drone. He also carries an engineering toolkit that he can use to repair Koschei and enhance its abilities during combat.\nMangler Track: Makes Koschei into a melee-ranged wrecking machine. Progressing down this track unlocks movement boosts for the drone and bolts close combat weapons onto its chassis, such as rotary saws and clawed feet. These attachments unlock new close combat attacks for the drone.\nPredator Track: Turns Koschei into a walking artillery piece. Progressing down this track bolts new ranged weapons to the drone, such as an auto-shotgun or a grenade launcher.\n\nWith your generous support, we were able to add Gaichu to your crew! And don't forget, now that Racter and Gaichu are unlocked, their COLLECTIBLE FIGURES have been added to THE TALISMONGER Reward Level!\nThanks to his elite Red Samurai training, Gaich\u00fb has access to close combat abilities that are inaccessible to other characters. These take the form of stance-based katana attacks that flow together in sequence, each of which has its own unique animation.\n\nRed Samurai Track: A mixture of offense and defense. Includes additional sword attacks, such as a coup de grace that can be used to dispatch stunned targets. Gaich\u00fb also gains self-buffs that can temporarily boost his armor, or give him the effects of cover when standing in the open.  \n\nGhoul Track: HMHVV infection has its advantages. This track includes a bite attack that inflicts damage and heals Gaich\u00fb, and claw and spit attacks that inflict damage and cause debuffs on enemies.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong contains all the features of Shadowrun Returns and builds upon the engine and gameplay upgrades we added to Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut (including the ability to save your game anywhere). \nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: The Shadowrun series hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart 12+ hour non-linear story with a diverse cast of all-too-(meta)human characters. (Some funding goals will add more hours of gameplay.)\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions. Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. \nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\nPowerful Game Editor: Create Your Own Stories! With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor. Our new Hong Kong setting will add tons of new weapons, spells, characters along with oodles of new tiles to the long list of editor assets from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut!\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Shadowrun: Hong Kong will be composed by fan-favorite Jon Everist, composer of the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall -Director's Cut. Here's an example of Jon's work:\nPC Only Release\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is being developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems only. We have elected to focus all our efforts on PC in order to deliver the best game we can without the current processing and memory limitations of tablets. This focus allows us to have higher-fidelity visuals, larger map sizes, and more stuff on screen.\nBecause we want to do more.\nWe're totally committed to making Shadowrun: Hong Kong and we're already several months into development. The project is budgeted, fully staffed, and on-schedule for a mid-2015 release. We also have a story we're really excited about. At our current budget, it's going to be 12+ hours long and at the quality level of Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\nBut this is Harebrained Schemes and, as always, we have more ideas than we have budget. \nThat's where you come in.\nBy backing the project, you'll increase our production budget and get more features, more improvements, and more game. Take a look at the funding goals below to see all the stuff we want to add.\nNow, we could always talk to traditional publishing partners, but we\u2019re pretty independent-minded around here and we only want to serve one master - our audience. \nWe're gonna ship a great game and it can be even greater with your help. Our last adventure together was a blast and we think the results speak for themselves. So help co-fund our third Shadowrun game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and let's make the best Shadowrun game yet!\n$100,000 - Enhanced Player Controls! In addition to all the new Tech, Magic, Weapons, Consumables, Creatures, and Enemies we're already planning, if we reach our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll add a bunch of interface upgrades. These include the ability to decide which team member picks up an item in free-move mode, item swapping between party members, a player-initiated turn-mode toggle so you can position your team before you enter combat, and a spread-range indicator for shotguns and sweeping melee attacks.\n$150,000 - Animatic Scene Transitions! These are short animated slide shows with voice narration that play at key points in the story - the opening, end of Act 1, end of Act 2, and at the end. \n$200,000 - Racter joins your team of runners! Racter is a Russian rigger with a wry smile who relates better to his custom drone than he does to people. We'll tell you about Racter's unique gameplay abilities and player-influenced upgrade paths when we get closer to unlocking him.\n$250,000 - More Animatic endings! If we hit this goal, we'll be able to create multiple animatic endings for the story to reflect the choices you make in the game.\n$300,000 - Gobbet's personal side mission! Dive deep into the backstory of your team's resident Rat shaman. Gobbet's absurdist philosophy and impulsive nature have led her on a twisting path through life. In her personal mission, you'll get the chance to walk that path with her and see for yourself where Rat takes you.\n$350,000 - More better sound! We can only describe smells (for now) but we can definitely improve on our audio. Dynamic combat music will ebb and flow as a battle progresses, providing more atmosphere and tension. Enhanced Ambient Sound is a catch-phrase for lots of technical babble about making your play environment sound more real and less repetitive.  \n$400,000 - Gaichu joins your team of runners! Gaichu was a member of the Renraku Corporation's elite Red Samurai security force. Infected with the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) on a mission gone wrong, he was forced to abandon his pure-human unit as the virus slowly twisted him into a ghoul. Now a shadowrunner, Gaichu could prove a valuable ally, but his loyalty comes at a price\u2026\n$450,000 - Enhanced Cyber! If this goal is reached, we'll add a new skill to our character creation system that enhances a character's cyberware and unlocks the ability to install powerful new cybernetic enhancements. This system will further differentiate characters with 'ware from their flesh and blood counterparts. We'll also add cyberweapons that you can install into your characters' arm slots, complete with new animations and visual effects.\n$500,000 - Is0bel's personal side mission! Born to immigrant parents of Somali descent, Is0bel has experienced life in the slums of Kowloon first-hand. Escaping at a young age, she retreated into the cold perfection of the Matrix, but her family still languishes in the depths of the sprawl. Her personal mission will take her back to a place that she barely escaped from - and you'll come along for the ride.\n$550,000 - Expanded magic! If we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll add new gameplay options and equipment for magic-using characters. Shamans will gain the ability to summon Shrine Spirits at specific locations in the Hong Kong environment. These great-form spirits are far more powerful than their mundane counterparts, can\u2019t break away from your control, but are limited in duration. Hermetic mages and physical adepts will gain access to Foci - enchanted weapons and objects that can boost a spellcaster\u2019s magical power or allow an adept to deliver devastating magical attacks.\n$600,000 - Gaichu\u2019s personal side mission! When Gaichu became infected with HMHVV, the Red Samurai code that he'd sworn to demanded that he take his own life. Instead, he took to the shadows, dishonoring himself and the rest of his team in the process. In Gaichu's personal mission, you will square off against a squad of highly-trained warriors who will stop at nothing to destroy their old teammate... and you alongside him.\n$700,000 - Revamped Matrix: Art and Gameplay! If we hit this goal, we'll add more people to the team to revise the look, feel, and gameplay of the Matrix. We want the Matrix to feel more like you're traveling in the digital world. We also want to add new types of Intrusion Countermeasures and new ways of interacting with them so that decking feels more like an illegal entry into someone's system. \n$1,000,000 - Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign! We have our plans set for the story we want to tell in Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but if we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll create an ADDITIONAL 4-5 hour Hong Kong Mini-Campaign that takes place AFTER the story ends. The Mini-Campaign will allow you to IMPORT your high-karma Hong Kong character for a challenge only a prime runner could accept.  The Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign will come out sometime before the end of 2015 and will be FREE to Backers at the $15 pledge level and up. \n\nWe know from experience that fulfilling lots of physical rewards is a big, distracting, and expensive undertaking and we want your funding to go into making a quality game - not into shipping a bunch of tchotchkes. Remember, the people making your game are also the ones making and sending your stuff! So, we created a bunch of cool digital rewards and TWO sweet physical rewards. We hope you like them and we hope you support us. \nHey! Here's a special BONUS for Backers at the $35 Reward level and above!\nEveryone who backs the project at the $35 Reward Level and above will get access to an AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK from the Shadowrun Development Team. Hear the writers, designers, artists, engineers, and composer discuss how the game was made, the challenges they faced, and the fun they had while making the game. The audio commentary will arrive in an update after the game is released.\nAND everyone who backs at the $35 Reward Level and above will also get TWO HIGH-RES DIGITAL POSTERS that, when placed together, combine into a beautiful Shadowrun Panorama. The first poster contains a Timeline of Shadowrun History. The second contains a Glossary of Shadowrun Slang. Tell your friends!\nAll rewards starting at the CHUMMER ($15) level come with at least one copy of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\nThe actual figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted and numbered!\n Here she is along side a Golem Arcana figure.\nThe power of a Fire Ram is no match for the cunning of a Rat Shaman!\nHer final figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted, and numbered\nCreated over 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of The Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world should have ended on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic returned to end our world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\n Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news - we've done this before. More than once. \n\nWe've run successful Kickstarter projects and we've made two Shadowrun games plus a Director's Cut, so we know how to deliver. \n\nThere's always risk in game development, though. In this case, we have a few new team members who need to learn the ropes - but we've got a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people, who go the extra mile for their game and their Backers and they've already distinguished themselves as great additions to the team.\n\nBeyond that, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we need to revise it several times until we're happy. A critical bug could take a whole week to fix while others take ten minutes. \n\nSo while we've done Shadowrun games before and have a solid idea of what we're doing and how our tools work, we haven't done THIS Shadowrun game before and you never know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "The Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign Is Here!!", "update_content": "We are pleased to announce that the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is now available as part of a free update to Shadowrun: Hong Kong.This update also adds the developer audio commentary Kickstarter reward and a variety of small game improvements such as new visual effects, updated dialogue, and editor features for User Generated Content.\nSo, we\u2019ve rebranded the title asShadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition to reflect all the new content.

From the north, it covered the Shelves of the Mist, and much of Southern Kayomar to lap up against the feet of the Bergrucken in the northeast. Those days were long ago, when dragons were young, and the sentients ruled the soil and men and dwarves were few and unlearned. The Darkenfold is a remnant of that forest, stretching only several hundred miles from the Danau River and the Plains of Kayomar in the east to the doorsteps of the unexplored Rhodope Mountains in the west. In the south, the great Soup Marsh hems in the ancient trees, and the forest continues in wild growth from there to the far-off Shelves of the Mist in the distant north. The Eldwood, to the east, holds the heart of the Ethvold of old, but the Darkenfold holds its dark memories. It is an evil wood, filled with its own wild abandon and creatures of ill intent. Those who live there know that the trees and the soil hold memories of their past glory and do not forget the axes of men, orcs, dwarves, and goblins that have plundered them of their wealth and life.\nRead the full write up from Shades of Mist HERE.\nThe Darkenfold\n$16,000 STRETCH REWARD: WHAT IS INZAE?\nWe are moving toward our next stretch reward, and it occurs to us that some of you may not know what Inzae is. Here's a bit of synopsis.\n What\u2019s next?? The World of Inzae. It\u2019s the inner world.\nIn the beginning the All Father crafted substance from his own being. But in the darkness of the Void he saw a light and there he found the dragon, coiled upon herself, thrashing about. And she rent the fabric of the Void and from the tears came the maelstrom, a madness of elements that spilled into the Void.\nAnd the All Father settled upon the Maelstrom and from it he created the world of Aihrde. But seeing him the dragon thought to make her own world, and beneath the Maelstrom she fashioned Inzae, a grim world, and dangerous. Thus there came to be two worlds, one astride the Maelstrom, one beneath and they hung in the Void for all the long years.\nInzae is another world, apart from Aihrde, yet bound in its mythology. The two are connected through the roots of the Great Tree and the Rings of Brass.\nWhat does this mean for you and your game? There are two worlds to play in, one, Aihrde, more traditional fantasy, the other, Inzae, a dark world of harsh realities, little magic and where death is a constant.\nAihrde was created by Stephen Chenault and Inzae by Davis Chenault.\nWe are only a few hundred from release of the primer for the World of Inzae. In short your getting two for one!\nAbout the World of Aihrde Project\nPresently, the World of Aihrde consists of 2 volumes, the Codex of Aihrde and the Players Guide to Aihrde, with one 27\" x 39\" map depicting the Cradle of the World adventure area. We'd like to expand this, with a particular focus on the maps, improve the content of the book and perhaps make the book full color.\nNOTE:  Both $75 levels come with a PDF copy of the corresponding book. \nA Note on Nomenclature\nAihrde is the name of the world.\nThe Codex of Aihrde is the world setting book. It is divided into two sections: The Andanuth and the Almanac. The book will be printed in hardcover format, is approximately 276 pages long and it's price (depending on whether the map is folded into the book or not) stands around $35.00.\nThe Players Guide to Aihrde consists of player information: racial classes, spells, guilds and orders. This book will be printed in hardcover format, is 76 pages long and its price stands around $20.00.\nThe World of Aihrde Map consists of the entire world, as seen in the image below. There are no plans presently to have this map printed anywhere other than inside the Codex of Aihrde, unless we meet stretch goals as noted below.\nThe Cradle of the World Map (also known as the Lands of Ursal) is that region of the world covered by the Almanac in the Codex of Aihrde as depicted in the map below. It is as you see in the box in the map above. Presently this map is sold separately in 9 sectional maps.\nWant to see a larger preview of the map? Click the one below:\nObjectives\nPresently, the Cradle of the World Map is sold separate from the Codex. We want this bound with the book, folded and fully detachable. This allows for one stop shopping when picking up the book. The max size of this is 39\" wide by 27\" tall.\nBut the Cradle of the World map is too beautiful to keep in such a small form. We want to split the map in half, print two of the same size and ship in a tube. This makes the Cradle of the World map twice as large and keeps it rolled and not folded.\nThe long range goal of this kickstarter is to land the books -- both if possible -- in full color. Printed like the three sisters kickstarter, it will make the whole a far better experience.\nAnd lastly, we'd love to see the Cradle of the World mounted on a spring roller assemble for you to hang on your ceiling, wall, or put on a tripod.\nWHAT IS THE WORLD OF AIHRDE\nAihrde is a complete campaign and world setting for your favorite RPG. Whether your playing Castles & Crusades, Dungeon Crawl Classics or any other RPG, you can find a home in Aihrde.  There is an in-depth history, mythology, descriptions of all the races of the world, from dwarves to giants and elves to orcs, a case by case study of all the relevant kingdoms and peoples and the geographical regions they live. It also includes deities and all the relevant info needed to run them: guilds, orders, significant terrain features and so very much more.  Aihrde is the most complete campaign setting on the market today.\nSee the Full Table of Contents of the Codex of Aihrde here.\nSee a Preview of the Codex of Aihrde here.\nAIHRDE\nThe world of Aihrde spins upon an earth-like axis of ancient civilizations where good and evil have struggled for countless years. It is a world that bears the markings of its past; where ancient evils slumber, stained with the power of eldritch wizardry; where gods dwell in bejeweled halls of wonderment, worshiped by men and women of all creeds; where dragons live in great dens of heaped treasure; where the new stands upon the ruins of the old in beds of ancient glory.\nFor a thousand years and more, the dark god Unklar ruled the world in a terrible reign of Winters Dark. But now, banished to the Great Empty, Aihrde is a world reborn.\nIn the After Winters Dark, heroes tread in iron shod boots and wizards lean on crooked staffs to plunder the buried wealth and power of the ages. Here, the eternal struggle goes on, age after age, for Aihrde is a world of adventure, of undaunted heroes, untainted by the decadent philosophies of those meek who suffer in the shadows of lesser men. For here, the stone columns of history are wiped clean, awaiting the bold to carve their mark and gain entry to the halls of immortality!\nSTRETCH REWARDS EXPLAINED\n$4,000: Unlocked! We are funded.

Please stop by the d20E website ay www.d20entertainment.com  or Troll Lord Games for news on the Castles & Crusades  RPG at http://www.trolllord.com\n\"Beyond the River\" is a tale of Juergan of Astode, a knight of some renown. Weary and spent, seeking only the solace of quiet, he's retired to the Barren Wood, upon the banks of the Hruesen River, in the shadow of the Blacktooth Ridge. There he's built his home. and there he lives out his days in meagre comforts.\nBut now, he stands before the Baron Botkin . . . .\n\n\"My niece, Clarrisa, fell into the cold waters of the Hruesen River. The current was swift there, in the river's bend, and it pulled her down stream. It was so fast. Areth went after her, but he never came up. But she did. Clarrisa did. She crawled out of the water on the far side of the river, upon the feet of the Blacktooth Ridge. She called to me, but I could not hear her. I could not hear what she was saying. The water was too loud and my blood was rushing. That's my sister's daughter. She's only nine.\n\n\"We went to get boats, but it took us too long. By the time the fisherman had uncovered their craft and brought them down to the river bank, she was gone.\n\n\"As the light failed we found her trail. She crawled up the bank. This we know. But it was snowing already. Not much. Just enough to cover her trail. We lost her. But there's been no murder of crows, no circle of death, no wolf calling its mates to the feast. She's alive. I know she's alive. \n\n\"Juergan. You know the ridge. You know what dwells there. I charge you, as a knight of New Aenoch and servant of the Empress, to cross the Hruesen River and find my niece. Alive. Failing that. I want vengeance. But alive or dead, whatever took her, dies.\"\n\n\"Beyond the River\" is the title for episode one of d20 Entertainment's live action drama, the first of what we hope are many tales of Juergan of Astode. \n\nWritten by Stephen Chenault, the Troll Lord of Troll Lord Games, author of over 20 RPG supplements and the Codex of Aihrde, and Produced by d20 Entertainment. This is an epic moment in the history of Castles & Crusades and the World of Aihrde. Don't miss out!!! Only two days left!\n\n\nSir Juergan of Blacktooth Ridge was born the fifth son of a knight in the service of the King of Kayomar. As a young man he was farmed out by his father to the Knights of Haven who served many lords. Juergan quickly earned a reputation for his bravery on the battlefield, but more, for his skills with both lance and sword. He proved himself on many occasions and soon other knights wished to serve with him and he rose in the ranks, where he proved an even greater skill through calm deliberation and an iron determination both on the field of battle and off it. \nIn his prime he joined the Crusade called by the young Empress of New Aenoch. She called for all men of worth and courage to come to her land and drive back the vestiges of evil that ever lurked upon her borders. For two and twenty years Juergan served the Empress, as well as the many Dukes and Prelates who ruled under her. It was during one such foray for the Empress, upon the heights of the Blacktooth Ridge that Juergan unearthed a coven of witches. They served the black-hearted Unklar, the Horned God, bound to him by covenants both ancient and new. For many years he struggled with them. Some were slain, others fled, but not until he convinced one of their number, Ingrid, to cast off he Horned God, was he able to destroy the coven. It was perhaps his greatest deed. But it soured him, and he left the Knights of Haven. \nHe retired, with great renown, if little wealth, to a small plot of land near to Ludensheim beneath the shadow of the Blacktooth Ridge. There for years he has enjoyed the comfort of a simple life, but Juergan\u2019s fame carried to the many storied halls of lords and ladies and the powers of one such as he are not easily forgotten. They come to him, more often than not . . . .\nStarring: Rene LaVertu.\nProducer: Ken Whitman \nExecutive Producer: Stephen Chenault\nStudio: d20 Entertainment\n\nSimply increase your backing amount by the amount above.

The Kickstarter has been doing so well we have \"commissioned\" Mr. Ward to offer his novel, \"The King's Commission\" to be used a stretch goal at $33,000.  If we make it there before it ends, everyone at $25 level will receive a digital copy of it and everyone at $75 will receive both the print and digital copy.  Here's a little more about the novel:\nThe KING\u2019S COMMISSION novel presents a James Bond style fantasy action hero adventuring for King and country through a richly detailed enchanted world. This work presents Captain Corbyn Cauldron of the King\u2019s own 25th Lancers. The heroic Captain moves through a danger-filled fantasy world. At first his King\u2019s Commission seems a fool\u2019s errand, but a great many powerful enemies work toward stopping the hero from carrying out his duty to King and country. Wizards, assassins, Fey elves, and demons, all magically plot to destroy Cauldron. Things are never quite what they seem, and Corbyn is no exception to that axiom as he fights and loves his way through his duty. The KING\u2019S COMMISSION is the first in a series of novels on Corbyn Cauldron and his adventures in the fantasy empire of Dulse.\nThe votes are in!  And they are pretty overwhelming in favor of hardcover, with 87% of you preferring to see this book in hardcover as opposed to soft. So let\u2019s make that happen! Our newest stretch goal is going to be at $30,000. If we do that, everyone that is getting a print copy will get it in hard instead of soft. This will ensure that the book is more durable, easier to use and more pleasant to work with.\nWe currently are at $26,100 so we don\u2019t have that far to go, but with only 2 days left, it is a bit of an uphill climb. But with your help, we can\nmake it happen. If you are at $10, consider upgrading to the $25 level. This will not only get it in hardcover (if we reach 30K) but also get you the anthology in print as well and any other stretch rewards at that level.\nSo help spread the word and let\u2019s get this into hardcover! You can use this link: http://bit.ly/stcgks to share with friends and tell them about this great endeavor we are undertaking.\nGiving back to the schools!

I knew it was spelled something like \u201cAtlatal,\u201d but I couldn\u2019t find it in the two dictionaries I had or on Wiki. I turned to the Missile weapon section of the STORYTELLERS THESAURUS and there it was\u2014ATLATL.\nI like to give unusual treasures in my adventures. I\u2019m constantly looking for little know gems. The STORYTELLERS THESAURUS has a huge section on treasures and especially gems that I have found invaluable in creating fantasy treasures of all types and sizes.\nOne day I had to fill up a wizard\u2019s spell casting chamber with appropriate things. I went to the WIZARD\u2019S THINGS section of the thesaurus and there were hundreds of useful items I could put in the chamber. The work of many hours took fifteen minutes.\nAbout the Authors\nScroll to the bottom of this page to see information on the authors of the Storyteller's Thesaurus.\nSHIPPING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES: If you are ordering from anywhere other than the United States we will work with you on shipping.

Ward\nBeing old is a problem when writing things like this because old people have done a lot more than young ones. I was born on May 23, 1951; the same year as the release of my favorite movie FORBIDDEN PLANET. I was lucky enough to marry my high school sweetheart Janean M. Bray in 1973 and we had three fine sons: Breck, Jim, and Theon. In turn they have given me six marvelous grandchildren: Keely, Miriam, Sophia, James Preston, Teagan, and Noah.\nIn 1974 I was lucky again and met E. Gary Gygax and he taught me how to play D&D on the porch of his house in that summer. I made the suggestion that he should do a science fiction version of the game and he was nice enough to say, \u201cJim I\u2019m too busy right now, why don\u2019t you give it a try.\u201d He didn\u2019t know I could write, but he\u2019d played D&D with me enough to know I was creative. That was the beginning of my successful design career as I put together METAMORPHOSIS ALPHA the first science fiction role-playing game.\nFrom there I designed GODS, DEMI-GODS, & HEROES, GAMMA WORLD the first apocalypse role-playing game, and lots of other things. In 1980 I started working full-time for TSR for the amazing salary of $13,700 dollars. I loved working for TSR and thought I wanted to be there for the rest of my life. In 1984 I was laid off with 55 other TSR employees in the third of five nasty purges that eventually took the company from about 386 people to 86 people.\nIn 1986 after I had written quite a few products for royalties, TSR wisely decided it would be cheaper to hire me back again. I quickly rose to the Vice President of Product and helped the company have its best year in 1996. I was asked by the then president of the company to fire 20 of my editors and designers and I refused as the president wanted her company accounts to look better and it had nothing to do with the working ethics of those 20. I left TSR and never looked back. My poor hard working wife had to deal with me going from making a great salary to no salary for awhile.\nI worked for lots of different companies after that and did many varied types of design including: DRAGON BALL Z collectible card game, helped with the Tomb Raider, Wheel of Time, and Babylon 5 collectible card games, worked on the JEWELED CHALK product line, a Star Wars computer game, and recently OF GODS AND MONSTERS and TAINTED LANDS products from Troll Lords.\nThat takes me right up to joining the Eldritch Enterprises group with three old friends. I\u2019m happily designing role-playing product with science fiction, horror, and fantasy elements. I\u2019m working on the third in my Monty Haul series of fantasy adventure products. I\u2019m also keeping my hand in science fiction as I write the third in the Dark series.\nIt\u2019s my hope to do lots more design work in the time I have left on this Earth.\nAnne K. Brown\nAnne Brown was destined to be a word junkie from a very young age. Reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at age 8 turned her on to the magical prose of Roald Dahl, and reading her aunt\u2019s vintage Nancy Drew books hooked her as a reader for life. Anne recalls being charmed by the quaint prose of Nancy\u2019s adventures as she donned a frock, alighted from her roadster, and enjoyed luncheons of watercress tea sandwiches. The first real job Anne wanted as a little girl (after ballerina and princess) was to be a librarian.\nA series of odd turns led to Anne becoming a games editor and designer for TSR, Inc., where the twisted genius of the other editors and designers rubbed off on her. After being immersed in the TSR thinktank for eight years, Anne moved on to freelance work. Eventually, she became the author of ten fiction and nonfiction books, numerous magazine articles and game products, and dozens of credited and uncredited publications. Her work also includes grant writing and marketing.\nWithout realizing it, Anne\u2019s head became a vast collection of words and information, so much so that her husband dubbed her \u201cthe font of useless knowledge.\u201d She can tell you that a group of turkeys is called a rafter, the difference between a greave and someone who grieves, and that a big difference exists between a parley and a parlay. Anne realized long ago that words are her toys, and she enjoys collecting them and playing with them.\nImagine her head exploding with possibilities when her buddy Jim Ward called one day, wanting to put together a thesaurus. After several ideas, variations of ideas, and spin-offs of ideas, The Storyteller\u2019s Thesaurus was born. Many times, this book nearly became the project that would never end, partly because it was so gosh-darn much fun. This project was way more fun than a kid in a candy store\u2014it was running amok in Wonka\u2019s factory and all of his secret back rooms.\nAnne hopes that readers will enjoy romping through The Storyteller\u2019s Thesaurus and finding fascinating new words, but mainly, she hopes it will provide inspiration, a kick-start to writer\u2019s block, and a tool to craft marvelous prose, rich settings, and memorable characters.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLarge books such as this one are hard to print and bind and we have to choose our printers with care.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges we face is creating such a large book and maintaining the quality of the printing and binding. In order to do this, we must find a printer with the knowledge and capabilities to execute a book of this size and have it look polished and professional, something we take great pride in. This will cost more than usual printing so Kickstarter becomes essential in raising enough capital to give this book the quality it demands and deserves. \n\nWe are confident that with a successful Kickstarter we can bring this product to the world not only as a great resource, but also as a great looking book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Storytellers Thesaurus Backers", "update_content": "Greetings from Chenault & Gray,\nA few years back you were gracious enough to support Chenault & Gray in one of our first major projects, the Storytellers Thesaurus!

If the info above doesn't help, you can ask the project leader directly.\nQ: Doesn\u2019t Pathfinder have a witch?  Why do I need this?\nA: Yes, there is a Witch class. This book embraces that class and extends it. While we all enjoy that class, there are some things we felt were missing or could be better defined. This book will address those areas.  \nQ: What can I contribute at the $300 level?\nA: You may submit new feats, spells, magic items, covens, etc., to the book. The limit is 1,000 words and we will work with you to make the submission\nQ: What is with the retro-looking cover?\nChristina responds: It's a Peter Bradley cover, and Peter mainly works on Castles & Crusades. I LOVE this type of fantasy art. Peter Bradley is one of my favorite artists. How could you not like it? The lettering may change on the final version, but this is my cover. \nQ: Will there be Hero Lab files?\nI am in the process of talking with a programmer about such. It is on my radar.

Designed for use with multiple players, Castles & Crusades puts you in charge of the adventure path. Included within are all the rules of play, how to get started in your very own role playing game, how to run the game and play in it. It\u2019s an easy to learn attribute-based rules system that allows players to choose among 13 archetypal character classes and 7 races to with which create their characters. Spells, equipment, fast-paced combat rules, and all essential information needed to play a game of Castles & Crusades are in this book.\nWant to know more about the game?  Check out this page on our website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoving a product line from black & white to color is a huge risk. The costs associated with the improvement are large. The interior pages need redesigned, the art converted from black and white to color, the whole of it needs to be integrated. Paper concerns in the actual printing play a role, as some papers absorb color better than others. The cost of printing the physical books is large as well, usually double what it costs to print in black & white.\n\nTo bring all three main C&C books out in color is a large leap for TLG and will take a pretty penny to do so.

More material from The Lost Lands is on the way, and while we finish up the massive Sword of Air, we decided to go ahead and get the next volume of material going.\n\nWinner of the 2004 ENWorld Gold Ennie for Best Adventure, this hardcover book is the original (revised and expanded) work by WDBK Kenower and Bill Webb. The book will be produced in 2 versions, one for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and one for the Swords & Wizardry Roleplaying Game. \n\nFor all you Lost Lands fans out there, this one is canon \u2014 it interfaces with Stoneheart Valley, Rappan Athuk, and Sword of Air, and represents the next of many ongoing chronicles of the Frog God Games/Necromancer Games home world. A MUST HAVE book for any fan of our material.\n\nOur base level of funding is small \u2014 we wanted to keep the price point down on this. We listened to your feedback from our last few Kickstarters \u2014 and we are adding more new material based on stretch goals as detailed below. \n\nThe Lost City of Barakus, designed to take characters from 1st to 5th or 6th level (or higher), is as much of a campaign setting as an adventure. Detailed within these pages is the great, bustling metropolis of Endhome, the Penprie Forest and Duskmoon Hills located north of that city, and, finally, the huge dungeon that is the Lost City of Barakus. Within all these areas are many adventures, NPCs, and locations for the party to explore, interact with and conquer. How and in what order the party chooses to take on the various challenges before them is entirely yours (the GM\u2019s) and the players\u2019 choice.\nThough given specific location names, the adventure herein could easily be modified to fit in any campaign world. As always, change, add, modify, delete and alter as necessary to meet the needs and desires of you and your gaming group.\n\nAdventure Background\nCenturies ago, a race of humans built an elaborate underground city beneath the Duskmoon Hills called Barakus. These were a magic-loving people, and for hundreds of years they dwelled peacefully in their subterranean home, delving into the arcane arts. Eventually, however, one of their number, a necromancer named Devron, rose to great power and transformed himself into a lich. The wizards of Barakus banded together, and after a great struggle, banished him to a prison far below the city. Before his banishment, however, Devron forged the helm of power, which he could use to restore his power at some future point.\n\nThough Devron was locked away in a magical prison, the wizards of Barakus knew that someday he might use his powerful magic to somehow free himself, and so they created a weapon, the sword of Kell, which a mighty warrior could use against him. Because they wanted control over who got and used the sword, it was forged such that unless empowered in a specific room in Barakus with the use of three orbs of power which were themselves powered by three \u201cflames\u201d \u2014 small geometric shapes scattered throughout the city. The idea was that the three elders of the city must agree on a champion before they offered their flame: without complete agreement, the sword was useless.\nHowever, before a suitable champion could be found to battle Devron, the lich played a risky gambit. At great expense to personal power, he summoned a stone of madness, which erupted through the floor near the gates to his prison. This magical stone had the power to drive all sentient creatures mad. This it did, and the good people of Barakus soon destroyed themselves, and the city fell into ruin.\nCenturies passed. The stone of madness\u2019 power diminished and most of the city was freed from its effects. Eventually, creatures from the Under Realms and the surrounding wilderness began moving into the city and using its many halls and chambers for their lairs.\n\nBarakus is now a massive dungeon, filled with creatures that have their own designs and desires. Many of the inhabitants over the years have altered the layout of the city slightly to fit their needs, and hundreds of years of monstrous habitation has left the city\u2019s once-great halls filled with forgotten treasures and un-sprung traps.\nOf course, Devron still dwells deep beneath the earth in his magical prison, and as is the wont with trapped liches, he would like nothing more than to escape his prison and find his helm of power, which would restore the power he lost during his captivity. While exploring the city, the party may decide to find the sword of Kell, empower it, and go after Devron. The battle between the heroes and the lich is likely to serve as a climax to this adventure.\nAdd-Ons\n$15 The Lost City of Barakus Hero Lab Files - Hero Lab files allows customers to modify, print or use our NPCs in their home campaigns, fast and easy. It also allows them to export to online formats such as D20 Pro or other virtual tabletops.\nStretch Goals\nAll stretch goals for this Kickstarter will focus on additional content.\n$20,000 Bonus Dungeon Level 4B (UNLOCKED) - \"Hall of the Shield\" (written by WDBK Kenower, Bill Webb.) This level will add a new and powerful shield that the players will find highly useful during the end game and battle against Devron. Further, after the players leave the environs of Barakus, both the shield and Sword of Kell could take them to the next stage of their adventure in the depths of Rappan Athuk or in their quest for the Sword of Air.\n$22,500 New Wilderness Encounter (UNLOCKED) -  Bill will add an additional wilderness encounter of 2000-4000 words to the book. These encounters will include: mini-dungeons, monster lairs, new monsters, and new magical items never before seen in the Lost Lands. \n$25,000 New Wilderness Encounter (UNLOCKED) -  Bill will add an additional wilderness encounter of 2000-4000 words to the book.

Most of these books will be discounted 10-50% off!!!  \n$50,000 Iconic PCs (UNLOCKED) Our existing Iconics will get an overhaul, and a few new ones will be joining the group. Use them as pre-gens, rival NPCs, or whatever you need them for!  \n$55,000 Full Color Region Map (UNLOCKED) This full color map shows a wide expanse of The Lost Lands from the Sinnar Ocean to the southern reaches of the March of Mountains and includes key locations that we've been to or heard rumor of such as Rappan Athuk and the Forest of Hope. An excellent addition to a Game Master's collection! (Add-On price of $8 each, $2 each for PDF copy)\nOur purpose in offering these stretch goals is not to make each one of you drastically raise your pledge, but instead to grow the number of gamers who are backing our project.

Thanks so much!\nABOUT THE PROJECT\n\u2022 Lusus Naturae is a horrific bestiary featuring 100 new monsters.\n\u2022 A 6\"x9\" hardcover, approximately 160 pages long; features a durable binding and high-grade paper.\n\u2022 Funding pays for artwork, printing, and shipping.\n\u2022 Uses the Lamentations of the Flame Princess system (thus, it's compatible with many other old-school role-playing games). \n\u2022 Stretch goal: full color interior artwork!\nBack it now so you can torment your players later!\nLusus Naturae (\"Freaks of Nature\") is a collection of grotesqueries that will break the bodies and hearts of your player characters. If you like horror in your old-school gaming, then you'll enjoy this bestiary.\nDownload the PDF preview!\nIt uses the Lamentations of the Flame Princess system. LotFP is a dark and violent tabletop role-playing game of horror/fantasy, and it's part of the \"Old School Renaissance\" family of games.\nEach entry In Lusus Naturae is accompanied by a black-and-white illustration by Gennifer Bone. She's executing all the artwork, because I love her style, and because she gets where I'm coming from. I enjoy things that are broken, hideous, and upsetting; she's good at illustrating these notions. We're a great team.\nThe 100 viscera-chewing monsters in this book include: \nPain-fueled Algionauts, bestowing power upon those who mutilate themselves \nThe pitiless and insectile Blight, which hungers for the agony of tormented newlyweds \nThe self-birthing Porphyrogene, eternally seeking the origin of feminine power \nVitiators, which methodically disembowel those who ignore entreaties to abandon sobriety, virginity, and abstention of all kinds \nThe thin and lonesome Wending Skirl, howling its soul-deadening grief in frozen woods\nMethodical and elegant Monstructs, which build their Citadel of Perpetuated Joys from the bodies of children\nThey derive strength from fear, they nurture hate, and they reshape human flesh. Bereft of conscience, these entities inspire torture, manipulate time, and establish new religions in lightless ocean depths.\nThey are sadists, manipulators, predators, and colossal monstrosities that are only peripherally aware of the actions of two-meter-tall mammals on an inconsequential telluric planet.\nFor the first time, I seek to draw upon the legends of my Peruvian ancestors, including:\nMachukuna, the ancient ones who saw their doom when the Sun was created, and fled to deep waters (where they wait);\nSarara, a feathered horror summoned from the darkest pits of the underworld by foolhardy sorcerers;\nChuyanchaki, shapeshifters who always forget one important detail;\nSupay, lord of death, who rules over all demons from his throne in Ukhupacha;\n... and many others!\nIn 2013, I published Teratic Tome, a bestiary for OSRIC. This monster book bulged and pulsed with heinous terrors. The critics said:\n\"I can only presume that Chandler dreamed up these monsters while smoking weed mixed with the ashes of Ed Gein, since what's here are uniformly twisted beings.\" (Shane O., DriveThruRPG.com)\n\"I felt disturbed reading parts of this and uncomfortable in others, much like a good horror fiction novel. And yet I kept flipping the virtual pages. Like an addict. There can be no higher praise.\" (Erik Tenkar, Tenkar's Tavern)\n\"Suffice to say that it comes with my highest possible recommendation.\" (Michael Gibbons, Metal Earth)\n\"If you would imagine, for a moment, if H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker collaborated on an AD&D monster manual, you would have the Teratic Tome. Honestly, I don't know if I need any more to this review than that one sentence.\" (Christopher Helton, Dorkland) \n\"Short form: holy balls is this an impressive book. If you like old school and you like freakishly scary and horrifying monsters, BUY THIS BOOK!\" (Keith J. Davies, In My Campaign)\nNow it's time to create something even nastier!\nThough I love the Tome, and all the other books that I've created, they've all been published through print-on-demand services like Lulu and CreateSpace. With this project, my intent is to create a high-quality printed book with features that aren't available via POD.\nFunding will pay for artwork and printing. If we exceed our goal:\n$16,660 : Stretch Goal  \nAll images are upgraded to color.\nSome images are upgraded to full-page.\nLayout by Jez Gordon (Scenic Dunnsmouth)\nWe're not ruling out the possibility of a second stretch goal, but we won't cross that bridge until we come to it.\n1. If things get weird or messy, I'll fix it. My first RPG (Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium) was published in 2002. There were only 100 copies made. Some got lost in the mail. I mailed replacement copies to my customers, even though it ate into the profits (international shipping is a beast, I tell you). Why? Because it matters. This is about getting game books into the hands of people who will use them while throwing dice on the table, simple as that. I took the same approach when I started publishing print-on-demand books via Lulu in 2007. People get what they pay me for.\n2. I'm keeping it simple. Not going to complicate my first Kickstarter with shirts and keychains. You can get the PDF or the print book. Incidentally, this is as cheap as either version is going to be -- if you don't back the project now, you can always pick up the book later, but it's going to cost more.\n3. Pre-orders come first. I know, you're not supposed to think of it as a pre-order, because you're all investors. Hell with that! I don't have investors. What am I, some kind of Nickelback-loving suit-and-tie office drone? This is a pre-order. Lusus Naturae won't be available to the public until every backer has received what was paid for. After the pre-orders are delivered, I'll sell the remainder of the print run to anyone who wants a copy. The book will then be sold via print-on-demand services, but minus the color artwork and glossy paper. If you pre-order now, you get a higher-quality book for a lower price.\nThanks, comrades!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSure, it's a gamble, having one person illustrate an entire book, but the end result will be a consistent art style. I think it'll be cool. Worst case scenario, Gennifer's hometown gets nuked or maybe invaded by Triffids, so I make arrangements with a different artist to finish the project. I don't think that the nukes will be a problem (not sure about the Triffids), but I believe that Gennifer will get the job done because she's a professional.\n\nShe's done work for Wicked North Games, Rite Publishing, Necromancers of the Northwest, and Lamentations of the Flame Princess. In addition, she's contributed artwork to several of my books, including Lacerations of the Slain Priestess, ViewScream, Bad Myrmidon, and Teratic Tome. She's never missed a deadline for me.\n\nI've written an entire monster book before, and most of Lusus Naturae is written already. In 2013, my output was 1,017 pages and 291,000 words, including The Starship from Hell, Teratic Tome, Pandemonio, Viewscream, SlaughterGrid, Roll XX, Bad Myrmidon, and two Lamentations of the Flame Princess adventures. That doesn't count the writing I did for my day job -- I work as a story designer and scriptwriter in the video game industry, and I've spent the past decade working on multimillion dollar projects for Sony, Ubisoft, and a dozen other companies. I have experience delivering content on a deadline, and I am hungry for this project because it's full of the kind of NC-17 material that I can't get anyone in the video game industry to greenlight. \n\nWhile this is my first Kickstarted project, I've contributed to three other crowdfunded RPGs: Jason Morningstar's Durance, Clint Krause's Don't Walk in Winter Wood, and Jim Raggi's Lamentations of the Flame Princess Referee Book. In all three cases, my contributions were delivered on time.\n\nIf the funding is a lot higher than anticipated, this will be a good thing, because it will result in a prettier book. However, it has the potential to affect the delivery date, because of the increased workload. If we hit the stretch goal and go full-color, then we'll still deliver the book in 2014, but it might be in November or December. No surprises -- you'll know well in advance if that's the case.\n\nNOTE: Lamentations of the Flame Princess is a registered trademark owned by James Edward Raggi IV, and is used with permission.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Monsters never die...", "update_content": "Dearest comrades,\nWell, it has been a strange journey: on the one hand, it was dreadful, bloody, and nightmarish; on the other, it was horrible, gruesome, and filthy.

Thanks everyone, for your support on Pairs!\nUnderstanding the Rewards: \nThis campaign is very simple. There will be no add-ons and no post-campaign shopping cart, just the pledge levels listed on the right. Aside from the various freebies, every level gives you a certain number of decks. You can adjust your pledge as long as the campaign is active, but not after.\nYou can choose any unlocked deck for each deck in your reward. You'll make your selections after the campaign is over.\nIn early April, we will send you a backer survey that asks for your mailing address, and which decks you want. There are eleven versions of Pairs, as well as one completely different game, FALLING.\nIf you don't get them here, you might not be able to find these decks anywhere else. You will certainly be able to buy Pairs decks of some kind in the Fall, but some of the decks from this campaign will be made in limited quantity. Here's a small preview of each one:\nThe core deck is the Name of the Wind deck, by Shane Tyree, followed by the Fruit deck, by James Ernest. Next are the Pirate deck by Brett Bean, and FALLING by Val Mayerik. After that, we have the Modegan deck by Shane Tyree, the Barmaids deck by Echo Chernik. and the Goblin deck by Pete Venters. \nThe next decks are two by Nate Taylor: The Princess and Mr. Whiffle (it looks like a kid's book, but it's a bit grisly), and the Faen deck from The Name of the Wind (which is slightly NSFW). You can read more about the content in the Faen deck on Pat's blog.\nNext, we have the Professor Elemental deck by Cheyenne Wright, and an adorable Baby Cthulhu deck by John Kovalic.Our top deck, unlocked at $200k, is a deck of Muses (from the Girl Genius universe) by Phil & Kaja Foglio. Please look below for details and preview links. Or check out the Pairs page at cheapass.com.\nPairs is a new pub game by James Ernest and Paul Peterson. It's a card game for 2 to 8 players, and it plays in about 5 minutes. \nThe deck is very simple: Just the numbers 1 through 10, with each card appearing in proportion to its rank. That means there is 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3, and so on, up to 10 x 10. That's 55 cards, packaged in a compact card box, and it's everything you need to play. For complete rules (the free beta version) click here.\nThe artwork for the core Pairs deck will be drawn by Shane Tyree, and based on The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss. That's the first book in his best-selling \"Kingkiller Chronicle,\" a high-fantasy series that also includes The Wise Man's Fear.\nRothfuss is a gamer, and his respect for gaming shows in the way that games like Pairs are integrated into his world. Turns out, he's also a fan of Cheapass Games! So he was happy to lend us his world for our game.\nPairs doesn't appear in those books, because we just invented it! But we decided to create a deck of cards that could easily belong in that world. And who knows, Pairs just might show up in future stories.\nWhat's in the deck? The Name of the Wind deck is not finalized, but we think it will contain: (1) Tinker; (2) Amyr; (3) Royalty (based on Pat & Sarah); (4) Courtesan; (5) Moneylender; (6) Farmer; (7) Seven Calamities; (8) Bandit; (9) Beggar; (10) Ruh. [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\nPlaying Pairs is easy. The most important rule is that points are bad. Also, there is no winner, just one loser. For example, In a 4-player game, the loser is the first player to score 16 points. The complete rules are at cheapass.com. Or, you can watch our How to Play video, right here.\nThe reward levels for this campaign are pretty simple: How many decks do you want? We have 12 different decks all together, including one completely different game (FALLING). After the campaign is over, you'll receive a survey asking you to choose one deck for each slot, and there are no restrictions on which decks you can get. \nDecks: Each Pairs game will contain 55 bridge-sized cards and a small rule book, in a compact tuck box (just like a normal deck of cards). The cards will be printed on high-quality playing card stock, by Carta Mundi USA. We are very particular about playing cards, and we will make these cards extremely nice!\nAfter this campaign is over, Pairs will go into retail stores, but some decks maybe very hard to find. We will decide which decks will be printed in large numbers, and which won't, after the survey results come in.\nCoins: Campaign Coins made a handsome 39mm metal coin for our Get Lucky campaign, and it's been so popular that we decided to make another one for Pairs. Our preliminary design is shown below, along with a photo of the Get Lucky finished coins, to show what the finish will look like. The Pairs coin is included in the backer rewards at the $40 level and above.\nCut Cards: We will include one sturdy white plastic cut card with each deck. This is similar to the cut card in the How to Play video, except that it's thicker and white. It's a handy tool for covering the bottom of the deck, which is important in Pairs since you often deal all the way down to that card. This cut card will not be part of the retail product, so it's a nice backers-only perk.\nStickers: Our original plan was to include one small round Pairs logo sticker for every backer, but we've grown this to a 2 x 3.25 sticker, perfect for decorating the cut card, and we will include one sticker with every deck. The upgraded sticker will be a Kickstarter exclusive, featuring two exclusive designs: one version for the Pat Rothfuss decks, another for everything else. [No Sample Art Yet]\nCompanion Booklet: Every deck comes with a small rule book. The companion booklet is larger, and it will be a collection of all the Pairs variants from this set, like Calamities and Pieces of Eight, and alternate games, like Blackstone and Hawthorn. It will also contain some Pairs history (both real and fictional) and artwork from the game. One copy of the booklet will be included at 5 decks or higher.\nPAX Pairs Party: Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) is a huge gaming convention held every year on Labor Day weekend in Seattle. This year\u2019s dates are August 28-31. One evening during PAX, we will find a venue in Seattle (perhaps even a pub) and throw a party to celebrate the release of Pairs. (You do not need a PAX badge to come to this party.) We\u2019ll have Patrick Rothfuss, Shane Tyree, James Ernest, Paul Peterson, and other special guests TBD. Backers at the $1200 level will receive 2 tickets to the PAX Prime Pairs Pub Party (that\u2019s P5 for short), as well as everything from the $120 level. More details will follow after the campaign, once we know how many guests we have.\nCheapass Games is a tiny game company in Seattle, run by designer James Ernest. We specialize in low-cost games that are funny and fast. Many of our games, including Pairs, are available in free print-and-play versions at cheapass.com.\nSo far, we've had three successful projects on Kickstarter: Unexploded Cow, Deadwood Studios USA, and Get Lucky. We're learning a little more with each one, and we can't wait to bring you another one as soon as Pairs is off to press!\n$20k Unlocked! Shane Tyree will do some extra art for the Name of the Wind deck, putting seven different pictures on the 7's. These pictures are various \"Calamities\" like floods, fires, plagues, and so on, exact list TBD. And, we'll include a variant rule in the deck, that makes the 7's behave in an appropriately calamitous fashion.\n$25k: Fruit Deck. Our second deck is the Fruit Deck, which is the deck from the videos. This deck has yummy artwork of fruits and vegetables (Pears, Peaches, Cherries, Blueberries, Grapes, Pumpkins, Mushrooms, Lemons, Peppers, and Onions). [Sample Art]\n$30k: Cut Cards. Backers will receive one plain white plastic cut card with each deck. These cards are simply for covering the bottom of the deck, as illustrated in the How to Play video. We will not include this card in the retail version, so it's a nice backers-only freebie.\n$35k: Starbase Jeff. Once this campaign is over and the smoke has cleared, we'll add a full-color version of Starbase Jeff as a print-and-play game at cheapass.com. Starbase Jeff is a gambling / puzzle game about building a space station, designed by Jim Geldmacher. \n$40k: Pirates. Avast! Brett Bean's magnificent Pirate deck has now been added to our collection. This is a third complete Pairs deck, containing a special variant rule: \"Pieces of Eight.\" [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\n$50k Juggling Video: The Edema Ruh card in the core deck features a portrait of James Ernest in his renfair garb. This image is based on a video of James juggling at the Washington Midsummer Renaissance Faire. Now that we've passed the $50k level, we've posted the video of this unmemorable performance for your mocking pleasure.\n$55k FALLING: This is not a Pairs deck; it's another entire game, with exactly the same size deck. FALLING is a real-time card game, a frenzied 90-second game about falling and fighting, where the object is to hit the ground last. We will print a new edition of this game, with all-new art by Val Mayerik. [Sample Art] [More Sample Art] [More about FALLING]. You can read more about FALLING in Update #11.\n$65k: Modegan Deck. This is the second Patrick Rothfuss / Shane Tyree Pairs deck. The Modegans are a distant and isolated culture, and their Pairs deck will look quite different from the first. In addition, the Modegan deck will contain the rules for an entirely different game, called Blackstone. (Rules in Update 6.) [Sample Art]\n$75k: Rules for Tak. Tak is an abstract strategy game featured prominently in The Wise Man\u2019s Fear. It has aspects of chess, go, and other traditional strategy games, but it\u2019s entirely new. James Ernest and Pat Rothfuss will take a crack at writing it, although we might or might not get it right. If we get somewhere, we will give you, our faithful Pairs backers, access to the closed beta test. Wahoo!\n$85k: Echo Chernik\u2019s Barmaids. Echo Chernik is one of the most talented illustrators working today, and she will draw a set of ten barmaids for this very special edition of Pairs. Each barmaid is carrying the appropriate number of drinks. (Note: These samples don't have numbers yet, but the final cards will) [Sample Art] [More Sample Art] \n$100k: Pete Venters' Goblins. We asked celebrated Magic artist and goblin specialist Pete Venters if he'd like to make a Goblin Pairs deck. Instead of just 10 fantasy goblins, he has decided to give us a \"Goblins Through the Ages\" theme, with everything from Cave Goblins to Goblins in Space. And now we've unlocked this deck too! [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\n$105k: Bookplates. We will include one bookplate, autographed by Pat Rothfuss, for backers at the $80 level and above. This will be an archival quality, self-adhesive, cream colored 3\" x 4\" bookplate. It will have artwork by Shane Tyree, and will be signed by Patrick Rothfuss. [Sample Art]\n$110k: Rothfuss Laughing Ringtone. For all you Patrick Rothfuss fans, what is more charming than his self-deprecating laugh from 3:15 in the project video? We\u2019ll create two ringtones from this sound bite: one that\u2019s just the laugh, and the other with Pat muttering \u201cGod Damn\u201d at the end, which didn't make the final cut. Chose your favorite, or grab them both!\n$115k: Princess and Mr. Whiffle Deck. The Princess and Mr Whiffle is a very dark little story by Patrick Rothfuss, masquerading as a children\u2019s book, and the characters are perfect for a Pairs deck! If you\u2019re keeping track, this is the third of four Patrick Rothfuss-related decks. This deck will be lovingly illustrated by Nate Taylor. [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\n$120k Rothfuss Outtake Video: If the ringtones aren't enough for you, check this out. We\u2019re going to cut together the highlights of Pat\u2019s raw Kickstarter video footage for your viewing pleasure. He took a few stabs at getting it right, and he\u2019s been gracious enough to let us show you all the ways he got it wrong.\n$125k: Stickers Upgrade. Originally, we offered a small round logo sticker as part of every reward level. Now, the sticker is growing to 2 x 3.25 rectangle, just the right size for the cut cards. Also, we\u2019re giving you a sticker with every deck. The sticker that comes with the Pat Rothfuss decks will feature Shane Tyree artwork from the Name of the Wind deck. All other decks (including FALLING) will come with a Cheapass Games / Pairs logo sticker. Both stickers will be Kickstarter-exclusive designs. Hooray for freebies!\n$130k: Faen Deck. This is another Patrick Rothfuss deck, the fourth in the set (and the third from the Name of the Wind series). The Faen deck will be illustrated by Nate Taylor, and contains images of ten Faerie characters, including Bast (sketch below). We\u2019ll release more sketches from this deck as we get them, including a very sexy Felurian (meaning PG-13). This deck will also have a great new gambling variant, Hawthorn, which is explained in Update #12. [Sample Art]\n$140k: Veronica Belmont Cameo. Veronica Belmont, host of Sword & Laser, has agreed to go cavorting with the Fae! We will include Veronica as one of the Mortal Guests in the Faen Deck. Will she be dancing, making music, or getting hit on by Bast? We're not entirely sure, but we know it will be glorious.\n$150k: Hank Green Cameo. Award-winning YouTuber and internet entrepreneur Hank Green wants to be seduced by Faerie women. At least, on a card. And he's fine with showing a little skin. In fact, he demands it. We're putting Hank on a card in the Faen Deck,  as a mortal guest at a Faerie revel. *sizzle*\n$155k: Professor Elemental Deck. Artist Cheyenne Wright will bring Professor Elemental and his many minions to life in this exquisite Pairs deck. Cheyenne has worked with Cheapass Games for many years, illustrating games like Unexploded Cow, Freeloader, and James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game. He is also the colorist for the Girl Genius web comic. Professor Elemental is a \"Steampunk flavoured mad Professor\" whose amazing work you can check out right here. [Sample Art]\n$170k: Baby Cthulhu Deck. John Kovalic is best known as the creator of the comic strip Dork Tower, but he's also done some work with Cheapass Games. This Pairs deck from John Kovalic is based on his favorite theme, tiny little baby Cthulhu monsters. We're calling it the \"Shallow Ones\" deck. [Sample Art]\n$200k: Foglio Muses Deck. Are you keeping count? This is number twelve. That's as many different decks as we can reasonably print, and we've saved the best for last. Phil and Kaja Foglio are frequent collaborators with Cheapass Games, but they are best known as the creators of the Girl Genius web comic. For the Pairs deck, Phil and Kaja will draw a set of ten Muses, who are ancient and powerful clanks (sort of like robots) from the world of Girl Genius. [Sample Art]\n$250k: Companion Book. Each Pairs deck already comes with the basic rules, and many of them will contain a unique variant as well. Now we can also produce a separate, pocket-sized collection of all the rules and variants, as well as some artwork and information about the history of Pairs (both real and fictional). We will include one copy of this companion booklet for backers at the 5 deck level and above. It will also be available in the Fall (price TBD), and the contents will be free online.\n$300k: Laughing Video. Can we make it this time? This was a popular stretch goal from our last campaign, though we didn't quite make it that time. If we reach $300k, James Ernest will post a video of himself laughing all the way to the bank.\nWhat's Next?\nIf you want to be a part of the final hours of this campaign, James Ernest (@cheapassjames) will be tweeting from the end-party in Las Vegas. We have reservations for 7:30 Friday at an undisclosed steak house. If we reach $299k, James gets lobster.\nSometime in early April, we will send you a survey asking which decks you want, as well as your shipping address. We should be able to show you all the art, or at least a decent cross-section, and we'll know a little more about which special rules go into which decks. Your choices will help us decide how many of each deck to print. So please answer your survey promptly!\nThanks again for your overwhelming support, and special thanks to all the artists and contributors who helped make Pairs happen!

This edition includes additional components, which enhances game play.\nThe game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over.\nEach village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics. Each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.\nEach village is part of both a Fief and a Bishopric.\nFiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs.\nEach player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.  \nIn 'Fief - France 1429', a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1VP and more power to the family! \nOther members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (in this case 'YOUR') fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1VP and special privileges to your family!\nYou win the game as soon as you have 3VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is 'mysteriously' murdered or dies of some other foul means! \nIn addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include \u2018Good Harvest\u2019, \u2018Good Weather\u2019 and \u2018Added Taxes\u2019 cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include 'The Plague', 'Heavy Rain', 'Famine', and 'Peasant Uprisings'! \nIncome can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent\u2019s villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.\nPlayers will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines.  \nIf you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner.\nIf two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll.\nEach 'f' rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle. \nFief is a highly interactive game of diplomacy, alliances, open chivalry and dastardly deceit! Perfect for 3 to 6 'friends' to spend a fun evening together.

This new fictional world focuses on air- and space-faring ships. In Stranger Skies is the title for the skyship's first story, which introduces the vessel and her journey in the skies of Calidar. The crew\u2019s mission is one of exploration fraught with mystery and danger. The fantasy setting section gives an overview of the Calidar Universe and its central world, Calidar, with a focus on the Kingdom of Meryath, the future home of the Star Phoenix.\nWorld of Calidar is intended as the first in a series of releases, each describing a new adventure for the Star Phoenix and providing an expansion to the campaign setting. This unusual format is inspired from the stories I wrote for Dragon Magazine, Voyages of the Princess Ark, and of course vastly expanded here. These were very popular in the 80s and 90s while I worked at TSR, and a major selling point for the magazine. Although written with role-playing games in mind, contents are non game-specific, therefore easily adaptable to most RPG systems.  \nThe product includes a 100-pg color book, which provides the skyship's story and the fantasy setting, plus a poster map depicting the Great Caldera, the center of known civilization on Calidar itself. There are several separate versions of the book available: a PDF file, an e-book intended for Amazon Kindle, a softcover book, and a hardcover book. Printed books will be distributed through DriveThruRPG. The poster map is produced and sold separately from the book due to limitations with print-on-demand. Stretch goals may lead to the addition of different poster maps to the project as well as extra written materials and a greater amount of internal art in the book.\nKingdom of Meryath's central island\n Before proceeding further, let's introduce the creative talent behind this project. I\u2019ll be spearheading the effort as the main writer. I am best known as the lead creative for the D&D Mystara campaign world and as its product manager.  I wrote several D&D Gazetteers and adventure modules as well as the Voyages of the Princess Ark.  Instrumental in capturing the physical appearance of Calidar, Thorfinn Tait, from Akita, Japan, stepped forward months ago to handle the world's cartography. Thorfinn is best known for his work on Mystara maps during the past twenty years. From the onset, he and I worked to fit Calidar\u2019s continents around a globe, ensuring an accurate and very recognizable depiction. Ben Wootten, a concept artist and illustrator from Wellington, New Zealand, will paint the cover art. His portfolio includes design work for the Lord of Rings movies as well as art for Wizards of the Coast and Pathfinder among many others. His incredible appreciation for nature is evident in the creatures he draws, both real and imagined.  John Dollar  will be producing pencil and ink illustrations. His extensive artistic background includes TSR's Ravenloft, Birthright, and Dark Sun, as well as FASA, White Wolf, and West End. He also worked on Shadowhunters Codex by Simon & Schuster, Earthdawn, Star Wars, Tales of the Emerald Serpent, and Larry Elmore's Sovereign Stone. Last but not least, my good friend from Toronto, Canada, Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms and author of many related novels as well as a Mystara Gazetteer, has also kindly offered his time and talent to design the City of Glorathon, the royal capital of the Kingdom of Meryath.\nCalidar's Center of Civilization\n Most Calidarans came from three lunar empires\u2014the humans from Manaan, the elves from Alorea, and the dwarves as well as their gnomish cousins from Kragd\u00fbr. The fellfolk, a race of small but fierce people, are the planet's original inhabitants. Calidar is imbued with a feral magic hostile to the expansion of civilization, a dangerous world only partially settled by the three off-world empires. A central region called the Great Caldera, a three-thousand-mile-large crater partially filled with an inner sea and ringed with towering mountains, serves as the cradle of civilization. There, the empires overcame nature\u2019s ferocity and established sprawling colonies. But over time, they rebelled and, after a long period of conflict known as the Sky Wars, the new realms earned their independence from their lunar masters. A fragile truce now remains between the three empires and their former colonies. Beyond the Great Caldera lies what is known as the Dread Lands.\nThe truth is that two lunar empires are overpopulated and exceeding their natural resources. The other, more attuned to nature, now stagnates, unwilling to further harm its own world. It was the reason for the rush to establish colonies on Calidar. There was, and still is, another reason. Traveling the immense distances between Calidar and its moons, and reaching other worlds gravitating around the Great Soltan is only possible with a certain type of magic. At the heart of imperial rivalries lies a strange substance called Seitha, which enables skyships to become incorporeal and travel at fantastic speeds. Though it can be found on the moons, the existence of the precious Seitha has been declining there since its discovery. The Dread Lands now remain its principal source and the origin of many conflicts to obtain it.\nThe appearance of the substance in Calidar\u2019s soil is predicated upon the health of that world and its moons. It is believed that all magic comes from the beating heart of Calidar, tying together not only Seitha but the souls of the dead and the very lifeforce of all that dwells on its surface, in the skies, and beyond\u2014be it flora, fauna, or sentient kind. It is strong enough to enable gods to spring from the inhabitants\u2019 spiritual beliefs. Indeed, Calidar is unique in that the divine did not create this universe and its people. It is quite the opposite. On each world  gods, demi-gods, epic heroes, and demons compete to retain the favors of mortals who created them, and to sway the minds of others for the sake of eternal hegemony. . . or oblivion.\nAirships of Calidar are as varied as its people, whether spacefaring or not. Let\u2019s start from the ground up, with the dwarves of Kragd\u00fbr. These fellows aren\u2019t wizards, yet they build flying ships. Theirs are brutes of steel, fire, and brimstone. In keeping with their own love of things from the ground, dwarves fly powerful dreadnoughts whose hulls and superstructures are made of forged iron, steel, brass, and copper held together with rivets. Cannons are their weapons of choice. They use coal and special minerals found on their moon, providing lift and thrust enough to propel their massive beasts. Kragd\u00fbr dwarves favor a harsh warrior-like culture.\nElven designs depart radically from the dwarven paradigm. Alorean vessels look more like sail ships from the Golden Age of Clippers. These are wind-powered, quad-masted, wooden vessels built for speed. Their style and workmanship remain unmistakably elven, with a heavy emphasis on organic rather than functional. Up close, their artful designs are reminiscent of twisting roots and leaf patterns. Unlike vessels of other races, Alorean liners house extensive hydroponic facilities within their hulls. Alive, self-healing, and able to grow parts like davits, boarding planks, hammocks, and tether-roots, they also feature deck weaponry in the form of native Alorean plants living in symbiosis with the ships. These elves behave more like artful intellectuals.\nHuman-built skyships of Manaan are far more varied than elven or dwarven designs. They stand anywhere between the two extremes of demi-human ships, blending metal and wood in various proportions. Manaani commanders generally favor maneuverability over speed or strength, which implies a preference for galley designs. Style-wise, they depend on the region of origin, somewhat like real-world 16th-century galleasses and 17th-century galleons that can be fitted with auxiliary oars. This implies an inverted tri-mast design (two sets of upper masts angled in a V-shape and one set of vertical masts underneath the hull) to allow clearance for the banks of oars. They usually rely on combinations of magic and mechanical devices as main deck weapons. The Manaani are highly religious people, for better or for worse.\nAnd what of native Calidar vessels, you might wonder? These ships are even more unpredictable as they mix and match designs from either of the three moons, making foreign observers cringe at certain very, very odd concepts. This habit goes back to the time when colonies broke away from their outer world overseers, and had to use whatever they could seize in combat or recover from wrecks. Anything goes, merrily blending dirigibles, wind sails, steam-powered paddle-wheels, mixed-dwarven and -elven medieval wood-and-steel bio-mechanics, ethereal ley line nets, four-winged flying beasts, and so on. There\u2019s more. . . how about the scaly, acid-spewing, glistening vessels of the evil Draconic Knights? Giant flying junks and armored turtle-ships claim the skies in faraway Lao-Kwei. At last, let\u2019s not forget the space Vikings with double- or triple-deck longships feared by all, including the mysterious starfolk.\nDread Lands, courtesy of Ben Wootten\nIt is the tale of the skyship\u2019s arrival in this strange new world.  Though the crew cannot recall the preceding days, they do seem to know each other and their functions aboard.  The rest remains a disturbingly frustrating blank.  It soon becomes clear that something or someone tampered with their memories for a purpose the crew will have to discover.  Overcoming personal doubts and suspicions, these heroes of fortune must work together to survive, unveil the truth about their presence in a foreign world and, one day perhaps, find a way back home.  Until then, the heroes must explore a world brimming with magic and mystery.  On Calidar, eternal glory is the ultimate achievement, leading those who prevail to tangle with webs of intrigue spun around them by empires and deities.\nCaptain d'Alberran: A swashbuckling wizard, his challenge is to come to grips with the mysterious power that erased all memory of his past and brought him to this strange new world. He sees this as a personal challenge and intends on addressing the issue head on, no matter what the cost. He senses that he and his crew were led into Calidar for some specific reason, and behaves accordingly, as someone who refuses to be manipulated. Like Captain Ahab, he fears neither cosmic beast nor god and dares to challenge their will. \nFirst Mate Ennia Daggart: She could be described as an Afro-Celtic warrior, with a few tattoos reminiscent of ancient Celts or Maori on her forehead and temples. This tough character actually runs most of the activities on the ship. There's some rivalry here with the captain. To begin with, the crew knows that they came from different realities (though none can remember which), and that they were gathered on the Star Phoenix for some mysterious purpose. This leads several crew members to question authority aboard. With a skipper (and a First Mate) who do not tolerate insubordination, you get the picture.\nMaster Arabesque Starward: As the elven navigator/cartographer/priestess/surgeon aboard, she's a most valuable character on the Star Phoenix. She and the captain discovered mutual feelings for each other, but question whether these are genuine or \"implanted\" by whatever power that brought them together into this mysterious universe. The captain fights pretty hard to ignore his own feelings for Arabesque, because of his function aboard. He fears they would jeopardize his ability to command. Arabesque, grappling with her sudden inability to communicate with her spiritual patron, also has her own internal conflict. \nCaptain-at-Arms, Wu Yuntai: He's a Chinese-style elven warrior who commands the ship's marines. Yuntai is very loyal to his captain, though he does not remember why. Although not yet apparent, he may develop feelings for the First Mate. Early on, he's nearly killed in combat and makes it a personal quest to best he who almost defeated him--the commander of the Draconic Knights, Captain d'Alberran's nemesis.\n\nOther characters include Purser Waessail Barrooney (actually a roguish fellfolk and somewhat of a coward), Rivven Cripplegate (a red-head bosun with a short fuse), Master-Artificer Ebben Philoneas Rugwittle (a spell-casting gnome in charge of the ship's magical engineering), Master-of-Engines Hoyk Pebbleborn (a blunderbuss-toting dwarven artillerist who has every intention of acquiring dwarven cannons for the Star Phoenix), Bugles \u201cOl\u2019 Babblejack\u201d Belzer (the helmsman, a salty old seadog), and--last but not least--Gumboyle Moffeecot, the fellfolk cook (part head-hunter and voodoo priestess, with a wooden leg, a killer frying pan, a homunculus familiar, and a crush on the Captain-at-Arms).\n\"Dragon's Fury\" courtesy of Ben Wootten\nAdd-ons are offered only at First Mate pledge level and above.

Please consult the mailing schedule listed at the end of the main project's description, which details additional postage fees outside the USA.\nYour Character Name: One of the characters appearing in the story bears the name of your RPG character;  a short description will be needed; suggested names are subject to publisher's approval; backers warrant that suggested names do not violate existing copyrights; backers agree that suggested names become publisher's property upon approval. There are no more than twenty slots for this add on, allocated on a first-come/first-served basis.\nName a Skyship: You get to name a skyship appearing either in the story or in the world supplement (at the publisher's discretion); suggested names are subject to publisher's approval; backers warrant that suggested names do not violate existing copyrights; backers agree that suggested names become publisher's property upon approval. There are no more than twenty slots for this add on, allocated on a first-come/first-served basis.\nAdditional Poster Maps: You can order additional copies of the poster map, at $8.50 each.  Shipping in the US and Canada is included with your original pledge for up to three additional poster maps.\n$8,100: Internal Art Upgrade ----------------- UNLOCKED!\nPresent art budget allows for about a dozen black-and-white illustrations in the book, in addition to maps and other diagrams.  This extension allows a substantial increase in the amount of internal art and/or the upgrade of some b/w pieces to color.\n\n$10,000: Map Upgrade -------------------------- UNLOCKED!\nPresent cartography budget allows for one poster map (the Great Caldera).  This extension adds an extra poster depicting the Kingdom of Meryath, with a standard hexgrid format.  If available, this extra poster map can be selected as an add-on with your original pledge at First Mate level and above.\n\n$12,000: Campaign Setting Upgrade ---- UNLOCKED!                                                                            + Pathfinder Guidelines\nAt present, the project allows for approx. 100 pages in the book.  With this extension, page count increases to approx. 125.  Additional text will detail in more depth the Kingdom of Meryath,  as well as provide a set of guidelines to help adapt the Calidar setting to Pathfinder game mechanics. Details are still being worked out, but Thomas Reid, former TSR designer and editor, will be the author of the guidelines.\n$15,500: Skyship Profiles ------------------- UNLOCKED!\nFive full-page color ship profiles by Ben Wootten will be included in the book, with performance statistics and text descriptions. They will include the Star Phoenix, Eternal Glory, Wind Thorn, Scion of Kragd\u00fbr, and Queen\u2019s Fury.\n$18,000: Skyship Deck Plans ------------- UNLOCKED!\nAt this level, a blend of 2D and 3D black-and-white deck plans are a possibility.  This is a tentative stretch goal as details are still being worked out.  At the very least three skyships will receive the treatment, including, of course, the Star Phoenix.  These will be part of the book along with the color plates.  Announcements will be forthcoming with relevant backing.  Many thanks to all of you for making this project a reality!\nInternational Shipping Schedule: Your pledges include the cost of shipping within the USA.  Postage outside the USA is major concern since a large proportion of Bruce Heard\u2019s fans reside overseas.  It would be easy but unfair to add a single additional postage fee to everyone, causing many to pay more than they should.  Mailing books separately from poster maps also has an impact on shipping.  As a result, a more detailed mailing schedule is posted here for each pledge level.  Please add the postage fees listed below to your pledges.  Asia/Pacific includes Australia and New Zealand.  Puerto Rico is counted as US domestic mail.\n****Master Pledge Level****\nCanada -- add $3.00\nUK -- add $2.00\nEurope (excluding UK) -- add $4.00\nAsia/Pacific, Central America/Caribbean Islands -- add $8.00\nAnywhere else: please contact B.

Concept work for the campaign setting has also been completed. My writing experience should be self-evident. Two editors are presently available. Our team feels confident in its ability to deliver a good product from both design and writing standpoints.\n\nArt, Maps, and Layout:\nArtists and a professional layout designer have already been selected. Because there are multiple contributors, delays are always possible, but the risk should be manageable. Everyone involved has a good professional track record and is more than competent in their fields. \n\nPrinting and Shipping:\nThis concerns essentially the production of printed books. They are to be distributed and sold subsequently through DriveThruRPG, which is a print-on-demand operation. Therefore printing issues can be easily addressed before and during production. Books are shipped directly to the customer by DriveThruRPG. Beyond the scope of the Kickstarter campaign, poster maps will be sold directly through Amazon.com. Both companies offer reliable services.\n\nJust like all of you, we are fans of the product we are designing and we stand behind it.

This campaign has been continuously running since 1977. Many of the adventures published by Necromancer Games and Frog God Games are directly inspired by this campaign. They have evolved over the decades, and more material continues to flow from it as the dice keep rolling. \nSages and wizards of legend speak of the Lost Lands\u2014many of the players who have lived and died in Bill's campaign over the years now have a place in history (in the books).\nFrac Cher the dwarf, Flail the Great, Bannor the Paladin, Speigle the Mage, and Helman the Halfling are well known to the fans of Bill's work. This is the game world, and these are the adventures in which the players of these famous characters lived and died. Hundreds of players over the past 35 years have experienced the thrills and terrors of this world. The Sword of Air is the centerpiece of the Lost Lands.\nFor a more in depth explanation of The Lost Lands and The Sword of Air please see this PDF Download: What is The Sword of Air? (2mb)\nSCROLL DOWN FOR AN EXPLANATION OF ALL THE PLEDGE LEVELS\nCurrently, this epic tome (estimated page count 500+) consists of several parts:\n1. The Hel\u2019s Temple Dungeon\u2014kind of like Tomb of Horrors on crack. This six-level, trap-and-puzzle infested dungeon formed the basis of Bill's game through his high school and college years. Clark Peterson\u2019s very own Bannor the Paladin spent several real life months in the place, and, sadly, finished the objective. This is where the fragments of the fabled Sword of Air can be found\u2026perhaps.\n2. The Wilderness of the Lost Lands extending to the humanoid-infested Deepfells Mountains and providing detail about the nearby Wizard\u2019s Wall. This so-called \u201cwall\u201d was raised by the archmages Margon and Alycthron harnessing the Spirit of the Stoneheart Mountains to raise the land itself, creating a massive escarpment to block invaders from the Haunted Steppes. These archmages are actual player characters from the early 1980s who live on in the legends of the Lost Lands. Over 70 unique encounter areas are detailed, and each one is a mini-adventure in itself. New wilderness areas may be added based on bonus goals described below!\n3. The Ruined City of Tsen. Legend has it the city was destroyed by a falling meteor. This place forms an aboveground dungeon area the size of a city, with over 100 detailed encounter areas. It\u2019s a very dark place\u2026even at noon.\n4. The Wizard\u2019s Feud\u2014This campaign-style adventure pits the players in a long-running series of intrigues and battles between two archmages. Which side will they take? Their actions all play into the overall quest, and could well determine which side wins. Law and Chaos are not always what they seem, and if the wrong decisions are made, the entire ordeal could fail. Remember, one of the wizards WANTS Tsathogga to win.\n5. New monsters, new demons, new spells, and new rules for various aspects of play.\n6. [Bonus level\u2014see bonus goals below] The Tower of Bells. This dungeon is the result of the workshop Bill ran at PaizoCon 2013, where the participants assisted him in building an old-school dungeon. Visit the tower and discover the secrets of the \u201cartist\u201d within. Beware: those entering may never come out!\n7. Character-killing Session (Bonus Module! See below). This adventure is a sequel to Wizard\u2019s Feud, and was first survived by a party in Dallas this June. This is what happens to the players should they choose the wrong side in the war between the wizards; a sort of \u201csecond chance\u201d should they fail. The adventure itself harkens back to 1980 or so\u2014even so, no one ever lived through it until recently.\n8. [Bonus Map\u2014see bonus goals below] A fold out map of the entire Lost Lands\n9. Bill Webb\u2019s Book of Dirty Tricks. This utility will allow Bill to share some of his infamous secrets of play in the Lost Lands. It contains many nasty adventure hooks, fake leads and other tricks that a Judge can spring on his players; and it\u2019s keyed with some links to this adventure.\nThe bonus module titled Character Killing Session will be added to the book; estimated page count 32 pages. This book will only be available with this Kickstarter at certain pledge levels. Bill Webb\u2019s Book of Dirty Tricks will be available later for purchase.\nFunding Level Required $75,000\nBonus Goals\n$85,000\u2014 The Tower of Bells will be added to the book; estimated page count 36 pages\n$100,000\u2014 The main book will be printed in color instead of black and white\n$120,000\u2014 The bonus map featuring the Lost Lands Setting will be added to the book\n$121,000+\u2014 One additional wilderness encounter area will be added to the book (approximately 0.5-2 pages each) for each $2,000 over the target amount ($121,000), to a maximum of 100 areas total!\n$130,000\u2014  Fat Dragon Games will provide a pdf 28mm miniature-scale 3D modular dungeon building set that can be used to recreate Hel\u2019s Temple Dungeon (or any other dungeon layout) for all contributors!\n$140,000\u2014 Herolab files will be available for purchase ($17.99)\n$150,000\u2014 Bill will write a Players Guide (estimated page count 48-60 pages) and we will include it as a pdf for $5 for all pledge levels.\n$170,000\u2014 We will print the Players Guide as a softcover book and make it available as an add-on for $10 per copy\u2014with a retail price of $20 after the Kickstarter. All pledge levels over $100 can order this for no extra postage.\nCollector Editions\nSIGNIFICANT deluxe editions will be available for you collectors.\nTwo are available; one embossed leather, and one that the printer is referring to as the \u201cnuclear edition.\"\nThe cover art will be included on the endpapers in both deluxe editions. There will be a strict limit of 40 of each leather book, and the number ordered of each nuclear edition book for each version (Swords & Wizardry and Pathfinder Role Playing Game).\nThe \"Nuclear Edition\" will have a Metal X steel coated (1mm thick) cover, with a metal clasps, and will come nestled inside a wood, velvet lined box. A truly unique item for those collectors out there. Oh yeah, the nuclear edition comes with a VELLUM map\u2014not paper.

Back then, the games often came in a beautifully covered box set. The mysteries contained within were everything we needed to play in a world of fantastical creatures and powerful warriors.\nThe Spanish game \"Aventuras en La Marca del Este\" began from the mind of Pedro Gil as a homebrew campaign for some friends in Spain playing the world's most famous game as devised in Frank Mentzer\u2019s (BECMI) Red Box with 9 starter classes and new rules on mounted combat, aerial combat, seafaring and ship battles.  Now, many years later, it is one of the most popular role-playing games in Spain. By enlisting incredible artists that are now rising stars in the RPG industry such as A.J. Manzanedo, Jorge Carrero and V\u00edctor Guerra, the \"La Marca\" team produced an incredibly captivating \"retroclone\" role-playing game that is an old school experience wrapped in old world flare. The game is published in Spain by Holocubierta Ediciones.\nTo see more of what this product line already contains in the Spanish game, please check out the original blog, Aventuras en La Marca del Este (en Espa\u00f1ol), and the community driven Codex de La Marca (en Espa\u00f1ol).\nThe Codex of the East Mark serves as an online structured setting that consists of both official content and fan based content. Since community has played a huge role in the creation of this RPG it makes sense to continue growing the setting by including community content. If there is significant response to this project, it is highly likely that an English version of the Codex will be built.\nArea map of the East Mark, prior to translation from original Spanish\nThe medieval world of Adventures in the East Mark is a place where magic and the extraordinary are present, albeit, not in evident way to the majority of its inhabitants. In reality only the most gifted, the brave and intelligent and determined adventurers come face to face with this reality while common mortals simply try to survive, put a roof over their heads, work and sustain a family. Adventures in the East Mark is faithful to the canons that define the swords & sorcery genre, given the technological and social components of the civilization described, and the supernatural elements permeating the whole, are only perceivable to a small minority of its inhabitants (the adventurers). It is also true that there are elements of high fantasy in the setting. We could say that Adventures in the East Mark stands at the crossroads of classic swords & sorcery and high fantasy. \nThe Setting World Map, available in the Blue Box\nValion is the most important continent in our world. It is home to some of the most representative countries of the setting. Nations such as Esmeril (the Kingdom of Elves), and the Forest Kingdom ( where the East Mark is located that constitutes the eastern frontier of this old and proud human kingdom), Ungoloz and Visirtan. There are two other important landmasses, Cirinea and the Lost Continent or Ziyarid in Dormunder language. The vast oceans that occupy almost two thirds of the world, with hundreds of small scattered islands from the Meridion Ocean, to the south, until the Coral Sea, to the east, where the sailors of Kang are the lords of the waves and the hills. Prominent are the Pirate Islands, in the Sea of the Dragon, home of buccaneers, filibusters and delinquents that look for a place that is far away from the cruel and implacable arm of justice. \nUPDATE: Now this project includes an exclusive add-on the Blue Book, a full 248 pages of an immersive setting. Read on to see what this means and how this Kickstarter is bringing both a complete set of rules and a complete setting to start playing upon funding!\n  Now Pedro Gil, the lead creator of the game, has given his blessing for us to bring this game to the U.S. for the first time ever. We have gotten Tony Reyes, second lead designer and contributing author on the Secret Fire project, to translate the first box set, The Red Box, into English for the first time. Tony has been working hard to maintain the old world voice that was a well-loved characteristic of the original game and he is already over 70% complete in his translation. Also on our team is John Adamus, editor-at-large and \"The Writer Next Door\", who has previously worked on Fate Core, Marvel Heroic Roleplaying and Becoming.\nThe Red Box includes everything you need to play the game and so much more: \nThe approximately 120 page perfect bound rule book with full color cover and B&W Interior (Collectors edition includes full color interior). In this book, you will find the complete game (Compatible under the Open Gaming License with the Basic Edition of the world\u2019s most popular fantasy role playing game); a bestiary; an introduction to the fantastic East Mark setting; and two adventures to get you started. (8.3\" x 10.3\")\nA card stock GM\u2019s screen\nA set of opaque crimson red Game Science Dice (un-inked) & white crayon\nA pencil with the Adventures in the East Mark logo\nAll encased in a full color box that is sure to stand out on your shelves (11.5\" x 11.5\" x 1.6\")\nSee some examples of the nine classes included.\nRed box\u2019s classes.

Frank Mentzer himself, the man behind the Red Box (that sold millions of boxes in 11 different languages all over the world), has offered to write a new introduction for the English edition of the Red Book.\nHuge Add-on: BETA access to the Blue Box Campaign Setting Guide PDF\nCover and sample pages of the 248-page Blue Book (originally in B/W). Click for HI-RES.\nThe Campaign Setting Guide, the book in the Blue Box set that we revealed in Update #15 that we are adding BETA access to, is filled with loads of stuff that make up the setting for Adventures in the East Mark.\nThe East Mark is actually a tiny portion of a huge world. Three continents, Valion, Cirinea and Ziyarid, dubbed \"The Lost Continent\", are thoroughly explained, including main realms, tribes and cities. The blue book includes both inspirational and crunchy material and it includes two heavy-setting adventures to get you started.\nIt is by all means the perfect companion to the Red Box. If you want to know more about this superb add-on, check Update #15.\nThe Moor by Pedro Gil \nThe exclusive adventure is centered around two \u201csimple\u201d errands ran by the adventurers for the Burgomaster in Robleda. These errands will take them to the swamps, where they will come face to face with an ancient witch, up to a village in the midst of a battle. In the style of all the classic modules, the adventurers will be able to explore the swamps, the forest and the mysterious mounds filled with ancient secrets.\nOur plan is for this to be just the first product in the launch of the entire product line here. Future sets will include: the Blue Box, concentrating on the campaign setting; the Green Box, containing the advanced rules and even more character choices; and the just about to be released Black Box, containing the culmination of the overall campaign known as \u201cThe Call of the Gods\u201d. With successful translations of those products, we may open the gates to even more products to further fill in the world for you to explore.\nSee Artwork from our future Product Line\nAvailable for Villager & Farmer Levels:\nKickstarter Exclusive Adventure \"The Moor\" by Pedro Gil in PDF - $5 (for digital only levels; already free with physical product sets)\nBrand New Adventure \"Crawlers from the Outside or Where the Non-Euclidean Things Are\" [working title] by Tony Reyes in PDF - $5 (for digital only levels; already free with physical product sets)  \nAvailable for Villager, Farmer, Aristocrat & Noble Levels:\nBETA access to the Blue Box Campaign Setting Guide PDF - $20 for Villager & Farmer levels; $15 for Aristocrat levels; $10 for Noble levels \nThe East Mark Campaign Setting Guide is a complete 248-page guide to the world for you to build your adventure in. \nAvailable for Aristocrat, Noble, Merchant & Grand Merchant Levels:\nAdditional Copy of Red Box (B&W interior) - $40 (+$20 International shipping) \nPremium Q-Workshop East Mark Dice - $25 (with physical product sets only)\nMock-up of East Mark seven dice set, by Q-Workshop\nFor the first time ever produced, we are offering premium East Mark seven dice set designed by Q-Workshop.

Details here...\nPrevious Challenge: If the KickStarter exceeds $130k, I will personally pay for the mastering of a 3rd BD50 disc, should the Backers decide to use some of the excess budget that way. Challenge met with 72 hours to go.\nBubblegum Crisis was one of the first titles AnimEigo released over 20 years ago. This classic 8-episode OVA series was created by a who's-who of the Anime world, featuring character designs by Kenichi Sonoda (Riding Bean, Gunsmith Cats, Gall Force), production design by Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Full Metal Alchemist, Space Pirate Captain Harlock (2013)), direction by Katsuhito Akiyama (Armitage III), Masami Oobari (Detonator Orgun), Fumihiko Takayama (Patlabor III), Jun Okada, Hiroaki Gooda (Oh My Goddess!), music by Kooji Makaino (Oh My Goddess!), and mechanical designs by Sonoda, Aramaki and Hideki Kakinuma (Detonator Orgun).\nWe could simply just release it like most of the dozens of Anime and live-action films we've inflicted upon an unsuspecting North America over the years, but we want to do something more ambitious -- we want to use it to test a new model for releasing films.\nAnyone who follows the foreign-film business knows that changes in the Anime market over the last decade has made life much more risky for releasers, and the result has been that small companies like ours have to be very conservative in our licensing decisions, especially when it comes to niche titles (which are the ones we like the most!)\nThis means that there are a ton of projects we'd like to work on that we can't economically justify because we can't properly estimate the risks and rewards. Which makes us feel like this...\nDoing this project as a Kickstarter lets us totally avoid this problem, and precisely tailor the project to your specifications. We do this by having two simple rules. The first one is:\n50% of the amount raised gets used for actual production expenses.\nBy this we mean all out-of-pocket expenses such as materials acquisition, mastering, replication, printing, shipping, etc., plus a flat $7,500 production fee to cover the cost of our time (very conservative estimate: 500-900 man/hours).\nThe other 50% will be divided between AnimEigo and our Japanese licensor.\nKickStarter fundraising expenses, including the out-of-pocket cost of providing special bonus rewards, come off the top, before the 50/50 split is made.\nThe end result is that the final product you receive will have much more real value in it than if we released the title in the traditional manner.\nThe second rule is:\nYou're the patrons making this project possible, so you decide how the budget is spent.\nWe rather unimaginately call this \"CrowdProduction\". We don't want you to be passive consumers, but active producers. You will get to contribute to the actual project, and vote on how the budget gets spent.\nOur goal is $75,000. Let's say we actually get funded for $100,000. That means there is an extra $11,250 in the production budget (I'm rounding up the KickStarter/Amazon fees to 10% in this example). Some of that will be needed to produce more sets, of course, but how does the remainder get spent? A fancier package? A bonus commemorative item? Spanish subtitles? Klingon subtitles? Flying over to Japan to record interviews with the original creators?\nYou come up with the ideas... we'll figure out if they are feasible and how much they'll cost... and then everyone will get to vote on how the budget gets allocated.\nIn addition, if you want to take a stab at actually doing some of the work, you'll have that chance. If you want to contribute, we'll try and find a way to let you do so -- and give you the credit you'll deserve!\nA Singular Goal\nDue to the unusual way we're doing this KickStarter, we only have one goal. If we reach it, the budget will be enough to provide each supporter with Bubblegum Crisis (with both Japanese and English soundtracks, and optional subtitles in English and French), all the Hurricane Live animated music videos, and the Holiday in Bali live-action video on 2 region-free BD50 Blu-Ray discs.\nIn addition, supporters will get access to a downloadable Omake (Extras) Archive that will contain all the static bonus materials we have, including program notes, song lyrics, translated interviews with the original creators, and high-resolution color artwork and line-art (settei). Our current plan is to provide this in both HTML and PDF formats, so you can refer to it on a tablet while watching the videos.\nFinally, the package will include 5 Postcards from MegaTokyo and a custom Commemorative Challenge Coin that you will help design.\nOur estimated delivery date for the product is August 2014. We hope to get it done sooner, but in our CrowdProduction system, you might decide you want a feature (like a new dub, or adding AD Police) that takes extra time.\nImportant Geographical Restriction: due to license restrictions, we cannot ship this product to Japan, the People's Republic of China, or Taiwan.\nStretch Robert's Wallet!\nEven though we didn't set out to have stretch goals, one of the interesting things about the CrowdProduction process is that it is already causing the project to evolve. One of the things a lot of backers are saying they'd like to allocate the budget to is a 3rd BD50 disc (to permit additional content, and higher bitrates). I personally think this is an excellent idea, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is (just like you backers are doing!).\nSo if the KickStarter tops $130k, and you vote to include a 3rd BD50, I will personally pay for the mastering of the 3rd disc and the AACS content certificate and keys -- that's about $1700.\nAnd if the KickStarter tops $160k, and you vote to include a 3rd BD50, I will personally pay for the authoring of the 3rd disc ($2000 and up, depending on how complex it gets, and somehow I think you'll find lots of ways to make it complex!)\nGet Involved!\nWe've set up a forum for the KickStarter. If you are interested in joining the discussion and helping us shape this project, please head on over. Comments on this page are fine too, of course! And it goes without saying -- tell your friends about the project!\nMore Information\nHere are some links to some interviews I've done about the project:\nAnime Herald Interview\nMecha Talk Podcast\nMedia Inquiries: I am happy to answer your questions, do interviews and appear on podcasts; please contact me at trebor@animeigo.com\nSupport Levels\nOmake supporters will get access to the downloadable Omake Archive, have their names included in a Scroll of Supporters on the disc, and be able to participate in the CrowdProduction discussions, but won't get a vote in the final decisions.\nPenPal supporters will get access to the downloadable Omake Archive, have their names included in a Scroll of Supporters on the disc, and be able to participate in the CrowdProduction discussions. They will only be able to vote on issues related to the Postcards.\nChallenge supporters will get access to the downloadable Omake Archive, receive the Commemorative Challenge Coin, have their names included in a Scroll of Supporters on the disc, and be able to participate in the CrowdProduction discussions. They will only be able to vote on issues related to the Postcards and Challenge Coin.\nBasic supporters will receive one copy of the final product, have their names included in a Scroll of Supporters on the disc, and have the right to participate in the CrowdProduction process -- both discussions and voting. Half of the pledge ($25.00) goes right into the production budget. Those of you who are fast off the mark will be able to take advantage of the limited number of Early Adopter Basic slots.\nPremium supporters get everything Basic supporters get. Half of the pledge goes right into the production budget, but up to 50% of that portion will be assigned to a special Premium production budget that only Premium supporters will decide how to allocate, either for special commemorative items made just for them, or to enhance the final product for everyone. The exact amount that gets allocated will depend on how much of the pledge is needed to fund a fair share of the basic production budget -- if we exceed about 1550 supporters, then 25% of your pledge goes into the basic budget, and 25% into the premium budget. And like Basic, those of you who are fast off the mark will be able to take advantage of the limited number of Early Adopter Premium slots.\nPatrons get everything Premium supporters get. In addition, your name will be listed as a patron when the disc loads, and you will receive a special bonus item -- first come, first served. The cels come from my personal collection, and most include the pencil sketch.\nThere are multiple limited-quantity Patron levels, each associated with particular items. Many are cels, which you can see here: Largo1, Largo2, Largo3, Lisa-1, Lisa-2, Lisa-3, Mason, Daley, Leon, Revenge Road, and Hurricane. We also have Garage Kits, Metal Figures and the infamous \u201cNight Night Knight Sabers\" Satin Pillowcase. And thanks to our friends in Japan, we've got 4 poseable and preprinted 1/15 scale figures available: MotoSlave+Priss, MotoSlave+Linna, MotoSlave+Nene, and Boomer+AD Police (only the Boomer articulates). Also, one of your fellow project backers has donated 1/8 scale Vinyl kits of Priss and Nene to be used as Patron rewards.\nFinally, we have a special Patron Inspector reward that gets you one of the actual replication check discs -- you'll get to see one of the discs before everyone else (and if you see a problem, hopefully you'll tell us about it!)\nWe also have limited number of the original Bubblegum Crisis 18x24.75\" poster from 1991 in three groups: Basic+Poster, Premium+Poster, and Patron Poster. And don't worry, the posters will be shipped in tubes -- although if you ask nicely, we'd be happy to fold yours up as well.\nAnd then there's the Sonoda Sketches -- Sonoda Ken'ichi, the lead character designer of Bubblegum Crisis, will create, sign, and personally inscribe a sketch of your favorite Knight Saber! Only 4 sketches will be available.\nNote: some non-Poster Patrons have indicated they want the Poster as well. KickStarter doesn't make that easy, but I have reserved some copies to handle \"lost in the mail\" situations. If you are a Patron who wants a poster, contact me and I will put you on a waitlist -- with any luck we'll be able to get you a poster.\nFinally, there is the exclusive SuperBoomer level. In addition to the premium supporter benefits, your name will appear on the actual printed packaging, and you will receive my personal, all-time favorite cel of Largo. To give you some idea of how much this means to me, Largo has been on my business card for over 20 years. I will literally weep if someone actually springs for this. Update: Waaaaah! Sob! I am retroactively increasing the reward to make it include 5 copies of the product, not just one; after all, the SuperBoomer will want to give them to family and friends!\nPatrons will get their special items immediately after the KickStarter concludes!\nA Rewarding Experience!\nNow that the KickStarter has reached its goal and we know that there actually will be a project, there are many more possibilities for unique rewards -- and given that a big goal in this project is to involve you in the actual production process, we are going to start giving you the opportunity to become part of the actual production team using Experience Rewards!\nThe fine print: we will make reasonable efforts to deliver on these rewards, but circumstances beyond our control (such as scheduling issues, or the destruction of Wilmington by Hurricane or Kaiju) may make it impossible; if so, we will work with you to provide an alternate reward or refund you. Also, in some cases you may be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. So remember: your mileage may vary, and Otaku in the mirror are closer than they appear!\nWith that out of the way, let's dip our toe into the deep pool of insanity that is the Anime business with our first experience reward...\nMusic Video Maestro! (6 available starting Wed 10/30 @ 8pm ET)\nAll the core benefits of being a Patron (Premium benefits plus being listed when the disc loads), plus you will have the opportunity to visit the incredibly non-fancy AnimEigo office in Wilmington NC, where we will coach you through the process of recutting one of the music videos into HD and subtitling it! You will receive an official production credit and your name will be displayed -- as the editor -- when the video plays on the Blu-Ray. You'll also get 5 copies of the final product, not just 1! Airfare and Hotel not included (because they are so variable), but we'll handle ground transportation in Wilmington and take you out for a nice celebration dinner. We think someone with no previous editing experience will be able to complete the job in about a day, so this could be done on a weekend -- fly in on Friday night, edit up a storm on Saturday, and fly back Sunday.\nThe first choice of which music video to work on goes to the supporter who claims the Music Video Maestro #1 reward, second choice to the claimer of Music Video Maestro #2, and so on.\nAs with all other support levels, 50% of the amount raised (after KickStarter expenses and actual out-of-pocket expenses related to providing the reward) goes directly into the production budget. So you'll not only get to do something cool, but you will be increasing the budget so that everyone ends up with a better product. And as a Patron, you'll have a say in how both the Basic and Premium budgets get allocated!\nDouble Vision Option\nIf you have selected the Basic level or above as your reward, you can get a second copy of the product by simply pledging an extra $45 (US) or $55 (International). For example, if you live in the US and pledge $50+$45=$95, then just select the Basic reward and you will get a second copy. Or if you live in the UK and managed to snag an Early Adopter Premium spot ($90+$10 shipping), then pledging $90+$10+$55=$155 will get you a second copy.\nTo change your pledge and activate Double Vision, use the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the upper right of the Kickstarter page, then change the amount (in green). Do not change the reward tier. Then click \u201cContinue to Next Step\u201d and finally \u201cConfirm.\u201d\nNow that the KickStarter has met our goal, we have added the option of accepting PayPal for those of you who cannot sign up using the normal KickStarter process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince we've been releasing Japanese films for almost a quarter-century, we have a good handle on how to do projects like this -- and in fact, we've done \"proto-Kickstarter\" projects before, such as the complete SDF Macross TV Series.\n\nThe major risks are things outside our control, such as problems obtaining proper source materials. While we either already have, or have confirmed the availability of the materials we'll need, experience has taught us that occasionally unexpected problems occur.\n\nSimilarly, problems can crop up in the final authoring process. If a disc needs to be reauthored, this could cause a delay.\n\nFinally, since supporters get a say in deciding what goes into the set, it's possible that something will get added that takes extra time. If that's a possibility, we'll make sure you're aware of it before you vote.\n\nThat said, we have built some slippage into our schedule, so that even if we have a couple of problems, we should be able to make the promised release date -- and our track record of hitting promised release dates is upwards of 95%.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Gunsmith Cats Explosive Edition Campaign is Live!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nI completely forgot to post an update when the campaign went live!

Here are gathered the flotsam of the world: miscreants, mercenaries, soldiers of fortune, adventurers. Dirty Bowbe's Roadhouse they call it, and it's as rough and safe a sanctuary as any will find in those dark and bloody grounds!\nOnce, long ago, a Kingdom thrived here and the wealth of its coffers flowed across the lands as honey from a jar. From the deep, blue waters of Lake Veyona to the broken crags that overlook the Northern Steppes the King ruled a realm, both prosperous and contented.\nBut all things must end. And the wages of war and plague overwhelmed the King and his people and ground all to ruin. And the days of the Highland Kingdom are long past so that now nothing but memories remain . . . memories and their shadows.\nOr so such tales are spun by the hearth fire at Dirty Bowbe's Roadhouse to any and all who pass through, for that legendary tavern lies at the center of the world.\nTo the northeast of Dirty Bowbe's lie the ruins of Bortenski and the hazardous wastes known as the Witch Moor. Beyond that, the village of the Ugashtan and further still lay the broken crags of the Mythnoc Cairns where the proud barbarian people once buried their cherished dead.

This is a FULL set (the only foam set with d6 and [stretch goal] Ten's d10 being included at one low price) of large soft foam polyhedral dice.\nThese soft foam dice are great for many uses. From your spawn's first set of dice (ages 3+), to helping the hard of sight old fart DM see the numbers, to educational uses (yeah I said that), to just throwing them at your Game Master!\nThe basic set will include six dice, 1 of each of these 2\" (tall) foam dice:\n4 sided die (1-4)\n6 sided die (1-6) (numbers not pips)\n8 sided die (1-8)\n10 sided die (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)\n12 sided die (1-12)\n20 sided die (1-20)\n\nThese dice are just the right size to fit in your fist and they are squishy too!

They are only shown for demonstrational purposes.\nThe final color of these dice will be done all in DEEP PURPLE with white lettering- unless we reach the stretch goals that allow voting. The font will change to something more stylish but very readable.\nThese dice are made of non-toxic Polyurethane and then tampo printed (stamped) for long lasting markings.

If you still want them, you can pay for an International shipping charge instead of EU to get them there. We can probably stick a bag into a first class envelope to get to you though. So again, NO LOOSE DICE will be shipped to the EU.\nTo buy any item off the ala-carte menu you simply need to modify your pledge to add the dollars listed to your total pledge amount, but leave your reward set to the original reward.

Their fleet of gigantic alien warships is capable of destroying an entire planet in a split second. The only hope for survival lies in the secrets of Robotechnology, an advanced alien tech which has given the human race access to powerful robotics systems and interstellar spacecraft.\nAt the turn of the millennium, a mysterious unmanned Robotech space battle fortress crashed into the Earth, containing valuable information which the scientists of the United Earth Government used to develop their own Robotech Defense Force. However, unfamiliar with these alien systems, the crew of this newly reconstructed Super Dimensional Fortress will face the nearly impossible task of defending not only their own lives, but the fate of the entire world.\nIn Robotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122 you choose your force from an array of mecha led by either the heroic United Earth Defense Force or the villainous Zentraedi. You will lead these two mighty forces in a variety of combat theaters, from skirmishes in space on the Mars Colony to epic battles in Macross City and the rings of Saturn.\nRobotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122 is a fast paced strategy battle game that expands on the popular Palladium role playing game. Take command of the brave men and women of the United Earth Defense Force to valiantly defend Earth from annihilation. Or, command the alien armies of the Zentraedi Armada to recover an alien artifact of immense power and enslave humankind. Collect your forces from an expanding range of world class game pieces. Relive the massive battles on your tabletop at home to enhance your Robotech\u00ae RPG adventures or as a stand-alone game.\n Robotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122 is a battle game in which players build armies of multiple squadrons of mecha to fight it out in scenario driven, objective based game play. Depending on the faction, and their choice of mecha, a player's army may include anywhere from 2 game pieces to as many as you desire! The rules are scalable from small skirmishes to mass combat with hundreds per side.\nRobotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122 uses a dynamic turn system. Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army.  By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening.\nThe wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes. Even the battlefield itself can alter over the course of the game, as buildings are leveled by destruction unleashed during the battle.\nEach player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.\nNow that we have successfully funded the Boxed Game, we will use stretch goals to expand the game with new units and upgrades. Each stretch goal will have a specific dollar amount or backer number required to unlock the goal. Once a stretch goal has been unlocked it will be produced and available at launch.\nThere are three types of stretch goal: Upgrades, Bonuses, and Purchase Add-ons. Upgrades increase the value of an already existing product with additional game pieces or better quality components. Bonuses are free items that are given to a specific group of backers. Battle Cry backers and above receive all Bonus stretch goals. Purchase Add-ons are items that are not included in you basic pledge. In order to receive them you must increase your pledge by the cost of the Add-on.\nYour pledges are how we will make Robotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122 a reality. Below, each pledge level is explained in detail. Look through them and choose your level of support.\nYou can always adjust your pledge level by clicking on the \"Manage Pledge\" button in the top right corner.\nNOTE: If you would like to receive Homecoming or Battle Hymn in addition to another pledge level, you may treat them like an add-on and increase your pledge by their value.\nNOTE: The Battle Cry pledge level receives ALL unlocked BONUS stretch goals!\nGLOVAL'S REPORT receives all Battle Cry components.\nNOTE: The Showdown pledge level receives 2x ALL unlocked BONUS stretch goals!\nRECKLESS receives 4x ALL Battle Cry components.\n\nPurchase Add-ons are additional game pieces you can pledge for to expand your games of Robotech\u00ae RPG Tactics\u2122. These game pieces will allow you to field new and interesting squadrons in your battles.\nFollow these steps to receive an Add-on:\nClick on the blue \"Manage Pledge\" in the top right of the Kickstarter page. \nIncrease your pledge by the cost of the Add-on(s) you wish to receive.\nKeep your preferred pledge level selected.\nAt the end of the Kickstarter we will send you a Kickstarter Survey which you can use to tell us which Add-ons you wish to receive. In addition, we will provide you with the option of a pledge manager that you can use to manage your pledge further.\nNOTE: While MSRP has not been finalized, all Add-on prices are lower than expected MSRP.\nKickstarter & Convention Exclusive\nKickstarter & Convention Exclusive\nKickstarter & Convention Exclusive\nKickstarter & Convention Exclusive\nAll game pieces are 1/285th scale (40mm \u2013 70mm tall) and are high quality, multi-part, multi-pose ABS plastic.\nGame pieces are unpainted, and assembly is required.\nThey are supplied with custom 40mm, 50mm, or 60mm plastic bases.\nFor those of you living in Europe, we have made an arrangement with a local vendor in the UK to ship your pledge rewards from there.\nThis means that as a European Backer you will not be required to pay any additional VAT or import duties on your pledge reward.

Back in 2004 and 2005 we took the OGL and cleaned all the litigious material out of it, returned the focus of the game to where it belongs, behind the screens. We've recently released the Players Handbook in full color and are set to release our next great book, the Codex Celtarum. Lets bring this book out in hardcover!\nThe Codex Celtarum is a 144 page book filled with all manner of content, from a complete guide to Celtic Mythology for everyone's use, to 190 spells for characters to monsters for Castle Keepers/Game Masters. It's that and more.\nPREVIEW ONE!\nTLG 8130 Codex Celtarum, 144 pages, estimated MSRP $27.99 for the hardcover.\nBeyond the comforts of home lie worlds of epic adventure.\nDruids have surmised that before the present Universe there was a Disharmonious Void that once existed. Torn by destructive chaos and strife, it was devoid of any creative powers and life completely. Nothing could exist in this Disharmonious Void. It was death for the dead in essence and completely uninspired. A spark of Inspiration or Awen, called the Great Spark, blazing red and shaped like a thunder-bolt, tore its way through the blackness with fury. The Fire of Creation split the shapeless Void into the (as yet empty) Three Circles (Tr\u00ed F\u00e1ine) that were anchored around one magnificent, growing oak tree. This tree was the first in the Universe, and under its immense leafy crown hung golden acorns, swollen with potency.\nA Celtic Cromlech\nThe druids dwelt in a world wholly apart from our own, a world that comes down to us in the stones of the cromlech, the wild burnings of the wicker man, the priests who called on ancient trees and fey to bless or defend them and a language of such haunting beauty that its echoes stir memories within us of a people we once were.\nThe Codex Celtarum delves into the myths of the Celtic peoples, the powers of the world around them, the monsters that hunted them, and the gods that watched over them. Its author, Brian Young, a scholar by trade, introduces the Celtic mythos like never before, exploring the depths of that world to recast it for the fantasy RPG Castles & Crusades. Within the Codex Celtarum lies a wealth of information; gaming material that blows new life into the world of the fey, the druid, the ranger and all characters whose travels carry them through the wooded hills, broken crags and dark forests of our primeval imagings.\nMore than Myths and Gods\nThe Codex Druidum contains a veritable host of gaming material. New spells for your druid, new powers for your characters, combat, and more, within the Codex Celtarum you'll find:\n190 new druidic spells\n90 gods and monsters from the Celtic mythos\n150 powers for the fey monsters\nExpand your character! With fey blood in your veins you too can possess the powers of the fey. Or even adopt new races for your game. The elder gods possessed powers of surpassing wonder and left a world with all manner of strange incarnations, those are yours to bring to life.\nCodex Celtarum comes complete in seven glorious, fun filled, fact packed chapters. Chapter 1 covers a complete history of the Celtic world view. Chapter 2 delves into the world of fey. Chapter 3 presents races and monsters. Chapter 4 covers mountains of new spells and magical abilities. Chapter 5 tackles the lords of war. Chapter 6 looks at the gods themselves.

Ken Whitman, a friend of mine, had tried to talk me into doing a Kickstarter campaign several years ago, because many times I had spoken to him about doing a big hardback book that would cover my life's work. Then another friend, Jim Ludwig of DarkSword Miniatures, started calling me about Kickstarter.\nWhen I crunched the numbers, for me to publish a big book on my own dime, I simply couldn't afford it. I had certain publishers approach me to do a big book during the past few years....they would publish it, and of course, make all the money. But I wanted to do it my way. I never had a real agent during my career, I never particularly cared for someone telling me what to do (art directors were enough), so I have done it all my way the best I could. With an agent, I may have made more money over the years, perhaps done covers of \"bigger books\" and maybe, more popularity could have come my way, I don't know... I wanted to paint and draw. I just kept working and never ran out of work.\nI was worried about this Kickstarter project, I didn't want to be the first guy to loose money on Kickstarter :-) . I was hesitant on the whole deal. I knew I had fans out there, because I have attend a lot of conventions over the past 25 years, but I didn't really know just how many and I didn't know just how strong and true they were. It really takes your most dedicated \"hardcore\" fans to pull off a project like this. I didn't know if there were that many---\"left\". Even though I still paint every day if possible and I will paint and draw until I die.\nI basically got out of the publishing world a few years ago and lately I have been painting my own work and selling the originals. I love it. But I know that many fans have missed my work being published on books and game covers. I guess some of you thought I had \"retired\"!!! Well, I haven't! I never will. I worked as an illustrator for over 40 years, now I am ready to do my own work. I will still be around, while you sleep, I will be painting and drawing, and I will continue to do that until it becomes physically or mentally impossible for me. In the future, I will publish books of my newer works, both paintings and drawings, I will continue to make prints of these pieces, available at my website.\nWell anyway, this campaign was greatly successful ONLY because of you guys. The MAIN reason I am writing this is to THANK ALL MY FANS...all over the world!! My family and I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of our hearts, I am seriously overwhelmed. I think my family didn't have a clue that this would happen, they are just as surprised as I am. Now, I have \"pad money\" ... and that means this, when I try to do a painting every month to pay the bills, and if that painting takes me a month and a half or two months to finish, I will have \" pad money\" to carry me over until I get paid. And that, my friends, takes a load of stress off me, and frees my mind up to do more creative work.\nI am planning other Kickstarter Campaigns later on, some special books, like a NEW color Snarfquest graphic novel, and we are working on card games and board games, which I am greatly involved in. One of the most important projects, that may go up on Kickstarter next year, will be a large hardback black and white book. I wanted to get all my black and white work in this book, but there was no way...the book would be TOO thick. So, I want to do another hardback of all my black and white art, pencils and inks. The black and white book will be a matching book to this hard back color book. If you have purchased this color book and you purchase the black and white book, you will have a matching set of hardback books that cover around 95% of my life's work.\nAgain, I Sincerely thank each and every one of you ALL your support in this Kickstarter campaign, not only for this campaign, but THANK YOU for supporting me through all those years of fun and games that covered most of our lives!!! Did you ever think we would all come together one more time? I love you all!!!\nLarry Elmore\nELMORE ADD-ONS\nADD-ON #1: Add $25 to your pledge and get a Dragon Doodle in front of your book.

Many of the images I will include in this tome are being re-mastered using the latest digital technology from original film, for unprecedented quality, and several pieces have never before been published or rarely seen.  Interspersed among the images I will also offer you glimpses into my studio and creative process, including sketches and preliminaries, as well as share with you my autobiography, my artistic journey, and my stories.  I will start from my earliest childhood drawings, and together we will journey through my challenges breaking into the industry and frustrations with commercial art, through my years working in games and on novel covers and ultimately to my latest personal works.\nThis hardback book will be 9\" x 12\" and encompass 300+ pages.  Depending on your pledge amount you can own this book as a standard coffee-table hardback edition, or a deluxe leather-bound cover edition, as well as other bonuses, such as special prints, original hand-drawn sketches, or even the original painting used for the cover itself!  Most importantly, you are helping me realize my dream of bringing this volume to you, my fans.  Thank you in advance for your pledge!\nThis kickstarter project is going unbelievably well and I am overwhelmed. I want to do more stretch goals, and believe me we have been wracking our brains. But I had an idea; I have a lot of paintings and many of them have never left my studio, the originals have never been seen, and hardly anyone has had an opportunity to purchase one. I feel that they are too much trouble to take to conventions and also more likely get damaged. In the old days every painting made a trip to the publisher in New York and after it was published they would send the painting back. When it returned I would usually put the painting on a shelf in my studio or in a flat file. Now days I drive my paintings to Nashville for a professional scan and when I get back put them either on a shelf or in a flat file. So why not put some of these paintings up for sale because so many fans of my art are following this project and everyone would have an equal chance at purchasing an original painting. I have selected 12 paintings to sell; we will keep three available for purchase at all times until they are all sold or this kickstarter project is over. We are still trying to come up with new stretch goals and want to sincerely thank everyone for the fantastic support of this project!!!\n\nSPECIAL: This Kickstarter campaign has been unbelievable, over whelming. So I decided to do one more special for everyone that is interested in original paintings. Since this campaign has been underway, many people have called me about buying original paintings. I think what surprised people most is that I have sold so many paintings over the years. Many of those iconic pieces are gone. I was never interested in hoarding all my paintings, I would always sell paintings at a reasonable price, because my favorite painting was always my next one! These paintings I am displaying here on kickstarter are some of the \"few\" that I have left to sell. I have saved some paintings to pass on to my children. Over the next 14 days, I have decided to lower the prices on these paintings $100 each day, until this Kickstarter campaign ends on December the 31st. If they sell, then I hope they find a good home, if not, I will keep them, just a few more paintings my children will have to deal with when I am gone....hopefully many years from now :)\nWANT TO SEE LARGER VERSIONS....\nThe Last Ingredient : http://larryelmore.com/lastin\nThree Doors: http://larryelmore.com/threedoors\nMight & Magic 8:  http://larryelmore.com/mightmagic\nUnexpected return: http://larryelmore.com/unreturn\nFrost Giant: http://larryelmore.com/frostgiant  \nKing Author: http://larryelmore.com/kingauthor\nPLACE OF POWER PRINTS\nThe more we raise with this campaign, the better we can make this art book.

Once the Kickstarter program is over, the Hardback book will sale for $80. \nHere is the curent retail value of our current stretch goals...\nStretch Goal 1: 48 Additional Pages If there is enough interest in this project, I would like to expand the book to 304 pages.

COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 2: 8\"x10\" D&D Original Box Set Covers  As a special thank you to my fans, should funding exceed fifty thousand dollars, I will include three 8\" x 10\" print of one of my most remembered painting series--the Basic Dungeons & Dragons Red Dragon box cover, the Expert Dungeons & Dragons Blue box cover, and the Companions Dungeon & Dragons Green box-- in every contributor's package. COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 3: B&W Sketch Book  As an added bonus for achieving the one Seventy-five thousand dollar mark, I am going to bind together a soft cover black & white sketchbook that will include copies of all the original drawings I will be doing as inserts for this project and a few extra no one has ever seen. Everyone who has contributed from the Fan Package on up will receive a copy of this book in their package. I am so very grateful to you all for making my 40 year compendium a reality! COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 4: 8\"x10\" Original Dragonlance Covers  Once we hit one hundred thousand, I will include three limited edition 8\" x 10\" prints of the three original Dragonlance Book covers -- Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, Dragons of Spring Dawning -- in every contributor's package. COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 5: Motorcycle Ride & Studio Tour As an added bonus for achieving the one hundred twenty-five thousand dollar mark, I plan to have a studio tour and motorcycle ride in my hometown of Leitchfield Kentucky. I will send each you a ticket to bring one guest sometime during the summer of 2013. You will have a chance to walk through my studio and time to talk with me. Later in the afternoon everyone with a motorcycle is welcome to take a long ride with me through the foothills of Kentucky. If you do not have a motorcycle, you are still welcome to come and enjoy the studio tour. (Contributors would be responsible for their own travel arrangements, overnight stay, gas, etc.)\nStretch Goal 6: 32 Additional Pages will round this book out to a whopping 336 pages. If pledges exceed two hundred thousand, all contributors will receive a 336 page book rather than the expanded 304 pages.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenges:\nThe greatest challenge I am facing with this project is the re-mastering and color-correcting of all my older works from the film the images are preserved on. Don't get me wrong, the quality of color will be phenominal and as close to the originals as I can get, but there is a LOT of work to do \"cleaning up\" the fuzzies, speckles and other gremlins that creep in during the scanning process. Still, I am excited to have the technology to reproduce these old favorites in a clearer, crisper way than ever before.\n\nSchedule:\nThis book will ship to Kickstarter supporters in August 2013. \n\nShipping:\nAll pledge amounts include USPS Media Mail shipping within the U.S. Shipping for international orders will receive an additional $48.00 fee.

If you're actually buying the card decks, this means five extra cards for free.\n\nFOURTEENTH BONUS GOAL: $75,000 ACHIEVED!\n\nWe have truly established Swords & Wizardry as a contender in the mainstream RPG world.\n\nFor everyone getting a pdf or a printed Encounter Deck, we'll increase the deck size to 52 cards per set (they are currently set at the 36-40 range depending upon manufacturers).\n\nAs an additional resource, for those who like visual aids at the game table, we will create a deck of \"What You See Cards\". This deck has pictures of monsters from the monster book, so you can show the players what they see without holding up the book and trying to cover the rest of the page. The PDF of the cards will be free to pledges $48 or more. The actual print card decks will be available to all levels as a $10 add on.\n\nThis area will be updated for Pledges as goals are achieved.

We are not responsible for any bookshelves collapsing under the weight of this treasure.\nNote: The genuine leather book will only be available on kickstarter and not sold in retail stores.\nDid you say it\u2019s connected to Rappan Athuk?\n\nYes we did. The Swords & Wizardry Complete Rules are the original \u201cOld School\u201d game rules, and if you want to go for the authentically deadly experience of the Rappan Athuk megadungeon by Frog God Games \u2026 this is the rulebook for it. These are the rules used to create Rappan Athuk in the first place, the rules that stalked its dark halls for many years until the turn of the millennium. So if you want to play Rappan Athuk in all its original deadliness, take a look at the rewards, and consider the role you want to play in this latest diabolical plot of ours.\nIs this the exact text of the 1974 rules?\nThe Swords & Wizardry Rules are a restatement of those rules, but with newly-written text, better organization (where the rules were spread across seven booklets).\n\nCan I publish my own adventures for Swords & Wizardry?\nYes. Swords & Wizardry is published under the WotC Open Game License, and contains our own license that allows you to create works and say that they are compatible with Swords & Wizardry. This license is similar to the now-extinct d20 license, but is less restrictive. We welcome any and all third party publishers of S&W, and there are already several.\nTell me more about Tome of Horrors Complete and The Black Monastery.\nThe Tome of Horrors Complete is a colossal 667 pages of monsters, monsters, and yet more monsters written for both Pathfinder Game System and Swords & Wizardry.\nEN World Review of Tome of Horrors Complete: \u201cI found the ToHC to be the strongest 3rd party product yet released for Pathfinder RPG. It was fun to read and I expect it will prove exceedingly useful at the table, simply when considering the utility of the animals contained within it. When the hundreds of other creatures are also considered, the ToHC more than doubles the available foes to GMs playing Pathfinder RPG\u2026 I believe the ToHC adds such a plethora of possibilities to the game that it is a must-have reference book for running Pathfinder RPG.\u201d Read full review here\n\nPaizo Publishing Public Review of Tome of Horrors Complete:\nGives it 5 out of 5 stars. \u201cNever before has this massive selection of monsters been updated and brought with these resources all together in one place for use in your own game.\u201d Read full review here\nThe Black Monastery is a lost adventure from 1981, never published because of a legal dispute with TSR. It isn\u2019t just retro, it is the real thing from back in the day.\nEZG reviews The Black Monastery:\nGives it 5 out of 5 stars: \u201cWhat truly makes the Black Monastery shine, though, at least for me, is its gothic convolutedness and its attention to detail: The crazed cook, and inscriptions upon inscriptions that hide hints and grant insight into the demented logic of the madmen and otherworldly forces that call this place home.\u201d Read full review here\n\nPaizo Publishing Public Review of The Black Monastery: Gives it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Read full review here:\n\nCan I substitute a Pathfinder version of Tome of Horrors or The Black Monastery?\nFrog God Games does publish Pathfinder versions of these books, and we realize that many people already have a Swords & Wizardry version of them. However, shipping Kickstarter materials is already so complicated (all those bonus goals add up, and there are many pledge levels) that we simply don't dare to add this as an option. It could lead to disastrous shipping errors. So, no.\n\nIs this game supported with adventure modules, or is it just a fantasy heartbreaker?\nSwords & Wizardry has been around since 2009, winning awards across the world. There are over 20 published print modules for Swords & Wizardry, with many more in the works.  Not only have we been winning awards, we have sold thousands of copies of the game, helped sponsor a convention, and built a strong community of players over the years. Now it's time to put the game into brick and mortar stores.\nWhat are the Dungeoneering Expenses?\nShipping will be charged AFTER the project has ended. We will research the cheapest shipping possible and send invoices individually for the shipping costs. We will mail the Swords & Wizardry Complete Rules in November. Shipping prices will apply at that time.\nWhy do a Kickstarter?\nKickstarter allows us to raise the funds to print the mass quantity needed for distribution. It also allows us to create more projects we wouldn't otherwise be able to like the Monster Book with new art, lairs, and encounters. \nAs we raise funds for this project we would like to continue to hear your feedback on future bonus goals for items you would like to see.\nShare us on your blog, website, or other social media!

Back in 2004 and 2005 we took the OGL and cleaned all the litigious material out of it, return the focus of the game to where it belongs, behind the screens. One simple mechanic drives the focus of the game, the attribute check system, The Siege Engine. Siege allows the Castle Keeper, our GM, to easily adjudicate any situation.\nThe Siege Engine is extremely versatile, open for use in almost any situation. If you have two dwarves that decide to tie themselves together and loop their bodies as ballast on a floating log, all in order to cross a raging river, the Siege Engine covers it. Have a paladin being lifted hundreds of feet in the air, dropped only to pull out his ring of feather falling and ask if he can put it on before he hits the ground? The Siege Engine covers it.\n Here\u2019s How it Works\nSame 13 characters. Same 6 attributes. Same races.\nCharacter attributes are either primary or secondary. Humans have 3 primary, demi-humans have 2. Challenges are rolled against the attribute. Any primary attribute has a base chance to succeed of 12. Any secondary attribute has a base chance to succeed of 18. If something comes up that requires an attribute check the characters roll a d20, add their level, their attribute bonus and check whether it\u2019s a primary or secondary. The CK sets a challenge level to the base (12 or 18), depending on how difficult the task is or is not.  If the characters roll plus bonuses meets or exceed the base +1 challenge level, the action succeeds.\nNo need for tons of skills and feats. Now its all on the table. Characters can try anything, they may not succeed, according to the CK. But the doors are open. How wide? That depends on the CK and the challenge level he sets.\nThat is C&C. A rules light, easy to learn fantasy role playing game.\nNow in FULL COLOR.\nWith Iron Heel the World Grinds Away\nPlunge into worlds of fantastic adventure where dragons lie and the undead stalk the shades of your mind\u2019s imagines, where creatures of legend plunder wealth through the horror of their passage. Monsters grim and foul hold the ecstasy of gold and the renown of glory. Upon the backs of these stalk heroes of great might; those who take up sword and shield, who harness eldritch might, those who stalk the narrow corridors in search of sport and those who serve a purpose greater than all the others. Heroes. Freebooters. Mercenaries. Adventurers.\nBeyond the comforts of home lie worlds of epic adventure.\nA Game That is Yours to Command\nCastles & Crusades is a fantasy role playing game with countless possibilities. The Players Handbook allows you take up the sword and shield, the staff or bow; to arm yourself as your mind desires and wander upon planes of your own imagining and plunder the wealth of adventure.\nDesigned for use with multiple players, Castles & Crusades puts you in charge of the adventure path. Included within are all the rules of play, how to get started in your very own role playing game, how to run the game and play in it.\nIt\u2019s easy to learn attribute-based rules system allows players to choose among 13 archetypal character classes and 7 races to create their characters. Spells, equipment, fast-paced combat rules, and all essential information needed to play a game of Castles & Crusades is in this book.\nDice and Monsters & Treasure sold separately.\nAbout this Printing\nThe 5th printing sports a new full bleed cover by artist Peter Bradley. The interior of the books contains minor text edits and some few rules clarifications. Otherwise the interior of the Players Handbook is much like the 4th Printing.\nSTORYBOARD UPDATE: Here is the latest version of the cover.

It offers legions of inventive traps, tricks, strange features, and monsters -- many of them never before seen. It affords numerous opportunities for roleplaying, but anyone willing to brave these subterranean halls better arrive ready to rumble, or their lives will be short indeed.\nWe at Frog God Games are giving you early adopters a unique opportunity to be a part of roleplaying game history. In cooperation with Necromancer Games, your generous pledges will help to fuel the production of Rappan Athuk for both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game system and the Swords & Wizardry rules. We hope to be able to raise enough funds to distribute this book to brick and mortar game stores!

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

Talanian (Castle Zagyg: East Mark Gazetteer, Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works, Charnel Crypt of the Sightless Serpent)\nIllustrator: Ian Baggley (Dungeon Deep Designs: Fantasy Posters, Charnel Crypt of the Sightless Serpent)\nCover Artist: Charles Lang (Cemetery Dance, Magic the Gathering, Zombie War Trading Cards)\nCartographer: Andreas Claren (Dragonsfoot Publications, Black Blade Publishing, Brave Halfling Publishing)\nEditor: David Prata (OSRIC, Malevolent and Benign, Lenard Lakofka's L4 Devilspawn)\nAbout the Game:\nAstonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea (AS&SH) is a forthcoming role-playing game by North Wind Adventures. It is played with paper, pencil, dice, and imagination. Participants include one referee and one or more players. The referee prepares and presents the adventure material, and the players create player characters, such as the principal classes of fighter, magician, cleric, and thief; or a subclass, such as barbarian, berserker, cataphract, illusionist, necromancer, pyromancer, druid, shaman, assassin, legerdemainist, scout, and more!\nThe heroes of an AS&SH game delve dungeons filled with horrifying monsters, lethal traps, and bewildering puzzles; they explore savage wilderness frontiers and hostile borderlands; they probe ancient ruins and investigate cursed tombs; they match steel against sorcery, and sorcery against steel; and they plunder for gold, gems, and magical treasure.\nHyperborea is the default campaign setting for AS&SH. This \u201cflat earth\u201d realm is overlooked by a bloated, dying sun, and hemmed in by the mystical boreas (or \u201cNorth Wind\u201d).  Hyperborea is in a perpetual state of decay, populated by disharmonious men, hostile monsters, and weird, alien beings.\nThe setting is inspired by the fantastic literature of Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith. Other inspirational authors include Edgar Rice Burroughs, Fritz Leiber, Abraham Merritt, Michael Moorcock, and Jack Vance. AS&SH rules and conventions are inspired by the original 1974 fantasy wargame and miniatures campaign rules as conceived by E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.\nHyperborea is an adaptable campaign setting. It can be used independently or in conjunction with other settings, published or home-brewed; indeed, Hyperborea might be just beyond the North Wind of any campaign setting.\nAbout the Designer and Illustrator:\nAstonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea is the creation of game designer Jeffrey P. Talanian, who is best known for his work with Gary Gygax, with whom he co-authored the critically acclaimed Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works, and other publications. Since Mr. Gygax's passing, Talanian has dedicated himself to the design and development of the AS&SH role-playing game.\nAS&SH is fully illustrated by Talanian's creative partner, Ian Baggley, an award winning fine artist from the Toronto School of Art. Baggley, who prefers to work with the mediums of oil paint, charcoal, and ink, brings a dark and moody tone to the AS&SH project that is scarcely matched in modern role-playing games.\nTogether, Talanian and Baggley have painstakingly designed and developed the AS&SH project for over three years, and they anticipate an early 2012 release.\nAbout the AS&SH Boxed Set:\nThe AS&SH boxed set includes a full color cover by fantasy and horror artist, Charles Lang.\nContents to include: \nManuals* fully illustrated by fine artist Ian Baggley.\nVol. I. Swordsmen & Sorcerers (features 4 classes, 18 subclasses)\nVol. II. Sorcery (features over 400 spells)\nVol. III. Adventure & Combat\nVol. IV. Bestiary (features of 200 monsters)\nVol. V. Treasure\nVol. VI. Hyperborea Gazetteer\nDice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)\nPoster Map of Hyperborea by cartographer, Andreas Claren\nCharacter Sheets\nThe projected retail price of the Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea = $50.00\n* The final format of these manuals is yet to be determined; i.e. the individual volumes may be bound as two manuals: Vol. 1-3 and Vol. 4-6. Regardless of format, the total page count will number approximately 400+ pages, depending on final layout.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nNorth Wind Adventures is a small press publisher that is just getting started. We need your help to get our core product, Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea, in print and available for purchase, both online and in hobby shops in the USA and other countries. Every level of support, from bronze to platinum, gets us closer to achieving this end. Meeting a $6000 support goal is just enough to allow us to fund the initial print run of AS&SH. \nAdditional support will allow us to order more game boxes and other necessary materials; this will put us in a better position to place AS&SH into distribution. Additional funds beyond our goal will also help us to better advertise our product, rent convention booths, and sooner produce further support material (adventures, supplements, etc.). \nNo donation is too small, and every donation is greatly appreciated!

Jackson \"Lapsus Calumni\" http://snikle.wordpress.com/\nShane Knysh \"Fictitious Entry\" http://fictitiousentry.posterous.com/\nDyson Logos \"A Character for Every Game\" http://rpgcharacters.wordpress.com/\nDavid Millar \"Dave's Mapper\" http://davesmapper.com/\nBrutus Motor \"This is Dice Country\" http://thisisdicecountry.blogspot.com/\nAJ Stone \"Stonewerks\" http://stonewerks.wordpress.com/\nThey each plan to contribute a design to the project.  If you've been posting 20+ dungeon geomorphs in a similar style, please get in touch.\nOther Notes:\nThe international shipping amounts (listed in each pledge) are good faith estimates.  If shipping is significantly more, we'll let you know and work it out.\nThe geomorph designs are not yet final.  I'll post updates throughout the process.\nThe battlemats in the pdf will each span several pages because each will be too large to fit on one 8.5\" x 11\" sheet of paper.  These will likely be created using my \"Dungeonographer\" map editing software.\nThe bonus battlemat (or two or three) at the $80 level and above has unfortunately been changed.  They simply weren't printable at that cost (if one wanted them to last more than one game session.)  But I think I've come up with some interesting alternatives:\nA font  of all 90 of the DungeonMorphs.  Yep, you'll be able to just type out geomorphs.  Pretty cool, I think.  These will be included at the $80 level and above.  They should be available in both TrueType and OpenType.  I'll test them to work on Windows and MacOS.  (Linux users probably don't need my help.) :)\nA card deck of all the DungeonMorphs.  Each of the 90 designs will be printed on one side, laminated and cut (likely to 2\"x2\" or 2.5\"x2.5\".)  These will be included for anyone pledging $100 and above.\nIf you want either of these but your pledge amount doesn't qualify, simply add $7 to your pledge for the font or $8 for the card deck.  (After pledging is complete, Kickstarter lets me send out an official survey where you can send me your address and product choices.) If you want the card deck but you aren't ordering any dice, please make it $12 instead of $8 to cover s&h.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "10th Anniversary!", "update_content": "Can you believe it has been a decade (to the day) since we launched this Kickstarter?!
