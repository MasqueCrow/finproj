During that time, we have worked with multiple factories and international freight companies to ensure our high-quality games are delivered on-time and in excellent condition. For this Kickstarter, we are working with experienced partners like Quartermaster Logistics to continue that pattern of quality.\n\nWe are estimating a May 2022 delivery date for this game, but please keep in mind this is only an estimate. There are always elements beyond our control when working with manufacturers, such as virus outbreaks, production delays, shipping delays, and delays with customs. Should these occur, we will make sure that we quickly communicate any delay or challenge and keep our backers updated.\n\nIn addition, the game has already gone through substantial production, which further limits the chances for delays. The artwork is mostly complete, the plastics have been sculpted, and many components are at or near a print-ready state.

If this is your first Meeple Source Kickstarter project, welcome! And if it isn't, welcome back!\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter project, so it really means something when we say that this project includes the most exciting variety of game upgrades to date. We hope that you will pull up a chair, stay a while, and take this journey with us.\nThis is expected to be our only Kickstarter project in 2021, so we are giving you everything we've got! We have new upgrades for popular series like Scythe, Wingspan, and The West Kingdom Trilogy. We're adding beautiful pieces to our line of upgrades for Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Concordia, Caverna, Agricola, and Grand Austria Hotel. Hot new games are definitely represented here as well, with sets designed especially for Lost Ruins of Arnak, Obsession, Darwin's Journey, Creature Comforts, Hallertau, Bonfire, New York Zoo, Dominant Species: Marine, Tekhenu, and Tawantinsuyu. And that's not all! Isle of Cats, Taverns of Tiefenthal, Fields of Arle, Carpe Diem, Keyper, Keyflower: The Farmers, and Key Market, Dice Settlers, A Feast for Odin, Cat Lady, Clans of Caledonia, Wendake, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, Reykholt, and Underwater Cities are all shown some massive love in this project!\nWith so many game upgrades offered in this project (and likely a few more to come along the way), we are offering some of our pledge levels in a different way than we have in the past. We are calling these first few upgrades \"Featured Pledge Levels\", and you can pledge for them by simply browsing the list of Kickstarter pledge levels and selecting it, just as you normally would with any Kickstarter project. If you scroll down further, you will get to the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which will be used for all of the other upgrades.\nAll of the other game upgrades, including partial sets (when shown as a project option), are being combined in the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which shows a cost of $1. You can/should still pledge for the combined amount for your desired game upgrades. Although different from the way we have done this in the past, we are hoping that a simplified format will make a project with as many options as this easier to navigate.\nIn Kickstarter, you will only choose one pledge level as your primary pledge, but it is certainly possible to pledge for multiple things here.  To do so, simply select one of the upgrades as your \"main pledge level\", then select \"add-ons\" for your other upgrade(s) you want as well. Additionally, there will be an intuitive process in BackerKit (the post-project order management and survey software we use) to handle the multiple upgrades and choices. You can take advantage of our flat-rate shipping offer by bundling an unlimited number of upgrades from this project with no additional shipping cost.\nThe popularity of flat-rate shipping cannot be understated, so that's what we're doing. The amount varies by country, but the shipping amount is fixed, no matter how many upgrades and add-ons you pledge for. The flat shipping rate within the United States is $7, and other countries have a flat rate of $9-$15.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties and/or fees owed at delivery, these are still your responsibility. This used to only rarely happen though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind. BUT, things are changing, at least in some countries. Read on...\nIf we are required to collect VAT for your order before the project ships, that cost will be collected in BackerKit (our chosen post-project management/fulfillment tool). This will almost certainly be necessary for UK backers (see more below), and likely EU backers as well. If at the point we need to collect the VAT for your shipment, you are unhappy with the amount or process, you will have the opportunity to cancel some or all of your pledge, but we will have to reduce the refund at that time by the amount of the non-refundable Kickstarter fees for your transaction. \n2021 has already seen huge changes in transit, tariffs, and international business. We are running this project in good faith, and will be transparent with what needs to happen to get you the fancy upgrades that you desire! :-) \nThere are also a number of countries that we are not able to ship to, due to known limitations and/or difficulty delivering successfully in the past. The list of countries that we CAN ship to are: United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other than the UK (see special circumstances below), if you don't live in one of these countries, pledging for this project will be difficult. Options that you may have are to combine your order with a friend who lives in a serviced country, or to use a US-based mail/package forwarding service. There are many out there, and some of our customers from around the world use them regularly. \nYou might be aware that we are not currently shipping to the UK on our website. We hope to change this soon, but Brexit-related changes to importing/exporting (at least for small companies such as ourselves) have proven maddening. Our distinct expectation is that it will be a thing of the past by the time we are fulfilling this project. Assuming so, we will have to collect the VAT for your pledge, and will file that on your behalf at that time (resulting in a seamless and fee-free delivery). But, if we are unable to accomplish this, we will refund 100% of your pledge (we will absorb the Kickstarter fees mentioned above, in this case). For a variety of reasons though, we would like you to make your pledge (no matter what it's for) as a $1 (+shipping) pledge in the \"UK Backers Only\" pledge level. We can sort everything else out with you individually in BackerKit afterward. We apologize for this admittedly wonky process, but our alternative was to exclude UK backers from the project, which we really didn't want to do.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Siblings Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions (in a non-COVID year!), you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for most of these upgrades is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our Wingspan birds, Raiders of the North Sea upgrades, Architects of the West Kingdom meeples, as well as a number of our other more recent upgrades! \nWe are also excited to offer a set of meeples by a guest artist for Darwin's Journey, Paolo Voto, who is the artist for the game itself!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with our a few of our most recent upgrades...\nWingspan: Oceania Bird Meeples\nNectar Tokens for Wingspan: Oceania\nPaladins of the West Kingdom Meeples\nRaiders of the North Sea Meeples\nResources for Raiders of the North Sea\nTomesaga/Overlord Meeples for Viscounts of the West Kingdom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for over nine years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 14 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. We quality-control every meeple individually by hand and ship all orders in-house, and we also use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you probably know that we are very straight-forward with regard to the progress of our projects, and will let you know if we encounter any delays. We did have an unfortunate technological hiccup with regard to Kickstarter emails/messages during the final phase of fulfillment of our last project, and can assure you that we will pay closer attention than ever, and won't have a lapse in response like we did at that time. \n\nWe believe that we have allotted enough time in the production and delivery schedule to account for the types of situations that could arise, but unexpected delays are still always possible. Our last few Kickstarter projects delivered early, and although this could occur again, we obviously can't promise that.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges. So don't worry, we've got this!\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Meeple Source reserves the right to cancel any pledge, although we have never had to exercise this right in the past.\n\nAny VAT that Meeple Source is required to collect and remit on your behalf will be collected in BackerKit (the 3rd party pledge manager that we use) - it is not already built-in to the listed prices on Kickstarter that are applicable to all backers.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in BackerKit and the package is returned to us as undeliverable, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any selected add-ons.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, Meeple Source will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nIf you do not log in to BackerKit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. If you need more time to complete your BackerKit survey, you must contact us. Meeple Source reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into the BackerKit system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge for this project.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email meeplesource@gmail.com for further information.

It seems that Kickstarter was actively changing the way that looked to backers even throughout the day of our last update. In the morning, the app showed add-on money as \"bonus\" money and described it in a way that made it sound like it was a donation, not support in exchange for rewards. The website still worked the \"old way\" where you could simply change your pledge dollar amount. But by the end of that day, both the website and app were both showing \"bonus money\" as the only way to add funds to your pledge. We don't expect any donations, don't worry!

Taking inspiration from countless hours of Anime, LokDown will allow players to enjoy the bombastic conflicts, colorful atmosphere, magical heroes, and amazing worlds found in the best Anime, while also crafting your own deep and well-versed characters (or just go with a tormented edge lord or a nerdy/shy-yet-still-charming high schooler with a destiny) to inhabit them.\nCheck it out Now!\nBut please, you do not have to take our word for it. We have an early version we are releasing, for free, so people can see what the game is about. There are over 170 pages of content showing you what LokDown will be. It has everything you need to begin exploring the LokDown world!\n  LokDown Early Edition Free Download! 180 pages of Anime TTRPG Awesomeness \nThe Luminous Dawn\nWhen the Calamity struck, the Luminous Dawn Settlement Fleet was mid-transit to an uninhabited world, well past the edges of Neo-Spine Space. Controls failed; life support systems faltered. In short, the 100,000 inhabitants of the escaping fleet were destined to die.\nThrough frantic effort, onboard engineers managed to repair basic life support systems, allowing the fleeing fleet's crews and their families to enter into stasis chambers, hoping to sleep out the danger until a rescue could be found. All four ships were linked to the controls of Admiral Keanu Lok, commander of the Luminous Dawn. He alone would stay awake, and he alone would determine all of their fates.\nBut what quickly became clear to Admiral Lok was there would be no rescue. After the Calamity, there was not a ship in the empire or perhaps even the entire galaxy that could find them. So, while they slept without dreams, Keanu Lok guided the fleet through the void of space on only the most basic of gravitational controls, completely alone, and without hope.\nPlanet LokDown\nWhen the alarms blared, announcing the end of stasis, the crews and their families slowly awoke to find their vessels had all crashed on a strange alien world. The only message from Admiral Lok: A call for hope, a plea for determination, and an inspiring farewell. He placed their ship on the best course he could towards an inhabitable world they would not reach for over 2,000 years. They found Admiral Lok\u2019s ancient mummified corpse still at the controls and gave him a burial in the planet he had died getting them to.\nThe world Admiral Lok found was tidally locked in orbit around its star. One sweltering side perpetually faced the sun, and the other in permanent frozen darkness. Only a narrow ring circling the planet from pole to pole, in perpetual twilight was inhabitable: The Eventide Steppes. Millennia ago, Admiral Lok had managed to somehow place the Luminous Dawn Settlement Fleet inside this narrow habitable zone on the northern hemisphere.\nDubbing the world LokDown, the peoples of the Luminous Dawn Fleet set about finding a means of surviving their new, brutal home. The ships that had ferried them for millennia were damaged beyond repair, and the precious fuel sources needed to propel them, completely spent. While able to support life in several forms, LokDown proved to be as hostile a life-sustaining world as any on record. The atmosphere was breathable, if barely. The wildlife was savage, and on par with the bio-engineered attack creatures bred for war in the Old Empire. The native peoples found on LokDown, while not necessarily hostile, were of little assistance, nearly impossible to track, and the closest translation they could work out of their name was Daemon.\nWorst of all, a thronging creature, later named murk swarms, moved in great grey masses across the Eventide Vale devouring everything, even the hulls of their colony ships. Without a means of adapting, the survivors of the crash would soon be left perpetually exposed to the harsh environment until they were devoured, one way or another.\n\nThe Adaptions\nEach ship had different specialties, and among the migrants were some of the greatest adaptive scientists in existence. In a desperate attempt to survive LokDown, the research teams set about devising means to adapt their peoples' bodies into something more viable with their new home. While most attempts failed, some with brutal outcomes, four methods of survival were invented, allowing the peoples of Luminous Dawn to live, if not unchanged.\n\nThe Quantum Geologists of the fleet discovered means of strengthening their own bodies with the native elements of LokDown creating the Godai. The biogeneticists used DNA samples from the hearty creatures native to LokDown to create the Shastra, near perfect hybrids of sapient and beast. Several of the engineers managed to adapt technology traded from the Daemons to create the Xenotons, a bionic people of metal merged with flesh. The last team used tissue samples from the Daemons themselves to create genetic hybrids, known as the Bloodbourne; fiendish looking people in appearance but not of heart.\nWhere We Stand Now\nAble to survive LokDown, but unable to leave, the four peoples of LokDown set about the most arduous part of their task: Making this new world into a home. Generations passed which had never seen a star, but the stories of the endless voids, filled with long lost peoples, never faded from the hearts and dreams of their souls. \n\n\nThe Setting\nLokDown takes place in the Reknown-Galaxy, and is part of the Carbyne Jungle universe. Unlike most expansions however, LokDown is designed to also work as a Stand-Alone game. So if you are a fan of Carbyne Jungle, you can use all of these options with your current campaigns. If Carbyne Jungle is new to you, no worries. You can enjoy all of LokDown without needing any other book or materials.\nLokDown is built on the Tri-Forge Engine, the same game system as Carbyne Jungle, an exciting action filled experience with customizable rulesets, and incredibly flexible advancement. With the Tri-Forge Engine, you can customize the rules to fit your table and use the simplified ruleset of Flip&Fight to introduce new players, all without slowing down your game. \nLokdown is designed to be a stand-alone game, but it can also work with Carbyne Jungle. So, you can use your LokDown characters in your Carbyne Jungle campaigns or Vice Versa.\nAnd if you have never tried Carbyne Jungle (or our Carbyne Jungle Mission Decks which are just absolutely amazing), we have good news! You can add those onto any Kickstarter order!\nWhat kind of setting is LokDown?\nLokDown is an Anime-Inspired Sci-Fantasy setting, meaning it has elements of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and a whole lot of goodies drawn straight from some of your favorite Anime/Manga series. We choose Sci-Fantasy because it has the most options. With a Sci-Fantasy setting, there is no limit on what you can create or who you can be.\nAt the same time, we know many players prefer a specific era or tech level to their games, so LokDown will also come with tools for running games in Classic Fantasy, Modern, or Straight Sci-Fi (no magic) settings. On top of that, we have optional rulesets for tables that want to emphasize a Shonen, Mecha, Cyberpunk Noir, or Cosmic Horror feel to their game. \nShort Version: You can run whatever you want, and we will give you the tools to make it fun.\n We Have Funded!!!\nWe've hit our goal, but we are not done! We still are reaching towards our stretch goals! In them, we will expand the premade campaign with the game and add in some special goodies: Our first is the Kaiju Invasion! With this comes a Mission Deck where parties will use special gear and tactics to try to stop the Kaiju attacking the Eventide Steppes. With the Mission Deck, every Kaiju will be a different random monster that provides a new challenge every time!\n\nWhat Will Be Added to the Early Edition?\nPlenty! While the Free Early Edition you can download above has some amazing stuff, the final release will have a ton more content. For starters, there will be 2 full books: A Player's Guide and a GM's Guide. There will be more lore, character options, monsters, setting details, and a full campaign. The final version will also have the Flip&Fight ruleset: a streamlined system designed for new players with simplified rules. Flip&Fight is designed to be played alongside the standard rulesets so new players can jump into a game with experienced players, enjoy the fun, and not feel overwhelmed.\nThat's right! You can get your favorite character into the LokDown Core Rulebooks! Choose the Shapeshifter package and on top of getting digital copies of all the stuff, you also get to create an NPC for the game! Take your favorite PC (or just a character idea that you like), and we will work with you on adding it to LokDown. Not only that, but that NPC will play a part in the campaign built for the LokDown GM's Guide. \nThe standard Shapeshifter package comes with digital copies of all books, but with Kickstarter's new Add-On feature, you can add physical copies of whatever books you want to go with it!\nNow, you can customize every Backer Package with Add-Ons! Once you click on the reward you want, you can customizing it by adding more copies of books or other related products such as the Carbyne Jungle Core Rulebook or the Haedus 8B Mission Decks which all work with LokDown!\n Shipping to unlisted countries\nWe will ship to any country in the world. To avoid over charging for shipping (and listing 110 nations on each option), we listed the most common countries we have received orders from previously. If you're country is not listed, shoot us a message and which packages you are thinking about, and we will setup the shipping prices for you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 3rd Kickstarter now, and we have delivered both previous projects on time despite one taking place in 2020 (gestures at everything).

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world.

This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address.

It's still the same great mechanics you've loved for over 10 years, now in a special, limited edition that includes all new art, plastic Walls and Towers for the Castle, plastic Monster minis that feature a unique spinning base to track damage, wooden Monster tokens, and more!\nCastle Panic is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players where everyone is working together to defend the castle from monsters coming in from the forest. The players must make it through all 49 Monster tokens and have at least 1 tower still standing in order to win the game. If the monsters destroy all 6 towers, the game ends and the monsters win.\n Castle Panic Deluxe takes everything you love about the standard version of Castle Panic and makes it, well, deluxe! \nAll minis figures come assembled but will need their damage bases attached. Don't worry, this is a snap! All plastics will come unpainted, ready for your painterly goodness! \n*Note: All images not final and not to scale. All components and upgrades subject to change.\nThis pledge level is only available to verified game stores. Verification will require detailed store information including EIN number. The verification process will be at the discretion of Fireside Games and the results will be final. When the campaign ends, you will have access to our pledge manager, where your pledge will be applied as a credit towards your order. Orders will be at a 50% discount and must be in case quantities (3 games per case). Your final order and payment will be determined when the game is ready to ship. Retail orders will be shipped at the same time as all other Kickstarter orders.\nShipping to be charged after the end of the campaign.\nPlease contact sales@firesidegames.com for more information. \nNOTE: The standard versions of the expansions will also be available as add-ons.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager which works like an online store where the amount you pledged is available as credit for you to spend as you wish. This is where you will provide your shipping information and can choose to add any additional products to your pledge.\nThere are 2 ways to pay for additional items. You can add products in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended and pay for the difference at that time, or you can pledge more during the campaign and spend that however you want in the pledge manager. Keep in mind, when you pledge more during the campaign, it helps unlock stretch goals!\n This game will be printed in enough volume to fulfill the Kickstarter plus a small amount to cover damages and other issues. We reserve the right to sell any remaining inventory on our website, at conventions, and 3rd party sites if necessary.\n In 2009, we launched our first game Castle Panic, a cooperative, tower defense board game. Over 10 years and hundreds of thousands of copies later, we're thrilled to bring you the ultimate edition of this evergreen family game.\nThe costs listed above are estimates only but are based on current pricing from our fulfillment partners using an estimated weight.  Actual shipping costs will be charged via our pledge manager.\nDue to complications with customs and regulations, we will not be shipping to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nFireside Games was started in 2007 by Justin and Anne-Marie De Witt. We decided to take our hobby of creating board games to play with our friends and turn it into a business. In 2009, Castle Panic became the first game we published and since then we've grown our catalog and published 18 other games. We founded Fireside Games with the core goal of creating fun, innovative, accessible board games that everyone can enjoy, and based on our growing fanbase, we're proud to say it's working.\nWe are committed to bringing joy and shared experiences to life through board games. We love hearing from people all over the world about how our games help them reconnect with friends and family, even in this hectic world. We\u2019re proud of the experiences we create, and we are thrilled when we can help you to bring fun home!\nCaste Panic Deluxe is a big project and a complex, expensive game. We've been selling games to Friendly Local Game Stores for over a decade, and we've seen the ups and downs of the 3-tier system (publisher, distribution, retail). We're in a challenging time right now, and selling games like this can be difficult to get right. Because this game is so costly to manufacture, there is a lot more risk if we were to publish this game through traditional means. A wrong guess on inventory could be devastating to a company of our size. We know that there are a lot of fans who have loved Castle Panic from the beginning, and we know that there will be new fans that are going to fall in love with this new version. The best way we can get a product of this scale into the hands of players who are excited to have it is to work directly with our customers via the Kickstarter platform.\n                                         This project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFireside Games has been publishing and distributing games around the world for over 10 years. During that time, we have worked with multiple factories and international freight companies to ensure our high-quality games are delivered on-time and in excellent condition. For this Kickstarter, we are working with experienced partners like Quartermaster Logistics to continue that pattern of quality.\n\nWe are estimating an April 2021 delivery date for this game, but please keep in mind this is only an estimate. There are always elements beyond our control when working with manufacturers, such as virus outbreaks, production delays, shipping delays, and delays with customs. Should these occur, we will make sure that we quickly communicate any delay or challenge and keep our backers updated.\n\nIn addition, the game has already gone through substantial production, which further limits chances for delays. The artwork is mostly complete, the plastics have been sculpted, and many components are at or near a print-ready state. Final layout, proofing, and editing still need to be done, but we are confident in our timing estimates.\n\nREFUNDS\nIf you request a refund within 14 days of the end of the campaign, we can refund your pledge including fees. Refunds processed after 14 days will still be credited, minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees, which we are not reimbursed for at that time. Refunds processed after 14 days may be refunded via PayPal or Stripe to the card used at our discretion.\n\nThis project is funded in USD and any refunds will also be processed in USD.\n\nAll artwork and materials shown are not final and are subject to change.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Fireside Games\n2 created \u00b7 14 backed\nFireside Games was founded in 2007 when we decided to take our hobby of creating board games and make it our livelihood.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger. So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components. Fortunately, we've enlisted Tim Burrell-Saward and Andrew Sung, both with significant experience on these types of projects, to assist us in overseeing the manufacturing process.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense. It's a major checkpoint, where you're likely to run into issues that need addressing.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically.

Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

Car Wars returns in a bigger, faster edition. The detailed 1/64 scale cars move, shoot, and catch fire the way you remember, with faster car creation and play. Once again you can rule the roads!\nNOTE: All miniatures are pre-assembled at the factory and packed unpainted. Miniatures shown in the photos are prototypes. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. \nForeground: Warhawk, one of the six miniatures included in the Car Wars Sixth Edition core game. Miniatures painted by Ben Williams. Displayed on Car Wars Playmat #1. All work shown is in progress and not final.\nNorth America, A.D. 2070. It's a new American frontier. The collapse of the U.S. government plunged the country back into the good old days -- days of wilderness lawlessness, banditry, regional dictators, and of the men and women who combat them. Modern-day knights and gunslingers are in demand; but the automobile has replaced the horse, and the machine-gun and recoilless rifle have made the sword and Winchester obsolete.\nWelcome to 2070. It's a rough world, but it's the only one around . . . \nCar Wars is the game of autoduelling; futuristic vehicular combat where the right of way goes to the biggest guns. Players design their cars -- complete with weapons, accessories, and crew -- and then take them into the arena where one emerges victorious . . . and the others are annihilated.\nFirst published in 1981, the earlier editions of Car Wars have sold over one million games and accessories during the game's near-four decades of life. Over the years, the Car Wars game -- as well as the world of Autoduel America -- has grown, adding more rules, expansions, and setting information. Car Wars has been featured in comic books, novels, solo adventure gamebooks, and even the fan-favorite classic Autoduel video game. \nNow, with your support, we're bringing Car Wars back as a faster, streamlined edition with detailed plastic models. The new Car Wars game was designed to put you in the driver's seat and into the action within moments of opening the game box.\nAfter six years of design, development, playtesting, and constant refinement and improvement, we've completed the core of the new Car Wars Sixth Edition game and we're now ready for your support. \nThe new core game includes:\n24-page rulebook, covering everything from building your car to movement and combat. All of the rules you need to start playing the game within moments of opening the box! \nTEN (stretch goal unlocked!) 1/64 scale highly-detailed plastic car models. Pre-assembled at the factory, these miniatures are ready to paint and take into the arena. Or, for those of you who want to jump into the action quickly, use the minis unpainted; the included car bases are color-coded so that you can instantly tell which car is yours during the heat of battle. \nFour color-coded player dashboards. These thick, durable chipboard player boards include spaces for your car's external armor, tire points, power plant points, as well as your car's current speed.\nFour car design decks, one for each of the included player colors. Using the Build Point and Crew Point mechanics, you can create a new car (and outfit your driver and gunner) in less than ten minutes! \nTwo different internal damage card decks, one for low-point value games and one for high-point value games. Once armor is penetrated, a card is randomly drawn to determine which internal components are hit by an attack.\nTwenty custom six-sided dice! These are used for all attack rolls, defensive rolls, and movement rolls in the game. \nA chipboard turning key. Use this when moving and maneuvering your car. The turning key works perfectly with the color-coded car bases; your car pivots over the turning key so that every swerve and turn made during the game is as accurate as possible. (Includes two copies of the key.)\nDozens of damage, control, Ace, and other types of tokens that are required to track the status of various parts of the game. \nA streamlined collision system that keeps the game flowing. See how the bases are used to push objects in a collision in this Facebook video. \nPlay on any smooth tabletop . . . or upgrade your game with one of the Car Wars playmats (see Add-Ons, below). The basic arena is a 36\" x 36\" playspace; scenarios expand play to even larger spaces for those of you who want to play a highway game, fight in a big arena, or tackle a custom scenario of your own design.\nDo you want to see Car Wars Sixth Edition in action?

There are a few minor issues, but nothing that we cannot address during the manufacturing process.\n\nOnce the factory opens, we'll officially shift the project into the production stage. There will still be a number of checks (photos and video, so we can confirm that those minor issues are handled). We will not skip steps during this process or sign off on \"meh, that kinda works\" components. We get one chance to do this right, and we are going to do what it takes to make the game (and all of the expansions) the best we can manage. This means that although we are moving into production, we may find an item or two that requires another round of tweaks during manufacturing.\n\nWe know the one question everyone is asking comes down to: When will I get my game? We cannot answer that question until the factory opens and together we can nail down a final production schedule. One of the biggest risks of a Kickstarter campaign -- especially one of this size -- is that everyone gets to see the behind-the-scenes delays and issues that can plague a project. We don't assign a release date for many of our games until everything is at print (and often not until we have the tooling complete). This makes it easier to hit release dates, but even that has been a major challenge over the last year as the global pandemic disrupts everything.\n\nWe'll be back with a new update in early March after the factory opens and we work out a tentative production timeline. Once we have a production schedule, then we can start to plan a shipping schedule, but even that will be subject to the issues that are delaying shipping containers.

But it appears that a mistake was made and material was changed during material changeover in the machines at the factory, affecting some of the games produced. We have already looked into the possibility of reprinting the cards, but this would be a time-consuming process and we would rather address this issue immediately. Because we pride ourselves on making components of the highest quality, we would like to rectify this situation by offering card sleeves.

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\n\nUse this link to access the Pledge Manager for Backer Rewards and Late Pledges! \nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. This Kickstarter features Barricades Mode designed by Bryan Reese - rules and components for Solo & CoOp play, plus Quest 6: What Lies Beneath. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter (but no new content), To The Barricades! which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion + Barricades! which combines both into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes the Champion Reward, To the Barricades, 6 packs of Premium Sleeves, the Epic Thunderstone Add-on for Champion, and the Neoprene Mat.\nNote for Expedited Backers: You can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Champion Expedited. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. We will ensure that every Expedited Backer who wants this Add-on will be able to get it regardless of the quantity ordered by other backers.\n\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your Champion Expedited.\n\nNote for All other Backers (including $1 Backers): You will be able to upgrade your Reward in the Pledge Manager to Your Inventory Is Full! at the same price listed in this Kickstarter. QUANTITIES MAY BE LIMITED, so to guarantee that you get this Reward, select it now!\nAll Quests, including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath, and the Stretch Goals from this campaign, can be played in either Barricades Mode or normal Competitive Mode.\nFollow the story of our Stretch Goals through Kickstarter Updates!\nThe Backers of this campaign successfully unlocked all the contents of Quest 7: Frostbite(*)! Quest 7 will join Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in the To The Barricades! portion of the Rewards for this Kickstarter.\nThe Premium To the Barricades Box!\n(This packaging is for illustration purposes only. Actual box will differ in graphics and dimensions.)\nWith the completion of this Kickstarter the Thunderstone Quest product line will be quite large. 7 Quests, support for 6 players, and all the components of Barricades Mode, 8 plastic figures, plus Epic Thunderstone support and the Neoprene Mat.\nPlayers who sleeve their cards will have filled the original Champions box. Therefore the To the Barricades box is being engineered to complement the Champion box.\nIn addition, we\u2019re designing a plastic vac-formed tray that you can use to organize the various tokens and chits as you play. You can store those things in the tray in the box, and when it\u2019s time to play you can remove the tray and put it on the table! The tray will be designed to accommodate all the various tokens & chits included in Champion + Barricades and a little bit of future proofing as well!\nCurrently we envision a box with the same dimensions as the Champion box. The two boxes will be graphically designed to compliment each other on your shelf.\nWe believe that when you sleeve all cards including Epic the two boxes together will have room for one or two additional Quests beyond Quest 7, although the storage of the Neoprene Playmat Add-on will affect how many cards can be stored in the boxes.\nWe expect to provide a suggested setup for managing all the cards and components across the two boxes when To the Barricades is delivered. Some people will prefer to organize their cards alphabetically by type. Others will organize them by Quest. We will have suggested setups for both.\nThe To the Barricades! Box will be Kickstarter Exclusive!\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals are included in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory Is Full!, but are not included in the Champion reward.\nThe Champion, Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory is Full! rewards will include all the Kickstarter Exclusive Content from the 1st Kickstarter.\nKickstarter Exclusive content (\"KSE\") are game components and accessories that are available only to backers of AEG Kickstarters. Kickstarter Exclusive Content may be released in an alternate form more widely in the future (different art, different card titles, etc.).\nThunderstone is one of the most successful games AEG has ever published. The Kickstarter for Thunderstone Quest and delivery of those rewards to our backers has enabled us to continue to develop the game and expand its scope. \nThe major innovation for Thunderstone Quest is ... Quests! Each Quest consists of a selection of dungeon tiles and monster cards that create an engaging storyline. Each Quest includes rules for selecting Village and Dungeon cards to create a variety of Adventures. After you've mastered each Quest you use random setups of Quest cards to create new Dungeons and Villages - build your own Quests and Adventures!\nThe Champion Reward\nIncludes:\nReally Big Box that holds all Champion content (even sleeved!)\n5 Quests (each Quest includes approximately 245 cards and 6 Dungeon Tiles [except Ripples in Time which includes 4])\nOver 130 base game cards (starting cards, quest cards, treasure cards, wound cards, key cards, randomizers & dividers)\nWilderness tile\nVillage game board\n6 plastic Champion figures\n140 wood tokens\n5 six-sided dice\nRule book\nQuest book\nKickstarter exclusives & extras including The Yellow Knight card & meeple (googly eyes not included)\nBarricades Mode\nOne of the most requested features from the community was the ability to play the game solo or in a co-operative game. Our team has developed an extension to Thunderstone Quest called Barricades Mode to make that possible.\nIncludes:\n6 Guardian Boards\n[ In ongoing playtesting, Guardian Key cards were removed ]\n20 damage chits\n1 Damage chit bag\n2 Marketplace overlay boards\n8 Prestige Class boards\n30 Prestige tokens\n20 Guardian Dice (D12)\n1 Threat Level wooden token\n5 Barricade tokens\n2 Additional Player Packs (all components required for adding a 5th and 6th player to both Competitive Mode and Barricades Mode)\nQuest 6: What Lies Beneath\nWe area also presenting Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in this campaign. What Lies Beneath is designed to work with Barricades Mode to create a seamless storytelling experience. What Lies Beneath can be played in normal competitive mode too. All of the other Quests will be compatible with Barricades Mode.\nIncludes:\nApproximately 245 cards\n6 Dungeon tiles\nRulebook\nEpic Thunderstone support cards\nFull color storage box (will also hold components from Barricades Mode)\nThunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon is on Kickstarter so that we can bring all our current backers the content they've asked for quickly, and to create an opportunity for new backers to join the adventure and get access to all the Kickstarter Exclusive content from the first campaign.\nThe Stretch Goals in this campaign will be included in the To The Barricades! reward, and the Champion + Barricades!, and the Your Inventory Is Full! reward, but not the Champion reward.\n\n(*) Quest 7: Frostbite is a working title and is subject to change.\nThe rules for Thunderstone Quest are available for download on the Thunderstone page at alderac.com. \nUpdate 15AUG:  We have produced a special Print & Play package for Barricades Mode that you can download and assemble at home. This is version 2.2 of the Barricades Mode system! If you own Thunderstone Quest, you'll be able to play Barricades Mode with this Print & Play!\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nThis new version of Thunderstone enhances the Dungeon mechanic introduced in classic Thunderstone. In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an Adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.\nThunderstone Quest uses a lot of the rules from previous versions of Thunderstone but the cards from previous versions are not compatible.\nThe heroes must travel through time and into the arctic waste in search of a legendary artifact of great power. Follow along as their story unfolds with each new Stretch Goal!\nEpic Thunderstone: \nOur 1st Add-On is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion and Champion + Barricades! Reward. If you backed the first Kickstarter and are backing this Kickstarter at the To the Barricades! level you can also order this Add-on.\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll new content (including Stretch Goals) in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play created by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook.\nThis Add-On is a pre-built Epic Thunderstone deck ready for play. You won't have to subtract cards from your main play set to play Epic Thunderstone.\nYou'll need a full copy of Thunderstone Quest to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the main game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern.\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within the To the Barricades box for this Kickstarter, rolled up. The length will be between 295 and 300 mm. The width is still undetermined; the graphics team will be redesigning the Village layout to accommodate the new size after the Kickstarter but the total will be smaller than the current Village board.\nPremium Sleeves\nOur 2nd Add-On are packs of Premium Sleeves. These Sleeves use the same plastic we used in the Mystic Vale sleeves.\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 1 more pack to sleeve the new content in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades!.\nThe Champion box holds all the Champion content, plus the Epic Add-on cards sleeved. You will need to store future Quests (including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath and the stretch goals from this campaign) in their own boxes if you wish to sleeve them.\nAdventurer Catch-Up Kit\nOur third Add-on is a way for people who purchased the Adventurer Reward in the first Kickstarter to get the Quests that they did not purchase in the first campaign. It consists of Quest 3: Risen from the Mire, and Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World. The Quests will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the To The Barricades! pledge level to order this Add-on (all this content is included in the Champion and Champion + Barricades! rewards.)\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected the Champion+Barricades (Expedited US Only) reward you will receive your Champion box in an expedited early shipment soon after the campaign ends. We have 1,000 units of Champion in our warehouse in the US so we will be able to send the Champion part of your Reward on an expedited timeline. We believe we can have them delivered 6 to 8 weeks after the close of the campaign. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nBecause this inventory is already in the United States the cost, customs issues, and complexity of shipping to non-US addresses prohibit us from delivering the expedited portion of the Reward outside the United States.\nThe cost to ship the Champion Reward for expedited delivery will be borne by AEG. Backers at this level will pay for shipping & handling for the rest of the Reward normally based on weight, and the rest of the Reward will ship at the same time as fulfillment of all other Reward content for this Kickstarter in 2019.\n\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! (including Stretch Goals) without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. \nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! at 23lbs/12kg.\nUSA:$23 \nCANADA: $40 \nEUROPE: $27 to Germany. $39 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nLATIN AMERICA: $80 to most countries. \nASIA: $33 to China and Hong Kong. $62 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $45 to Australia. $75 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $80\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping To The Barricades!

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nTo participate in the Kick It Here program for Thunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon please email kickstarter@alderac.com with the name of your store, the URL of your store's website, and your store's physical address. We will reply with details about the Kick It Here Promotion.\nParticipating retailers agree not to sell Thunderstone Quest product received through this promotion on the internet.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to - stores will pay actual Shipping & Handling for delivery just like regular backers.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nBenjamin Sheedy, voice work for the main campaign video", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your Reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.
