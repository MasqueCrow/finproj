We have been awarded the prestigious CES Design & Engineering Honors by the Consumer Electronic Association not once but twice, both for storage products. This is our 2nd Kickstarter project. Our first Kickstarter project, CloudFTP, also a storage product, was the 3rd highest funded Kickstarter technology project when funding ended and named by Stuff Magazine as one of the \u201c10 best Kickstarter technology projects\u201d. We are also the technology provider for another successful Kickstarter project called CameraMator.\nDaniel Chin is the Founder of Sanho Corporation. An electrical engineer by training, Daniel has a hand in all of Sanho's products which include: HyperDrive \u2013 Portable digital data storage products for Apple devices, digital cameras, memory cards HyperJuice \u2013 External batteries for Apple MacBook, iPhone, iPad, iPod, USB products HyperShield \u2013 Cases and stylus pens for Apple devices HyperThin \u2013 World thinnest HDMI cables HyperShop \u2013 Official Online store A serial entrepreneur, Daniel also founded another company EastGear.com in Singapore, where he was born, He came over to the U.S. in 2005 and currently resides in San Francisco Bay Area, California with his wife and 2 young kids.\nValerie Chong is the COO of Sanho Corporation. An mechanical engineer by training, Valerie oversees production and operations of the company.\nThe Design\nPrototype A: How nice would it be to be able to simply connect a USB flash drive into the iPhone or iPad to transfer data without going through iTunes, the computer or the Internet? That was how the idea for iStick was born, back in 2011. The first prototype was rather rudimentary. It was basically sticking a 30-pin connector (the original iPhone/iPad connector) at the other end of a USB stick. It was promptly rejected by Apple because the design was ambiguous as there is a possibility that the user might use the product like a cable and connect both ends at the same time, giving unpredictable results.\nPrototype B: A sliding switch was added to the design to allow only one connector (either USB or 30-pin) to be exposed at any time, preventing wrong usage. Certification with Apple would continue for 2 more years.\nPrototype C: The old 30-pin connector is replaced with the new Lightning connector to become the current design and we finally obtain Apple MFi certification for the iStick in 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is without their risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Kickstarter. We are also no strangers to Apple accessories, storage products or even Kickstarter.\n\nWe have been working on the iStick for about 3 years and have since built many stable prototypes and a fully functional universal iOS app. We recently just got Apple's approval to use the Lightning connector on this product and to list the iStick app on the Apple App Store. The iStick is now MFi certified to work with the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.\n\nThe iStick that you see in the above videos are real, working prototypes with an actual fully functional iOS app.\n\nWith your support, we can bring iStick to iDevice users worldwide. We are ready to enter mass production and your contribution will help to fund:\n\n- Mass production tooling \n- Large component order\n\nWe are confident of meeting (if not beating) our August 2014 ship date. Our previous \"CloudFTP\" Kickstarter project was featured by CNN Money as one of the few Kickstarter projects that actually ship on time.\n\nWe have sufficient components to manufacture about 10,000 units now. Beyond that, we may face long lead times especially for the components related to the Apple Lightning connector. Your strong support will give us the needed affirmation to place a larger component order and start mass production earlier.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "Get 25% OFF NEW USB-C Power Hub for Nintendo Switch & More!", "update_content": "Our largest-ever Cyber Monday Sale with 30% off sitewide"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "Exclusive 50% OFF offer just for our backers!", "update_content": "Our largest-ever Black Friday Sale with 30% off sitewide"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #84", "update_userinfo": "Last Day!

The one thing it definitely isn't is a play in which Poly Bunker Sings. In fact, Poly Bunker isn't even in the play. \nABOUT THE SHOW\nThe play consists of three short vignettes. The first gives us a glimpse into the lives of four people who live together in a polyamorous household, and experience all the pleasure and (mostly) pain that comes along with it. That's Poly.\nThe second vignette explores what happens when we lock two people in a bunker with little to do but \"get to know\" each other. If Rod Serling and Harold Pinter had a baby, we hope it would look something like Bunker.\nFinally, a wide-eyed hillbilly from Amite County, Mississippi sings her way through the mean streets of Los Angeles hoping to find her dreamboat, Tom Hanks. With original music composed and performed by Rana Rines as the innocent Darlene (pronounced Darlin') we wrap up the show with Sings.\nSo there you have it. Poly. Bunker. Sings.\nFor more info on polyamory, start with this article.\nWHY WE'RE HERE\nWe have the script (we wrote it). We have the actors (we hired \u2018em). We have the venue and four dates in June. What we need now is a little help to fund the show. The money we raise will help with many things, including marketing, prop acquisition, set pieces, and venue rental for rehearsals and performances. But MOST importantly - it will help us pay our actors, musicians and crew!\nRana Rines and David Harper, the creators of the show, would like to point out that they aren't paying themselves. Writing and producing and performing this show in the Hollywood Fringe Festival will pay us in one of life's most valuable currencies - joy. But paying the people who work long and hard to help us put this show on its feet is important to us, and you can help make that happen.\nDISCLAIMER - YAY!\nAnd now for the part at the end of the commercial where we show tiny print and talk really fast: None of the perks include transportation to or from Los Angeles.

We have come to Kickstarter to get your help getting our film made as our film is gaining momentum. We are a Bay Area production looking to do something epic, ambitious, foolhardy, and above our pay grade as we navigate the indie film world with this piece of material.\nSYNOPSIS\nWhy tell when we can show?\nPlot: Joel Carrero, late 20's/early 30's, is newly-wed to Sabrina, a former model with a sweet heart. Victims of a troubled economy, they do all they can to make ends meet and find some place in the world. Joel works with his best friend, Eric, at a job he hates with a hardass for a boss, Frank.\nThat job, of course, being a professional hit man. \nOne day, Frank asks an unusual favor: beat up, interrogate, and disappear a cop who's been blackmailing them. Joel is reluctant but agrees to the plan. However, Joel gets more than he bargained for when he meets the cop, Mitchell. Secrets are learned that threaten to take down everything that Joel has built but Frank won't let him just walk away. In retaliation for not doing his job, Sabrina is KIDNAPPED and Joel beaten down. He gets away but what else is there to do but revenge?\nORIGINS\nBack in May 2012, I came across a contest sponsored by Linkin Park via www.genero.tv where you do a music video for their song \"Burn It Down.\" The winner gets prizes and I decided to jump headfirst into the project. I decided to craft a storyline about Joel and his life as a hit man and the revenge that follows after his wife is kidnapped.\nAfter a whirlwind 2 day shoot, we had some amazing footage and worked on it right till the last minute of the deadline.\nThe video didn't win the contest but got me such a big reaction from friends, collaborators, and new associates that it wasn't something I could just ignore. 3 months later, I decided to start writing a feature length version of the music video and see where it goes. I started getting more and more into it as it started to resemble the types of movies I loved growing up. Looking to finally break into doing feature films after years doing music videos and shorts, I decided to make it my debut film.\nAll told, it was a music video entry that ultimately didn't win but became the perfect proof that I could pull off a movie like this. Lemons into lemonade!\nTHEMES\nConceptual character poster\n\"WAR PATH\" is a film about choices. Secrets. Cause and Effect, the consequences of every action you take and how it impacts the ones you love. It's a film about the economy and how it doesn't just affect \"civilized\" people. Even more than the rest, it's a film about flawed people trying to find their place in the world and escape the shackles of their lot in life.\nTONE\nGrowing up, I (Casey de Fremery) adored gangster and crime films. Goodfellas, The Godfather, Mean Streets, Narc, the movies about guys who made their way by force and not conforming to how society functions. They were on the fringes but they were vicious and the consequences of their actions always left a mark on me, showing that crime doesn't pay.\nEven so, I am not approaching this as my attempt to ape Scorsese or tell an Italian Mafia story. I want to make a story that isn't about an ethnic crime syndicate, this is an island of misfit toys. There are brutes who are ruthlessly effective and trainees who basically answered the job ad. They're in an industry that is dying (no pun intended) due to RICO and the crippling effect of the FBI and are trying to make ends meet.\nThe aim is to make a gritty crime drama but with humor, drama, a bit of action, a fast pace, and to get you thinking when it's over. My aim is to make a movie for the audience by a guy whose been in those same seats before.\nSimplified: Breaking Bad meets Killing Them Softly and has a baby with a middle name of Cormac MacCarthy.\nTHE CAST\nYou can't make it without the actors. I wanted to put the network of actors I've collected over the years to good use while also including fresh faces. The material has attracted some of the best talent I've seen in the Bay and we've only just started some of the big casting.\nGARY NEIL (Our Happy Apocalypse) as JOEL CARRERO\nThe main character of the film. He's a talented man in a business of death but trying to find his place in the world now that he's married. He is selfish and tries to hide the true extent of what he does to the outside world but doesn't want it to be his legacy.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3603702/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\nERIK SUNDQUIST (Criminal Minds) as ERIC DALEY\nOne of the lead roles in the film. Eric has been a longtime best friend of Joel and under his father Frank, runs one of Frank's criminal enterprises: hits and extortion. He's got a short temper, he's naturally competitive, and will be the first to hit on your girlfriend but he has a good heart. Unlike the majority of his employees, he actually loves his job and that leaves a lot of very unfortunate victims.\nLIZ CLARE as SABRINA CARRERO\nJoel's wife Sabrina, a former model Joel met at a bar randomly one night. Like Joel, she's a girl trying to find her place in the world despite there being no clear. She knows her husband is up to no good but she's a woman with secrets of her own and everything collides!\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3577579/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\n LISSA KEIGWINN as ELENA\nAn old flame of Joel from life before Sabrina, Elena was previously another killer in the employ of Frank Daley. She was cast out once her relationship was made public and true to form, the boy's club sided with Joel. Things deteriorated between her and Joel but she makes her living selling guns and other weapons of war. Tough but vulnerable, she wants out but things never go according to plan.\n MICHAEL UIMARI as FRANK DALEY\nFrank is Joel's boss/agent, who runs the overall business and handles the client side of the syndicate. Short tempered, gruff, and to the point, he has high ambitions to retire on a high note but leaves the hit man side of the business to his son, Eric. \nCOLE PANTHER (Absolution) as MITCHELL\nA detective with the local police, Mitchell is one of the few actively assigned to take down Frank's criminal syndicate. That alone could make a career but Mitchell's not in it for the glory. More than just about anyone else, he's playing the long game and poses just as much a threat as anyone in Frank's employ.\nDIXON SCOTT PHILLIPS (Hero Punk) as BENOIT\nAn old associate of Frank, Benoit is a domesticated middle man in a high power law firm. A gambler and routine customer to Frank's debt collection business, he's always on time and prompt. To Frank, he's a gateway to a lucrative contract for higher paying work. To Benoit, Frank's his main connection to his past life and a source for the dirty work of his employers.\nJEREMY JONES (Hero Punk, 8: The Movie) as IVAN \nIvan is the de facto bodyguard to Frank and never needs a command repeated when it's time to protect his boss. \n JOHNNY GILLIGAN as ABBOT\nAbbot is an elite criminal within Frank's employ but puts on his best poker face whenever around social situations. He's calm and collected, follows orders, but is always willing to listen to the highest bidder. A true wild card.\nCARL SCHREIBER as DENNIS\nDennis is a relatively new boyfriend for Elena, seen as a rebound by everyone but himself. In a film full of psychos, criminals, and sociopaths, Dennis is one of the more straight-laced guys out there. A banker by day with indoor hobbies, he's one of the few who's shocked at discovering who Elena knows and what she's capable of...\nDAWAYNE JORDAN (Fruitvale Station) as WESLEY\nIn a film full of crazed and skilled hit men, Wesley is more along the lines of the new frat guy, the pledge, who's trying to prove himself and show his superiors what he's made of. But going from 'newbie who is constantly hazed and exploited' to 'respected employee' comes at its own cost.\nMYLES WEBER as OWEN\nOwen is being portrayed by Myles Weber, noted Buzzfeed writer, actor, and stand-up comedian. Owen is the head of security at the syndicate but can just as easily be found surfing youtube when the others aren't looking. He got into this due to loving the crime films of his youth but this isn't a job for the meek.\nCREW\nCasey de Fremery (Writer/Director)\n\"Welcome to Jurassic Park.\" \nAfter that immortal line from Jurassic Park, Casey de Fremery came to the realization of what he wanted to do with his life. Born from a carpenter father and a truck driver mother, films became the highpoint of any week he was able to see them. From seeing his first film Jurassic Parkonward, he delved into any screenwriting or director book he could find and started his career in high school at the birth of the DV camera movement in 2003. Friends and relatives became actors and crew as he continued learning his craft through trial and error. After a number of years, he began to rise up the ranks with standout music videos and developing his own award-winning short films. His work includes elements of comedy, dark satire, and occasion tragedy, never staying within one genre or style of filmmaking. 7-9 years total working in the film business and \"War Path\" is his feature length debut!\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3621260/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 \nFerguson Sauve-Rogan (Cinematographer)\nCasey's partner in crime on this adventure, Ferguson is an accomplished filmmaker himself. A graduate of SF State, he works on a variety of commercials, music videos, short/feature films, and other ventures. He was also the writer/director of the feature film \"Return to Nowhere\" and director of \"Writer's Cramp.\"\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3864413/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\nChloe Tokuno (Producer)\n\"War Path\" isn't just a boy's club! Chloe is our very talented uber producer hard at work making this film a reality! In her own words:\nIn 2003, after graduating high school, Chlo\u00e9 followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps and began modeling for prestigious clients such as Sacs Fifth Avenue and Nike. While continuing her education with a degree in English Literature, she found a love for the runway, walking for Oscar de la Renta, Zac Posen, and Carolina Herrera, among other courtier designers. Chlo\u00e9\u2019s modeling career took her from San Francisco to Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. Working with top Photographers and Directors gave her a deep appreciation of advertisings production side. Eventually Chlo\u00e9 began producing still and motion shoots for Monkey and Snake Advertising and Big Buddha Productions. Word traveled of Chlo\u00e9\u2019s capabilities behind the camera. She has produced fashion, medical and utility campaigns for television, radio and internet. Chlo\u00e9 has supervised and co-produced print and motion advertising campaigns in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Poland and Korea. Beside producing commercials, small documentaries and music videos, Chlo\u00e9 is also media planning, media buying and Ad Directing for still and motion. Chlo\u00e9 has also co-published a sold out, limited edition fine art book set, printed in Germany by Cantz Printing for her Japan based client, MIKI Foods of Japan. Currently, Chlo\u00e9 is Executive Producer of a San Francisco based full length feature film.\nDANIEL KAUTZ (GAFFER)\nDaniel Kautz Isaac is a graduate from SF State who specializes in a number of film production roles, some ranging from gaffing, gripping and even the mocking of star wars prequels. Daniel Kautz has worked on 5 feature films including Star Trek Renegades, Return to Nowhere and Prep School. He is currently now in the process of finishing his own short sci-fi epic titled Jalopy.\nhttp://kickingitforward.org\n'The Epilogue'\nWhile the movie was being written, I took the opportunity (given by Syndicate Studios) to craft a short film supporting the film, titled \"The Epilogue.\"\nPlot: Joel Carrero wakes up, bloody and dazed, in the middle of a giant desolate landscape. A mysterious TV advertises that he's in Heaven but how could this be? Is this a dream? Is he dead? And why can't he remember how he got there?\nThis is a very personal film for me and deals with a number of heavy topics. The film utilizes the same characters from the music video and takes place after the feature film. The trailer is embedded so check it out! But keep in mind that just because Joel and Sabrina Carrero play a big part in the short, this by no means implies they survive War Path. Not by a long shot\u2026\nThe Epilogue is currently in submission for various film festivals and premiered at the San Jose Short Film Festival in October. It was an Audience Favorite and got great responses at the various screenings that took place.\nSo Why Kickstarter?\nKickstarter has become a valuable resource for filmmakers to reach their audience, draw attention to their work, and get projects made that might've otherwise stayed as a pipe dream. As the cliche goes, it takes a village to raise a child and movies are no different in that regard. I wrote the script and will see it to every stage of production but I'm just one person and need a talented cast/crew to fully realize the film. Less movies than ever are being produced and the ones that do tend to belong to billion dollar toy franchises. Making something different isn't always possible but Kickstarter provides a gateway.\nWe are asking for your help with this film but feel so confident in it that what you get for donating will feel like a great cause. We are a fully independent crew that is trying to make something with a great story, engaging characters, and leave you feel like you went through an experience.\nTHE KICKER\nThe kicker is that we must raise the amount in our campaign cycle or else we don't get a dime, endangering the production. It's all or nothing so we want to do all we can to make this a reality!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe film is one we are looking to have as $30,000 (or more. More is good) and have raised about $18,000 thus far. We've been budgeting and have a way of doing it for that budget for production and starting it up for post production. We are a lean and pragmatic production with much of the script written based on locations we can get, props we can get for low or no budget, and nothing that is impossible.\nWe are scheduled for a 20 day shoot but getting more than our target goal will allow us to get more shooting days, get additional gear rentals, help with additional post production costs, and brace us for any left-field emergencies. There are inescapable costs like food for the cast/crew, gear, gas money for the cast/crew, and certain locations. We run a tight ship and we've had dozens of years combined of running low/no budget shoots but not making them feel like their budget. \nREWARDS\nYAY! You've donated! Charity is awesome but we want to give you a lot for your money no matter what tier you're at for more than just the film. On the right side of this screen is a list of rewards based on how much you donate and the perks of each one. We are a very open group so going as low as $1 grants you access into the production and can follow the progress as we go. One night, I might get the urge to post a clip from the film but only the backers would have the private link to watch what we've put together.\nIf you go higher up the chain, DVD's, blu rays, and all sorts of ways we want to give back are found. A copy of the film is a given but you can be onboard first hand as a War Path-ian as production and post production continue on for the next year and a half. We have some very unique awards on hand that can't be bought after or replicated, ways to contribute that can find their way into the film beyond just a credit card charge. \nNOTE: Every tier has its own designated letter assigned to it, i.e. A, J, M, etc. Each tier you donate at gets you all of the other perks below it as well. So if you donate $100, you will get the $100 prize, plus all the other tiers below it like the DVD, blu ray, shout outs, etc. Exceptions are the times when the quantity is limited.\nMISC VIDEO:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny independent film carries its own trials and tribulations. By its very nature, the budgets could always be better, the food could taste better, certain locations might try to get you for more money, etc. Pre-production is always tough and main production is always an uphill battle. Thankfully, everyone involved has gone through those trials before on other projects and lived to tell about it with amazing footage to show for it. I (Casey) have a favorite film I directed that had three main actors cancel the day before but made it work due to a lot of quick thinking and improvised methods. There's always trials but our collected experience will allow us to get through it.\n\nThe post production will be tricky and lengthy but is where the biggest magic happens. Once the film is done, there never are guarantees about the ultimate fate of it. We will be submitting for film festivals we have connections to, distributors we know, and utilizing a very active online campaign. No matter what happens though, our backers will get what they pay for and if it takes off, everyone can say they had a part in it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Digital link here and download to come!", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nSo it\u2019s been a minute and apologies for the radio silence over the last several months.

Wear is a high fidelity directional analog microphone that is significantly lower in price than existing hearing aids. This microphone can be used with any pair of headphones, has a volume control, is rechargeable, and comfortable to wear.\nred metal case\nlimited edition wood/metal case\nSurface mount Wear\nPLAY\n\nOur Development Process\nWe've been developing this technology in our Brooklyn Studio for the past two years.  Wear incorporates a low profile micro-miniature, patent pending, directional microphone technology that creates a 6 foot zone which captures, focuses and clarifies conversations in noisy environments, while reducing the effects of extraneous noise. \nLatency (delay) imposed by digital signal processing is detrimental to the hearing impaired due to lip sync (lip reading) difficulties. For that reason we used an analog circuit design with no measurable latency. We incorporate a technology using a beam-forming array of 10 microphones that create a circular 6 foot zone. Acoustic waves generated in that zone (coherent) reach the microphones at the same time so they are amplified. Sounds from further away (non coherent) reach the microphones at different times are not amplified. This creates a near field to far field signal level difference of 10 to 11 db. That 10 db level difference improves the intelligibility of near field conversation. Our research over the past two years has allowed us to reduce the size of beam forming arrays to unprecedented small form factors in a lightweight package using low power. All of this is done without digital signal processing while maintaining hi fidelity sound quality so that the directional microphone can also be used for general recording applications as well as an assistive hearing appliance.\nWear is not a replacement for a hearing aid.  Wear is designed to be used when an individual is interested in having a quality conversation in very noisy environments like family get togethers, restaurants or meetings. Wear can also be used as a commentators microphone eliminating the need to hold a microphone during an interview and other high quality audio recording applications.\nVersion 1 Through-hole Wear in an Altoids Tin\n Press releases:\nhttp://typewell.com/blog/posts/wear-it-s-at-typewell-transcriber-develops-new-assistive-device", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGuarantee\n\nDefective parts will be on us, but improper usage of Wear will not be covered.\n\nManufacturing plan\n\nWe will take 6 months to complete the engineering and design for the case of the microphone and charger.  We will source all the materials required for production and begin to make first run samples using vendors and production houses in the USA. We anticipate that all manufacturing will be in the USA.  \n\nTesting Plan\n\nWe are planning to use our already completed pre-production prototypes to conduct testing on individuals with various levels of hearing loss in order to fine tune the functionality and maximize performance of our directional microphone, Wear.\n\nFuture plans\n\nOnce the roll out of Wear is successful, we plan to identify, design and fabricate other low cost products to help people improve quality of life. We are currently developing our next version of the directional microphone.

That's right...if we meet our goal, this library will become free for all to use, absolutely royalty free!\nThe sound you hear in the main video was an actual recording of the suppressed firearm system you see in the video. It gives you an idea of just how great the real deal is even with not-so-great recording equipment. In 192kHz with a seven microphone setup and a high-quality field recorder these sound effects will be a dream! Interspersed throughout the page are pictures taken during the demo recording session.\nCheck out our interview on asoundeffect.com!\n *CORRECTION: The Tascam DR-680 only records 2 Channels in 192kHz, not 4 Channels.\nGreat Sound is a Great Opportunity\nSound is one of the most looked-over elements in independent film making. Sound can make or break the quality of a film. In particular, gunshot sound effects are often neglected for several reasons. First, when you aren't filming a real firearm, you can't record it. Second, you may live in a state or country where particular firearms are illegal or hard to legally obtain. It's also not convenient to acquire a safe range location, the proper safety equipment and all the gear and know-how necessary to record your own sounds. Lastly, the internet does not have much to offer when it comes to high fidelity recordings, let alone a variety of types and calibers with authentic mechanism sounds, and even the few quality libraries currently available are usually bundled and cost hundreds of dollars.\nMic Setup Take 2\nThere is one other sound which some might consider to be the holy grail of firearm sound effects. The suppressed gunshot. In essentially every single film big and small the sound of a suppressed firearm is completely fabricated. One reason is that most people have never heard a real suppressed firearm so the viewer has nothing to compare the sound in the film against. Another reason is that silencers are illegal for civilians to possess in several states, and in order to legally buy a silencer an individual must undergo an extensive background check, wait for paperwork to pass (sometimes as long as eight months to a year), and pay a $200 transfer tax in addition to the actual item which can cost between $400 and $2,000. Regardless of the reasons, authentic silencer sounds are not widely used, i.e. nonexistent, and we plan to change that. And let us tell you if you haven't watched the main video yet (SPOILER)...the real deal sounds incredible!\nRecording for Posterity\nUse it Like You Know it\nThere is another element to firearm sound effects: proper application. Home many times have you seen a film where the bad guy points his pistol at someone and you hear some sort of cocking sound, even if the weapon has no external hammer or safety (like a Glock)? Considering that not many people have ever used a silencer, or any kind of firearm for that matter, it is important to help people understand what it sounds like to operate, disassemble, and even hold a firearm. For a silencer, there is an entire process to prepping and using it, and everything matters, down to the type of ammunition you shoot through it. As an additional resource for this sound library we will also provide useful information and videos concerning the proper application of these sounds which will walk you through the process of assembling and using firearms in a realistic manner.\nFamiliarization and Safety Brief\nMade for Maximum Customization\nWhen it comes to creating an extensive collection of firearm sound recordings we don't want to stop with just high-enough quality recordings. We want these sounds to be used for anything and everything. Recording all our sound effects in 192kHz enables a whole range of flexibility for anyone wanting to time stretch, perform granular synthesis, or manipulate the sound in any other way. Also, when firing an unsupressed firearm the gunshot tends to be so loud that it is nearly impossible to isolate any of the more subtle sounds. With the two suppressed firearms at our disposal we can record the sound of a bullet traveling through the air and bullet impacts without the massive volume of the actual gunshot smothering these finer sounds.\nShooting Lanes and Downrange Setup Planning\nReward Details:\n$1 \u2013 And you get it all. All the sounds for all the guns. Think of this as more of a \"donate\" button.\nGoing beyond the funding goal means more recordings as listed farther down on the page!\nRecording the Marlin Model 1895. The Zooms had a really hard time with the volume on this one. Recording levels had to be turned way down.\nThe Firearms:\nThe following are the firearms we will be recording for this project. By recording, what exactly do we mean? Basically, if it is physically possible to make one of these guns create a sound by firing it or moving any of the working parts, we'll be recording it. Loading and unloading. Safeties. Triggers. Magazines. Slides. Every single click, scrape, and bang. For firearms such as the 1911, this means nearly fifty unique sound effects, not including gunshots.\nAdding a little oil makes quite a difference both visually and aurally.\nIf we greatly surpass our goal, we will even throw in some recordings of medieval weapons: the spear, the sword, the bow, and the crossbow. Note: the sound of medieval-style bolts and arrows flying through the air is absolutely wonderful. Another option is renting threaded barrels for various firearms already on the list in order to record them with the silencer attached.\nThe photographer abandons his camera and takes up a different kind of shooting.\nNow, back to our segment on using sounds. How does a filmmaker who has perhaps never use a firearm know how to utilize all these sounds (pistols such as the 1911 can produce up to fifty distinct sounds)? That's just another one of the many advantages we will offer you. We will be creating tutorial videos (as mentioned in the project video) that will sort of walk you through the way these guns function, the sounds they make, and more. Think of it as \"Using Guns and the Sounds They Make for Dummies.\"\n Click HERE to see an example of the sounds we will record of the Walther PPQ!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSound design:\n\nThe sound produced by a gunshot is very complex. The weapon's mechanism, the gases expelled from the muzzle and the receiver, the bullet passing through the air, the \"sonic crack,\" and impact all produce unique textures important to producing the right sound from the right perspective. One of the most significant sounds a firearm produces comes from the reverberation from the environment. This sound not only places the gunshot in a real space, but it tends to bleed into the other aspects of a gunshot, making them difficult to manipulate. One of our challenges is to isolate the different events of a gunshot so they can be customized to fit the needs of any project.\n\nObserving the law:\n\nWe have taken great care and will continue to be conscious of and abide by all laws concerning firearms in the state of Michigan. Silencers are 100% legal to own in most states, including ours, and the silencer we are using was acquired legally by one of the members of our team. All shooting and recording will be done on property which we have permission to use.\n\nSafe firearm practice:\n\nFor any project which uses firearms, safety is paramount. We will only record at locations designated for shooting and all project members have been firearms-educated and will practise safe firearm handling. Hearing protection is a must for unsuppressed firearms; being exposed to a single gunshot can cause permanent hearing damage. All those Hollywood movies which have everyone running around shooting short-barreled automatic weapons in the fully-automatic fire mode? The very next scene should be those tough guys sitting on the floor holding their ears and hollering at each other uselessly. In addition, eye protection is recommended when using semi-automatic suppressed firearms as particle, gas, and lubricant blowback is a possibility.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Our Final Update", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWith our presence on Facebook, Twitter, and our new Kickstarter campaign, we are sending you our final update for The Firearm Sound Library.

Thank you all so much! If you're in the San Francisco area, please join me in celebrating the completion of funding this evening!\nSee the collection as I scan it on Tumblr\nMore information at WalterKoessler.com\nI have a hundred page photo album with nearly a thousand photos my great-grandfather Walter Koessler took in World War I. It's in pristine condition, beautifully preserved by my family over the last hundred years in Southern California. They've even saved the negatives\u2013 untouched, crisp and unfaded \u2013and a box of stereographs from the war and the early 1900s.\nThis album is a real treasure. Trained as an architect and conscripted into the German Army directly from the classroom, Walter became an officer in the reserve artillery battalion and he took advantage of many unique opportunities to record his experience on film. He captured the haunting experience of building and living in the trenches, the sunlight pouring in through the broken windows of bombed churches, and the clouds through the wings of biplanes as an early aerial reconnaissance photographer. After moving to Los Angeles to work as an art director in films, Walter made this album. The story the book tells begins with a pack of young men playing at war and ends with their crushing realization of what war really means.\nThese photos have captivated me for nearly two years, even after paging through them hundreds of times. It's an unbelievable, rare and intimate story, a deep look into the first world war you can't find anywhere else.\nThe images deserve to be seen and appreciated in the context of their whole story. They're compelling on a digital screen, but having spent many hours with the originals, they are significantly better on the pages of a book you can explore as a physical object. If I can find enough supporters and meet a minimum order requirement for this ambitious project, I will create a book from this album at its original size with my notes in the margins so you can have this full experience with history too.\nSaint Quentin Cathedral, August 1917 (Walter Koessler) - October 2012 (Dean Putney)\n\"When Dean first shared this discovery with me, I knew he'd found a rare family history treasure \u2014 but I don't think I, or he, or anyone realized at first what a treasure of shared world history this collection would turn out to be. It's such an amazing story: a time capsule from an ancestor, finding its way to the hands of a young man who works in the digital world. I'm glad Dean is able to preserve it, and I'm happy to see it shared with the world.\" - Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing\nAs seen in:\nWhat I'm doing\nI want you to experience this part of our shared history. I've done a lot of research about the photos in this book and Walter's journey. I even went to France to attempt recreating the photo above. This project means a lot to me and I've spent a lot of time working on it.\nMy goal is to scan and archive each image in the book, make an annotated version of it in its full form, and share that with all of you. I've already begun this process by posting some of the pages and their photos on Tumblr. I also want to print these images in a book roughly the size of the original, with space for my notes and closeups in the margins so I can share my research.\nDigital images are neat because they don't take up space, you can zoom in closer than the eye can see, and they are easy to share. But the images in this book belong together, not separated or in a mishmash online. They deserved to be printed, held and spent time with. They're a priceless, rare look into forgotten age that you'll come back to again and again.\nThe book itself will be available in high resolution PDF form and as a high-quality offset printed, casebound 11\"x17\" coffee table book. I've rejected vanity press for this project because it's absurdly expensive at nearly $1 per page, and it greatly limits the sizes at which you can print. Each book would cost over $150 and the quality would not be worthy of Walter's work. I've begun researching the best ways to do photo printing, found a printer, priced it, checked paper samples, and begun laying out the book. These are going to be really beautiful prints, with a fold out page in the back for the large aerial panorama. A collector's item for sure and much higher quality than a vanity press could deliver. Here's a blank copy of the book's actual materials, this is the size and format I'm making it at:\nI need supporters to help me approach a 1000 copy minimum order quantity so I can move forward. When ordering a book from the non-early bird levels, you'll also receive a print from one of the book's photos.\nI'd also love to get people following along as I scan images so they can spot things I wouldn't normally see and share their expertise. The Internet has been invaluable in identifying military equipment, locations, people and much more. For backers $25 and above, you'll receive access to high resolution images of prints and negatives as I scan them so you can see my progress and pitch in if you'd like. Definitely get in on at least on this level, this stuff will knock your socks off.\nThe goal here is to have rewards dated for December 2013 in your hands before Christmas. I cannot guarantee that will happen (see Risks and Challenges section), but if I meet my funding goal I will do everything I can to meet this goal.\nI hope that this project will make you consider the stories in your life. How do you create and record new ones? How do you review the ones you've already made? How do you preserve the stories from your family? Go make those stories something you can share, can't ignore or forget, and want to spend more time with.\nHigh level rewards\nFor those of you particularly interested in early 20th century photography, military history or World War I specifically, I have some very special rewards for larger backers.\nStereoscopic View-Master\nWalter took fifty nine stereoscopic photos throughout the war. These show military equipment, biplanes, and possibly a crucifixion in 3D when seen through the proper viewer. I'm planning to make classic View-Masters and reels of the best ones to make viewing these images easy and fun! You'll also receive digital versions of the stereograms in anaglyph magenta/cyan and side-by-side formats. I'm expecting to be able to include four reels of six images for each backer here, but I may be able to make more if there are enough backers at this level. Here's an example of one of the 3D photos as an animated GIF:\nTriptychs or panorama\nThese photos are incredibly detailed, and as I've been scanning the prints and negatives I've found nuances and hidden bits you can't see in a small image. Walter took photos that tell stories, and I'm curating a few triptychs for this. These may change in the future as I find more negatives, but here are some mockups of possibilities. You'll receive options from me if you back at this level.\nTrenches\nChurches\nThe back of the book will include a fold out copy of this aerial panorama Walter took, with annotations of trench and front positions. This reward level will have an option to receive a print of this panorama instead of a triptych. The book board will be removed in this image.\nPrints from the original negatives\nI've started experimenting with printing photos in the darkroom using traditional photo enlarging and processing techniques from the original negatives I have, and the results so far are exciting. \nAs I work with these images, get better and larger paper, and learn more about enlarging them, these photographs are only going to bring you closer to the day they were shot. Walter's negatives are pristine and clear, and he took many wonderful photos. Printed large, they show details you just can't see with the naked eye.\nI won't be making many prints. The negatives are nearly a hundred years old now, and I'd really like to put them back in storage. But for the few of you who want a beautiful and rare art print from the original negative, this is a great opportunity to get one made for you. Few people have negatives from this era, and I doubt anyone besides me is crazy enough to actually print from them now. Sizes to be determined, but at least 8x10, and I will provide a series of images for you to choose from.\nVisit from me, showing of all the materials, and discussion\nI want to make these photos available for the hardcore enthusiasts to see first hand. It's so much fun sharing the story and images with people, and I could talk all day to the ones who are most interested. So let's do that.\nAt the highest tier, I'll fly out to your gallery, museum, club or organization with all the materials I have. We can spend a day discussing them and going through everything. I've limited this to five so that I can prevent undue stress on the album and materials, but I've priced it relatively low so that small but determined clubs still have a chance of organizing a meeting. Can't wait to meet you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. It's been a long time in the making because I believe this is a deeply important thing to share and share right. Here are some points I expect may present challenges and how I intend to reduce the risk behind them.\n\nI have never written or published a complete book before. Fortunately I am getting excellent advice from print designers and publishers who do this regularly. Since I work for major online publishers (boingboing.net, Kevin Kelly and others), many of my friends have made books and print products before, and the printer I've chosen comes highly recommended by the publisher of Coilhouse Magazine, so I'm confident that I'm in good hands. I've already begun the layout of the book, received financial quotes and checked paper samples. I've set out a timeline from now until I plan to ship, and I'm ready to commit to it. I've given myself a substantial time buffer between each stage of the process to prepare for things going wrong.\n\nI expect shipping physical product to have some unforeseen hangups. I have first-hand experience in seeing this done, but I have not done it myself. I've consulted with experts in retail shipping to make sure my timeline and goals are reasonable. International shipping is particularly risky and troublesome, but I've already begun pricing it out and preparing for it. I am hiring help with packing and shipping once the books arrive to make sure this goes smoothly.\n\nPrinting large numbers of photos is new to me. I've priced this out, done test prints, and begun learning more about printing from negatives. I've got experience printing high quality photographs, and I've connected with SF Photoworks to print the reward images. I've done test prints at RayKo Photo and I'll be working with them to create the best traditionally processed prints from the negatives I can. I've been working with photos for years, but I've never printed them in large quantities, so this is an area I'm actively learning more about to get the best results.\n\nAlthough unexpected production challenges will undoubtedly arise, I've spent a year and a half and plenty of my own money on this already, and I will not give up until you get your rewards. I look forward to you joining me in reliving history through First Lt. Walter Koessler's photo journal of World War I.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "From Grandma's closet to the museum walls!", "update_content": "Dear friends,\nJust about all rewards have been shipped to backers!

For you folk unfamiliar with the term \u201caudio drama,\u201d it\u2019s like a talking book but better because instead of one narrator it\u2019s an entire world come alive with characters, sounds, and music. There is no visual stimulation, so it fully engages a listener\u2019s imagination. Our target demographic is 8\u201314-year-olds and anyone who enjoys great stories well told. Wonder, excitement, adventure\u2014it\u2019s all here in Iliad House. With this campaign, we're going to fund the show's 4-episode pilot series!\nWhy call it Iliad House? Well, we\u2019ll just leave with you with this: The Iliad by Homer is an ancient, epic poem about a war among gods and kings. Iliad House is also about a war, but instead of flesh and blood it is against the principalities of this present darkness. We\u2019re going to explore some rather intense subject matter and stories, but in a fun, funny, and engaging way that offers real answers and hope.\nFourteen-year-old orphan Jesse Davidson lives with his emotionally-distant and peculiar uncle Christopher Portalis in the Iliad House, a mysterious old mansion on an island off the east coast of the United States.\nJust when Jesse is finally getting used to living on the island, he discovers that the old abandoned train he and his friends have been using as a clubhouse for the past year can actually move\u2014through time! \nThey get caught up in a series of adventures fraught with temporal distortions, political intrigue, secret societies, and supernatural battles, all as they try to cope with the daily pressures and craziness of adolescence.\nWhile traveling through the future and the past, they learn hard truths and secrets about themselves, and that there is forgiveness and redemption available to all who desire it. And, as Jesse and his uncle come to understand each other, Jesse begins to see that there is much more to Iliad House, and to why he and his uncle are there, than anyone realizes.\nJesse Davidson\u201414\nOrphaned, redheaded, lanky, a bit clumsy, he is always going where people tell him not to go, and doing what people warn him against, and attempting things he has no business attempting. He does these things for fun, and adventure, and to escape boredom, and to prove his mettle and worth. But mostly he does them to, as he puts it, \u201cfind an answer.\u201d An answer to what, he is not certain. He only knows that all of his life, he has felt as though something was missing, something important, and he needs to find out what it is.\nChristopher Portalis\u2014mid-30s\nJesse\u2019s genius uncle. If not exactly a recluse, he\u2019s the closest thing to it. Tall, lean, a good looker, Portalis holds PhDs in philosophy, history, and theoretical physics, and taught those subjects along with natural and revealed religions at the Patriot Heritage University. But then came a higher calling\u2014a life\u2019s mission, if you will\u2014that brought him to Iliad House.\nStu Martin\u201414\nJesse\u2019s good friend. He\u2019s a brain-trust physics wiz who wins all the science awards and rides around on his own self-built, electronic-computerized scooter. But Jesse soon realizes that there\u2019s more to Stu than just gadgets and tech.\nCassandra Wilson\u201414\nAnother of Jesse\u2019s friends. Pretty, wild-eyed, disheveled, she claims to see the future. Jesse finds her equally annoying and amusing. (And she kinda scares Stu, but that\u2019s nothing new.) Her attitude is mostly a cover, though, because, like Jesse, she\u2019s looking for something important, but she doesn\u2019t know where to start.\nMrs. McKenzie Emily Delanie aka \"Mrs. McEd\"\u2014mid-50s\nThe housekeeper for Iliad House. Widowed, Scottish, stout, she is a cross between Mrs. Doubtfire and Marilla Cuthbert from Anne of Green Gables, which is to say, she is stern, strong, kindhearted, or loving as the occasion warrants, and sometimes all four at the same time. She\u2019s the closest thing to a mother Jesse has ever known.\n\"The Butler\"\u2014?\nA robot created by Professor Portalis. It helps him with quick answers and analysis, as well as providing him with his cloak, his pipe, and a nice strong cup of Earl Grey. The Butler is a combination of Iron Man/Tony Stark\u2019s Jarvis, and Marvin the manic-depressive paranoid android from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. He is Spock to Mrs. McEd\u2019s McCoy, which is to say, most of the time they don\u2019t get along. (His name has yet to be determined, but one fantastic person will get to name it by choosing the Name the Butler reward level!).\nThe Cast\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Phil\u2019s work in previous shows (*cough*Adventures in Odyssey*cough*Jungle Jam and Friends*cough*), you\u2019ll recognize a lot of the cast of Iliad House.\nFor example, the famous and wonderful Katie Leigh, who plays Connie in Adventures in Odyssey!\nAnd, well, Phil Lollar!\nDid we say that we are excited about some of the awesome talent that we have?\nFirst, our concept artist is Cliff Cramp (check out his sweet website). One of our favorite ways to tell our friends about Cliff is to grab a Star Wars Blu-ray set and hand it to them. \"Cliff did all that cover art, and he is doing the art for Iliad House.\" We love having him involved.\nOur musician is a cool guy too. Justin R. Durban (also has a sweet website) is best known for his work scoring music for film trailers for movies like James Cameron's Avatar, Pixar's Brave, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He did the Iliad House theme music, and we can't stop playing it in our heads.\nSo, what exactly does this project fund? The answer is a 4-episode pilot series of Iliad House, to be distributed by CD and online!\nTo do that, we need to pay for at least five key things:\n1. Excellent actors who will play Jesse, Cassandra, Stu, and, of course, Professor Christopher Portalis.\n2. Custom music to help build the tension, mystery, and whimsy.\n3. Vibrant sound design to bring the story to life.\n4. Replicating CDs for distribution. (They make great stocking stuffers, hint hint.)\nWe want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and we plan to be the best stewards we can be of that support.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe decided to use Kickstarter because we want a direct connection with you, our audience. We want to give audio drama fans a chance to decide if they would like to hear a story about a boy with a crazy mysterious uncle. Of course you do, but Kickstarter lets us (and you) be sure. Iliad House is an independent project by Phil Lollar and a small team\u2014there is no sea of middlemen\u2014it\u2019s just us telling great stories and giving them directly to you. Without you, what's the point?\nWhen we say, \"independent project,\" we mean REALLY independent. Iliad House is a completely new, original show, unaffiliated with Focus on the Family or Adventures in Odyssey, or anybody else except me (Phil) and my team at Guess What, LLC.\nAs you may have noticed, we have put some serious thought into the rewards that come with the different backing tiers for this Kickstarter. You can get get downloads, CDs, digital art, music, autographed stuff, limited edition numbering, the ability to name characters, and even a chance to party with Phil at Disneyland. (Most of us have been to a Disney park with Phil, and it is a blast, except Phil is constantly hearing a voice in a ride and saying, \"I know that voice actor. I think he owes me a lunch . . .\")\n\nRegardless, we put a lot of thought into the prizes, and they are awesome, so check them out. Once we have successfully completed the campaign, we plan to have the last of the rewards delivered to you by February 2014! (Of course you will start receiving the rewards as fast as we make them and get them out, so keep your eyes peeled!)\n\nBut here is some really cool stuff. If we reach some of our stretch goals (goals past our minimum Kickstarter funding requirement) EVERYONE benefits.\n\nIf we surpass our minimum funding goal of $15,000 and reach our stretch goal of $20,000, we'll make 2 additional episodes. If we surpass that and reach our stretch goal of $25,000, we'll make 2 more episodes (for a total of 4 additional episodes!). Even better, anyone who gives $20 or more to the Kickstarter campaign will get free digital copies of these additional episodes because we know that we will only achieve these stretch goals if you help spread the word.

Feel free to read the update about Iliad House's next step, and then follow the link above to the next campaign when it launches early September 2013!\n*******************************************************************************************************\nTo support Iliad House, just click the GREEN button to the right of the screen. All you need is an Amazon account, and you will only be charged if we meet our goal by August 31!\nFor the latest news and information, follow us on Facebook and Twitter! And if you'd like Iliad House to happen, be sure to SHARE and TWEET us out to your friends!\nIliad House will be an ongoing, independent audio drama, clocking in at about half an hour per episode. For you folk unfamiliar with the term \u201caudio drama,\u201d it\u2019s like a talking book but better because instead of one narrator it\u2019s an entire world come alive with characters, sounds, and music. There is no visual stimulation, so it fully engages a listener\u2019s imagination. Our target demographic is 8\u201314-year-olds and anyone who enjoys great stories well told. Wonder, excitement, adventure\u2014it\u2019s all here in Iliad House. With this campaign, we're going to fund the show's pilot mini-series followed by the first full season of 12 episodes!\nWhy call it Iliad House? Well, we\u2019ll just leave with you with this: The Iliad by Homer is an ancient, epic poem about a war among gods and kings. Iliad House is also about a war, but instead of flesh and blood it is against the principalities of this present darkness. We\u2019re going to explore some rather intense subject matter and stories, but in a fun, funny, and engaging way that offers real answers and hope.\nFourteen-year-old orphan Jesse Davidson lives with his emotionally-distant and peculiar uncle Christopher Portalis in the Iliad House, a mysterious old mansion on an island off the east coast of the United States.\nJust when Jesse is finally getting used to living on the island, he discovers that the old abandoned train he and his friends have been using as a clubhouse for the past year can actually move\u2014through time! \n\"Jesse Discovers the Train Engine\" by Cliff Cramp\nThey get caught up in a series of adventures fraught with temporal distortions, political intrigue, secret societies, and supernatural battles, all as they try to cope with the daily pressures and craziness of adolescence.\nWhile traveling through the future and the past, they learn hard truths and secrets about themselves, and that there is forgiveness and redemption available to all who desire it. And, as Jesse and his uncle come to understand each other, Jesse begins to see that there is much more to Iliad House, and to why he and his uncle are there, than anyone realizes.\n\"Jesse Arriving at Iliad House\" by Cliff Cramp\nJesse Davidson\u201414\nOrphaned, redheaded, lanky, a bit clumsy, he is always going where people tell him not to go, and doing what people warn him against, and attempting things he has no business attempting. He does these things for fun, and adventure, and to escape boredom, and to prove his mettle and worth. But mostly he does them to, as he puts it, \u201cfind an answer.\u201d An answer to what, he is not certain. He only knows that all of his life, he has felt as though something was missing, something important, and he needs to find out what it is.\nChristopher Portalis\u2014mid-30s\nJesse\u2019s genius uncle. If not exactly a recluse, he\u2019s the closest thing to it. Tall, lean, a good looker, Portalis holds PhDs in philosophy, history, and theoretical physics, and taught those subjects along with natural and revealed religions at the Patriot Heritage University. But then came a higher calling\u2014a life\u2019s mission, if you will\u2014that brought him to Iliad House.\nStu Martin\u201414\nJesse\u2019s good friend. He\u2019s a brain-trust physics wiz who wins all the science awards and rides around on his own self-built, electronic-computerized scooter. But Jesse soon realizes that there\u2019s more to Stu than just gadgets and tech.\nCassandra Wilson\u201414\n\nAnother of Jesse\u2019s friends. Pretty, wild-eyed, disheveled, she claims to see the future. Jesse finds her equally annoying and amusing. (And she kinda scares Stu, but that\u2019s nothing new.) Her attitude is mostly a cover, though, because, like Jesse, she\u2019s looking for something important, but she doesn\u2019t know where to start.\nMrs. McKenzie Emily Delanie aka \"Mrs. McEd\"\u2014mid-50s\nThe housekeeper for Iliad House. Widowed, Scottish, stout, she is a cross between Mrs. Doubtfire and Marilla Cuthbert from Anne of Green Gables, which is to say, she is stern, strong, kindhearted, or loving as the occasion warrants, and sometimes all four at the same time. She\u2019s the closest thing to a mother Jesse has ever known.\n\"The Butler\"\u2014?\nA robot created by Professor Portalis. It helps him with quick answers and analysis, as well as providing him with his cloak, his pipe, and a nice strong cup of Earl Grey. The Butler is a combination of Iron Man/Tony Stark\u2019s Jarvis, and Marvin the manic-depressive paranoid android from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. He is Spock to Mrs. McEd\u2019s McCoy, which is to say, most of the time they don\u2019t get along. (His name has yet to be determined, but one fantastic person will get to name it by choosing the Name the Butler reward level!).\nThe Cast\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Phil\u2019s work in previous shows (*cough*Adventures in Odyssey*cough*Jungle Jam and Friends*cough*), you\u2019ll recognize a lot of the cast of Iliad House.\nFor example, the famous and wonderful Katie Leigh, who plays Connie in Adventures in Odyssey!\nAnd, well, Phil Lollar!\nWe'll be announcing more cast members throughout the campaign!\nVerity Island\nThe adventure takes place on a small island off the eastern coast of the US not terribly far from the landing place of John Smith and his colonial adventurers.\nRecreated Native American Village on Verity Island\nFort Verity\nOriginally inhabited by Native Americans, Verity Island is now a sleepy place of wooded trails generally looked down on by the inhabitants of Verity City just across the Prudence River Bridge. The city folk think that the people of Verity Village are too strange and \"the wrong sort.\"\nModern-Day Verity Village\nSome say that the oddness of those who live on the island dates back to the building of the train depot in the woods while others say it goes back even further to the glory days of Fort Verity whose ruins still guard the island's north shore. The funny thing is, the strange folks in Verity Village are normal compared to the even more unusual Professor who has taken up residence down past the rock formation on the southern tip of the island in a mysterious place called Iliad House.\n\"Christopher Portalis in His Study\" by Cliff Cramp\nQuick version: This all started in late 2012 at a conference where many of us, including Phil, were teaching audio drama production to middle and high schoolers. After a few days, we found that we really respected each other and decided to create a new audio drama together. Thus, Iliad House and our partnership, Guess What LLC, were born.\n\nWe\u2019ll share more about the rest of the Guess What team as the campaign progresses, but we'll start with Phil Lollar, the creative director, showrunner, head writer, and overall audio drama maestro. He has co-created, written, and worked on a ton of stuff. Adventures in Odyssey, Jungle Jam and Friends, Little Dogs on the Prairie\u2014read his bio for more!\nDid we say that we are excited about some of the awesome talent that we have?\nFirst, our concept artist is Cliff Cramp (check out his sweet website). One of our favorite ways to tell our friends about Cliff is to grab a Star Wars Blu-ray set and hand it to them. \"Cliff did all that cover art, and he is doing the art for Iliad House.\" We love having him involved.\nOur musician is a cool guy too. Justin R. Durban (also has a sweet website) is best known for his work scoring music for film trailers for movies like James Cameron's Avatar, Pixar's Brave, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He did the Iliad House theme music, and we can't stop playing it in our heads.\nSo, what exactly does this project fund? The answer is a pilot mini-series and then the first season (12 glorious half-hour episodes) of Iliad House, to be distributed by CD and online!\nTo do that, we need to pay for at least five key things:\n1. Excellent actors who will play Jesse, Cassandra, Stu, and, of course, Professor Christopher Portalis.\n2. Custom music to help build the tension, mystery, and whimsy.\n3. Vibrant sound design to bring the story to life.\n4. A website so you can download the newest episodes.\n5. Replicating CDs for distribution. (They make great stocking stuffers, hint hint.)\nWe want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and we plan to be the best stewards we can be of that support.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe decided to use Kickstarter because we want a direct connection with you, our audience. We want to give audio drama fans a chance to decide if they would like to hear a story about a boy with a crazy mysterious uncle. Of course you do, but Kickstarter lets us (and you) be sure. Iliad House is an independent project by Phil Lollar and a small team\u2014there is no sea of middlemen\u2014it\u2019s just us telling great stories and giving them directly to you. Without you, what's the point?\nWhen we say, 'independent project,' we mean REALLY independent. Iliad House is a completely new, original show, unaffiliated with Focus on the Family or Adventures in Odyssey, or anybody else except me (Phil) and my team at Guess What, LLC.\nAs you may have noticed, we have put some serious thought into the rewards that come with the different backing tiers for this Kickstarter. You can get get downloads, CDs, digital art, music, autographed stuff, limited edition numbering, the ability to name characters, and even a chance to party with Phil at Disneyland. (Most of us have been to a Disney park with Phil, and it is a blast, except Phil is constantly hearing a voice in a ride and saying, \"I know that voice actor. I think he owes me a lunch . . .\")\n\nRegardless, we put a lot of thought into the prizes, and they are awesome, so check them out. Once we have successfully completed the campaign, we plan to have the last of the rewards delivered to you by February 2014! (Of course you will start receiving the rewards as fast as we make them and get them out, so keep your eyes peeled!)\n\nBut here is some really cool stuff. If we reach some of our stretch goals (goals past our minimum Kickstarter funding requirement) EVERYONE benefits.\n\nThis is how stretch goals work: We reach a benchmark and we throw a party! For example, let's see what happens if we raise $150,000 on Kickstarter. After we complete the pilot mini-series and the first season, we will make a special prequel of the professor's awesome back story and sell it on the Iliad House website (all the fans win!). Even better, anyone who gives $20 or more to the Kickstarter campaign will get a free digital copy of this prequel because we know that we will only achieve these stretch goals if you help spread the word. So tell your friends!\n\nHere are our official stretch goals:\n\n$150,000\u2014Three-episode prequel for the Professor Portalis's backstory! Everyone who pledges at $20 or above gets a digital copy!\n\n$200,000\u2014The second season of Iliad House. Everyone who pledges at $20 and above will receive a digital copy!\n$250,000\u2014Everyone who pledges at $20 or above will receive a deluxe digital map of the mysterious island! $45 or above will receive a deluxe physical map of the island!\n\n$300,000\u2014The third season of Iliad House. Everyone who pledges at $20 or above will receive a digital copy!\n$350,000\u2014Phil Lollar and the cast will do a live recording of a very special episode! The event will be in LA at a to be determined date and will be live broadcast online around the world!\n\n$400,000\u2014Yes, we\u2019ll totally do a fourth season if we reach this stretch goal. But if we get to $400,000, we\u2019ll also unveil part of our master plan hinting at a huge development to come after the end of the third season. Get the campaign up to this level, and we\u2019ll tell you what that is. Otherwise, we\u2019re keeping our lips sealed on this one.\nCheck out the coverage Iliad House has received so far!\nPress\nCrossMap\nChristian NewsWire\nChristian Post\nChristian Today\nSmashing Interviews Magazine\nSEK Voice\nWND\nPodcasts\nAudio Theatre Central\nBlimey Cow\nVoxy Ladies\nBlogs\nAdventures in Odyssey Blog\nAIO Update\nCranach\nEncounter Gospel News\nGeneration Joshua (part I, II, and III)\nHeavy Laden\n\nLooking for Overland\n\nOdyssey Scoop\nPreschoolers and Peace\nRaven's Landing", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe good news is that that we have an awesome team! Phil clearly is the creative genius who has inspired millions of kids with his previous work. But the rest of the core team is pretty fantastic. We have two people who run large budgets, a radio producer, three members who have worked extensively on feature films, and someone who has coordinated projects of up to 2,000 volunteers/staff in 15 different states all crammed into five days. \n\nThis team is impressive because of their broad experience. Between them they are marketers, actors, bloggers, published authors, carry extensive social media experience, and distribute products all over the country. \n\nWhile the audio drama business is new to some of us, and all creative projects face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, we have a team that excels at problem solving. We have also already begun to write the scripts and have access to a great studio, which will help minimize risks due to cost and cut down delay in the delivery of the final product\u2014which is key to the success of a creative project. We are convinced that with your help, we can do this if you fund this project and spread the word to your friends.

I am RAISING FUNDS to bring the FIRST EDITION of the BARFFUS Doll to the world and to children in need. With your help JillJoy will be able to complete production and begin working with non-profit organizations actively engaged in helping children.  JillJoy needs to raise $28,000 to accomplish this production.  It is Jill's dream to give children a toy that can teach and/or remind them that they are loved and are connected to the divine.  In a world full of fashion dolls and baby dolls Jill sees a need for a new kind of doll, one with values and gifts of the heart.  The BARFFUS Dolls have their eyes wide open, learning from experience and a big fat smile, knowing that they are never alone and troubles pass.  This 1st edition BARFFUS Doll wears a heart with the message \"Be~Now\" inviting parents, teachers and care-givers to utilize it's heart message to teach kids what it means to be \"present\" and how to find peace by living in the moment with acceptance.  The BARFFUS Doll is also very fun to hold, cuddle, sleep on and it absorbs tears nicely.  BARFFUS has many messages and stories to share and many charities to contribute to... but it starts with the success of this campaign and accomplishing the production of this 1st series of dolls. \nWhy is it called a \"BARFFUS\" Doll?  Answer at the bottom of the page.\n\"The Story of Barffus\" is the True Story of the Barffus doll and myself. I (Jill) am the \"grateful young girl\" in the story and I am the designer and owner of JillJoy and the BARFFUS Brand.\nTHE STORY OF BARFFUS\nThere once was a Grandma, so bursting with joy, she made up a rag-doll a friend and a toy.  She called the doll \"Barffus\" her own word for happy... the look on his face some might even call sappy.\nWith a big hug goodbye, a smile and a poem, Grandma knew Barffus doll would love his new home. With his wide-eyed smile Barffus flopped into the arms of a grateful young girl with her own kind of charms.\nHugging and dancing Barffus smiled so hard, they rode in the car and they played in the yard.  Barffus listened and watched with a stillness admired and his bright quiet smile made her feel calm and inspired.\nThen a MIRACLE happened, one night, it seemed, when the girl and her Barffus doll had the SAME DREAM.... While in their garden, a beautiful sight, each gave the other a bit of their Light!\nIt was more than a dream 'cause they each had intention, to live on in each other and ask the best questions.  Like; why are we here? Where were we before? Are we just this body or are we much more?\nAs the young girl grew older she felt it was truth... that we are MUCH more and there's more we can do.  Like See Beauty and blessings, Give Thanks for creation.  Invite peace, love and clarity and Hear Inspiration.\nSearch inside and out, look for truths you can treasure.  Let patience and charity be part of life's pleasure.  The quest for us all is to care for each-other.  Be still, love yourself and connect with earths mother.\nTune in to your heart-brain, recognize presence.  Feel peace in each moment and come to your senses.  Barffus has a Mantra to help you endow. Ponder and practice;  Be in the Now !  (c) ~JillJoy\n\"The Story of Barffus\" will be included with every doll sold.\n  Rewards:\nThe first reward is a digital download of the Barffus Theme song: \"Rainbows\" by: Megan Joy.

ONLY 30 Teeny and 10 Big Dolls OFFERED!\nBARFFUS wants to serve as MASCOT for the enlightenment of  humans, reminding you of your divinity and give gentle suggestions of ways to find the calm in the craziness by being present in the moment with simple acceptance, and a smile.  (Not always easy, but always bringing peace when accomplished.) BARFFUS also wants to help bridge the gap between religions, cultures, races, gender and all forms of hypocrisy, expectations, stereo-types and judgement.  BARFFUS wants people to Discover their Dreams and Give them life! \nA LITTLE MORE BACKGROUND:\nI have made many prototypes and custom dolls over the past three-four years, some I have donated and others sold, all having landed into the arms of children (and adults) with loving adoration.\nAs interest and demand increased for the custom BARFFUS Doll, I began feeling overwhelmed with the inability to make dolls fast enough and with the level of quality and skill needed to meet my own standards and local interest.  So my vision for BARFFUS grew even bigger. My dream, however, is not to be a seamstress, It is to design and give life to the BARFFUS Brand and create it's messages of love and light, from my heart, using the Barffus Doll as a mascot.  After much research and development of the doll and the \"brand\" I began looking for a reputable manufacturer to produce the First edition BARFFUS Doll.  This task alone was quite a challenge but with that mission now accomplished... production of the First Edition of the BARFFUS Doll has already begun and production is scheduled to start end of August.  \nAlong with the design of the doll I have been working on every other aspect of business and marketing for The BARFFUS Brand, such as;  Design Patent & other legal stuff, writing messages and poems (to become childrens books) such as: \"The Story of Barffus\" and \"Barffus Is, Wants & Thanks\", Barffus Brand accessories and rewards for this fundraiser and the lyrics to our theme song: \"Rainbows\"  (Co Written with Megan Joy and John Feldman), Logos, Trademarks, Copyrights and the Rewards for this project.  \nThe Be~Now 27\" doll design has been in the making for over a year.  I \"see\" them sitting in your homes and places of business, in the arms of children, teens and even adults.  They love to ride in the car and I have even seen a newborn/premie smile at a Barffus Doll (SEE PICTURE at the very end). \nRE-CAP...   This is the 1st Edition of BARFFUS dolls and accessories!  With your support BARFFUS will begin it's journey of life on this planet.\nWith successful funding JillJoy will...\nBring the BARFFUS DOLLS & Inspirational Messages to the world.  Starting with fulfilling every Kickstarter Reward!\nEvery BARFFUS DOLLS will find a loving home and spread it's good energy to all who find  magic in it's energy and meaning in it's messages   : )\nIf this fundraiser exceeds it's goal JillJoy will:\nPay back creditors for money lent to initiate production! : ) YES!\nHire a professional to make an exceptional WebSite for BARFFUS, and its Fans and supporters (Many groovy and interactive ideas have been discussed and would love to be accomplished!) My current website was created by me using \"IWeb\" however my computer hard-drive was replaced and all files have been lost and can not be accessed or edited anymore... I'm already looking for solutions...  barffus.com\nBegin development for the 2nd release of the BARFFUS with new messages & accessories and... books, music, videos,  games, apps, artwork, kits and of course all containing helpful messages  and tools for joufull living.  The possibilities are endless and are have already begun : )\n\nTHIS PROJECT IS DEDICATED TO MY GRANDMA T\nJill & Iona... BARFFUS Life Givers\nNOTE: A Special THANK YOU to my beautiful Granmother, Iona, who made me a \"Barffus Doll\" when I was a child that, for me, was a friend and a toy reminding me always that I was loved and I too could be a reflection of love and joy and share it with others... THANK YOU GRANDMA, I LOVE YOU!  This project is dedicated to you and every grandmother who aspired to share her love, life and wisdom to the children in her life!  YAY for Grandma!\nTHANK~YOUS: I need to give a BIG THANK YOU TO:  Megan Joy & Quinn Allman, My Parents (Ron & Carolynn Tranmer), Ryder Corkery, Landon (& Ariel) Moser, Colby Knudsen, My Siblings and their families, Abey Baraghoshi, Kathryn Miles and all of MY and Megan's friends and Family who helped with the music video and slide show!!!

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!\nNewborn (premie) Smiling at Barffus doll\nThe Same Child, different Barffus doll.\nWhy is it called a BARFFUS Doll? This is a loaded question. The first answer is because that's what my grandmother called it when she gave it to me. I remember thinking the name sounded like \"Barf\" and I didn't understand. She said it was because she knew a goofy looking man who was always smiling and his last name was Barfuss (spelling unknown) and the doll reminded her of him. As I child actively engaged in going to church and sunday school and primary I had learned not to judge people by how they look or what their name is and that we are all the same in gods eyes. The name of the doll gave me the opportunity to look past the \"gross\" name and see the beautiful gift therefore transforming my perception of the word from \"gross\" to \"awesome\". I continue to use this skill in life, of changing my perception, and it has served me well.\nTHANK YOU! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMany risks and challenges have already been taken and overcome. Payment to initiate production has already been made. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of August. Completion of production is estimated to be middle of October. As far as the quality and finished product for the 1st Edition Be/Now Series BARFFUS DOll... I had the finished samples (1 boy and 1 girl) for a few weeks and played with them and took the pictures for this project and I am very happy with the quality and craftsmanship (the factory needed me to send them back to finish the final details... adding the Be/Now heart and Barffus Tags to then begin production). It took a few changes and alterations getting to this point (over a year's worth) but the sample dolls are beautifully made and the manufacturer has been great to work with. \nOther risks and challenges may present themselves in the process of production and shipment (this is my first go-round in this arena so I don't have experience but I do have support from others who do have experience and I have done a lot of research and preparation). I already have a freight company that I am working with and have preliminary pricing and time frames. At this point everything seems to be on track. If I meet my goal the dolls should be ready for shipment by middle of October and then the Shipment of dolls should arrive by end of October- start of November. This should give me enough time to have the Be-Now Series dolls shipped out by end of November. \n\nAs for all of the other (CUSTOM) rewards (made by me) I expect to have all items shipped out, no later than the end of November. I will work diligently to meet all delivery goals, I am surrounded by talented people standing by to help me in any way I need... I have loads of support. \n\nIf you have any questions, concerns or advise for me I would love to hear from you.\n\nTHANK YOU!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "jilljoy\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nBorn & raised in Utah.

Here\u2019s how you can stay in the loop regarding future product launches, feedback surveys, beta tests and promotions:\nSubscribe to the Peak Design Newsletter\nFollow us on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and Instagram\nMedia & bloggers \u2013 if you\u2019d like to run a story, let us know!\nTHANK YOU TO OUR AMAZING BACKERS\nThank you, thank you, thank you. We hate clich\u00e9s, but we\u2019d be doing you an injustice if we didn\u2019t say that we literally couldn\u2019t do this without you. And yes, we know that is a somewhere between a double and quadruple negative. We don\u2019t care \u2013 we\u2019re excited and we freaking love you folks.\nThis is more than just designing new products to help photographers carry their cameras. This is a way of running a business, and ultimately for the Peak Design team, a way of living our lives. Our Kickstarter backers, many of whom supported us during Capture v1 and Leash/Cuff, make it possible for us to spend our time doing exactly what we want to do: design rad photography gear and enjoy putting it the hands of people who appreciate it. The funds generated from this campaign will support the research, design and development of newer, better solutions to problems that camera owners face. As we do this we will continue to look to you, our most die-hard, passionate supporters, for feedback and direction.\nOnce again, thank you for your generous support!\nQUESTIONS? ANSWERS IN THE FAQ!\nWhether you're a new backer or existing backer, we've got a massive (we're talking laughably long) FAQ at the bottom of this page. We bet you'll find you'll find an answer there!\nWHAT IS CAPTURE?\nWe believe Capture is hands-down the best way to carry your camera. The beauty of it lies in its simplicity. Capture is a compact metal clip that lets you carry your camera on any backpack strap, belt or bag. Its unique quick-release system keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button.\nCapture Camera Clip v2: Carry your camera on any backpack strap, belt or bag.\nCapture frees you from cumbersome camera straps and holsters and lets you go anywhere and do anything with your camera safe and in reach, making sure you never miss another shot. Whew, it feels good just typing that.\nAlong with Capture v2, we're launching 2 new accessories:\nPROpad\u2122 gives you extra stability and comfort when carrying very heavy cameras with Capture.\nPOV Kit (formerly called the GoPro Mount) lets you mount GoPro and point-and-shoot cameras on Capture to take POV video.\nSO WHAT'S NEW IN CAPTURE V2?\nBack in 2011, Peak Design launched the original Capture Camera Clip right here on Kickstarter. We\u2019ve spent the past 2 years building our team and reinventing our solution from the ground up, incorporating feedback from our thousands of awesome backers and customers. Here's a high level look at what is new in v2...\nTo walk you though the big new things one by one...\nThere's a Standard and Pro version now: Hobbyists and beginners have different needs than serious pros and adventurers, hence 2 versions of our clip. Read the \"Capture vs. CapturePRO\" section below to learn more.\nBeautiful new ergonomic shape: The new Capture looks sleek and stunning - but the new shape is more than just eye-candy. We\u2019ve redesigned it to give you total comfort no matter where on your body you wear it. We also redesigned the clamping bolts to make them easier to screw down, even if you\u2019re wearing gloves.\nLighter and slimmer: We\u2019ve trimmed the fat, making our (already compact) product lighter, slimmer and more unobtrusive. See FAQ for size specs.\nBetter security features: We created 2 new secondary locking systems to give you more security options. A safety lock has been added to the quick-release button, giving you a quick and easy way to prevent accidental release. For maximum security, the all-new twist lock tightly clamps your camera in. The new twist lock also stabilizes your camera if you\u2019re using Capture as a tripod clamp. Wait - did we just say you can use it as a tripod clamp?\nThat\u2019s right, it works as a tripod clamp too (PRO): CapturePRO has a \u00bc\u201d tripod mounting hole in it\u2019s back plate. This means you can put it atop your tripod or monopod and have a fully functioning quick-release clamp for your camera.\nWorks with more tripod heads (PRO): CapturePRO comes with one of our three PROplates. These plates offer compatibility with more tripod heads (ARCA and Manfrotto RC2) and camera types (SLR and Compact Mirrorless). See the FAQ for info on choosing a plate.\nWorks with sling straps (PRO): Capture, equipped with the standard plate, is designed to work with Leash and Cuff using our micro-anchor attachment system (see FAQ). CapturePRO, equipped with one of our PROplates, works with Peak Design straps as well as classic sling-style straps made by companies like BlackRapid\u00ae. PROplates feature a special load-bearing D-ring that lets you attach your sling strap directly to your camera when you\u2019re not using Capture.\nCAPTURE VS. CAPTURE PRO\nHere's a look at Capture, CapturePRO, and the different quick-release plates that you can get with them:\nCapture\u00ae is a simpler, less expensive camera clip for folks who just need a better way to carry their camera. CapturePRO\u00ae is the full-featured all-aluminum Cadillac of camera clips - designed to meet the strength and compatibility needs of serious photographers. Both clips are designed to carry cameras of any size. CapturePRO\u00ae just has a bit more functionality:\n\nWHAT CAN I GET BY SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT?\nIf you to like go places and do things with your camera, you'll get a big fat treat. In addition to Capture v2, we've got some amazing new accessories. Behold:\nCapture\u00ae: The standard entry-level version of Capture has a glass-reinforced nylon backplate and comes with our standard quick release plate (see FAQ for details). Pre-order at the $50 reward level.\nCapturePRO\u00ae: Our flagship professional version of Capture features an all-aluminum body and comes with one of 3 PROplates. It can be used as a tripod head and is compatible with multiple tripod systems, as well as sling straps and hand straps (see FAQ for details). Pre-order at the $65+ levels. Also, note the limited \"Naked Edition\" early bird specials!\nPROpad\u2122: This accessory (for all versions of Capture including v1) provides additional support and padding for folks who want to use Capture with heavy camera/lens/battery grip combinations, or those who are just looking for maximum comfort. Projected delivery in September. Included at the $95+ levels, or you can order it \"a la carte\" for $20 by selecting the $1+ reward.  This may seem obvious, but note that the PROpad is only useful if you have Capture.\nPOV Kit: We formerly called this the \"GoPro\u00ae Mount,\" but we've renamed it because it we've broadened it's capabilities. This accessory lets you use Capture as a rigid, positionable video-capture mount for your GoPro\u00ae, or other brand POV camera, or your point-and-shoot camera. This means you can take POV video from any backpack strap, belt or strap-like object.  The GoPro\u00ae Mount is best suited for Capture v2, but works with v1 too.  Projected delivery in October. Included at the $95+ levels (except the Early Bird Special).\nLeash & Cuff (not pictured above): Leash is our quick-connecting, uber-versatile camera strap. Cuff is our quick-connecting minimalist wrist strap. We launched these straps on Kickstarter in 2012. Included at the $150+ levels.\nWHAT ARE THE REWARD LEVELS?\nWe would love your support, and created reward levels based on what we think you'd love to get in return for your generosity. See the FAQs for information on adding individual products to your reward a la carte.\nPROPAD: USING CAPTURE WITH BIG OL' CAMERAS\nGot a heavy camera/lens/battery combo? Watch this video to see how PROpad\u2122 + Capture is the ultimate carrying solution for you:\nBased on feedback from our customers with super-sized rigs, we\u2019ve developed a supportive pad accessory that makes Capture an ideal solution for even the bulkiest of cameras. We call it the PROpad\u2122, and whether you have a large camera/lens/grip or you just want extra comfort when carrying your gear all day, this is the accessory for you.\nPROpad\u2122 allows you to side-load or top-load your camera into Capture when you wear it on your belt, and it can be worn on your backpack strap as well. PROpad\u2122 is constructed from super-tough Hypalon and has a gel-like compression-molded EVA foam back pad. We expect PROpad\u2122 to be ready to ship by September.\nPOV KIT: USING CAPTURE WITH GOPRO & POINT-AND-SHOOTS\nWant to know what the POV Kit is all about? First, watch this video.\nIf you can attach a DSLR to any strap or belt, then why the heck shouldn\u2019t you be able to do that with a POV video camera? Well, we\u2019ve got good news for you. Soon, you\u2019ll be able to use Capture (any version) to mount your GoPro\u00ae camera directly to any backpack strap, belt, or strap-like substrate to capture point-of-view video in exciting new ways. This accessory will also let you take POV video using other brand POV cameras, as well as point-and-shoot cameras. We plan on having it ready to ship by the beginning of October.\nMAKING CAPTURE\nWe care immensely about the quality of our products. 8 different materials go through 15 different transformation processes to produce 26 different parts for Capture v2.\nThis video gives some insight into how these raw materials are processed and assembled to become Capture. It also shows how closely we work with our manufacturing team in Wuxi, China to bring Capture to life. We filmed all of the footage in this video during a recent week-long trip to Wuxi to hash out our final production process for Capture v2, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed filming it.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT, SHIPPING, AND TIMING\nWhen this campaign ends on August 23rd, all backers will get a survey sent via email. We'll ask you to provide your shipping address, and you'll also specify which quick-release plate you want (if you pre-ordered CapturePRO\u00ae) and which items you want from the a-la-carte menu. Until then we don't need any shipping info from you - so just sit back and relax. You deserve it!\nWe have every intention of shipping Capture\u00ae and CapturePRO\u00ae starting shortly after our funding campaign ends, no foolin'. That means most of you will be receiving your rewards in the month of September, international backers maybe early October. Leash\u2122 and Cuff\u2122 will also be shipping immediately after the campaign ends.\nThe PROpad\u2122 and POV Kit might take a little longer to ship. We're still finalizing our supply chain for those products. We don't want to hold up shipping of Capture, so for that reason these accessories may ship separately. So you might get your rewards in 2 shipments. We won't make you wait too long though - we should have them ready to go in October.\nIf you've chosen one of our limited Naked Edition early bird rewards, your CapturePRO Naked Edition units, your reward should be on it's way! If you haven't gotten a shipping notification from us, please check your Kickstarter messages immediately.\nWe kindly ask international backers to add a single $15 amount to their pledge to cover shipping. If you have questions about international shipping, please see our FAQ.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply Chain Risks\nHoly smokes, have we learned a thing or two about our supply chain over the last two years! One of the main ingredients in making Capture V2 an outstanding product was improving our supply chain by selecting the right manufacturers, the right materials and the right processes. We can't even begin to convey how monumental of a task this has been, but the short and sweet answer is that it's paid off - we have a high-quality product, and we have a much higher confidence in our ability to build lots of them, and do it on time. But, things can still go awry. A supplier may slip a deadline or their machines might break down or they might run out of a certain type of paint. Those things would delay fulfillment.\n\nDesign Risks for Future Products\nPROpad\u2122 and the GoPro\u00ae Mount are not quite as far along as Capture V2. PROpad\u2122 has a complete design but we still need to create packaging for it. the GoPro\u2122 Mount is getting a couple small tweaks to the final prototype. We anticipate these products being ready in September, but it could take a bit longer if we have to do any major redesign work. Highly unlikely though.\n\nActs of God\nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

Digital download only.\"\nWhat's the story about?\nSet against the backdrop of a great war Carbon Grey follows twin sisters Mathilde and Giselle Grey, members of a noble family dedicated to protecting the Kaiser of Mitteleuropa, as they struggle to reconcile duty with their own beliefs and ambitions. When the Kaiser is killed a vast conspiracy is uncovered, centered around a prophecy made long ago by Gottfaust, father to the Greys and hero of Mitteleuropa, that the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey \u2013 will one day spark a revolution.\n  Summary\nThe sisters of the Greys; descendants of Gottfaust \u2013 Godlike hero of the nation\u2019s Golden Era. For over three hundred years their family have protected and counseled the Kaiser, ruler of the Prussian Empire. The sisters are beautiful, wise and deadly; bred for purity and groomed to achieve perfection.\n\nThrough generations there have always been three \u2013 one for Strength, one for Grace and one for Wisdom.\n\n\nBut this is a different time.\n1913. At the beginning of the industrial age a great war is raging. As the myth of glory in battle is cut to ribbons on the frontline of Mitteleuropa twin sisters are born; Mathilde and Giselle. One of these two sisters is the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey, prophesied by Gottfaust to bring about a renaissance, and restore the nation to glory.\n\n  Both are flawed; imperfect in different ways. Giselle is disobedient, stubborn; but her faults are hidden. Mathilde does not share the physical perfection of her sisters, something she cannot hide. And an exposed flaw can be exploited.\n\n\nThis war is a diversion, orchestrated by the ruthless Queen, Raisa Vasilyeva. She conspires to manipulate Mathilde, twisting Gottfaust\u2019s prophecy to turn sister against sister, all to gain possession of the Stone, the source of Gottfaust\u2019s Godlike power.\n\n  When the Kaiser is murdered Giselle must run, traveling west across the scorched battlefields of Mitteleuropa on a mission to deliver a mysterious letter into the heart of enemy territory. Pursued by the sisters and hunted by the enemy Giselle must discover the prophecy\u2019s true meaning before the Cossack queen harnessed the power of the stone to rewrite history itself.\n\n  Carbon Grey has been a labor of love for my friends and I. We have been working on and off with this project for over a decade. It is a dedication born of passion, perseverance and hard work, and the belief that one day we'll complete this journey. Now that day is finally here.\nLast year we successfully launched and executed our first Kickstarter project to fund the second volume of Carbon Grey. We couldn't have done it without the support of the community.\nWe're now reaching out to the Kickstarter community again to help fund the final chapter. It will be a two issue mini-series published by IMAGE Comics.

We also wanted to do something with Superheroes in the future. Hero Punk is a dystopian, hard sci-fi superhero film that -- we believe -- the studios would never make.\nIf you are a fan of CHRONICLE, BLADE RUNNER, DARK CITY and THE MATRIX, you'll probably like Hero Punk. If you read comics and graphic novels like PREACHER and TRANSMETROPOLITAN, you'll almost certainly love Hero Punk. We are fans of those comics and we believe it shows in our film.\nCheck out our Kickstarter updates or Hero Punk website for storyboards!\nStyle of Hero Punk\nHero Punk takes place in a dystopian, cyberpunk future. It is a combination of a style called Steam Punk -- along with a present which has nano-bots, bio-enhancements and gene therapy.\nHero Punk Timeline\nThe world stopped innovating on all public fronts sometime around 2002 and factions developed which built weapons, vehicles and clothes from other, discarded items in the world. Because of this, the world looks like something between the 1800s and 2042, with modern weapons and clothes, combined with very intricately designed items.\n1942 - the government decided to eradicate any mutant abilities and eliminate any trace of superheroes. The Nazi\u2019s and the US worked together to put mutants in concentration camps, where they were exterminated for the greater good of the world.\n1962 - mutant rights activists began to protest and a new world government was formed and its ruling body, the UNITED NATIONS COUNCIL, outlawed lethal force against mutants.\n1970s - factions developed, with \u201cheroes\u201d on one side, \u201cnormals\u201d on the other. German and US scientists went to work synthesizing the enzyme to suppress special abilities.\n1988 - no mutant abilities exist, due to the enzyme (and airborne pathogens). All water on earth is laced with harmless, microbial enzymes. All air has pathogens.\n1990 - technology catches up with science. Bio-tech weapons, fusion reactors and enhanced humans were beginning to emerge. An unmanned ship crashes on earth, carrying a message. The message is deciphered and wide-spread panic causes the planet to band together. The message was simple; WE ARE COMING.\n1995 - along with the threat of annihilation by a potentially hostile alien species, the Government started to make attempts to colonize space, attempting to build large bio- domes, which were called \u201cSpheres\u201d.\n2001 - Fusion reactors explode and kill over 2 billion people. The UNITED NATIONS COUNCIL makes the choice to halt all space exploration, ban all fusion technology and prepare for the possibility of alien invasion by setting up the \u201cARMORY\u201d. The world revolts, the police are useless.\n2031 - Deveaux forms The Enclave, a kind of secret project to save humanity, with loose ties to the government.\n2040s - Lane, an ex-bounty hunter with a troubled past, begins to pull together his own team to save the world; The Resistance.\nAbout The Creator\nKanen is the creator of this show is the founder of Scruffy.TV and the host of That Post Show (the most popular post-production podcast on iTunes). He has a history of web and Hollywood successes, including the original THAT MEDIA SHOW (now The Scruffy Show) which helped launch Glee star Darren Criss and then starred Morgan Cullen and Austin Scott.\nHero Punk: The Film\nWhen finished, Hero Punk will be made available online for a small fee (around $10) and will also be distributed on Netflix, iTunes and/or Amazon as a full-length feature, available for rent and purchase.\nWe are actively seeking other distribution channels, such as Redbox and Walmart.\nWe've even had a little press already!\nSo far...\nIn late January, 2013, we shot the first half of Hero Punk on a large (over 1,100 square foot) green screen stage in a studio in San Francisco. We assembled almost a hundred actors and we shot on the BlackMagic Cinema Camera. We have confirmed with BlackMagic Design that we are the first feature film ever shot on this amazing camera!\nBlackmagic even wrote about us.\nSince then, we've shot more of Hero Punk and we're in the process of finishing all our shooting, which will be complete in April/May.\nOur total out of pocket cost for Hero Punk is around $55k so far. This Kickstarter campaign will help us raise the money needed to finish shooting pick-ups and several new scenes for Hero Punk and will pay to complete the editing, visual effects and sound design for the film.\nRemember, our goal is our minimum required to complete Hero Punk.\nHero Punk is over 80% green screen with 3D backgrounds. We've shot some of the film in practical locations, but these account for a small percentage of the final film.\nThe Crew\nWritten by Kanen Flowers, Hero Punk is a labor of love that started in 2008. It is being Directed by Kanen Flowers, with help from Paul Del Vecchio and Patrick Johnson.\nKurtis Lee Hermes - Assistant Director\nDrew Bishop - Audio Engineer\nManual Salas - Audio Engineer\nSky Tallone - 2nd Camera and Behind The Scenes\nOlly Quinn - On-Set Editor\nKristin Martin - Audio Editor\nMatt Christensen - Colorist\nJohn Osteen - Editor\nCarolyn Stampeen - VFX Coordinator\nCory McElrea - Grip\nGameli Anumu - Grip\nColton Coate - Grip / PA\nDoug Birnbaum - Grip\nJady Brooks - Script Supervisor\nMichael Morgan - Script Supervisor\nKendell Evans - Wardrobe\nJonathan Reisfield - Makeup\nKayla Franz - Makeup\nMolly Gazay - Makeup\nStar Symmetric - Makeup\nAaron Cook - PA\nMary Wieczorek - PA\nMelissa Wan Wen - PA\nJesse Muick - PA\nSamantha Alvarez - PA\nSteven Emerson - PA\nThe Actors (and their Characters)\nJamil Vaughn plays Lane, the Leader of the Resistance. He was a Bounty Hunter and a thief until 2032. Jamil's nickname during Hero Punk was \"Vaughn Diesel\", because we were reminded of Pitch Black when we saw him in his gear, barking orders to the Resistance.\nDamien Jade Warren plays DEVEAUX and leads the ENCLAVE. He developed bio-weapons and nano-technology for the government. Is perceived as a villain by the Resistance, because of his Machiavellian choices and his creation of The Courier. Former CEO of a billion- dollar company who still has ties to the government. A kind of Sherlock Holmes meets Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle Corporation.\nRyder Darcy plays Caleb, The Conduit, who has the ability to counteract the pathogen(s) which suppress the mutant abilities. Anyone who is around him starts to regain their mutant ability. This lasts -- if The Conduit is alive. \nJeremy Jones plays Simon, the Holographic Avatar. He is the \"Jarvis from Iron Man\" character. A rogue program, created by PALMER, Simon has the facts and helps LANE and the RESISTANCE survive. \nSherman Koltz plays Palmer,  the wise man, who may also be completely insane. Fueled by anger, his dialogue can be abrupt and confusing. Palmer curses constantly. PALMER created SIMON, along with several technologies used by the everyone in Hero Punk. \nChris Morrell plays Palmer when he's younger. He works for a crappy data entry firm. Later, he gets a job with the Government and builds \"The Kite\" and other technologies.\nNatalie Dickinson plays Fade. She is the fighter in the Resistance and she can summon a kind of force-field when needed, along with other powers.\nDialy Paulino plays Rhea, she's beautiful, European and charming. She joins the Resistance with Caleb, who she is dating.\nKatie Whitcraft plays Shaw. She joins the Resistance, along with Fade, Caleb and Rhea. When her powers manifest, she learns to \"teleport\". If she\u2019s near Caleb, she can transport at will. She can also heal people, sometimes.\nKeagan Weathington plays \"The Courier\". He has enhanced abilities, all technology-based. Has tattoos which come to life. Wears a near impenetrable spider- mesh body armor to protect his chest. All his weapons have a slow-death neuro-toxin on them. \nConstance Hasapopoulos plays Madam Assange, the Leader of the free world and the third \"elected\" president of the New Government. The people trust her, because she's right and fair. The fear her because of her massive power. She has a scar on her face from an explosion years prior. \nAlfonso Godinez plays Langley, Deveaux's right hand. He is very serious about the Enclave, but has a sense of humor. He's good at getting into places and carries a small satchel and a gun on the other side. He keeps a leather folio, with a lock pick set. \nSyra MacCarthy plays Shifler. She's addicted to Eastwood (it\u2019s a drug). She has part EEL DNA to help her move, survive in cold water for long periods and have better vision in dense fog or smoke. Sniper rifle bad-ass. \nDixon Phillips plays Ramsey and runs the DELTA ARMORY. Originally from Memphis -- he fights to hide the accent he would have had. Ramsey is in charge of orbital stations, like Epsilon Six, which are scheduled to be online in mid 2042. \nMike Guerra plays Harkness. He spends time in the street and commands the DELTA ARMORY ground troops. He\u2019s also Ramsey\u2019s advisor and friend.\nOther Stuff\nThe more money we raise, the better Hero Punk and the visual effects and sound and color will be. If we meet our minimum goal (of $28,500), it will be about eight months. Our stretch goal of $42k will allow us to finish by Oct/Nov of 2013. Anything more will help us finish a bit sooner and have a better finished film.\nAnything over our stretch goal will allow us to start pre-production for the second film in the trilogy, HERO PUNK: PART II (and, believe me, we'd be dancing around the living room of our respective houses, listening to \"Walking on Sunshine\", while drinking cheap champagne and belting lyrics like we don't care who our neighbors are... that's how much we'd appreciate it).\nWe will be posting interviews, behind-the-scenes and much more over the next weeks, including interviews with Kanen (the director), Paul Del Vecchio (the co-cinematographer), Patrick Johnson (the co-cinematographer), Jamil Vaughn (who plays Lane) and much more.\nThank you!\nThanks for reading this long message.

Or worse, running out of juice while on an important conference call (or at the climax of a movie).   I had tried all the battery case add-ons and even a few of those $100.00 remote batteries, and was always left disappointed.  It seemed that they made their predictions in some kind of perfect world lab.   I set out last year to figure out what would make the perfect remote charging battery back up unit and I think I have landed it with my product.  \nFirst off we did real world load testing on tons of different battery systems and chemistries.  We selected lithium polymer and lithium Ion as our battery chemistry mostly for the quick charge times, length of idle charge holding and lifetime cycling strength. I personally think this is the best battery you can get and I have yet to have one let me down. \nAll The Models next to an iPhone 4S for comparison\nNext we had to find a way to package it that was traveler friendly, would not make the TSA think you are a terrorist and would work with all those existing cables I already had.  We discovered that having a USB with 2.1A output to charge tablets really made charging faster, so we had to fit that in.  I will admit the first few designs were a little clunky and failed to meet the aesthetic standards we set out to match. (Think Radio Shack Project Box and Duct Tape) The final three products however I think are really slick. They are all smaller than even the smallest paperback book.  The largest one, Destination  measures in at 3.75 x 5.25 and is only 5/8th of an inch thick and our smallest model, Adventurer, is 2.55 x 3.9 and is 3/4 of an inch thick. \nWe included some flashy-blinky LEDs to let you now how full your tank is...and then I realized they wasted power and annoyed some of my friends that I had asked to evaluate the prototypes.  So, we went a head and added a push button to check your batteries charge... it will light up indicating the level of charge (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and then turn off, not wasting precious milliamps and annoying your airline seat-mate. (I still like the Rave in a Box idea...but lost out to cooler heads).  The unit will flash status while you are charging it... since you recharge the power banks by plugging them into your computer's USB port anyway I thought the light show was a bonus. (if you don't like it flip if over) The following YouTube video shows you how easy it is to charge your devices and the batteries.  These are pre-produciton units off the production tooling!\nLastly we found a supplier of universal cables that supported a bunch of different mobile phones, gaming devices, tablets and digital cameras.  We negotiated what we think is a great price for these and decided to package our batteries with the whole kit.  Out of the box, with the included cables, you can charge: Iphone 3-4s, Ipad, PSP, Nokia, Micro 5 Pin USB, Mini USB, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and LG. Of course it will work with your existing cables too, but if you ever save someone who lost or forgot their cable, think of me...\nPlugs included with Universal Adaptor\nI have three models to offer you: \nOur 6600mAh version, the Adventurer ($30.00 reward), will charge an iPad from 20% to full one time or charge an iPhone, or similar mobile phone, 3-4x from zero to full.  (these are our real world tests, not theoretical numbers) The best results were at room temp, about 70F or 25c.  Charging time from zero to full for the battery from USB is about 6 to 8 hours.  You can expect a lifetime of over 500 charging cycles. \nThe Adventurer, Single USB, 6,600mAh\nOur 10,000mAh version, The Destination ($65.00 reward), has enough juice to recharge an iPad from zero to full about 1.5x.  Or your iPhone, or similar mobile phone, 6-8x from zero to full. (these are our real world tests, not theoretical numbers) The best results were at room temp, about 70F or 25c.  A full charge for this battery, from zero, is between 6 and 7 hours from a USB connection. This unit has a sleek brushed aluminum chasis that looks like a baby computing device from our favorite fruit company. The aluminum case helps with heat dissipation during charging and costs quite a bit more to make than the plastic case, but the heft and quality are impressive. (and it looks really cool sitting next to a MacBook or iPad)\nThe Destination, Dual USB, 10,000 mAh\nOur biggest capacity version, The Expedition ($50.00 reward), is a whopping 11,200mAh Lithium Ion battery that will charge your iPad 1.5x and your iPhone 2x on a single charge. Or you could charge your iPhone almost 10x from zero to full! This is our first use of Lithium Ion and we are very impressed.  An additional benefit of LI-Ion is only a 4-6 hour charge from empty to full form our Mac Pro Tower USB connection! This unit is in a high-impact polymer case and comes Black or White.  Best performance bang for the buck, but unfortunately this new battery will not fit in our existing brushed aluminum case. (YET!).\nThe Expedition, Dual USB, 11,200 mAh\nHere are photos of The Expedition and The Adventurer in Black\nBlack Destination for Reference\nI have made it through the prototype and pre-production phase with my own savings and the help of my manufacturing partners, and if I want to  keep making $500.00 one-offs I am set, but to get to full production I need to raise the funds to go into mass production, hire a web guy to build a direct sales site, and find a community of people who have had a chance to own and use the product to tell everyone how awesome it is! We have already completed FCC, CE and RoHS testing and certification. Once the project funds we will be  able to deliver production units within 4-6 weeks!  \nI am a solid-state lighting guy by trade.  I have spent all of my working life either selling LEDs or designing LED systems for everything from on/off indicators to parking garage luminaires.   This is not my first product, but the first one I am doing all by my onsies.  Whether you chose to support my project or not I would love your feedback and input on how we can make an even better remote battery solution! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk I have is not raising enough to create a full production run with my contract manufacturer in Shenzhen, China.

Read all about it here.\nUpdate: Halo Co-Creator Chooses LiveCode to Build Graphic Novel Experience\nThis is such an amazing new iOS app that we wanted to share details here.\nWhat is this Kickstarter Campaign About?\nHave you ever had an idea for an app but don\u2019t know how to code?\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to code but found it too difficult?\nHave you ever been frustrated by how long it takes to write an app?\nAre you frustrated with the current state of computer science education in high school?\nDo you want to help establish coding as a new form of literacy?\nAre you interested in a better way to write software for your company?\nIf you answered YES to any of these questions, then we need your help.\nIn 1987 Apple created a program called HyperCard. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, all you need to know is that tens of millions of end user programmers used it. It was the easiest and most popular end user programming environment ever created, before or since.\nLiveCode is like a next generation version of HyperCard. It is used to create #1 one app store apps, real-time flight booking systems and control satellites. It is used to create simple one off apps and utilities to solve day-to-day problems.\nThere are some things it can\u2019t do \u2013 yet. This project is to create a next-generation LiveCode.\nOur vision is that this new next-generation LiveCode will be free and open source.\nIt will run on every popular platform and device.\nIt will let you write programs in English.\nAnd by being open, its English language programming will be extensible to any computing problem out there. That's a world first.\nIf you couldn\u2019t code before, LiveCode is the answer. If you\u2019ve used the existing version of LiveCode before and it didn\u2019t do everything you needed, this next-generation version has you covered.\nWhat is LiveCode? Our story.\nComputer Science Students Love LiveCode\nAlmost a quarter of secondary schools in Scotland are now teaching with LiveCode.\nEvery school that has used LiveCode for more than a year has seen a doubling of uptake in advanced computer science classes!\nBy supporting this project, you\u2019ll be helping create a version of the platform even more suitable for teaching.\nIt will be free for schools and universities worldwide.\nWe believe that computational thinking and programming is a key form of digital literacy and that enabling a new generation to write interactive software is critically important in today's economy.\nStudents use LiveCode to create games and apps for their own smartphones and tablets. Although the LiveCode language is easy to use, it is a sophisticated and complete programming language suitable for teaching all aspects of computational thinking needed for this age group, even including advanced concepts for older students (e.g. arrays, parameter passing by reference). \nThe open source edition of LiveCode will be free and available to schools globally. Read more about LiveCode in Education.\nWhat is your money going toward?\nWe need to raise \u00a3350,000 to fund an experienced team to do this right.\nWe will re-engineer the whole platform so it is easy for the community to contribute to the code base. Did you know that Linux only took off after a version of it was created that was modularized with a kernel? We\u2019ll be doing the same to LiveCode. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about this here.\nWe will introduce a new technology called \u201cOpen Language\u201d. With Open Language, the more technical members of our community can create English-like words and phrases to enable everyone to write programs that use any aspect of a computer or device. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about that here.\nWe will introduce a new visual editor designed around today\u2019s usability standards. The editor will be open. The more technical members of our community can create simplified versions of the editor for tablets or primary schools.\nHere is a screenshot of the prototype:\nWhen Will it Be Completed?\nWithin a month of the campaign closing we will launch the Community Edition with the source code. That version will have the source code as it is today. This will provide everyone who has made a pledge access to the platform.\nOver the following few months we will be hard at work on the main goal of creating the next generation of the platform. We will restructure the code into modules that plug into a new kernel and deliver this version for testing over the summer. Once that is complete the community will be able to contribute to the source code easily.\nTechnical Summary of Kickstarter Deliverables\nWe are going to use the Kickstarter funding to deliver the next generation of the entire LiveCode language and visual development environment. To do this we need to do some packaging and updating, including:\nPacking the source code into community-friendly modules\nOptimize the execution engine and some older components\nAdd a clean architecture to allow new language plugins to be developed\nCreate a new, beautiful graphical front-end for building your apps\nThe scope of these tasks is considerable. We will be reorganizing some half a million lines of C++ code, running on six platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and Server, into straightforward modules that plug into the new kernel. We will be porting our English-like syntax into a new uniform virtual machine layer and adding a way to let the community add its own syntax. Another team will be working on re-designing the visual editor in parallel to make the platform even easier to get started with and use!\nWhile we will be making the code base available in its current form immediately, these important changes will take the platform to the next level, and make it much easier for the open source community to make contributions. At the end of this we will have a beautiful, consistent and openplatform.\nStretch Goals\nWe have designed the project to be flexible and there is so much more we can add to the new Open Source platform.\nWe have some truly amazing stretch goals - features for students, for gamers, for commercial companies and more. Supporting our stretch goals will let us deliver the future to you much faster. Example stretch goals include a brand new multimedia layer, new sprite capabilities and support for additional platforms!\nWe have goals covering virtually every enhancement request our customers have ever made, so please stay tuned.\nWho You Will Be Working With\nThe LiveCode Team - click to learn more about us\nRewards\nEvery pledge you make is so important to the success of this exciting project and we have developed fantastic rewards to thank you for your support.\nEveryone who contributes more than \u00a312 ($20) will get a complete set of LiveCode Training Academies where you can learn everything you need to know to create your own app or game.\nThe pricing in euros and US dollars is an estimate and your actual conversion rate may vary slightly.\nPlease Make a Pledge.

Help us reach our stretch goal for P&A (prints and advertising). Thank you!\nTHE STORY\nCHEATIN' is an animated adult tale of love, jealousy, revenge, and murder \u2013 full of nudity and violence, but also with my surreal sense of humor. The story is inspired by the work of James M. Cain (\u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d, \u201cThe Postman Always Rings Twice\u201d). CHEATIN' marks my 7th animated feature film.\nI've always enjoyed using watercolors in my illustrations, and now, for the first time, I can employ my painterly sensibilities to the treatment of my animation. This loose, almost impressionistic style has never been seen before in my films. Thanks to this new aesthetic and a beautiful, full-length musical score, I believe CHEATIN' will be a breakthrough for my career! Unfortunately this style is very difficult and time-consuming to complete.\nI am an artist and take great pride in my status as an independent filmmaker. I don't work with big production houses and I draw every frame myself. Including my Producer and Art Director, my studio employs 10 artists who need to digitally clean, paint, and composite over 40,000 animation drawings. We have an editor, composer, and sound designer working out-of-house, making the total staff under 20 people \u2013 quite small compared to the thousands on staff at large animation studios such as Pixar or Disney. For these reasons, it's very difficult to raise funds for this project, and that's why we need your support!\nWith your help, we hope to complete this landmark film by next September \u2013 just in time to qualify for the Oscars!\nThank you for your support!\n- Bill Plympton\nEXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER VIDEO UPDATES\nI will be posting exclusive Kickstarter videos once a week until the end of January.

I did not squander my money on drugs or a fancy home. I went from 1967-1994 before I saw my first royalty check. The music giants I recorded with only paid me for 7 of my albums. I have never seen a penny in royalties from my other 10 albums I recorded. Our hit song was licensed to over 100 films, TV & commercials without our permission. One major TV network used our song for a national commercial and my payment was $625 dollars. I am now 72, trying to live on $1200 a month. Sweet Relief, a music charity, is taking donations for me. Only the 1% of artists can afford to sue. I am the 99%.\u201d\nThe music industry may have screwed Lester Chambers for decades, but we the internet public can right their wrong.\nThanks to the open internet (things we fought for against SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, etc.), sites like Kickstarter and other innovations that are being worked on by entrepreneurs right now, we have the opportunity to do right by artists and cut out those who'd mistreat them. We have the opportunity to create solutions that will support artists in the digital world.\nThe Chambers Brothers\nLester Chambers is putting together a new album titled \"Lester's Time Has Come.\" With this project, we have the opportunity to support not only the awesome work of a storied and talented musician, but we have the chance to stand up against the tyranny of the record industry.

All the times I sat hoping and wishing I could make another record had finally come true. In this record I promise to have some of the worlds GREATEST songs from your past and some Great New songs for your new year to come!\"\nRead more about Lester in his interview with Vice.\nFather & Son\nEven with a daunting list of illnesses and a life of hardship at the hands of the music industry, Lester is not a beaten man, far from it, and it's clear that his son is a big part of that.\n\"My son, Michael Dylan, said 'Dad don't worry. I'm never gonna leave you. Always stay by your side.' He slept on the floor with me....

Barrie into a graphic novel that is as true to source as possible. The original story is one of the most beautiful novels I've every read, and has always been a huge inspiration to me. I feel current adaptations leave a lot of the original story left untold, or have fundamentally changed story elements. Therefore I feel doing this Graphic novel is a terrific way to highlight the fantastic original story of Peter Pan in it's entirety. I also intend to further explore Peter Pan and Captain Hook's backstory by adapting parts from J.M Barrie's The Little White Bird  ( prequel to Peter and Wendy) and a little known information given by Barrie about Jas. Hook into the story. \nI also would like to create something that parents can share with their children. It's my hope that creating something children can also experience will encourage reading, creativity, and appreciation of classic tales.\nThose that have not read the novel may not realize just how much deeper and more involved the original story is. I don't want to give away all the differences between present adaptations and source material, but I promise it will be worthwhile to experience them if you are a Peter Pan fan like I am.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n2 page spread preview (unlettered) This part adapted from \"The Little White Bird\"\nI am not a Peter Pan expert, I am just a person who is a lifelong fan who loves the story.  I'm so looking forward to starting this project, and to highlight J.M. Barrie's masterpiece to the best of my abilities.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n                              *   *   *\nWhy we need funding....\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to get VOLUME 1 (of 3) completed, and set the groundwork for the rest of the series. I will be adapting and penciling the artwork, while my husband, Ray Dillon, will be tackling inking, coloring and lettering. Ray and I previously worked on the New York Times Bestselling adaptation of Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn Graphic Novel by IDW. You can see some at our work on TLU HERE.\nI am focused on Volume 1 of Peter Pan right now because I don't want to keep backers waiting for over a year for the whole series to be completed before they receive their reward.\nUpon first sight, $48,000 seems like a lot of money. However, Kickstarter campaigns are not straight donations and in reality a campaign costs a lot  of time and money to fulfill rewards ordered and manage correspondance. So only part of the money asked for actually go towards creative production of the book. \nProduction costs- We are the entire creative team for the book, and if you break down what funding we'd get for the 90 pages of full production work we'd create, the rates break down to less than we would get paid elsewhere. I didn't even include funding for the time to adapt, letter, design, create promotional images, covers, pin ups, take care of the Kickstarter, or work on the sketchbook. In short; we are not becoming rich by any means with this campaign. Our only intent is to be able to work on Peter Pan, and be able to survive through it!\nKickstarter/Amazon Fees - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding\nTaxes -  self employed rates apply\nProduction of books - These rates vary depending on amount ordered, but takes up a nice chunk of funds\nShipping & shipping supply - Another large chunk, depending on amount shipped\nBuffer Amount - This should be included in ANY Kickstarter. This includes money aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any errors and miscalculations.\n                              *   *   *\nHow Kickstarter Works...\nKickstarter is unlike regular online ordering experiences in that you are not just buying an item for precise arrival, you are joining us in our personal adventure to complete this project. You'll be with us for both the victories as well as the bumps and difficulties, all culminating in receiving the final product which we have all given so much to achieve. Kickstarter is more about supporting ideas, people, and projects than it is to receive an item right away. Just so you're aware of everything before you join us in Neverland! :)\nStep 1. Create a Kickstarter account, and determine payment method\nStep 2. Decide which Reward you'd like, taking special note of any shipping estimates.\nStep 3. Wait and see what happens! If our campaign is successful by December 20th, then your card will be charged and your reward is secured. If our campaign is unsuccessful, then your card will NOT be charged.\nStep 4. (optional ;) ) If you would really like to see this project succeed, then the most helpful thing you could do is help spread the word! Tweets, facebook posts, blog posts, whatever you want to do to help, we would eternally appreciate it!\n                              *   *   *\nRewards...\nWe are aiming for September 2013 for delivery on most rewards. Please consider this includes an overestimate of about 4-5 months for research and production, 1 month for design, 2 months for printing, and 1 month for shipping.\n***Christmas 2012: For those who order Peter Pan: Vol. 1 as gifts, you will have access to a printable certificate on December 20th featuring new Holiday Peter Pan artwork. It will certify the recipient that they have a copy reserved for them for when the project is completed next year. They will also get a password protected URL link to visit to see the same previews and updates you receive as a Kickstarter Backer! :) Merry Christmas!\nUnless noted otherwise, ALL rewards include your name listed in the \"Honorary Lost Boys and Girls\" section of the book, as well as access to Kickstarter Exclusive previews and updates!\nTYPES OF REWARDS \nPeter Pan: The Graphic Novel - Vol. 1: This will be a hardcover, 100 page, full color graphic novel. The story will be about the first 3rd of the original story, as well as extra bits from The Little White Bird and, if space allows, a small peek at an adaptation of little know information given by J.M. Barries about Captain Hook. For bonus material I hope to include an interview with Christine De Poortere, Peter Pan director from the Great Ormond Street Hospital, as well as a brief biography spotlighting their relationship with Peter Pan.\nPeter Pan: The Companion Guide: A sketchbook sized 90 page booklet that includes ALL the penciled artwork for Volume 1, as well as thoughts and notes on the adaptation process by me!\nSigned/Sketch/Artwork Copies: These copies will require longer processing time as to have time to create the artwork on the interior cover :) Signed copies should be much faster.\nCameo Reward: This reward will require a photo and release of likeness form signed. I will send you a scan of your cameo when finished! :) Note: I probably won't have time for any revisions, but I'll do my best to make sure it's right!\nPage to Yourself Reward: Please contact beforehand to be sure we can print what you have in mind! :)\nEvent/Hooks Revenge Reward: Contact if you have any questions!\n*NEW* Penciled Page Reward - You'll receive one penciled page from the Graphic Novel. These pages are 11 x 17 and will be chosen at random (though if you have a requested section of the story, let me know and I'll try to accomodate!) HERE is a sample of my penciled work: Note - this sample is a 2 page spread. Your will be getting a standalone page\n*NEW* Tinker-Doodle Reward - (YES I noticed I typed \"dairy dust\" instead of \"fairy dust\" in the reward listing, and NO you will not be getting powdered milk with your reward! :p ) Here is the Tinker Bell Doodle to expect in the companion guide (though it may slightly vary)! There are slight gold \"fairy dust\" accents.\n                              *   *   *\n  Great Ormond Street Hospital...\nBefore J.M. Barrie passed, he relinquished all rights and profits to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in England. His hope was that Peter Pan's success would forever serve to help children in need. The novel version of Peter Pan is now in public domain, however I am determined to keep to the spirit of Barrie's gift. If somehow this series (Volume 1 and onward) becomes successful upon regular publication, it is my goal to benefit GOSH in some way. It is only right. \n                              *   *   *\nJOIN US ON THE ADVENTURE!\nPeterPanComic.com | Twitter | Facebook\nA VERY special thank you to Peter Mellini and his store, Nostalgic Book & Comics for helping us get this Kickstarter up and running!

Please add $5 to your total pledge for international orders.  And we will ask for your color preference and shipping address at the end of the campaign!\nThanks for checking out the Sunskis! We\u2019ve received a ton of support getting this far and we\u2019re really excited to finally share all of our hard work with everyone. We\u2019re bringing back some incredible vintage sunglasses that were nearly lost to the pages of history. There are only five pairs left on the planet, which is why we\u2019re here on Kickstarter\u2014to save these sunglasses from extinction! The new shades are stylish, polarized and contagiously fun to wear. \nWith your support, we'll be able to bring the Sunskis back, and you can be the first to wear these awesome shades in over 25 years! \n- Tom & Michael\nThree years ago, Tom returned from a surf trip in Australia with a curious souvenir tucked away in his carry-on.  Hiding among the sandy remains of his journey were a few pairs of colorful sunglasses called Sunskis. These vintage Australian shades haven\u2019t been made in 25 years, and Tom\u2019s few pairs turned out to be the last Sunskis of their kind. \nWe think Sunskis are a wonderful design treasure that shouldn\u2019t be lost, so we\u2019ve put our product design experience to the work over the past six months preparing the Sunski revival with improved craftsmanship for all to enjoy. Our updated Sunskis feature polarized lenses and hand-polished polycarbonate frames, all wrapped up in the original, vibrant design. The end result is the perfect blend between timeless style and modern sunglasses technology. \nIn 2009, Tom went to Australia on a shoestring budget surf trip. With a tent, a board, and a duffel bag, he made his way up and down the eastern Australian coast riding waves, making great friends, and accidentally stumbling across the Sunskis. \nWhile visiting family in the tiny coastal town of Forster, Tom found Sunskis in a mom-\u2018n-pop surf shop right by the beach. A handful of pairs were out on a small sidewalk table, and they really caught his eye. They were like no sunglasses he\u2019d seen before, so he bought the remaining pairs and wore them for the rest of his time in Australia. They quickly became his most coveted surf trip accessory, alongside his surfboard and tent.\nWhen Tom got back to the States, he started wearing them at home and people immediately began to ask about the shades. Since everybody wanted a pair for themselves, we started doing some research about the Sunskis to try to find out how to get more for our friends. We had to wait until the Australian summertime to call the seasonal surf shack in Forster, but after speaking with them we discovered they were sold out completely. We then tried to track down the original manufacturer, but that company went out of business more than 20 years ago.  With nowhere else to get Sunskis, we decided to use our own product design experience to bring these incredible frames back to life. \nThe new Sunskis will combine the best of the past and the present. We\u2019ve taken the timeless design of the original frames and rebuilt the Sunskis using the latest in cutting edge sunglasses manufacturing. Check it out!\nThe Sunski lenses are made from multiple thermally fused polycarbonate layers. The center layer contains a horizontally polarized film to cut glare from reflective surfaces and water. The colored layer contains a bi-gradient-tint film with a variable Visible Light Transmission rating of 12% at the edges and 18% in the center, making them ideal for environments which involve both strong sunlight and strong reflected light\u2014such as on the snow, at the beach or on the water. The flash mirrored layer heightens contrast and blocks 100% of all UVA, UVB and UV400 ultraviolet rays, far surpassing US ANSI Z80.3-2001 regulations. The final layer features a clear and durable scratch-resistant layer to keep them looking great no matter what you throw at them.\nThe frames are made from injection-polycarbonate plastics that are hand-polished and assembled. The construction material is the lightest and most durable available on the market, while the elasticity of the arms provides a universal fit for the wearer\u2019s face. It\u2019s also transparent and neon and awesome. The aluminum composite hinges feature a molded pin that is part of the frame material, preserving flexibility while heightening durability.\nOur biggest goal with this Kickstarter project is to get Sunskis out into the world so they can be enjoyed again. As a result, the rewards for your support are pretty simple: you get Sunskis! We\u2019re also offering two awesome t-shirt designs (available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles) celebrating the Kickstarter launch. If you choose a reward that includes a t-shirt, you can pick what style and size you would like at the end of our Kickstarter campaign. \nEvery rewards tier will include a handwritten thank you card and an invitation to our launch party in San Francisco. After that, we have a few options to choose from, all of which will get you at least one pair of polarized Sunskis. Check them out here, and alongside the campaign to the right. All U.S. shipping is free, but if you are an international friend, please add 5USD to your pledge. \n$5: The handwritten thank you!\n$30: One pair of Sunskis (any color)\n$50: One pair of Sunskis (any color) & a t-shirt\n$60: Two pairs of Sunskis (any color)\n$80: Two pairs of Sunskis (any color) & a t-shirt\n$120: All four colors of the Sunskis & a t-shirt\n$250: 12 pairs of Sunskis (3 of each color) and a t-shirt, ideal for retailers and sunglasses mavens! \nThat pretty much sums it up.

We created Antigua Leather after being captivated by the quality of craftsmanship produced by leather artisans in Guatemala.\n\nWe built a relationship with a small group of exceptional artisans in Antigua, Guatemala who have honed their skills for generations, and together designed and crafted these beautiful products. We have combined traditional manufacturing methods while still maintaining style and functionality, to create products that can withstand the strenuous life of a traveler while suiting the needs of a student or businessman.\n\nYour Contribution:\nOur goal is to start this project by bringing handmade, authentic leather bags and cases from Guatemala to Kickstarter backers around the world. Kickstarter funding will cover the production costs and shipping.\n\nOur designs, production and shipping plans are finalized and are ready to go into action the moment our project is successful. \n\nThis project represents an excellent and beneficial opportunity for the Kickstarter backer, as our backers will not only receive one of our excellent leather products, but will additionally be supporting a new opportunity for hardworking, talented artisans in Guatemala.\n\nThe Products:\nMany \"high end\" designer bags on the market are only exceptional in price, not durability or design. Antigua Leather bags offer impeccable design and construction at a fraction of the price of a designer bag. Our motto: Pay for the bag, not the brand. These bags are durable, beautiful, and are fashioned from natural, pure leather instead of highly processed or synthetic materials. Antigua Leather presents to you three high quality, stylish items made specifically for the modern electronics you use everyday.\nThe Antigua Leather messenger bag is designed for modern laptops and tablets. We offer a 13\",  15\" and 17\" option to house your laptop and iPad with room to spare. Our iPad and iPhone leather cases provide a safe way to protect your device with a simple, durable leather sleeve.\nOur bags are designed in a minimalist style with the traveler, student and professional in mind. These bags will endure the daily stresses of the trail, and the office, while showing off a unique, authentic and timeless style.\nConstructed of full grain 3/16\u201d thick leather, the durability of these bags is one of their strongest assets. They feature alloy buckles and thick, sturdy stitching. These bags are tough and we are confident it will stand up to your high demands. The leather is rugged and will resist crumbling and tearing far better than most highly processed leathers on the market, but will also conform to your body shape and become more pliable with use.\nEach bag will be inspected for quality by hand before it is delivered. Quality, craftsmanship and backer satisfaction is our number one priority.\n\nWhy Antigua Leather?:\nComing from a world dominated by big-box stores and the convenience of cheap, disposable products, we wanted to break the trend of cheap, mass-manufactured goods. \n\nWe focused on providing cases for modern electronics that form the daily toolset of the modern student and businessman. We have worked closely with the artisans to design these high quality, unique products for the modern market. \n\nWe created a great line of tough, stylish bags that combine the craftsmen\u2019s traditional workmanship and quality with modern needs for durability, style and functionality. We hope you will support our vision and support this project. We look forward to sending you a unique, hand-crafted, quality leather case that will last you for years to come.\nMaking a Pledge to Antigua Leather:\nThank you for choosing to make our project a reality! Over to the upper right hand side of our project page, there are several different pledge tiers available with Rewards.\nIf you choose to pledge for the Bundle Pack, that includes one 15\" or 13\" Messenger Bag, one iPad sleeve and one iPhone sleeve, we added a discount if you order all three of our products together rather than individually.\nLastly, as you may have noticed, the Antigua Leather Signature Messenger Bag comes in two colors; Light Brown and Dark Brown. The iPhone and iPad cases come in three different colors; Light Brown, Brown, and Dark Brown.\nImmediately following the conclusion of our successful campaign, we will request your shipping address and also your preference for color.

Starring Jodelle Ferland of Silent Hill and Claudia Christian of Babylon 5, the film is the debut feature effort of Films by Neptune, a dynamic new production company based in San Francisco. Red will be distributed by RSquared Distribution.\nThe Film\nBased on the classic fairytale Little Red Riding Hood, Films by Neptune's Red follows teenage Rowan as she moves to San Francisco to live with her grandmother. But when unforseen circumstances force her to stay in a hotel instead, she tests her newfound independence out in the city, falling in with an older man who seems too good to be true. Are his intentions for her good? And if not, can she get away before it's too late?\nThe Cast\nLeading our cast as Rowan is Jodelle Ferland, star of Case 39 and Tideland, and recently featured in Twilight: Eclipse as the vampire Bree.\nClaudia Christian also stars as Marlena, a woman with a mysterious connection to Rowan.\nJoining Jodelle and Claudia is James Russell, star of 476 AD and festival hit short film The Crustacean Crisis.\nThe Crew\nWe have a fantastic crew of experienced Bay Area filmmakers working on the film, including Ben Einhorn and Wes Warfield on camera, Randy Hall on sound, Rachael Bell handling production design, and Alex Neil heading post-production.  Our writer and director is Danielle Colman, and our lead producer is Benjamin Yennie.\nWhy should I support Red?\nFor starters, \"Red\" is the finest example of independent film at its best.  Our shooting budget is tiny, but our cast and crew are world-class.  We started with a fantastic script, and that drew together a talented and dedicated team of actors and filmmakers, each of whom is bringing a unique voice to the production.  Every crew member has spent hours and hours working - so far for free - to give \"Red\" the level of detail and richness that it absolutely deserves, and it's poised to be an unforgettable experience on screen.\nMore importantly, \"Red\" deals with an incredibly relevant social issue: the issue of trust, and how that trust can be betrayed.  The lead character, Rowan (played by Jodelle), has to navigate a difficult new city in which no one is quite who they appear to be, and when she mis-judges whom she can trust, she finds her life hanging in the balance.  The mis-use of power and abuse of trust is something that real people go through every day: in fact, during our last Kicktarter campaign, one of our crew members found herself in a situation very close to what Rowan experiences over the course of the film.  We want \"Red\" to be more than just an entertaining film: we want it to be a story in which people with similar experiences can find an honest, respectful portrayal to which they can relate, and a cast of characters who can give those experiences voice.\nHow Kickstarter Works\nKickstarter is a platform for filmmakers and artists like us to raise funds from our audience: people like you. Anyone can pledge to the project, and in return we keep you informed about our efforts, and send out incentives and rewards once the money is raised. You can pledge any amount you like: for $1, you get access to exclusive updates from the cast and crew, and for $10,000, we'll fly the director, producer and a limited-edition DVD or Blu-ray of the film out to your location for a private screening party. In between, we're offering downloads of the film, special edition DVDs and Blu-rays, and replica production art, props and costumes from the film itself. Have a look to the right to see what we're offering at different pledge levels.\nPromotional buttons, available at the $7 pledge level\nTo help out, click on the amount you'd like to pledge, and Kickstarter will guide you through the process of selecting your reward and setting up your payment. Your card won't be charged until the end of the campaign, and only if we raise our goal. For more information, have a look at the Kickstarter FAQs.\nSPECIAL REWARDS\nRowan's and Marlena's gowns from the party scene, each available at the $750 pledge level. Designed by Roman Voytko Barosse.\nIn addition to rewards ranging from signed posters up to a personalized premiere party, we're also offering a limited number of special rewards, which will be actual items used during filming.  Keep an eye out throughout the campaign for these unique rewards!\nIsn't $25,000 kind of low? Is that enough to make a feature film?\nIn order, yes and sort of. $25,000 is only a fraction of our full budget, and it's not enough to make the whole film. But what it is enough to do is take care of a few key things that will persuade our other investors to come on board. Firstly, we'll be using the money to attach an actor to the lead male role and round out our amazing cast. We'll also use the money to kick pre-production into high gear, so that by the time we get to shooting we'll be ready to put something truly incredible on film.\nWhat happens if you don't reach $25,000?\nAbsolutely nothing. You don't get charged, we don't send out the incentives, and we go back to more traditional methods of trying to get the film financed. Unfortunately, that makes it anyone's guess whether we'll be able to get the film made at all.\nWhat happens if you raise more than $25,000?\nThat's the real question, isn't it?  $25,000 is only the very beginning of what we need to make this film, but our last campaign told us that we have enough fans to make that goal.  If we can succeed at that early in the campaign, then we want to use that success to push ourselves to raising even more money for the film!  Once we get close to $25,000, we'll start adding stretch goals so you can see exactly what we need to progress with different parts of making the film.  The more we raise on Kickstarter, the less we have to raise from investors, and the sooner we can go into production!\nLinks\nFind out more by going to the following links:\n\"Red\" on IMDB\nOur homepage\nOur Facebook page\nOur Twitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Hello backers", "update_content": "Hi backers,\nIt looks like Producer Ben has been posting some updates without running them by me, so I thought I'd clear things up some.\nIt is true that the project has been sold to my personal production company, Sognetto Films.

We will organize after-school programs at the center so children can learn how to knit and keep this tradition alive.\nEach pair of socks gets us one step closer to the knitting center.\nWe plan to open the center in time for winter, giving the women a place to knit when the weather turns cold. By sending Bloc Socks as early holiday gifts to your friends and family, you can help us give an early New Year's present to the knitting women of Patalenitsa.\nThe Debut Line of Bloc Socks (all except Valentina available at 45 $ level)\n1) The Dayko embodies the Bloc Sock style philosophy.

We plan to offer the style in a range of colors for both women and men, including tan and gold.\nToepa\n3) The Burgas is our indoor-outdoor model. The cable-knit, ankle-length slipper is thick and rugged enough to handle wood floors as well as the great outdoors.\nBurgas\n4) We named Sofia after the capital of Bulgaria, and this feminine indoor-outdoor slipper features a classic web pattern and a deep rose color.\nSofia\n5) The calf-length Zora has stolen the spotlight with her rings of bright color and tiny heart-shaped openings.\nZora\n6) Kalina is Zora's darker, more subtle sister. She's knit with more texture, deeper colors, and traditional bordering.\nKalina\n7) The feminine Meeka features a traditional pattern with a raised plume in front and two bands of purple woven around the ankle.\nMeeka\n8) Varna has a name that comes from the sea but a pattern that comes from the leaves of Bulgaria's autumn trees. Here she is in traditional brown and tan.\nVarna\n9) The Sebas, like the Dayko, is a versatile, ankle-cut slipper. It features a traditional weave pattern in front and alternating rows along the sides.\nSebas\n10) The Nadya is a delicate house slipper with a distinguished collar at the ankle opening. Here we have it in gold and bronze.\nNadya\n11) Valentina takes a traditional Bloc Socks pattern up to the knees.

All you need to do is choose how many MiniDrives you want, and we will collect your choice of model (i.e. the Nifty MiniDrive Pro, the Nifty MiniDrive [Air], or the Nifty MiniDrive Retina), as well as your choice of color and shipping address in our email survey at the end of the campaign.\nUPDATE - MiniDrive for the Retina MacBook Pro now available: See Update #2 for details.\nIMPORTANT: The MiniDrive does not come with a MicroSD card - that must be bought separately and can be easily acquired at almost any online or high street consumer electronics retailer :-)\nNOTE: A couple of people have pointed out to us that we have mixed our terms a little. To clarify; when we refer to the MiniDrive increasing the \"memory\" of your computer, we mean the storage space, not RAM. Sorry for any confusion that this might have caused!\nTHE PROTOTYPE\nThe main difference between the prototype and the production model is that we change the casing material of the body from mostly aluminium to an engineering plastic.\nThe front of the MiniDrive (the bit can be seen when the drive is inserted into the computer and is used for removal) will still be machined from high grade aluminium to ensure the fit and finish matches the MacBook.\nNote 1: The MiniDrive is really easy to remove from your computer - you just stick a paper-clip through the specially designed eyelet at the front of the device to pull it out!\nThe first time you use a paper-clip you can use the front of the drive to bend the paper-clip into a little hook - then you have your very own MiniDrive removal tool! Macgyver would be proud.\nOr, if you are not the paper-clip kind; if you can help us get over $500,000 pledges before the end of the Kickstarter campaign, we will be sending one of these out free with every MiniDrive we ship:\nThe Nifty Tool - Specially designed for removing your MiniDrive\nSee our updates for more details on the Nifty Tool!\nNote 2: The devices shown on all videos are the prototypes we made to test the concept - the appearance of the production drives will be as close to the following pictures as possible:\nNifty MiniDrive - for the Macbook Air\nNifty MiniDrive Pro - for the Macbook Pro\nNote 3: Pink and blue are special editions for our Kickstarter supporters, and will not be initially offered after the Kickstarter campaign.\nWHAT IS THE NIFTY MINIDRIVE?\nThe Nifty MiniDrive is an easy to use device that allows anyone to quickly and simply increase the available memory in their MacBook computer, as well as providing a set and forget back-up solution. \nThe Nifty MiniDrive + MicroSD Card\nTHE STORY\nIt all started with the MacBook Air. We wanted to create an easy way to add memory to the MacBook Air, without having to rip it open with a torx screwdriver.\nThe easiest way to do that of course is to use an external hard disk drive, but as that is not really integrated with the computer we thought we could do better.\nThe MiniDrive is designed to be an integrated solution to that problem by using the SD card slot in the 13\" MacBook Air.\nWhile a normal SD card, which sticks out by about 1cm from the body of the computer when fully inserted, the MiniDrive is designed to sit completely flush with the body of the MacBook, becoming a semi permanent part of your computer.\nWe made our first protoype by 3D printing our design out of plastic before building a smalll batch of working prototypes that we had indiviually precision machined out of aircraft grade aluminium\nPrototyping the MiniDrive\nWe also developed a simple way of removing the MiniDrive from the computer by hooking a paperclip through our specially designed eyelet at the front of the device.\nTHE PRODUCTS\nWe are proud to announce the launch of not one but two products; the MiniDrive and the MiniDrive Pro.\nThe MiniDrive and the MiniDrive Pro have been designed to fit securely into the SD slot of the MacBook computers.\nThe MiniDrive in the Macbook Air\nThe MiniDrive Pro in the Macbook Pro\nBy utilising standard micro SD cards the MiniDrive can add plug in and forget memory to your computer.\nThe MiniDrive & MicroSD Card\nThis gives you the extra space for the things that are most important to you - holiday snaps, music, movies and any documents you may need with you, wherever you go.\nTHE MINIDRIVE AS A BACK-UP SOLUTION\nOne of the cool things about Micro SD cards is that they are practically indestructible - in fact a major manufactuer of them claims their cards can survive under the sea for over 24 hours, withstand 1.6 tons of force, and are impervious to magnets and X-rays.\nTherefore, when combined with the Nifty MiniDrive, this makes them perfectly suited as a primary back-up disk.\nAs the Minidrives are designed to stay in your computer without getting in the way, a daily back-up  of your critical files may be set up and then happen automatically without having to remember to plug anything in.\nThen if you happen to spill coffee on your computer or drop it down the stairs, or some other disaster strikes you will not be forced to re-do days, weeks or even months worth of work, or even worse lose memories in the form of photos, or videos that may be irreplaceable.\nTECH SPECS - Micro SD cards\nAll MacBook Air and Pro computers from the mid 2010 refresh onwards have a Secure Digital Extended Copacity, or SD XC card reader in their SD card slot.\nThis format can support a Micro SD card of up to 2TB - roughly 2000GB in size. The largest capacity Micro SD card available to put in a MiniDrive today is 64GB which would already increase by 50% the capacity of an entry level 13\" MacBook air.\nOf course we are excited to see what the memory manufacturers will be doing in this highly active market in the near future.\nTECH SPECS - Nifty Minidrive\nFor us it is critical that the finish and quality of the drives match the computer for which they have been designed for.\nThis is particularly true for the aluminium front of the MiniDrive, as this must become as much like the computer it sits within in order to truly become part of it.\nTo achieve this we will be putting the aluminium of the MiniDrives through the same kind of rigorous anodising process that the Macbook Air and MacBook Pro go through themselves.\nBut of course, it is not just how good it looks that counts, but also how well it works, and to ensure reliability and longevity we have selected components that have been tested to be reliable for over 10,000 insertions and removals of a Micro SD card as well as coating our main connectors with immersion gold to enure the connection to your MacBook does not degrade over time.\nTHE MANUFACTURING PLAN\nThe money we raise on Kickstarter will help us pay for the tooling needed to commercially produce the MiniDrive, as well as the cost of materials themselves.\nAlmost all of our manufacture and assembly is done in the UK, using high quality local expertise in machining and manufacture. The exception to this is the circuit-boards which are printed and assembled in China by a UK based company, as the UK, sadly, does not seem to have facilities to print 0.4mm circuit board.\nManufacturing schedule:\n- End of Kickstarter campaign\n- Up to 20 days for funds to clear (yes 20!!)\n- Week 1: Order placed for the MiniDrive injection mould to be made\n- Week 1: Order placed for machined fronts for MiniDrive & MiniDrive Pro\n- Week 1: Order placed for PCB manufacture & assembly\n- Week 3-4: Machined fronts sent for finishing and anodising\n- Week 5-6: Finished machined fronts received and checked. \n- Week 5-6: Finished and assembled PCBs received and tested.\n- Week 4-6: Tooling for injection mould finished + first 50 sent to check for mould finalisation.\n- Week 6-8: Final injection moulded components delivered\n- Week 7-8: MiniDrives assembly and testing.\n- Week 9: MiniDrives dispatched.\n- Week 10: MiniDrives arrive\nBased on above - expect shipping at the end of October/start of November.\nWHERE WE ARE\nSo that's the MiniDrive, we have finished the design and made the prototypes, and we're just about to start production. But we need your help to get the MiniDrive into your computer.\nWe hope you'll join us, thank you!\nFollow The Nifty MiniDrive on Twitter! @NiftyMiniDrive\nFor high resolution images: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ncgtu5tyv2dmc44/h_VXQS3piU", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Lessons learnt, a big thank you and some information if you are thinking about starting out!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nSo, it has been a long journey to here.

Starring Jodelle Ferland of Twilight: Eclipse and Silent Hill, the film is the debut feature effort of Films by Neptune, a dynamic new production company based in San Francisco.  Red will be distributed by RSquared Distribution.\nThe Film\nBased on the classic fairytale Little Red Riding Hood, Films by Neptune's Red follows teenage Rowan as she moves to San Francisco to live with her grandmother.  But when unforseen circumstances force her to stay in a hotel instead, she tests her newfound independence out in the city, falling in with an older man who seems too good to be true.  Are his intentions for her good?  And if not, can she get away before it's too late?\nThe Cast\nLeading our cast as Rowan is Jodelle Ferland, star of Case 39 and Tideland, and recently featured in Twilight: Eclipse as the vampire Bree. \nClaudia Christian also stars as Marlena, a woman with a mysterious connection to Rowan. \nJoining Jodelle and Claudia is James Russell, star of 476 AD and festival hit short film The Crustacean Crisis.  Two of the lead roles are still being cast - and that's a big part of what brings us to KickStarter.\nThe Crew\nWe have a fantastic crew of experienced Bay Area filmmakers working on the film, including Ben Einhorn and Wes Warfield on camera, Randy Hall on sound, Rachael Bell handling production design, and Alex Neil heading post-production.  We'll start posting crew bios and interviews as the campaign progresses, and one of the first things we'll do with the money we raise is hire more crew to fill out our key departments.  Our writer and director is Danielle Colman, and our lead producer is Benjamin Yennie.\nHow Kickstarter Works\nKickStarter is a platform for filmmakers and artists like us to raise funds from our audience: people like you.  Anyone can pledge to the project, and in return we keep you informed about our efforts, and send out incentives and rewards once the money is raised.  You can pledge any amount you like: for $1, you get access to exclusive updates from the cast and crew, and for $10,000, we'll fly the director, producer and a limited-edition DVD or Blu-ray of the film out to your location for a private screening party.  In between, we're offering downloads of the film, special edition DVDs and Blu-rays, and replica production art, props and costumes from the film itself.  Have a look to the right to see what we're offering at different pledge levels.\nPromotional buttons, available at the $6 pledge level!\nTo help out, click on the amount you'd like to pledge, and Kickstarter will guide you through the process of selecting your reward and setting up your payment.  Your card won't be charged until the end of the campaign, and only if we raise our goal.  For more information, have a look at the Kickstarter FAQs.\nNEW: SPECIAL REWARDS\nRowan's signature red hoodie - original now available for $500! (logos by Jessica Jampolsky)\nIn response to requests from some of our backers, we're now offering select original prop and wardrobe items from the film.  Keep checking back: we'll be offering more as the week goes on!\nRowan's and Marlena's gowns from the party scene (designed by Roman Voytko Barosse)\nIsn't $50,000 kind of low?  Is that enough to make a feature film?\nIn order, yes and sort of.  $50,000 is only a fraction of our full budget, and it's not enough to make the whole film.  But what it is enough to do is take care of a few key things that will persuade our other investors to come on board.  Firstly, we'll be using the money to attach more actors to the project, since a great cast is one of the first things an investor looks for in a film project.  We'll also use the money to kick pre-production into high gear, so that by the time we get to shooting we'll be ready to put something truly incredible on film.\nWhat happens if you don't reach $50,000?\nAbsolutely nothing.  You don't get charged, we don't send out the incentives, and we go back to more traditional methods of trying to get the film financed.  Unfortunately, that makes it anyone's guess whether we'll be able to get the film made at all.\nWhat happens if you raise more than $50,000?\nYou mean, aside from lots of celebration and possibly some very dorky dancing at Films by Neptune HQ?  Well, that really depends on how much!  Every penny raised on Kickstarter (aside from what goes to Kickstarter fees) will go straight into the film's production.  The more money we raise here, the less we have to get from investors, and the sooner we can start filming!\nLinks\nFind out more by going to the following links:\n\"Red\" on IMDB\nOur homepage\nOur Facebook page\nOur Twitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Films by Neptune\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nUnder new management as Sognetto Films (owned by Dani Colman)See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "On pledging for round 2", "update_content": "Hi backers,\nMost of you should have heard from me by now about coming back to support Round 2 of Red's Kickstarter campaign.

This is why we created Brydge. \nThis idea of adding a high quality hinging keyboard to your iPad seemed obvious to us and we were shocked when we could not find any accessory that accomplished this. So we set out to make such a product to perfectly compliment your iPad.\nBrydge is an elegant solution to the lack of quality iPad keyboards and accessories currently on the market.

When paired together Brydge and your iPad appear to be two parts of the same device, blending style and functionality seamlessly. Unlike other products made of painted plastic in an effort to look similar to the iPad, Brydge does not fake it. Not only does it look good, but when held in your hands you can feel the quality craftsmanship Apple lovers demand.\nWatch our \"Keyboard Comparison\" video to see what sets Brydge apart\nBrydge's patent-pending hinge holds the iPad secure and allows for close to 180 degrees of positioning. While many stands offer a non-adjustable ledge to lean your iPad up against, Brydge's hinge allows you to position your iPad at nearly any angle, even allowing you to close it up entirely for easy transportation. Once closed, both your iPad and Brydge go to sleep automatically.\nHinge made of metal alloys and magnets, with a thermoplastic elastomer shell\nBrydge\u2019s hinge combines the forces of friction and magnetism to hold strongly onto the iPad. There is no need to enclose your iPad in any sort of case, instead, your iPad snaps in and is ready to go. If you need your iPad free from Brydge, simple hold down on the Brydge and pull your iPad free.\nOptional Stereo Speakers \nBrydge connects with your iPad via bluetooth, so there is no need to deal with any wires or plugs. This was important aesthetically, but also adds to the portability and convenience of the product. Additionally, the keyboard has been designed specifically for an iPad, with iPad functions built in and charges through a USB connection.\nKickstarter is an amazing tool that has helped introduce you to our product so that we can raise this capital. We have come so far and have a clear plan to cross the finish line, but part of that plan relies on you.

But with my STEELIE, my phone is easy to mount in a difficult location, and easy access in the heat of battle, as it were. And I simply don't have to worry about whether or not its going to stay, or if I got the holder correctly.  In my cars, the STEELIE makes me even happier - it has a tastefulness and simplicity that perfectly compliments the good looks of the iPhone or my iPad.  There's no clips or holders showing - elegant. The same ease of use makes it perfect for the car.  Easy to attach, easy to point just where you need it, and to move for a passenger to see, too.  GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SUPPORT, good people to work with. Plus, we all know, magnets are cool.\" - James Sly, SLY's Restaurant, Carpenteria California.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've made a couple hundred STEELIE's, sold them around town and people think they are great.  Not one complaint or return. We believe we have a good idea, but we need to know if we have a GREAT idea. KICKSTARTER funding will allow us to upgrade some of our older equipment and purchase a used laser engraver.  We hope to ramp up production so there will be \"No Tablet Left Behind\".  KICKSTARTER feedback will help us make our products better.\n4 Guys, 4 Walls\nThe 4 guys that work inside the 4 walls of BlackGlass Design, LLC are out to prove that quality products can be \"machine made by man\" and shipped directly to the consumer.  We make it, you buy it. No middleman, no going overseas to make our product.  We design, manufacture, package, and ship from our shop in Boulder, Colorado, USA.   We're making it, not faking it.\nSTEELIE was born when a friend asked Frank to make a handle for his new tablet.  Frank designed a magnetic holding system (the Hobknob), which led him to design the STEELIE Table Top Stand, which then led him to design a smaller version that works with cell phones.  The name STEELIE comes from the precision steel ball that we use in our design. Remember when you were a kid and having a STEELIE was the coolest marble in your collection?  We do.\nSTEELIE uses American craftsmanship and the finest quality materials to create the world's finest mobile device holders.\nintergalactic space craft quality class 6061 aluminum. \nA grade 10 ultra smooth hard chrome steel ball.\nRare-earth neodynium magnets made to our specifications.\nNickel plated steel for corrosion protection.\nLaser etched markings. \nType 2/Class 2 military spec anodized aluminum finish.  \nThe HOBKNOB uses a genuine made in China rubber bouncy ball.\n3M high performance adhesives tapes\nindustrial grade high friction silicone.\nWe currently source our magnets from Asia, however we are looking for a US manufacturer for supply.  If you know of a US magnet source, please let us know!\nWe'll punch you...for FREE!\nDo you want the STEELIE ring magnet to stick directly on the phone or tablet and come through a hole in your case?  We have a fancy punch machine that will cut a perfect hole in any case so the magnet can pop through.  Send us your case and we will punch yours for free and send it back to you same day, postage paid.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: will a magnet harm my tablet or phone?                                                         NO.  Magnets have no effect on solid state electronics such as phones and tablets.  STEELIE does use a strong magnet so use caution around magnetically sensitive items such as credit cards, pacemakers and hard drives. STEELIE assumes no liability for damage to such devices.\nQ: How does the STEELIE magnet attach to my phone or tablet?                A: STEELIE uses a high performance 3M adhesive to attach to your phone or tablet.  While the adhesive is incredibly strong and durable, you can remove the magnet from your device by swabbing some rubbing alcohol between the device and the magnet, weakening the 3M adhesive bond.  Slowly, the alcohol will dissolve the adhesion allowing you to remove the magnet. DO NOT REUSE the 3M adhesive.  We will be happy to mail you a new one free of charge if you email us.\nQ: What if i want to remove the dash ball from my car dash?  Is it permanent?    \nA: NO. While the 3M adhesive is very strong, it can be pulled off of any dash without causing damage. Again, use a bit of rubbing alcohol to weaken the bond. A bit of silicone protectant (such a ArmorAll) will return your dash to original condition.  DO NOT REUSE the 3M adhesive. We will be happy to mail you a new adhesive free of charge.\nQ: what if I get a new phone or a new tablet?  How would I transfer the STEELIE on my new device?\nA:  The STEELIE 3M adhesive is designed for one time use .  We will gladly send you a new adhesive FREE OF CHARGE FOR LIFETIME of product.  Just email us at answers@STEELIE.com and we will send you what you need.\nQ: Why is international shipping $40.00?\nA: Because we want to make sure you get your STEELIE.  We offer USPS international Express shipping so we can track to your door.  If we hit our funding, we will offer more affordable, but NOT TRACKABLE or guaranteed delivery, shipping. \nQ: Does my mobile device slip or move on the mount?\nA: STEELIE's design allows it to be positioned and hold to almost any viewing angle you desire. The TABLE TOP STAND holds your device at the angle you want. In your car, normal vehicle vibrations have no effect. If slippage occurs,  simply wipe the steel ball with rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt or oils.  Slippage will then stop.\nAny other questions?

If you think Remee deserves to be available at Brookstone, vote here!\nLucid Dreaming, really?\nYes, really! For nearly as long as recorded human history, the idea of consciously recognizing and controlling our dreams has been around. From the Hindu Upanishads to Aristotle's On Dreams, people have been puzzling out the mysteries of lucid dreaming for centuries. These days, there's more information on Lucid Dreaming, the science behind it, and modes and methods of experiencing it than there ever has been. Yet the idea still remains relatively unknown to the average person.\nTo us, this is kind of a shame, sort of like being unaware of the existence of books or music. Lucid Dreaming can be one of the most profound things you can experience in this life - but explaining it to someone who has never done it can be a bit difficult. It is so visceral and hard to put into words that it can rarely be related in a meaningful way to a non-lucid dreamer. Conversely, when a lucid dreamer meets another lucid dreamer comin' through the rye, general excitement and lots of note-comparing ensues. It almost feels like a secret club. We want you to be in that club, too. \nGreat, but why would I want to do it?\nThis is an easy one. You saw in our video some of the more creative applications of Lucid Dreaming. Sure, you can perform any feat from the sublime to the superhuman. But the potential benefits of lucid dreaming are truly limitless. Flying through the galaxy riding a giant kitten might not be your thing, but what about having a roundtable discussion with your ego and id? Maybe you can finally get over your fear of public speaking in the safety of your own dreams. What about trying to write a short story, or compose a melody? Paul McCartney and Mary Shelley, among others, might have a lot to say about harnessing the creative power of dreams. Build skyscrapers in your mind, attack unsolved mathematical problems, or just try and figure out what happened at the end of Lost. Lucid dreaming is a path, a journey - what lies at the end of the path, magnificent or mundane, is your call.\nOk, but why Remee?\nThere's a lot more to Lucid Dreaming than simply acknowledging that it's real and crossing your fingers. It's tough! Your body has a been dreaming one way for your entire life, so teaching it to dream a new way requires some effort. Dozens of websites have cropped up where lucid dreamers, novice and expert alike, flock to swap stories and tips. Some of these techniques include Reality Checks - a quick \"lucid test\" that requires forming simple habits during waking life that you then perform during dreams. Other methods, like WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming) involve taking a very active role in the process of falling asleep, which can lead to entering directly into a dream from wakefulness. Remee aims to make all of this a lot easier by providing recognizable external input into your dreams. You may find that you don't have to remember to ask \"am I dreaming?\" and count your fingers - with its customizable light patterns, Remee is doing the reminding for you. You may find yourself sitting at an outdoor bistro with Ellen Page and suddenly a soft pattern of red lights appears in your field of vision. Back and forth. Back and forth. \"That looks familiar.\" you think. Wait. Remee! That's Remee! I'm dreaming! This is a dream! \nBoom. Congratulations. You're lucid. With luck, and a little help from Remee, you can stay that way!\nHere's some great info for people new to the concept:\nWNYC's Radiolab - We've been listening to Radiolab for ages, so we thought it was great when they recently released a short about someone using lucid dreaming to overcome a recurring nightmare.  The podcast has a great overview of lucid dreaming and is as usual well produced and entertaining.\n/r/LucidDreaming - Reddit's active, knowledgeable, helpful Lucid Dreaming community. 25,000 dreamers strong and growing!\nLucidipedia - A veritable treasure trove of information about the practice of lucid dreaming. Tips, tricks, & techniques.\nExploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge - from the father of all modern advancements in lucid dreaming research, and the creator of several useful lucid techniques, comes this, the Lucid Dreamer's bible.\nSo how does it work?\nSleep stages are divided into two main categories: non-REM sleep and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, where dreams typically occur.  Over the course of the night a sleeper will cycle through the five stages of sleep a number of times with the REM stages lasting longer and longer towards morning. \nIn default mode, Remee targets these long chunks of REM sleep towards the end of the sleep period. Before bed, turn Remee on, fine tune the brightness of the lights (if needed) and then go to sleep.  Remee will wait for an initial long delay, usually 4-5 hours, until you're in the heart of the heavy REM stages, before initializing light patterns.  After the initial long delay Remee will display light patterns for 15-20 seconds with a second shorter delay, default at 15 minutes, between each signal.  During non-REM sleep the lights are unlikely to effect you, but if you're in REM sleep the lights will bleed into your dreams, presenting a perfect chance to become lucid.\nWhy six lights and why red?\nWe spent a lot of time making sure that Remee's lights were configured in such a way that it would work well for all face shapes and head sizes. Six lights creates a much larger effective signal area so that even if the mask shifts during sleep you'll still most likely have at least a few lights over your eyes.  Even cooler, by having six lights we make it possible to create much more unique signals that can strobe, sweep and blink in ways that are not only recognizable, but that stimulate your visual field in a more tangible way.  In addition,  red light penetrates skin much more readily than other wavelengths.  Remember when you were a kid and you put a flashlight in your mouth to make your cheeks glow red? That happens because red light is able to pass through your skin, and in the case of Remee, your eyelids, much more easily.  On a side note, red LEDs also use much less power than other colors so we were able to keep you from strapping a 9v battery to your head.\nCustomizable, you say?\nYou bet. You'll be able to edit the standard full night sleep long delay and short delay, as well as setting both the short and long delay for nap mode.  Nap mode lets you trigger signals after a delay as short as 15 minutes - perfect for a quick lucid siesta. This is also great for the Wake-Back-to-Bed technique, which veteran oneironauts can attest is one of the best methods for lucid dreaming. In addition to setting Remee's timing, you'll be able to select from a variety of unique signal patterns and also modify the brightness to suit your paper thin or ogre thick eyelids.\nI own a soldering iron, give me specs!\nCongratulations, you're probably into tinkering and hacking just like we are, and most likely you want to know the skinny on Remee's guts. Remee is built around an atmega168 running on the internal oscillator.  Which means its fully compatible with the Arduino IDE.  If you're inclined, you'll be able to load whatever code you like on Remee and we'll be sure to create a tutorial to show you how. We are working on a simple way to hook an ISP to the board with no soldering or messy wires too. The light sensor bit-banging is pretty cool and we can't wait to share that with the world with a forthcoming tutorial, including part numbers and settings so you can use it in your own projects.

More info in the latest update)*\nThe Seed:\nAbout six years ago, while working with some new music interface ideas, I stumbled across some images and audio of an early Blues instrument called a \u201cDiddley Bow.\u201d The Diddley Bow is a homemade one-string instrument used by Blues player and buskers when nothing else is available. A piece of broom wire is strung across a long board, and played using a glass bottle as a slide and a stick or finger plucking for an expressive percussive sound. I realized that this instrument was a true \u201cfolk instrument,\u201d being cheap, homemade, and incredibly expressive in its simplicity.\nWhy in the age of DIY electronics and cheap or free music software is their no electronic folk-instrument?\nAfter years of struggling with this idea, and prototyping numerous interfaces, the oneString controller has come to life.\nThe Project   \nHere's the link to the 1st youtube demo: http://youtu.be/KaMZBtpqijM\nAnd a 2nd demo with more playing styles (same as above video): http://youtu.be/1mFMLxMdEss\nThe oneString controller is a super affordable, easy to construct open-source USB MIDI ribbon controller for musicians looking for a new means of expression.\nUSB Powered, allowing for only one cable. This means easy setup and portability in our wire-filled lives.\nUses a standard MIDI signal over USB allowing compatibility with almost all music software packages. (ANYTHING that takes keyboard input: Reason, reNoise, Energy XT, Ableton, FL Studio, Max-MSP, PureData... the list is endless!)\nUses free and open-source drivers to allow the most economical cross-platform (WIN, OSX, LINUX) solution.\nUses a minimum of parts, making it cheap and allowing for simple build instruction that even a beginner builder can finish in a day.\nBody construction based on simple parts, allowing for everyone to easily make cool unique instruments without a wood-shop or plastics prototyping shop at their disposal.\nUses Arduino firmware allowing for augmentation and support from a HUGE open-source community.\nHow it Works \u2013 What's a \u201cribbon controller\u201d??\nA \u201cribbon controller\u201d is a long position-sensing strip that can control the tone or modulation of a synthesizer, much like a slide-able guitar string. The sensor is read by a condensed USB powered \u201cArduino\u201d circuit, which sends the MIDI synth signal to your laptop. Once there, the signal is translated by open-source software and transported to the music software of your choice.\nThe device will have a dip-switch to allow for 16 preset interface modes (ex: pitch-bend continuous tone, individual note sending, multi-octive ranges, control of other MIDI \u201cCC's, etc... ). A potentiometer (knob) allows the user to chang the tuning of the instrument on the fly. Unlike currently available ribbon controllers in the >$200 range, the oneString can be triggered by a second \u201crhythm tap\u201d sensor, allowing for a unique 2-handed play-style.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Wil Lindsay. I am a career hacker-artist, performer, college professor and entrepreneur.\nI've been creating and distributing various levels of open-source and DIY kits through www.straytechnologies.com for nearly 4 years. I am most well known in cyber-land for a similar open-source kit called the \u201cBliptronome\u201d which married the idea of the MONOME 64 button synth controller with a cheap toy from Thinkgeek.com called the \u201cBliptronic 5000.\u201d\nAnother well known project I've created is the YM_MINI synth kit which allows cheap control of the soundchip from an Atari ST to respond to midi output from your laptop or computer.\nYears of teaching have taught me that at the heart of any successful open-source project is simplicity and affordability.

You can still preorder the Ramos Clock at www.ramosclock.com and take back your mornings!\nLink to Twitter\nThanks to all the media and blog coverage! Here's what some people had to say:\nUncrate: \"We've already seen several clever alarms that attempt to lure you out of bed, but few look as good as the Ramos Alarm Clock\"\nGizmodo: \"There are countless alarms that go the extra mile to get you out of bed in the morning. But none go quite as far, or look as slick, as the Ramos.\"\nApartment Therapy: \"This is one of the most striking, steampunk-inspired alarm clocks that we've seen\"\nTechnabob: \"Alarms clocks are a dime a dozen, but this beautiful bedside clock aims to shake things up a bit.\"\nOhgizmo: \"There are many alarms on the market that try to tackle this issue and the Ramos Alarm Clock, currently on Kickstarter, is one of the better ones.\"\nRamos alarm clock. \nIf you've ever tried to wake up early in the morning, but ended up just hitting the snooze button till it was too late, Ramos is for you.\nAfter consistently failing to wake up when I wanted to I started designing a better alarm clock. After years of hard work I came up with Ramos. Ramos forces you out of bed and to the Defuse Panel, where you'll have to enter a code. You'll have to use your brain a bit more, which will help wake you up. Best of all, after you turn off the alarm you\u2019ll find yourself in your bathroom or kitchen, away from the evil alluring bed and ready to start your day.\nLED Ramos\nWith your $160 pledge you\u2019ll be ordering the LED Ramos. The special handcrafted wooden Ramos will be smaller than the prototype shown in the video, and will have a birch housing finished in a glossy clear coat. The LED Ramos will have all alarm functionality mentioned on this page. Your LED Ramos will have an electronic alarm tone generator along with a hidden internal antenna. \nYour Ramos will have a 5\" by 7\" Defuse Panel that you can hang up wherever you want (the one featured in the video is the 8\" by 11\" prototype). The Defuse Panel is powered by a standard 9 volt battery and has an automatic off feature to conserve battery life. We've been testing our Remote Panel for almost a year and it\u2019s still going strong.\nFor pledges that are $200 and above you can choose to have either the blonde, teak, or dark stain finish shown above! \nNixie Ramos\nThe Nixie Ramos features four vertically mounted nixie tubes that display the time in a stunning and unique way for just $350. The Nixie Ramos uses tested new-old-stock Soviet Union nixie tubes that are no longer in production. These vintage tubes have a limited supply that dwindles every year. The beautiful warm glowing digits, coupled with a green PM back-light, tell the time like no other clock. Be the first one to own such a unique product and help bring Ramos to market. Your Nixie Ramos will be encased in a glossy finished teak case. There won't be a big antenna on your Ramos; it'll have a small internal one, along with an electronic tone generator. You'll also get the small and sleek Defuse Panel as shown in the LED Ramos picture. You can also choose to have it in blonde, or dark stain finish. The prototype model was made a little extra roomy to accommodate development, so the Nixie Ramos you will get will be slimmer in depth to maintain good proportions. \nBecause of the scarcity of nixie tubes, the Nixie Ramos is a very limited edition product. We have already acquired all the nixie tubes needed for the Nixie Ramos clocks we are offering here. We are still trying to find more nixie tubes but as of now it doesn't look very good. So we are offering the limited edition Nixie Ramos while it lasts!\nRamos Custom \nAt this pledge level I will personally build a Ramos to your specifications. The Ramos Custom will be a Nixie Ramos made out of your choice of available exotic hard-woods and finishes. 2 full sets of nixie tube spares will be included. Each wood panel will be made from a solid piece of exotic wood board. I will spend all the time necessary to make every part of your Ramos Custom perfect. \nHere's a list of some of the hard-woods that we'll have available. You can just drop us a line about any requests of how you want your Ramos to look and we'll work with you to get it just right. \nRamos Features\nRamos has a bunch of useful features available in all models. Using a simple menu system you'll be able to enable or disable the optional features. You'll even be able to disable the Defuse Panel and use the Ramos as a regular alarm clock.\nKnob time setting - No pressing buttons over and over again to set the time. A simple knob allows for quick and precise time setting.\nSnooze Mode -  Ramos will still have an optional snooze mode! You can give yourself as many allowed snoozes as you want. Though once you run out of snoozes you\u2019ll have to get out of bed.\nDigit Cycling - The Nixie Ramos has a Digit-Cycling effect that is necessary for the health of the nixie tubes. We think the effect looks pretty cool, so we\u2019re including it as an optional feature in the LED Ramos!\nLockdown Mode - Ever wake up early before your alarm goes off and decide to change the alarm to get an extra 15 minutes of sleep? With this feature enabled, 30 minutes before the alarm is set to go off Ramos will go into lock-down mode. At that point Ramos will not permit any changes to the alarm until it has been remotely deactivated. In the case that you genuinely get up early, you can just go to the Defuse Panel and pre-deactivate the future alarm.\nCourtesy Mode - Don\u2019t want to bother your significant other or roommates? With courtesy-mode enabled, the alarm goes off for only 10 seconds. It is then suspended for a minute. This gives you time to get out of bed and deactivate the alarm without annoying everyone else in the house. Although beware, at the end of the courtesy minute the Ramos alarm will come back in full force!\nDefuse Codes - You'll be able to either use the date, or a 4 digit number that gets flashed on the clock that you'll have to memorize before your trip to Defuse Panel. A defuse code option asking you to punch in the number Pi to the 16th digit might also be in there. \nBattery-Backed Clock - Power outage proof Ramos will stay fully functional for hours. It will also keep track of the time, day of the week, date, and leap years for about 9 years.\nAuto-dim -  Don\u2019t need your clock to be super bright at 3:35am? Not a problem: Ramos will automatically dim the lights at night if you want it to. \nRamp-up -Personally I like to be forced out of bed and ushered into consciousnesses with the same urgency a doctor has while resuscitating a patient. If this isn't for you, just enable ramp-up mode, and enjoy a smoother transition into your day.\nWireless stuff\nWe will offer two types of wireless systems on the Ramos clocks. The standard range and long range. I've tested the standard range Ramos in all my friend's apartments, including a duplex, and it works flawlessly when placed within 50 feet \"walking range\" from the base unit. Walking range just means the distance it takes to walk to wherever the Remote Panel is placed. If you're going to be placing the Remote Panel more than 50 feet away simply order the long range version. The long range version has a very powerful 2.4 GHz radio module that will work for an indoor distance of 100 feet, which is a lot. It is also ETSI (European telecomms standards) compliant, so we can ship it to Europe! \nAll the pledge levels above $200 have the long range, so you won't have to worry about any of this.\nSo, whats the plan?\nWith your money we'll be able to do the many, many, things necessary to get Ramos off the ground. We found a perfect wood-shop that we'll be renting. We'll also have to rent out a machine shop to fabricate drill jigs, clamp fixtures, router templates etc. needed for production. The electrical components will be bought in bulk, which will make Ramos affordable. We'll be able to create an assembly process to produce Ramos, invest in a spray finishing system and the list goes on and on. \nThank you so much for your time and for checking this out! \nLet's make Ramos a reality.\n-Paul\nP.S. All wood used to make Ramos is sourced from wood harvested with responsible forestry practices.

But the best way to describe Carbon Grey is for me to show you a progression of images.\nI initially did a pencil drawing of Mathilde around 2002 and was immediately flooded with story ideas. I wanted to tell a story about innocence lost, in a war that would consume the world.\nI then fleshed out her design and proceeded with her painting. And it wasn't until I painted Giselle (red haired girl) that the story started to solidify in my head. From then on it was work done between jobs and family, whenever I can find the time. I often stay up till 2 or 3 AM to work on it, but knew that I could not do it alone. I brought in Mike, Khari, Paul and Kinsun to help me finish the book. And last year we put out the first chapter of Carbon Grey from IMAGE Comics.\nWhat's the story about?\nCarbon Grey is a story about humanity's creative or destructive side. At the center of it, it's about family, tradition, duty and honors. It's an epic \" Diesel Punk\" world fill with intrigue, espionage and tragedy.\n\nSummaryThe sisters of the Greys; descendants of Gottfaust \u2013 Godlike hero of the nation\u2019s Golden Era.\n\nFor over three hundred years their family have protected and counseled the Kaiser, ruler of the Prussian Empire. The sisters are beautiful, wise and deadly; bred for purity and groomed to achieve perfection.\n\nThrough generations there have always been three \u2013 one for Strength, one for Grace and one for Wisdom.\n\nBut this is a different time.\n\n1913. At the beginning of the industrial age a great war is raging. As the myth of glory in battle is cut to ribbons on the frontline of Mitteleuropa twin sisters are born; Mathilde and Giselle. One of these two sisters is the 13th sister \u2013 the Carbon Grey, prophesized by Gottfaust to bring about a renaissance, and restore the nation to glory.\n\nBoth are flawed; imperfect in different ways. Giselle is disobedient, stubborn; but her faults are hidden. Mathilde does not share the physical perfection of her sisters, something she cannot hide. And an exposed flaw can be exploited.\n\nThis war is a diversion, orchestrated by the ruthless Queen, Raisa Vasilyeva. She conspires to manipulate Mathilde, twisting Gottfaust\u2019s prophecy to turn sister against sister, all to gain possession of the Stone, the source of Gottfaust\u2019s Godlike power.\n\nWhen the Kaiser is murdered Giselle must run, traveling west across the scorched battlefields of Mitteleuropa on a mission to deliver a mysterious letter into the heart of enemy territory. Pursued by the sisters and hunted by the enemy Giselle must discover the prophecy\u2019s true meaning before the Cossack queen harnessed the power of the stone to rewrite history itself.\nWhy is the production so expensive for a comic book?\nCarbon Grey is not like any ordinary comic book, it's structure more like a graphic novel. The story is epic in its scale and we wanted to do justice to it. We hand painted each and every panel on the page, it is a slow and meticulous process, but the end result speak for itself. Here is an example of a page we had to redraw and repaint. The final version in the book looks nothing like the original anymore, but it was necessary to propel the story forward.\nWhy should I care? and why did this project take so long?\nCarbon Grey has been a labor of love for me and my friends. We have been working on and off with this project for almost a decade. It is a dedication born of passion, perseverance and hard work. And the belief that one day we'll complete this journey.\nI have been self-funding this project for a while now, unfortunately, I've now ran out of money. The budget for the first arc was 40K and the second arc will be the same. I'm now reaching out to the KickStarter community to help me fund the second story arc. It will be another 3 issue mini-series published by IMAGE Comics.\nI need to finish Carbon Grey just as much as I need to breathe. It's hard to explain, the need to be creative can be overwhelming at times. \"What my mind sees, my hand cannot create fast enough.\" Please help me and my friends finish what we have started.\nThank you for your generosity.\nHoang Nguyen\nPrizes for your support\nPledge $10 or more: Issue # 1 of Carbon Grey (Volume 2) signed by the creative team.

Fortunately for him, I\u2019ve developed a controller using Arduino, the open-source microcontroller platform.\nA Complete TJ* Kit will ship with a brand-new Arduino Uno pre-loaded with code to run TJ* with the included puppeteer\u2019s controller for his eyes and mouth.  TJ* will run with live control and record-playback functionality too!  You\u2019ll be able to play with TJ* as soon as you power up his controller (see the FAQ below for how to plug him in).  \nIf you\u2019re interested in servo robotics, or if you already have an Arduino or other servo controller of your own, I\u2019m happy to ship you a Maker\u2019s TJ* Kit with the necessary connectors so you can start controlling him yourself.  Sample code to get him running will be available by the time you get your TJ* in hand!\nWhat can TJ* do? \nTJ* is a very talented performer - or at least he will be, in your hands! You can dress him up as much as you'd like, and record TJ* mouthing out monologues from your favorite movies, have him sit on top of your cookie jar and keep an eye out... or he can keep you company at work.\nIf you don't want at TJ* of your own, you can watch him on TV... and by TV I mean YouTube, where he's hoping to have a channel someday soon.\nSounds like my kids would like TJ*!\nI bet you're right! If you like toys and technology, TJ* is for you.  Not only can you and your child decorate TJ* together, but you can show your child how cool technology can be. Use TJ* as a tech puppet and your child is all set to create a story with TJ*.  As your child grows older, you can introduce your child to the world of software tech by developing TJ*s programming together and have fun getting TJ* to do new and different things.\nCool.  How about some sweet upgrades? \nAbsolutely!\n  You can get TJ* in colored plastic by adding the additional cost to any pledge. It's available in opaque and transparent colors.  This is what Acrylic stock from TAP plastics (a local supplier) looks like!\nIf you'd rather not see TJ*s skeleton, I'll ship you a Paper 'Skin' for TJ* that's nicer than the one he wears in the video.  Over the next few weeks, I'll  refine TJ*s skin pattern and post photos of the different options.\nA lot of people have told me that he\u2019d look really cool with LED eyes. I\u2019m building  an optional LED eye upgrade for TJ* and I'll post photos of this over the next few weeks too.\nFor all options, you'll be able to select your color choices through a KickStarter survey once TJ* is funded!  I'm sure your TJ* will appreciate all of your efforts to make him look cool.  It'll do wonders for his self-esteem.\nThat\u2019s preposterous... Robots don\u2019t have feelings!\nWell. That\u2019s another topic for another time. TJ* is ready to rock your world in his current form, but the next version, Emotive TJ*, will have two more servos. He\u2019ll be able to smile/frown and raise/lower his brow. When you see that, I challenge you not to perceive feelings coming from his sensitive robot heart... err... microprocessor.\nWhat else is next for TJ*?\nI'll be using the funds from Kickstarter to make the first batch of TJ*s at TechShop and shoot some by-request videos starring TJ*!\nI'll be developing Emotive TJ* and sharing the progress this summer with Kickstarter backers.  This version of TJ* needs an updated paper skin to make him look and feel even friendlier, and I'll be working on a few versions of that too!\nTJ* is a talented performer who wants his own YouTube channel. If I get enough TJ*s into the world, we can create a community of robot performers and inspire each other and our kids with the combination of storytelling and technology!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 101, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jeffkessler/tj-an-animatronic-puppet", "project_name": "TJ* An Animatronic Puppet"}}, {"backer": "Darva Campbell", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #88", "update_userinfo": "Premiere Date Set: 10th Anniversary, November 16, 2021", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Update #87: Holiday Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "Update 86: Back to Health + Eat More Kale Goes Dark", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "Update #85: Update on health and edit", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 179, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1674889308/a-defiant-dude", "project_name": "A Defiant Dude"}}, {"backer": "Darva Campbell", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Huge thanks to everyone who backed this project and helped to make Story Forge a reality! If you discovered this project after it ended, don't despair! Story Forge decks will be on sale to the general public shortly after all the Kickstarter backers have received their decks. Please go to  http://www.StoryForgeCards.com for details, or follow the discussion at https://www.facebook.com/StoryForgeCards.\n___________________________________________\nWriters have traditionally used 3\u201d x 5\u201d index cards to brainstorm their stories and characters, but often, even those cards stare back at you as blankly as the pages you are trying to fill. But what if those cards were already crammed with drama-provoking ideas?\nStory Forge is a deck of 88 cards packed with the elements that all great stories are built from, like dramatic building blocks. Novelists, playwrights, screenwriters and role playing gamers can easily combine them in countless ways to maximize dramatic tension and blast through writer\u2019s block.\nStart by choosing a spread diagram from the 32 page booklet included with the deck. Each spread is tailored for the type of story you are working on, such as \"The Love Story,\" \"Film Noir,\" \"The Crossroads,\" or \"The Train Crash.\"  Next, draw random cards from the deck and place them into the indicated positions that suggest context. Lastly, read the meanings directly from the card faces.\nEach card illustrates a unique concept: plot twists, reversals of fortune, or character archetypes. You will find the seven deadly sins and their countering virtues as well as the four horsemen of the apocalypse and their opposites. There are cards that represent the various stations of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs and The Hero\u2019s Journey. Some cards speak of humanity\u2019s finest strengths and most tragic flaws, while others evoke the powers of gods and the universe itself.\nThe definitions on the cards are suggestive, yet vague enough that you can\u2019t help but interpret them within the context of your story. If a card doesn\u2019t match your conception of the character or situation, that too is informative, and you can lay down further cards until you find one that \u201cclicks.\u201d The deck also contains blank cards so you can customize Story Forge to perfectly fit your unique writing style.\nAfter a few cards, your mind will be racing with possibilities, any creative block completely gone!\nThe concepts contained within the Story Forge cards and the situations they may suggest to the user may be too complex or intense for young children, and parental guidance is suggested.\nYou can see more demonstration videos of the cards in action at www.StoryForgeCards.com\nBe sure to read \"The Story Behind The Forge\" in the Updates section!\nWhat people are saying about Story Forge:\n\"Having a sense of play is vital to being a creative writer, and Story Forge encourages that better than anything I\u2019ve tried. The unexpected associations of ideas, the imaginative \u201cwhat-ifs,\u201d the sudden reversals, twists and turns that make up compelling and orginal plotlines and stories-- they\u2019re all waiting in that deck of cards. A simple re-shuffle, combined with your own instincts and insights, and you\u2019re good to go, as many times as you like. So go play, have fun, and be a better writer for it.\"   \n -- David Frost, Director of \"Ring of Steel\"\n\u201cAs a novelist and screenwriter, I\u2019ve always been suspicious of tools that supposedly help writers \u201ccraft\u201d their stories.  But Story Forge is different than anything else on the market. Unlike other tools, Story Forge randomly generates an evocative tapestry of rich possibilities, thematically deep and deliberately ambiguous enough that the writer can interpret them in a wide variety of ways.  All in all, Story Forge is a great tool for stirring your brain and generating insights. It\u2019s like spitballing ideas with an endlessly creative, wise, and maybe slightly drunk friend.\u201d\n-- Jeff Seeman, screenwriter of \u201cAmerican Virgin\u201d and author of  \u201cGuns and Butter\u201d\n\"Story Forge Cards are really a cool concept, not only from a role-playing gamers point of view, but for anyone that enjoys writing. It is undoubtedly a nifty tool for overcoming writer\u2019s block, and can expand the 'theatre of the mind' for roleplayers on either side of the screen by giving them more to think about in terms of character backgrounds, motivations, as well as plots and story arcs. I must admit that fooling around with the cards is quite fun and a little addictive, and the fact that they are completely genre-neutral allows them to create characters and plots for any game system and setting, from fantasy to horror to science-fiction. I think it would be really fun and unique, as a gaming experience, to base an entire campaign on players making characters with this method.\"\n-- Neuroglyph, EN World Magazine\n\u201cStory Forge is a marvelous accomplishment -- intriguing, inspiring, and as useful as it is fun.  Every card is a steppingstone that illuminates and guides the writer toward the heart of his or her work.  Indeed, the deck could be likened to a treasure map torn into bits.  Each card offers clues, even as it invites us to detour to our heart's desire.  The deck is the perfect diversion for anyone with writer's block, since it offers an alternate route to bypass the blockage.\u201d\n   -- Craig Conley, author of \u201cMagic Words\u201d and \u201cOne Letter Words\u201d\n\u201cWhenever I get stuck on a story, I start throwing the Story Forge cards. Time and again they have provided creative connections that have helped me think through my various plot contortions. Story Forge is a writer's block hammer!\u201d\n   -- John R. Mabry, author of \u201cThe Kingdom\u201d and \u201cThe Monster God\u201d\n\"What I love about Story Forge \u2013 and what makes it a vital part of my game master's toolkit \u2013 is that it doesn't dictate the story to me; instead it draws out my best ideas, the creative twists I didn't even know were waiting for me.\"\n   -- Dinah Sanders, author of \u201cDiscardia\u201d and avid gamer\n\u201cStory Forge is my first go to when I need inspiration. Plus, it's just fun to discover new aspects of your characters, or new reactions to unthought of situations. You want to know what really makes your characters tick and new and interesting situations to put them in? Story Forge is your tool.\u201d\n   -- Jake Simpson, author of \u201cMyndware\u201d\n\"Whenever a writer stares at an empty page, unsure of what to do next, they are in immediate need of Story Forge. Imagination sparks at the turn of each card. Motivation, characterization, plot twists\u2026it's all there! I wish I'd had access to this amazingly well-thought-out tool earlier in my career. Many days of facing that empty page would have been so much more productive. I have a deck now, though, and absolutely LOVE it!\"\n   -- Ginger Chambers, Author of 33 books for Harlequin and Dell Publishing\n\"Using this deck is so fun and inspiring, it actually makes me look forward to getting writer's block.\"\n   -- Jason Shankel, Stupid Fun Club", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "At long last!", "update_content": "Story Forge is now available to the general public!

WOW! SEE IT HERE.\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nHi Kickstarters,\nThank you for taking the time to learn about the FLOTE\u2122. \nBACKGROUND.\n\"If the pundits are right, and the touch-screen tablet is the future of computing, then we\u2019ll have to come to terms with the Handling Issue: unlike with a laptop or desktop computer, you have to hold a tablet with your hand as you\u2019re using it.\"   - David Pogue, NY TIMES\n\"But the iPad is much heavier than the Kindle and most people will need two hands to use it.\"  -  Walt Mossberg, WSJ\n\"Even at 1.5 pounds, the iPad feels heavy to hold.\" - Matt Brewer, MAC FANATIC\n57% of  iPAD / 61% of eReader owners read in bed - NIELSEN   \n\"It's (iPAD) too heavy. It is. Just admit it.\" - Henry Blodget, CEO The Business Insider/ HUFF POST TECH\n* * * * *\nAfter too many nights experiencing tingling fingers and pains in my neck and shoulders, I decided that I wanted to create something new that would hold my tablet for me as I browsed, read, or watched a movie\u2013 particularly while I was on a couch, chair, or even better\u2013 my bed. It had to be cool looking so it didn't detract from the experience, and it had to be simple and hassle-free to adjust. \n\nThis was my inspiration for the FLOTE.\n\nSO WHAT IS THE FLOTE\u2122?\nThe FLOTE is a machined-metal floor stand designed to securely hold a wide variety of tablets like the iPAD\u00ae or e-readers like the Kindle\u00ae in virtually any position so you can use them hands-free for prolonged periods of time.\nNot only does it hold it where you put it, but the patent-pending FLOTE is also simple to adjust without the hassle of tightening or loosening any knobs or screws each time you move something. You simply put the tablet where you want it, and it stays there until you move it.\nThe FLOTE's clean, sophisticated design compliments most interiors while truly enhancing your tablet or e-reader experience. It's built by U.S. craftspeople, and is made of machined metals that will withstand years of regular use.\n(Note to Nook\u00ae owners that a case is required to use it with the FLOTE.)\n\nHOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED.\nIt took us several months of working and testing with designers, engineers and fabricators to be ready the FLOTE for release. But before we step up to manufacturing, I need to prove that there is true market demand. Your support will do just that, and funds will be used to get required tooling and refine manufacturing processes. \n\nREWARDS. FOR KICKSTARTER CONTRIBUTORS ONLY.\nThe engraved, stainless steel Official FLOTE Kickstarter Commemorative Plate is for Kickstarter contributors only. The plate goes on top of the Base Cylinder during assembly after you receive your FLOTE.

There are some great kits out there - the Makerbot, the Ultimaker, the Prusa Mendel, and others - but none as small and simple as the Printrbot.  This all-in-one 3D printer kit can be assembled and printing in a couple of hours.  Other kits will not only take you many more hours to build, they will also have hundreds more parts, and they will cost more.  My design also does away with the finicky calibration and adjustment from which most 3D printers suffer.   This is the printer a kid could put together. We assemble the electronics, we assemble the hotend, and we put the connectors on all the motors and components... no soldering required!\nQuality design and quality parts\nThe Printrbot is my original design, but borrows from many great designers in the open source 3D printer world (check out reprap.org).  This new printer incorporates some of the best practices out there.  We use the latest electronics and firmware,  linear bearings, smooth drill rod with tight tolerances, a lasercut print bed, the most popular extruder design, mechanical endstops, a manufactured PCB heated bed, a simple hotend with replacable tips, and it works with the latest open source software.  \nPictures of the Printrbot:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/62370789@N08/sets/72157628143157998/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/1770156@N25/\nVideo of the Printrbot:\nhttp://vimeo.com/printrbot/videos\nMore Info: printrbot.com\nAuthentic and Expandable\nWe could have (and will eventually) build this printer using all lasercut wood like Makerbot and others, or poured molded plastic, or even injection-molded plastic, but I believe in the original RepRap.org purpose: to build a self-replicating machine - one that anyone can build given time and materials.  If you've got a RepRap - you can print lots of useful stuff, and you can print another RepRap for a friend.  Printrbot is a true RepRap machine. \nBeing a true RepRap means you will immediately be able to upgrade and modify the machine with parts you print yourself.  The design easily allows you to increase the print area, add stabilizers for rigidity, replace the threaded rods with plastic parts.... that is the beauty or RepRap!  Also worth mentioning is the fact that all the electronics and hardware could easily be repurposed to power a completely different model of RepRap.\nWe need your support to scale production\nAnyone can research and build one of the larger 3D printers, but it WILL be time consuming, complex, confusing, difficult for beginners and expensive.  We have brought 3D printer kits down to the beginner level and a better price point simultaneously.  How?!  Well, that's where you come in.  The only way to produce assembled, cutting edge electronics is to order a lot of them.  The same logic applies to all the parts.  We need your support to scale production.\nThe goal: a printer in every home (and school)\nThis kickstarter will do more than fund a single project.  This project will launch a business in pursuit of the dream of \"a printer in every home\".  We have reduced the complexity of these printers, but will soon focus solely on pushing the price of these printers to the absolute lowest sustainable retail price for kits and fully assembled printers.  \nPlease, help us change the world.

Check out the updates section above to see more footage from the EZ-Steady. \nYou can now choose black anodizing as a color option for the weight arm! (We'll get your preference at the end of the project)\nHow do I know what to pledge?\nMy Story\nI started making films a year ago and quickly realized that without a camera stabilizer my footage was useless. I tried several different products but all of them had their own issues. So I asked myself this question. What if there was an affordable stabilizer that was quick to balance and easy to pan and tilt? \nThat's when my quest started to engineer the \"perfect\" stabilizer. After almost a year of designing, prototyping, and re-designing I came up with the EZ-Steady. You can balance it in 5 minutes or less. You can \"fly\" it effortlessly with one hand. And, it's affordable with a MSRP of $325 ($225 if you pledge on Kickstarter) while still being made right here in the USA. \nWhat is the EZ-Steady?\nIf you are unfamiliar with camera stabilzers, the EZ-Steady is a way to get really smooth camera motions without having to use a large rig. It is a simple, hand held device that eliminates camera shake and gives the footage a feeling of flying.\nWhat's so cool and different about it?\nMost camera stabilizers take a long time to balance your camera when you're first learning. With the simple stage systlem, it can take as little as 5 minutes.\n  Another great feature of the EZ-Steady is that there are many points of contact that allow you to control where you're pointing the camera. Use one hand or both, each option has muiltiple flying positions.\n  \nAlso, the precision machined gimbal allows amazing range of motion for running or low to the ground shots. The weights shown in the picture below are easily adjustable. They allow you to remove counterweights without having to completely unscrew the weight pack from the stabilizer arm. This makes for quick adjustments on the fly if you're changing lenses or cameras.\nThe EZ-Steady is also extremely compact. This enables you to get low to the ground shots or fit into tight places when filming. It packs away easily for travel and you can even detach the weight arm if needed. \nWhy is this product on Kickstarter?\nThis is where you guys come in. Oh my wonderful Kickstarter community. You see over the past year I've spent countless dollars (my wife knows exactly how much) on product design that I don't have the money for my first production run. I need your generous support to get this product going and into the hands of creative film-makers.\nThat's why we need your help to get the ball rolling. We're offing the EZ-Steady at a reduced price if you pledge $225 towards this project.\nWhat's Rhino Camera Gear?\nRCG is the company I created to sell the EZ-Steady and other film making equipment we design in the future (Sliders and shoulders rests are currently in development).  Don't be surprised if you see our future products making their debut on Kickstarter.\nNote: The final production version will have a few changes made to it. All for the better of the EZ-Steady. These include a stainless steel gimbal, a micro-adjustable weight to balance it even quicker, and a slightly smaller stage. Please message me if you have any questions. \nTHE END\nThanks for checking out my project! Please watch the video and have a read through the FAQs below.

They were binding up and not spinning freely as they should. We figured out that the there was too much space between the outside of the bearings and the inside of the handle tube. Somehow our epoxy expanded unevenly and cross loaded the bolt within the bearings causing it to seize. In simple terms they don't work. We tried to just put one bearing in the handles.

You can still join the thousands of other awesome Twine owners by pre-ordering on Supermechanical. It's the next best thing to being an original backer!\nConnect your things to the Internet, without a nerd degree.\nFollow us on Facebook or Twitter.\nWant to hook up things to the Web? Maybe you want to get a tweet when your laundry's done, or get an email when the basement floods while you're on vacation. Even if you're good with electronics and programming, these are involved projects. Instead of worrying about wiring or networking code, you can focus on your idea.\nTwine is the simplest possible way to get the objects in your life texting, tweeting or emailing. A durable 2.5\" square provides WiFi connectivity, internal and external sensors, and two AAA batteries that keep it running for months. A simple web app allows to you quickly set up your Twine with human-friendly rules \u2014 no programming needed. And if you're more adventurous, you can connect your own sensors and use HTTP to have Twine send data to your own app.\nTwine lets you create Internet-connected systems and objects anywhere you have WiFi. Compact, low-power hardware and real-time web software work together to make networked physical computing simple and versatile.\nHow it works\nTwine is a wireless module tightly integrated with a cloud-based service. The module has WiFi, on-board temperature and vibration sensors, and an expansion connector for other sensors. Power is supplied by the on-board micro USB or two AAA batteries (and Twine will email you when you need to change the batteries).\nThe Spool web app makes it simple to set up and monitor your Twines from a browser anywhere. You set rules to trigger messages \u2014 no programming needed. The rules are put together with a palette of available conditions and actions, and read like English: WHEN moisture sensor gets wet THEN tweet \"The basement is flooding!\" We'll get you started with a bunch of rule sets, and you can share rules you create with other Twine owners.\nBecause the hardware and software are made for each other, setup is easy. There's nothing to install \u2014 just point Twine to your WiFi network. Sensors are immediately recognized by the web app when you plug them in, and it reflects what the sensors see in real time, which makes understanding and testing your rules easy.\nSensors\nRight out of the box, Twine has an internal temperature sensor and accelerometer. We're also making additional external sensors. That brings the initial total to:\ninternal temperature sensor\ninternal accelerometer (for vibration, impact, and motion detection)\na magnetic switch (useful for doors and anything else that moves)\nmoisture sensor (detect the presence of water)\nbreakout board --- provides analog or digital input, power and ground (allows you to easily wire up other sensors that you think up \u2014 no soldering required!)\nWhen you plug these into the multipurpose jack, they pop up on the web app ready for you to add to your rules.\nIf we go over our Kickstarter goal, we'll be able to develop additional sensors for you to choose from (up to three). For every additional $10,000 we raise, we'll offer our Kickstarters the chance to vote for another sensor. These might be an RFID reader, a pressure sensor or a current sensor.\nUpdate: We went *way* over our original goal, so we're going to be making all three of the new external sensors. Backers can expect to see the first poll soon.  We'll put the projected cost and availability dates for each sensor in the poll.\nOutput\nUsing our simple web app you can configure Twine to speak in a variety of ways.  At the moment we support:\nText messaging (SMS)\nTwitter\nEmail\nConfigurable HTTP request (for fancy applications)\nEach of these let you include sensor values (like the temperature) and your own text.\nHoliday note:\nWe've sent the physical holiday cards to the printer, but the digital \"print-at-home\" edition is still available.\nWhere we are, where we go next\nDrawing on our experience in hardware and software, we've spent the last few months creating working prototypes and near-final forms. We are truly excited about getting Twine into people's hands to see what new uses others will find for it.\nOur Kickstarter will fund final refinement of our prototypes and the equipment and parts needed for production. The more funds we raise, the quicker we'll be able to add new features that make Twine even more powerful and simple. We have big things planned \u2014 and because it's all on the network, software upgrades to the web interface and to Twine itself come automatically to you.\nIf you agree with our vision of simple physical computing, contribute to our project with your dollars, word of mouth, and creative ideas for Twine!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Announcing Range, the smart thermometer from Supermechanical", "update_content": "It\u2019s been almost two years since we launched Twine on Kickstarter; we couldn\u2019t have done it without your help.

You can also follow us on twitter @touchfiretype and on facebook.com/touchfiretype to hear about our latest adventures.\nCheers, \nSteve & Brad\nTouchFire makes your iPad feel like a normal keyboard!\nTouchFire puts the \"touch\" back into typing on an iPad. You can now feel where the keys are and rest your fingers on the home row, so you can type as fast and accurately as you can on a laptop. You can even type without looking at the screen. TouchFire cushions your fingers as you type, something both touch-typists and two-finger typists really appreciate. Typing on an iPad is no longer a pain!\nTouchFire is ultra-thin and weighs less than an ounce. It attaches to the inside of the iPad cover and folds with the cover, so you can always keep TouchFire with your iPad without it getting in the way.\nWhat People are Saying About TouchFire\nNew York Times - \"The keyboard is incredibly simple to use. Typing on it is like typing on a physical keyboard\"\nWired - \"Two Seattle-based inventors have come up with an iPad keyboard that could dramatically alter the tablet keyboard landscape\"\nFastCompany \u2013 \"Turns the iPad into a true laptop killer\"\nCNET \u2013  \"The super-thin-and-lightweight TouchFire adds virtually no physical bulk\"\nHow It Works\nTouchFire fits right over the iPad's on-screen keyboard and is completely transparent, so you can always see the keys underneath it. \nTouchFire is soft and supple if you swipe through it horizontally, so you can easily select the special characters on the keyboard. Yet it is stiff enough vertically to allow you to rest your fingers on the home row keys without accidentally triggering the touch screen. At the same time it responds to typing with just the right amount of resistance and spring-back to feel  like a lively and responsive keyboard. Amazing! \nWhen you want TouchFire out of the way, you simply fold it down. TouchFire's magnets keep it neatly folded below the screen.\nTouchFire also comes with a pair of cover clips, which help secure it magnetically to your iPad's cover.\nYou also get a thin storage case, should you ever want to store TouchFire off your iPad.  \nTouchFire Supports Both iPad 1 and iPad 2 \nAs you saw in the video at the top of the page, TouchFire attaches to the iPad 2 using the magnets built into the iPad 2. TouchFire also works great with the original iPad. Here's a video showing how.\nOur Story\nSteve has been passionate about mobile computing since the early 90s, when he was one of the first employees at a Silicon Valley company called GO that made one of the world's first tablet computers. He also worked on Microsoft's first mobile operating system, Windows CE. \nInput (handwriting, typing, etc) has always been the biggest challenge for tablet computers, and those early systems were marginal at best. When Steve first got an iPad, he immediately realized that typing on it was better by leaps and bounds than anything that came before. But typing was still the iPad's weakest area.\nSteve became obsessed with finding a way to make typing on the iPad live up to its full potential. In the spring of 2010 he finally came up with the idea that became TouchFire. He built a conceptual prototype of TouchFire, and asked Brad, a mechanical engineer and product designer, to join the project.\nTouchFire was one of the most challenging design problems Brad has ever tackled. On one hand, TouchFire had to be thin, light and flexible enough to live in the iPad's cover. On the other hand, TouchFire's keys had to provide the proper force resistance to allow people to rest their fingers and type naturally. Brad figured out how to do this by inserting a series of micro-structures inside each key. You can't feel these micro-structures, but they contain carefully designed walls that provide the proper force resistance no matter how your finger strikes a key.\nThe money raised through Kickstarter will enable us to fund our first production run and bring TouchFire to market. We are in the final stages of choosing our manufacturing partner, and plan to start shipping shortly after our Kickstarter campaign finishes.\nTouchFire Rewards\nThe TouchFire Standard Pack includes a keyboard, a storage case and a pair of cover clips ... everything you need to use TouchFire with your iPad.\nWe also have a special offer just for Kickstarter - the TouchFire Variety Pack.\nIt includes:\nTwo TouchFire keyboards, one black and one white\nTwo storage cases\n5 pairs of cover clips in colors that complement the iPad Smart Covers\nThe Variety Pack lets you pick the colors you like best (and we'd appreciate you telling us what those are). Since the Variety Pack comes with two keyboards, you can also give one to a friend. \nThanks for stopping by.

Tell your friends!\nWe have finally determined that the retail price of Sensu will be $34.95 when it lands in stores next year. That makes our Kickstarter pledge pricing very attractive. If you've been sitting on the fence or considering getting in for a little more, these hours are your last chance...\nPlays Nicely With Others\nWe've fielded several questions about compatibility with devices other than iPad. Sensu works brilliantly on iPhone, the device we first \"iPainted\" on. We've tested Sensu on multiple Android-based tablets with great success as well. One of the best apps available, SketchBook has an Android version available today. Several other favorite painting and drawing apps have announced plans for Android versions in the near future.\nFinally, a true painting experience on your iPad.\nWe developed Sensu out of our desire to have an authentic brush to use with our favorite drawing and painting apps on iPhone and iPad. Of course, Sensu works well on other capacitive screens we've tested. Over the years, we've developed a lot of artist brushes and have learned tons from some of the best brush makers in the world \u2013 careful craftsmen who understand the subtle properties of hair taper, flexibility, and strength. We've learned to build brushes that yield perfectly to different paint mediums and various surfaces.\nWe have applied the same care to developing a brush for capacitive devices which gives a satisfying sense of resistance, and still dances across the screen with a real liveliness. You'll feel like you're painting.\nClose-up of our Sensu Brush prototype in action on the iPad.\nPatent-pending Hair Technology\nIn our search for the right conductive hair, we tested various metal and metallic fibers. None had the true feel of a real artist brush. An old brush-making friend in Japan introduced us to a brand new hair technology being developed for the cosmetic industry. Traditional synthetic brush hair was being infused with conductive properties to help fine powder release from make-up brushes as they came in contact with skin. This synthetic hair could be made in the diameters and tapers we required for Sensu to feel just right.\nTruly Portable\nLike your iPad, the Sensu brush is truly portable. The protective cap becomes the handle for the brush when in use. When you're done painting, simply insert the brush tip into the handle chamber and push closed. The brush is now safe for travel and a rubber stylus nib is exposed that can be used for other navigation.\nSensu brush shown above open (A) and closed (B) ready for travel.\nWhen closed, the Sensu brush reveals a useful rubber stylus tip.\nExclusive Finish Available for Kickstarter Backers\nClassic chrome or EXCLUSIVE gunmetal plating, both on solid brass.\n__________________________________________________________\nThanks Steve.\nIf not for the genius of Steve Jobs, we wouldn't have these amazing products to fall in love with.

Watch the video to see what they are capable of... CineSkates were used to film it! \nCineSkates work specifically with the GorillaPod Focus tripod. A ballhead is also required... most small, strong ballheads will work great. Fortunately, JOBY, the maker of GorillaPod Focus and BallHead X has agreed to include their products in the CineSkates System at a generous price!\n\nWhat rewards are available?You can get any reward shown in the table below by pledging the appropriate amount. We will send out a survey when the project completes to verify the reward you selected and gather your address.\n\nWhat's the money for?Backers of this project will be helping to create the first production run of CineSkates. Your pledges will enable me to move forward with orders for each of the 44 different parts in CineSkates and to continue building portable gear for filmmakers. Backers pledge to pay for their selected reward only if we meet the funding goal of $20,000. I'm grateful for every $1 pledged! \nWhen will rewards ship?Update 10/12: We have all the CineSkates in our garage in final stages of assembly, and we're waiting on the cases to arrive. They are coming in next week, and we'll start getting boxes out the door as fast as we can after that. We plan to have everything shipped by the end of October.\nWhat makes CineSkates so cool?CineSkates can produce shots that have previously been impossible or only possible with bulky and expensive equipment. Here are a few:\nArcing shots that rotate around objects\nSliding shots that push or pull the subject into focus \nRolling shots that glide over the subject\nTime-lapse shots that move the camera slowly and smoothly\nPanning shots that scan a wide area\n\"Worm's eye view\" shots that slide just above the floor\nFilmmakers will find CineSkates perfect for weddings, music videos, product demos, real estate ads, web videos, corporate films, and even for narrative and documentary films. \nHow do you use them?You'll be able to figure them out in no time... just line up the wheels and roll! But, like your camera, CineSkates have a learning curve. So, there will be a \"How to use CineSkates\" video, and I'll send the video link out to all project backers. I can't wait to see how you use them!\nWill there be future CineSkates products?You know it! I designed CineSkates in two parts with a proprietary quick connection called cinetics connect\u2122. This connection enables easy expansion to other tripods. It also enables other attachments, like robotic wheels, to be attachable to GorillaPod Focus and other tripods. Send me a Twitter or Facebook message if you have an idea for the cinetics connect\u2122 platform!\n\nWhat is Cinetics?\nCinetics is the company I started to sell CineSkates. It's just me and some friends that have volunteered tons of time toward the company, but we're hoping Kickstarter can help us take the company to the next level! Cinetics is based in Austin, Texas.\nWhat is the Cinetics Lens Cloth?The Cinetics Lens Cloth is a useful reward for people that back at lower levels. The micro-fiber cloth quickly wraps up into a neoprene pouch that clips onto your camera. They work great for glasses and computer screens too. They turned out pretty slick!\nAre CineSkates patented?\nCineSkates have been patent pending since shortly after being invented in early 2011.

Thank you for visiting our page for the Zeppelin Stylus, a sleek and stylish stylus that provides precise pointing and unobstructed view through a patent pending capacitive stainless steel wire tip for all touch screen tablets and smartphones.\nPLEASE CHECK UPDATES TAB FOR IMPORTANT VIDEOS ON PRODUCT PERFORMANCE.\nFunctional Benefits - Precision and Clarity\nOur stylus tip uses capacitive coupling to produce a writing instrument unimpeded by foam or a plastic disc. You get a clear unobstructed view of the screen as you\u2019re writing, sketching, scribbling or selecting, thus making PRECISE touch with visual clarity possible on tablets and smartphones.\nHow does it work?\nModern touchscreens work by using the electrical property of capacitance to detect touch. To mimic the large capacitance of a finger, current styluses use a large, continuous conductive surface. The advantage of the Zeppelin stylus is the principle of capacitive coupling, which is the principle that a single conductive wire has electric fields that extend well beyond the wire itself. By combining several conductive wire rings, the Zeppelin mimics a solid conductive surface with much less material, giving a clearer view.\nThe patent pending tip is formed from a single piece of tempered stainless steel wire which makes it very strong and flexible.  The center spring coil allows the outer ring to pivot easily so that you can use the stylus at various angles.\nDesign Aesthetics\nThe Zeppelin body has a unique aerodynamic look and solid ergonomic feel as it is constructed from solid aerospace grade aluminum.   There are two rare earth magnets embedded inside for attaching itself to the iPad 2 or other magnetic surfaces.\n\nThe Zeppelin stylus cap was refined and iterated many times to complement the body design and naturally evolved into a rocket fin.  Functionally, it prevents the stylus from rolling and allows the Zeppelin stylus to literally stand on its own.\nRemaining Decisions: We need your input on the following items.  \nFunction or Form.  Do you like the functional benefits or the way it looks?  Functional - Looks - Both\nIn what color(s) should be the cap be offered?  Red - Black - Other\nWhat Metal Finish should the body do you like? Matte - Brushed - Polished\nDo you think the tip should be coated with black Teflon? Yes - No\nWhen you think of the name Zeppelin, which comes to your mind first? The band Led Zeppelin - the airship dirigible - Both\nWhere are we now and what needs to happen.\nThe Zeppelin Stylus has been prototyped, and vendors are anxiously waiting to produce it.  Injection molding tools, especially high quality ones, cost money and time. If we meet our funding goal, we anticipate delivering the Zeppelin Stylus in November.  Managing the suppliers is something that we do on a regular basis so you'll definitely get the goods if we meet our goal.   We need your pledge to make this happen.  \nRetail price for the Zeppelin Stylus will be $59.\nYour support is greatly appreciated!

Our guiding principle is to do more with less, and with this little guy we call the Orbit we believe we found the perfect harmony between form and functionality. \n***A quick update on our adjusted retail pricing***\nWe have been doing a lot of work on the development of the Orbit and it has shown that we were a little too optimistic with production costs due to the complexity of the injection molding required. We are now expecting the Orbit to retail around $30.00. Still a great price considering all that the Orbit does for you.\nThis will not effect any of your pledges on Kickstarter. In fact, the $15.00 pledge is now 50% off the expected retail price. Get your Orbit now at this fixed Kickstarter special before it hits retail shelves. \n***A RECENTLY ADDED COMPONENT: The following little double threaded 1/4\"-20 adapter will allow you to mount your Orbit directly to a point and shoot camera. If you don't have a tripod, this gives you just a bit more flexibility. All $15 and over pledges get this free upgrade. \nThe Orbit is truly the simplest device allowing you to make the most of your cell phone, iPod (and soon the iPad as well!) by giving you the ability to securely mount your device practically anywhere, and leaving your hands free to be more productive. \nWhat does the Orbit do?\nIt seemingly gives you a third hand. With two opposing suction cups swiveling around a simple ball-joint, the Orbit securely mounts any mobile device to practically any surface. Any surface? Well, almost. Included with the Orbit are clear repositionable polycarbonate discs that can be stuck on to most non glass-like surfaces giving you the capability to mount your device to a painted wall, wood surface, your dashboard or practically anywhere you can think of. You\u2019ll find your favorite spot, and when you do, we\u2019ve got you covered.\nIn addition, the Orbit has a removable suction cup. What lies underneath is a standard 1/4-20 threaded insert that allows you to mount the Orbit to any tripod giving you the flexibility of hands free video and photography, and the ball joint lets you dial in the perfect angle without having to fumble with the tripod adjustments. \nYou can even remove the remaining socket portion of the Orbit and you have a convenient little suction kickstand that positions your device in either portrait or landscape.\nIs it really that handy?\nWe have tested a lot of phone mounts on the market and, to be honest, a few of them \"work\" pretty well, but if you want to take them out of your car to throw them in your purse or pocket, good luck. If you want them to hold another device your chances are dicey. We found most of them to be big, bulky and in many cases device specific. In our opinion you shouldn\u2019t have to adapt to the limitations of a device. The genius of the Orbit is it\u2019s so simple it adapts to you.\nWhy we need your help...\nIn order for us to develop the orbit, we need your support primarily for the hefty tooling investment involved to injection mold the polymer ball and sockets, as well as the custom designed suction cups. Aren't plastic parts inexpensive? Well each one of those little guys popped out of a steel tool costing thousands of dollars. Our Orbit is no different except that he is worth his weight in... well, truffles!\nWith your help we'll be on our way to giving you that third hand, and to us, that's priceless.

Our friends at The Buzz Lab made some great videos that help explain some of the ways to use SurfEasy to protect your privacy.  You can see all of them on our Vimeo page or watch the one below that explains how SurfEasy leaves nothing behind. \nHey Kickstarters, thanks for checking out our project!  We\u2019ve spent the last 7 months developing SurfEasy to make it plug and play easy for anyone to secure their online privacy and freedom on virtually any computer or network.  Now we need your help to get them produced. \nSurfEasy is designed to do 4 things really simply: \n1.      Protect your online freedom:  Bypass firewalls and other tools that are used to block or restrict access to your favorite sites \u2013 on any computer.  This could be accessing Facebook at work or BBC news while traveling in China. (See FAQ for details). \n2.      Protect your online privacy: Encrypt all of your web browsing and prevent anyone from monitoring what you do online.  This includes company networks, wifi-sniffers, your Internet Service Provider and others. \n3.      Use your own personal browser everywhere: SurfEasy\u2019s password protected USB key lets you carry your own personal web browser with you in your wallet or purse.  This lets you have all of your bookmarks, usernames, passwords and other preferences with you on any computer.\n4.      Leave no trace:  SurfEasy is designed to leave no personal information on any computer you use.  Plug it in to any PC or MAC and when you\u2019re done, simply unplug it and walk away with all your personal information.  No trace is left behind on any computer.\nHow many different computers or networks do you use during the course of a week or month to access your online life?  I picked a random week and counted my use \u2013 5 different computers and 23 different networks \u2013 and of those I only had confidence that my online privacy was reasonably protected on 1 computer and 1 network.  For the other computers and networks (at work, at hotels, wifi hotspots, etc.) I had to trust third parties to secure the personal information I was transmitting over their networks or leaving on their machines. In many cases, I knew my information was not secured, or worse, actively being monitored.  The goal of SurfEasy is to make it plug and play simple to protect your online freedom and privacy \u2013 to let you be confident in your privacy on any computer.\nSurfEasy is a combination of a unique USB key and custom software.   Lets start with the hardware.\nNearly as thin as a credit card, the SurfEasy USB key and holder are designed to be easily carried in your purse or wallet.  We spent a lot of time on this custom industrial design to make it as thin as possible, while maintaining durability and great looks.  The finish is a UV coating similar to what you would see on Apple products \u2013 it looks great and provides a scratch resistant finish.\nWhy a credit card?  We considered other form factors, like a key chain, but we wanted something that you would be able to carry with you every day without hassle.  We thought about frequent travelers and what they would carry with them.  Most people don\u2019t carry their keys on vacation, but you\u2019ve almost always got your wallet. After all, your wallet is where you store some of your most important personal belongings and IDs \u2013 why should your online identity be any different?\nThe USB key itself contains a specialized hardware solution that runs about 3 times faster and last 10 times longer than a standard USB drive.  This is important for SurfEasy, since the key holds your own personal web browser and internet connection encryption software.  Since everything runs from the SurfEasy key (never on the computer) it\u2019s important that the key is as fast and durable as possible.  We expect your SurfEasy key to last over 3.5 years with daily use.\nThe software on SurfEasy is a highly-modified, patent pending browser based on the Mozilla platform that includes an embedded custom SSL tunnel solution, which wraps all your browsing in the same encryption used by the big banks.   Your personal web browser looks and acts just like your normal web browser, but in the background a lot of custom development ensures your online privacy and ease of use.  Here are just a few of the custom features:\nPassword protection locks access to the SurfEasy key and all your personal information whenever the USB is removed or after a period of inactivity.\nPatent pending management of a complex network of private encrypted proxies that protect your online privacy and freedom without you having to press one button.\nCustom Google search solution that lets you get localized search results behind a proxy network without passing your IP address.\nAccess some media that may be blocked in your country. (see FAQ's for details)\nA lot of really hard stuff that makes everything look easy!\nWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of the hard work done, but we need your help to start our first production run.  Our product is designed and custom handmade samples have been created.  Our software is working very well in beta and now we need to put it all together.  With your support we will move forward into tooling and production and begin shipping SurfEasy\u2019s to Backers in early October.\nFor more information check our webpage at www.SurfEasy.com, follow us on Twiiter @SurfEasyInc and Facebook facebook.com/SurfEasyInc\nThank You!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "SurfEasy VPN - Kickstarter Special Offer", "update_content": "Hello Kickstarters\n In 2011, you helped us raise almost $70,000 to bring our first product \u2013 the SurfEasy Private Browser to market.

Thank you for checking out our Kickstarter page.  We have an idea that we think is great, but we need your help to bring it to life and into your hands.\nStylusist is an accessory for the Ipad 2 that saves you from the much-dreaded, \u201clost stylus\u201d. We think it's a much needed addition for any stylus user and iPad 2 owner.  With the help of Stylusist, you can always have your stylus available for whenever you may need it. Instead of having to search through your backpack, car, purse, pockets, house, or where ever you think you last put it.  Just clip your stylus onto your iPad 2 and it\u2019s always handy.  \nWe need YOUR help because the cost to manufacture a Stylusist is expensive.  We want to make a product that is high enough quality to be deemed acceptable for accessorizing the iPad 2.  To do this, it requires a process called injection molding, which cost a lot up front.  In order to pay for production, we would prefer pledges of $20 or more.  \nWe created a limited $1 or More pledge option to get this project off the ground.  We hope that if you do pledge less than $20 you tell your friends and spread the word about Stylusist and our Kickstarter page!\nWe came up with the idea for Stylusist when we noticed a big increase in Stylus purchases for the iPads.  We were thinking of why we personally would NOT buy a stylus, and it wasn\u2019t because we wouldn\u2019t use one.  It was because we knew we would lose it immediately. In fact, we purchased the top 3 best selling styluses on Amazon to get the sizing for our product right, and within the first day we had already lost one.  Instantly, proving the value of our product.\n\nThe measurements for Stylusist are 85 mm wide x 35 mm tall.  The depth is 11.8 mm because the plastic itself is 1.5 mm thick (making it 3mm thicker than the iPad2 itself. It holds a Stylus that has a circumference of 26.9 mm or a diameter of 8.5mm.\nYou gotten this far! Now, help us turn Stylusist and our dream into a reality by making a pledge today!!

Now What?\nHi! First off, THANK YOU to everyone who has backed this project! But if you haven't, you might be asking yourself why back a project that's already fully funded. That's a great question that I'm happy to answer: REWARDS!\nYou can still essentially pre-order a copy of the book by backing this project, get prints of the artwork or even snap up some of the remaining portrait commission and cameo appearance rewards available for backers in the last few days of this project.\nSo please take this opportunity to continue supporting The Circus and the Cyclone and sharing it with everyone. Thank you again!\n~~~\nThe Circus and the Cyclone is a piece of fantastical historical fiction set against the worst natural disaster in Wisconsin\u2019s history - the destruction of the town of New Richmond by a tornado in 1899. The event was made even more tragic because a traveling circus had also arrived that day, attracting many outside visitors to the town. \nUsing this backdrop, I have created a narrative that weaves between a pair of childhood friends, now grown and fallen in love, a pair of clowns competing for the affections of a beautiful contortionist traveling with the circus and a megalomaniac human cannonball who dreams of flying to the moon. All of these stories culminate when the tornado suddenly strikes, turning fates and revealing hidden truths.\nThe book is fully illustrated in my unique style which combines historical circus art with the artistic style of the golden age of illustration from the early 20th century. I have created nearly 50 illustrations already with only a few to go. I'm working on an expanded draft of the novel which will integrate with the illustrations to create a compelling story that is both visually rich and entertaining.\nI'm hoping to have the last of the illustrations completed in the month following the closure of this Kickstarter campaign, including the integration of anyone who is rewarded with a cameo appearance.  We are ultimately targeting to have everything to your door just in time for holiday gift giving!\nThe book will be 8.5 x 11 inches, printed in full color on nice heavy paper stock in a hard cover binding. Each book will be signed and shipped to your door. Electronic copies are DRM free and can be read on your computer or other device that can open PDFs. Prints of the artwork are roughly in 8.5 x 11 in. They will be shipped flat along with your book.

The adventure will be written by Dev Purkayastha, who created the initial The Dance and the Dawn tabletop roleplaying game.  See the update log for more details.\n****************\nAbout the Medium\nA theatrical experience -- also known as \u201cinteractive literature\u201d or as \u201clive-action roleplay\u201d -- is essentially a play without a script or an audience. It is a chance to live out a story, guided by the game rules but ultimately directed only by one's own thoughts and actions. \nAbout the Game\nThe players take on the roles of nobles in a gothic fairy-tale realm, convened for a great ritual dance, who have one night to find love and redemption.  Six players become the Ladies of Ash, who have come to the midnight ball in hopes of healing their heartbreak; seven become the cold, proud Lords of Ice who are there waiting for them, and who struggle with tragedies of their own; and the other two become the Queen of Ice and the Duke of Ash, the enigmatic figures who have arranged the whole affair.  The game is an event that lasts about four hours, which will be taken up with dancing and dueling and courtly intrigue...and, of course, with the eternal hope of romance and joy. \nAbout the Contents\nThe Dance and the Dawn is a hefty product; we've made sure that it contains everything that you might need to run a satisfying and enchanting Midnight Ball.  Game materials include:\nTwo complete rulesheets -- one for the Ladies of Ash, one for the Lords of Ice.\nFourteen extensive character sheets, detailing the history, personality, and special abilities of the nobles present at the midnight ball.  (The Queen and the Duke share a character sheet.)  \nAn Orchestrator's Guide, explaining the hidden machinery of the game and providing tips for keeping it running smoothly.\nAn additional play guide for the Queen and the Duke, expanding on their tasks as the ball's masters-of-ceremonies. \n...it's a darned good value for $10. \nWhat do I get for my money?\n$1: A PDF copy of an tabletop RPG adventure module, compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, set in the world of The Dance and the Dawn.  The module will be composed by Dev Purkayastha, the author of the original Dance and the Dawn tabletop game.  This prize is a bonus offering, available because the project successfully passed the 200% funding milestone.  Many thanks!\n$10: A PDF copy of the game.  This is, almost certainly, substantially less than it will cost at market value.\n$25: At this level you also get the exclusive Dreams of Ice and Ash supplement, which may not be available elsewhere.  See the FAQ for more details.\n$50: The game requires props representing the favors of the six Ladies of Ash.  Each backer at this level will be provided with a set of satin ribbon-rose brooches to serve that function.  As a reward for helping us reach our 150% funding milestone, backers at this level and above will also receive an additional set of six ribbon-roses to serve as the favors of the Ladies included with the supplement.\n$75: The game requires a prop to represent the favor of the Queen of Ice.  Furthermore, one of the characters -- the Prince of Ice -- has to be able to display to seven favors at once.  Each backer at this level will be additionally provided with a crystal brooch for the Queen's favor, as well as a sash for the Prince so that he can gracefully display a whole bunch of brooches at once.\n$150: Each backer at this level will receive a custom character (either a Lady or a Lord), created in consultation with the game's author around his specifications, as well as a character of the other type to serve as the custom character's True Love.  These additional characters will have complete character sheets and will be fully playable.  They will be included in the Dreams of Ice and Ash supplement.\n$500: If you donate this much, the author will come out to you and run the game.  You won't need to worry about Orchestration.  Note that, in addition to the donation, this reward may require reimbursement of travel expenses (depending on where you are and other factors). \nWhere's the money going?\nThe Dance and the Dawn is a fully-written, fully-edited game; it's been run many times, on several continents, carried around the world by people who love it.  But now we want to turn it into a product worthy of public consumption, and for that we need art and layout design and printing and distribution, and those things are expensive for a project of this size -- especially given that we're not willing to cut corners on quality. \nIt's worth noting that, while our $2000 project goal represents the amount we'll need to turn The Dance and the Dawn into a saleable item, money beyond that limit will not be wasted in terms of helping this project grow.  It's possible to make the game look good with a relatively minimal amount of art, but the more pieces we can pay for, the lusher and more beautiful the end product will be.  Money funneled into marketing and publicity power will help us get the game -- and the whole theatrical-experience medium -- to a wider audience.  And there are more games coming down the pipeline...\nWhat's the bigger picture?\nParacelsus Games was founded to promote and popularize interactive literature.  Theatrical experience gaming is very much a niche phenomenon right now, but there are a lot of people out there looking for a fundamentally social form of structured entertainment, and it is our goal to introduce them to the medium that can provide exactly that.  The Dance and the Dawn is our first product; its success will open a great many doors for future theatrical experiences.  For those who want a sneak peek into the future, various games in development include:\nThe Song and the Sunrise, a mechanical and spiritual successor to The Dance and the Dawn -- a wuxia-themed story of swords and sorrow in a China that never was\nThe Soul of the World  -- a tale of humans, given the power of gods by the strength of their desires, seeking to remake creation according to their own philosophies\nAn as-yet-unnamed Miskatonic University Faculty Conference Game\nAnd the waltz plays on, and on, and on...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "More from Paracelsus: Inheritance", "update_content": "A tale of strange technologies, transhuman dreams, and property rights.

Now I find myself frowning alongside all the other sad worker bees during the morning commute. It isn\u2019t like our umbrellas are the problem, but they aren\u2019t helping either.\n\nMy mission is to make the umbrella into something whimsical and beautiful, not just a solemn guardian on those wet days. Each Over Our Heads umbrella is made with my original artwork on the inside of the canopy, surrounding you with colorful scenes when you need it most - on those dull gray days. The outside is left simple and reserved so that you only have to share the love if you want to.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m out to make your rainy days a little less wet and a lot more delightful!\n\nWhy umbrellas?\nBecause they desperately need cheering up. Umbrellas are constantly associated with dreariness and discomfort, but their form and simplicity gives them a strange sort of beauty. It\u2019s the perfect artistic canvas because you can take it with you, and it gives you a view that is both panoramic and personal. Plus, when you\u2019re sharing one it means you\u2019re close together - embraced tightly under your own little domed art gallery. That\u2019s something we could all use when we find ourselves getting wet and sad.\n\nMy goal:\nRight now each of my umbrellas are painted entirely by hand. This is a problem because, with the amount of time that it takes, I have no choice but to sell them at fine art prices. I\u2019d rather they be priced like umbrellas!\n\nTo do this, we intend to start reproducing Over Our Heads umbrellas using a printing process called sublimation. This will allow for the charm and detail of the design to be preserved while greatly lowering the price of each item. It also doesn\u2019t give that chunky texture when you run your fingers over it - it\u2019s like the artwork is a part of the material.\n\nYour contribution:\nWe have already partnered with a printer, but we need money in order to place our first order. Your donation will help pay for the very first shipment of Over Our Heads umbrellas! And the best part is that if you donate $50 or more, it will count as your own pre-order (it gets better too; check out the rewards!).\n\nBut if you like our mission and don\u2019t feel you have the money, I still love you. In fact, I could use your help getting the word out there. You can follow me on Twitter (@OverOurHeads) or facebook (Over Our Heads). Even a single mention on the interwebz will go a long way in making our dream of cheering up your rainy day a reality!\nSHIPPING- (so I've done the research and these are the best prices for those of you who are getting a pre-order= please include this w/ your pledge)\n                     AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, and all EUROPE: $35\n                     CANADA: $24\n                     US: $6\nThese are the two 'brellas that will be reproduced:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Well Hello There!", "update_content": "Look!

If you've ever written with one, you know what we're talking about.  If you haven't heard of these pens, check out jetpen's blurb.http://bit.ly/hitecc \nPen Type-A is a stainless steel replacement for the Hi-Tec-C's cheap plastic housing. To us, the Hi-Tec-C cartridges deserve a more durable home.\n\nThe design is minimal, the construction is super solid, and indestructible to protect and cherish these coveted ink cartridges.  It has a dime screw on one end to allow for easy ink cartridge replacement.  Its shaft is a solid smooth surface with no branding, no fancy grip or grooves, and just the right thickness and weight so it feels comfortable in your hand.  The entire piece is milled and turned from a block of 304 stainless steel.  The raw steel finish today is how it\u2019ll look 50 years from now.  This thing will last forever. \nThe pen slides slowly into its sleeve, which doubles as a ruler.  The notches on the ruler are in cm and inches.  An internal lip at the bottom of the sleeve protects the tip from getting shoved in any further than it should. The tiny amount of space between the sleeve and the pen creates an effect like a pneumatic cylinder, so the pen slides in slow and smooth.\n\nWe'd love to share our passion for this pen.\n\nWith your support, we'd like to gather enough pre-orders to cover the tooling costs to get this pen into your hands.  It also makes a great gift, so we've opened up higher pledges for those of you who want more than one.\n\nYour support is greatly appreciated!\nLove, CW&T\nPS.

We are ecstatic to deliver you a pair of Eyez\u2122 and can\u2019t wait for you to start recording.\n  Best Regards,\nZionEyez\nThe facts:\nOur engineering team at ZionEyez is currently developing Eyez\u2122, the latest innovation in personal video recording technology. Eyez\u2122 embeds a 720p HD video camera within a pair of eyeglasses designed to record live video data and take pictures. The recorded data can be stored on the 8GB of flash memory within the Eyez\u2122 glasses, transferred via Wifi/Bluetooth or Micro USB to a computer, or wirelessly transferred to most iPhone or Android devices. After a one-time download of the \u201cEyez\u2122\u201d smartphone and tablet app, users can wirelessly broadcast the video in real time to their preferred social networking website.\n\n\nCurrently, the most popular way to record mobile video is via smartphone or digital camera. However, while the online social network platforms are excellent for receiving the video, physically recording the video remains problematic. Many recorded video streams are short, largely because it is uncomfortable for users to continuously hold their cameras up for longer than a few minutes. Also, users are forced to watch the event they are recording through the miniature mobile phone screen, rather than enjoying the action as it unfolds in front of them. \n\nEyez\u2122 solves both of these problems. Now users can comfortably record live video completely hands-free, and without the burden of watching it through a tiny screen. Users can simply tap the power sensor, open the Eyez\u2122 app (or not), and then forget about it. Several networking sites, including Qik and LiveStream, will broadcast to users profiles' and save the videos to cloud storage. If users prefer not to broadcast the video to the internet or to their mobile, the data will automatically save to the built-in flash memory, allowing for an easy upload later via Micro USB or Bluetooth. While employing cutting-edge technological advances, Eyez\u2122 glasses are also practical for daily use. Users can choose from high quality removable lenses in both clear and shaded tones. In addition, the shape of Eyez\u2122 glasses is extremely popular, so most optical stores can easily fit the appropriate prescription lenses. Imagine yourself recording exactly what your \"Eyez\u2122\" see, whether it be worldly travels or a college lecture, no memorable event will be lost. No other product in existence can deliver you such a first person video recording experience.\n\n\nOur Team:\n\nAt ZionEyez we have a team of the most talented engineers in the micro video recording technology field. Joe Taylor, our Chief Technology Officer is an engineer who has designed many consumer electronics products, including products for the FLIP line of video cameras. Joe studied Engineering at Purdue University where he recieved his B.A. of Science. Joe is working closely alongside many of his former colleagues from FLIP who specialize in the hardware and software development of personal video recording technology.\nLeading the ZionEyez team as CEO is Carlos Becerra, he was formally educated  at University of California San Diego where he received a Bachelor of Science in Economic Management Science. He later acquired his J.D. from U.C. Hastings College of Law.\nOur Mission:\nOur mission is to revolutionize the way people share the most significant experiences in their life. We are idealists who know that people value memories most. ZionEyez provides a solution for capturing these moments without compromising convenience or style.\n\n\nYour support:\n\nZionEyez has carefully assessed all of the possible options for getting the Eyez\u2122 glasses to the market as quickly as possible.

It is a play that everyone can relate to and become engrossed in. You can't learn or feel if you're bored, and Gilman intuitively knows this. This is a play that will disturb you in one moment, make you chuckle in the next, and need to discuss it all over coffee afterwards.\nIf you're a woman and have ever felt yourself measured and judged by the eyes of men on a city street, then this play relates to you. If you have a woman in your life, a daughter, sister, partner, friend, then this play is for you. If you admire the beauty of women, then this play is for you. If you prefer TV to the theatre, then come see this play. If you've ever done any internet or blind dating, or have ever been on any sort of date, then this play relates to you. This play is for everyone.\nProduction Vision\n\nOur aim is to let Gilman\u2019s words speak for themselves \u2014 to tell the story simply and truthfully. Theater depends on nothing more than an audience and an actor, and the barest production values to provide context for the whole. We are currently putting together our design team and arranging for performance space that will be intimate enough to preserve the theatricality of the piece. And we need your help to make it happen.\nHarry Diesel Productions\n\nIt's not easy producing a play in New York City, and it's infinitely harder to do it without the aid of a theatre company or access to grants.

At that time I realized that there was no easy solution to this problem. I could either buy an outrageously expensive pair of jeans that did fit, or buy a cheap pair and get it tailored. It was really hard to find a department store that carried a size that fit just right. \nWhat I eventually came to realize is that there is a fundamental problem with the way we buy jeans today. It's easy to find a style you like, but when it comes to finding the right size and fit at a reasonable price... well that's another story entirely.\nIn 2009, I teamed up with Leona who like me shared the same frustration with jeans. Together, we set out on a mission to come up with a way to affordably manufacture custom-fit jeans. Since neither of us had a lot of experience sewing, we first examined the possibility of outsourcing the production to China or India. Unfortunately, we quickly discovered that most of the foreign manufacturers were unable to do mass-individualized orders. The few that could, had very long lead times. \nThe Solution:\nUltimately we decided that in order to do this right, we had to do the manufacturing ourselves. So here we are two years later after countless sewing classes, trade shows, practice runs and a trip to China. From all of this experience, we have finally developed a production system that delivers our goal: A custom fit pair of jeans for around $60.\nHow Does it Work?\nIn order to custom tailor the jeans specifically for you, we first take a few of your measurements (inseam, waist, hip, etc.) and then utilize technology in a big way. Unlike the majority of jeans (which are cut in large quantities), each pair of our jeans needs to be cut, sized and sewn individually. Unfortunately, this can be extremely time consuming because there are usually 15 different pieces of fabric per pair of jeans. That's where our computerized cutting machine comes in (one of our most important... and expensive tools!).\nYour measurements are put into a special Autocam program linked to the computerized cutting machine (above). The program will begin by modifying each section of the jeans digitally to your exact size. Once we finalize the design, the automatic cutter will then slice each piece to the specified dimensions. This machine essentially takes the time it would normally take to cut the individual pieces, and reduces it by 2 hours! Once this process is complete, it's just a matter of sewing the pieces together, distressing the jeans and applying a final wash.\nWhy Should I Invest?\nBecause in this day and age, we have the ability to clone cattle, smash atoms together and even create antimatter, but when it comes to finding an affordable pair of jeans that fit perfect... good luck!\nWe're doing this project because we want to deliver on a basic need that has been ignored for way too long. People want clothing that fits! And they don't want to pay a fortune for it. Your donations will help us to change this model and launch an affordable solution in the marketplace. Eventually we hope that one day, all clothing will be custom-made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 147, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sammiller/custom-fit-jeans", "project_name": "Custom Fit Jeans"}}, {"backer": "Darva Campbell", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In March 2011 Amanda Palmer and Kim Boekbinder sat on a couch in a warehouse in Melbourne, Australia and sang a song called \"Such Great Heights,\" by The Postal Service. \nIt was the end of the night at the end of the tour at the end of the world.

Not only will we be manufacturing in the U.S. but the black WINGStands will also be made using recycled, regrind plastic.

Thanks for checking out the WINGStand and supporting the project. In case you\u2019re interested, here\u2019s a little more info about the WINGStand and the story behind it. Also, there are FAQ's at the bottom of the page if you have a specific question in mind.\nThe Cliff notes version:\n\u201cThe WINGStand creates the world\u2019s sharpest multi-touch laptop by physically integrating a wireless keyboard with an iPad, tablet, or smartphone. It connects to a full sized keyboard making it possible to type naturally as one would with an actual computer. \nThe WINGStand is manufactured via a process called injection molding. This allows us to assure an impeccably high quality product, but it also entails a large upfront cost for initial tooling. The purpose of the Kickstarter campaign is to raise enough money cover these upfront costs and make the WINGStand a reality.\nThe WINGStand accommodates a myriad of different devices including the iPad, iPad2, iPhone, and all other tablets on the market. It also works with most cases including the iPad Smart Cover and 1st Generation iPad case. Independent of a keyboard, the WINGStand doubles as an upright stand for tablets, smartphones, and eReaders.\nThe Extended Edition:\nThe WINGStand was designed to give tablets the same interactive capabilities as actual computers. Because touch screen devices have always lacked a tactile interface, it has been impossible to write with them as if they were computer. As such, devices like the iPad have been used almost exclusively for reading and media display. But not anymore. \nThe WINGStand solves the typing issue by uniting a touchscreen device with a wireless keyboard, thus creating a de-facto laptop with an iPad, tablet, or smartphone as the monitor. But the WINGStand does a lot more than the standard laptop. For instance, the WINGStand setup allows you to remove, rotate and reconfigure an iPad, tablet, or smartphone in any orientation. It enables one to switch between different devices for different circumstances, and it even doubles as an upright stand without a keyboard when needed.\nWe\u2019ve worked to create a device that mirrors the same clean, elegant simplicity of Apple products. The design is sleek, with subtle curves and smooth faces. Our goal with the wingstand was not only to make you more efficient but also to inspire you - to bring simplicity, clarity, and elegance to your life. \nSo Why Kickstarter?\nWhy are we launching on Kickstarter? Because the injection molding process used to create each WINGStand is quite expensive. The price of tooling, the machinery, setting up the equipment, and ordering the first run of WINGStands is more than most individuals can afford, let alone an enthusiastic student. Kickstarter is a way of building energy around the WINGStand and raising enough money to make the product a reality.\nBut in reality it\u2019s a lot more. This Kickstarter campaign is also a way of showing that today, a good idea is no longer limited by age, or connections, or money. With a good work ethic, a dose of youthful enthusiasm, and a community of active, involved and supportive patrons, any good idea can be realized- even one developed in a Stanford dorm room. The WINGStand, I hope, will be testament to that fact.\nWith regards,\nDaniel H.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Wonderful Things", "update_content": " I\u2019ve been making physical products for years now - starting with the Wingstand, the Handleband and a handful of other cool gadgets since then.

The really cool thing is that there are NO straps/clips/velcro/magnets required, only the screen of your iPhone 4/iPod touch will be visible. Even if you have no pockets, you can keep in touch on the go.\nHow it Works\n1) Place The Move behind your shirt or article of clothing that you are going to 'wear' The Move with. \n2) Position The Move where you want your iPhone4/iPod Touch screen to appear.\n3) Place your iPhone4/iPod Touch in front of your shirt or article of clothing.\n4) Secure your iPhone4/iPod Touch by snapping it into The Move (as shown in the pic below):\nYour clothing is what keeps The Move in place, it will be secure until you want to take it off!\nSpecial features of the The Move include:\nPoint of View Video\nWhen your iPhone 4/iPod touch is attached anywhere on your clothing, you can record video hands free wherever you are.\nUse it:\nAt a concert\nAt a sporting event\nCapturing memories with your kids\nHiking\nBiking\nOn vacation and exploring \nAnywhere you are and anything you're doing you can now record video - hands free!\nListening to Music  \nAttach your iPhone 4/iPod Touch to either the upper arm of your shirt or near your waist with your headphones and you will have quick access to your iTunes music library and phone where ever you go (your headphones jack connects as normal to your iPhone4/iPod Touch which you then insert into The Move).\n Use it: \nWalking\nJogging\nHiking\nBiking\nWaiting in line\nHands Free Reference\nAttach your iPhone 4/iPod touch to your forearm for hands free reference.\nUse it:\nAs a GPS device you can use while driving\nFor accessing reference material when sightseeing\nTo view recipes quick and easy when cooking\nFor quick access to notes during presentations\nWhen Geocaching\nReference tabs while playing guitar \nHands Free Phone\nAttach The Move close to the neck line your shirt and use it as a hands free device for your iPhone 4. It's a great way to keep in touch on the go because you don't need any pockets/clips/cases, The Move goes where you go, anytime, anywhere!\nThe Plan\nIn order to bring The Move to market we need a way to mass produce them to bring down the cost per unit.  The way to do it is by a process called injection molding. The catch is that the creation of Injection molds is costly. Your pledge money will be used to create the molds we need to bring The Move to you!\nWe have a local manufacturer lined up who will help us create the molds and start producing The Move once we have reached our funding goal of $25,000.\nAfter all pledges have been received all we have to do is contact the manufacturer with the design (that we have already created) to get the molds made, then we will start manufacturing and immediately shipping out The Move to all the people that helped us reach our goal by pledging! \nAll manufacturing of the injection molds and The Move will be done locally, we want to keep this product domestic and help our local economy.\n\nShipping Info\nWe are pleased to offer FREE Shipping to all orders within Canada and the U.S. International orders please add $8-12 for shipping depending on the pledge tier listed to the right. \n\nOnce we receive complete funding for The Move we will start shipping the orders when the manufacturing process is complete.\n\nThanks!\nThanks again for looking at our Project! We'd love to hear about some of the ways you think you could use the Move. One thing that we've learned is that when people see it, they are blown away and give great and unique ideas that they will use the Move for!  Be sure to leave us a comment on how you will use your Move.\n\nIf funding is successful, we will add a section to our web site where people can upload photos of themselves using the Move in their unique way AND video that they have taken when using The Move as a Point of View camera. Stay tuned for details as we will announce this on our website: www.theiphonemove.com and as a backer you will receive exclusive access to this section of the website for a limited time after launch.\nVideo music acknowledgement - Kevin MacLeod", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jonathan\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nJon and Lenny have been friends since college and have always been interested in bringing products to market.

The trailer is beautifully shot and suggests the promise and potential of this mind blowing story \u2026 it could ultimately be a wonderful and dramatic take on this much loved tale.\"\n- Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop\nTHE MOST EPIC-EST SHORT FILM EVER MADE\nTroll Bridge is an epic short film based on a fable written by Terry Pratchett.  Set in the phenomenally successful Discworld series, Troll Bridge is about the world\u2019s last Barbarian hero (now at the age of 87) embarking on a suicide mission to battle a bridge troll in mortal combat.\nTroll Bridge aims to be the largest scale short film in history.  Using resources garnered over eight solid years of dedication, love, sweat, and tears \u2013 Troll Bridge has already begun exceeding expectations as to what should be anticipated from a short form production.  With the scale of Lord of the Rings, the absurdity of Monty Python, and the intimacy of Into The Wild - Troll Bridge relishes the opportunity to present the Disc in all the grandeur and depth of character she deserves.\nTHE ADAPTATION\nTo boost the quota of epic-ness in Troll Bridge, a short prologue scene was written (which Terry Pratchett contributed some dialogue for) has already been shot.  This prologue introduces Cohen in his prime, as a young man battling several armies at once.  This scene was built to counter balance and strengthen the intimacy of the later scenes with Cohen, empowering the viewers to appreciate and relate to the challenges of age that Cohen now finds himself in.  For all intents and purposes \u2013 Cohen\u2019s journey to Death Bridge in which the troll resides, heralds the expectation that it will his last.  To adequately depict Cohen at the end of adventure \u2013 it\u2019s important to show him at the beginning.\nA teaser trailer for this portion of the film is now online.  While it doesn\u2019t reveal the direction we want to take the remainder of the film (we haven\u2019t shot it yet!) \u2013 it does adequately communicate the scale and quality we wish to continue shooting in.\nThat\u2019s what this funding drive is all about!\nTHE BUDGET\nLet\u2019s be clear about this, not a single cent of this funding drive is to be spent on wages.  Every dollar that goes into it \u2013 you will see on screen.  The entire process; from direction to catering to art design and costuming to acting and armoring \u2013 is all being done on a volunteer basis.  The entire cast and crew (although all professionals in their field) are in this project for the passion of it.\nThat means we\u2019re spending this money on building the bridge set, warehouse hire for the set, equipment hire, bigiature construction, costuming materials, travel, make-up and so on and so forth.  If we exceed this limit (and we certainly hope we do), we\u2019ll be spending that additional money on better equipment, better materials, and better locations.  Not a single cent will be wasted \u2013 it\u2019s vitally important to us that we do justice to Terry Pratchett\u2019s work.\nPROMOTING THE PROJECT\nIf you are part of a community, or have an active social media profile, please take the time to let your members, audience, or friends and family know about this project.  Word of mouth is our best way of raising awareness of this film \u2013 and in that regard your help is invaluable!  Please let people know about this page.\nAlso take the time to fan us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, or subscribe to us on YouTube.  Keep up to date with the project\u2019s status and evolution.

She has gone over the pits more times than we can count to try and get her looking right for the film, but more importantly, right for Terry\u2019s dialogue. Feedback from our convention screenings have been absolutely invaluable in recognising the work ahead we had with her. The rhythm and intentions of the dialogue is a simple enough thing to translate, but finding an image that appropriately balances that character is even more important (and we\u2019ve learned that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean going for the obvious).\n\nWe think we\u2019re close to locking her off (again) but wanted to post what we had in order to reaffirm / renounce what we had in our head before returning to the heavy CG process.\n\nhas been instrumental in helping us through many of these revisions, and has graciously allowed his more recent designs to be seen for public comment.

His work influenced countless generations of illustrators and animators including Walt Disney. Unfortunately, outside of film history books, Winsor never received the attention that he deserved.\nThe Flying House (1921)\nIn 1921, Winsor McCay created one of his greatest short films, The Flying House. Unfortunately for animation history, his boss William Randolph Hearst felt that the talented artist was neglecting his drawing duties at the paper, and demanded that he stop making films. So, sadly, The Flying House was McCay's last film. Who knows what great achievements he could have attained had he not given up his animation career. With his talent, he could have surpassed Walt Disney, whose Mickey Mouse was still 6 years in the future.\nThe Flying House (2011)\nI discovered The Flying House a few years ago while watching a collection of McCay\u2019s works on an old videocassette tape. I was amazed by the humor, great storytelling, and of course, the superior draftsmanship. But all that was hindered by too many intertitles, word balloons, and the lack of color, music, and sound. The biggest problem with the film is the terrible condition of the print. It has been neglected and badly handled for nearly 90 years. It's a mess of scratches, dust, and erosion. So, I took it upon myself to restore and update the film for a new generation. STEP 1: painstakingly clean every frame of the film by removing all the imperfections. STEP 2: color each frame, using reprints of Winsor\u2019s color comics as a guide. Winsor loved color and even hand-colored some of his early films, like Little Nemo in Slumberland. STEP 3: record actors Patricia Clarkson and Matthew Modine to give voices to the two leading characters allowing us to remove the word balloons and intertitles. STEP 4: hire a musician and sound editor to add a stirring new soundtrack to compliment the beautiful new picture. \nFunds\nI\u2019ve been working on all of this for awhile now, but still have a long way to go. The restoration process is quite laborious \u2013 each of the 12,000 frames has to be personally cleaned up. There's no magic computer program called \"Clean the Film.\u201d With your help, we can continue to work on this important project and hopefully complete it later this year. $10,000 is the bare minimum we need to move forward, but we hope to raise a lot more. I\u2019ve never worked on a project like this before. It\u2019s far more costly, time consuming, and difficult than I ever anticipated. Even a small pledge of $5 or $10 will help us, so if you\u2019re a fan of animation, please consider supporting this project.\nI remember when the great bluesman Howlin' Wolf, in his declining years, recorded an album with his big fans, The Rolling Stones, and that album went on to become the greatest blues album ever, and people rediscovered the genius of Howlin' Wolf. Well, that's what I want to do with Winsor McCay. Young animators have no idea who this genius is. In my opinion, he was the greatest animator, bar none; better than Ub Iwerks, Hayao Miyazaki, Bill Tytla, Milt Kahl \u2013 even Bill Plympton! And he deserves to be rediscovered by the world for the genius that he was. I hope this new version of his film will give Winsor and his great body of work a second chance at life.\nThank you for your support!\n-Bill\nFor more information on Winsor McCay and Bill Plympton, visit the following sites.\nThe official Winsor McCay Wikipedia page\nThe official Bill Plympton Wikipedia page\nBill Plympton\u2019s Plymptoons website\nBill Plympton\u2019s official Facebook page\nFor a pledge of only $125, you will receive this limited edition 14 x 22-inch movie poster signed and numbered by Bill Plympton and actor Matthew Modine!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "I NEED YOUR HELP!", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nFor the first time, I'm using animation to satirize a president.

Both models are virtually identical looking with an ergonomic, very comfortable grip and use the best available LED light source. The Prime has a max light output of 350 lumens and the Flex has a max light output of 500 lumens. For reference, a good quality $30 brand-name flashlight puts out 100 lumens of light. The major difference between the Prime and Flex models is the HexBright Flex is USB rechargeable and USB programmable. If you want, you can re-write the default code and tweak the HexBright Flex however you desire.\nWhy do I need a programmable light? What can I do with that? I don't know yet. And that's the point. I want to release the HexBright Flex into the wild and let the community develop original source code. I want to see how brilliant (pun intended) people can be and supply an outlet (hexbright.com) where folks can swap and share ligthing code. I'm not fundraising just to make creative lights, I want to build online creativity.\nWhat about programmable color LEDs? Yep, definitely want to do that, but I am taking baby steps first.\nBack story\nJust about anywhere you can buy a cheap flashlight with a zillion unnecessary modes (high, med, low, slow blinky, fast blinky, SOS blinky... laser pointer too??). All garbage and the light will usually break on you. I made myself a light the way I wanted it; I picked the best available LED (a CREE XM-L!!!), a good rechargeable battery, built the electronics and programmed it with the only modes I wanted- high, low, and blinky. From necessity (also known as cheapness) I machined the body out of 1\" aluminum hex bar stock and came up with a unique elegant look with a surprisingly very comfortable grip.\nBased on the aluminum hex-bar body, I named my light the HexBright Prime, and I was pretty happy with it. Then I wanted something better.\nIt was a no-brainer the next upgrade should have a mini-usb plug right on the board so we could flash direct to the microprocessor. And hey, might as well put a charging circuit on the board to charge the lithium-ion battery right in the HexBright case. \nI conceived the HexBright Flex but I was tapped out of cash to actually make one. Kickstarter became an obvious solution. To raise capital I am offering reproductions of my original and first-made HexBright Prime for just $35 or you can pre-order the more powerful and versatile HexBright Flex for $60.\nWhat's the money for?\nThe money is going toward economies of scale. I need to order at least 1,000 of the most expensive items (CREE XM-L, electronics, optics, batteries) so my fundraising amount is based on making 1,000 HexBrights. Also, I need to make molds and aluminum extrusion dies to reduce manufacturing costs. I machined my original HexBright Prime out of solid hex-bar stock, but if I can have the bar stock made with a hole in the middle I save a ton of time and money and you can pre-order a really great light for a low-low $35 pledge. My primary goal is to put as much of your pledge money into what really matters for a light- the LED, the electronics, optics, and the battery. The sexy, ergonomic, anti-roll grip is just the icing on the cake.\nThe HexBright Team\nIt takes talented people to get anything ambitious done. Resident electronics expert Terry is the \"bright\" behind the HexBright's amazing power.\nTerry H. Cooke has 10 plus years in mechanical and electrical design experience. He has worked both in the aerospace industry for NASA and Oribital Launch system as well as designed 3D camera systems for James Cameron and the movie Avatar. His current work includes Lecturing and Research in Mechatronics design for Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo and Contracting work in the medical field.\nOne more note\nIf I can raise more than my fundraising goal I will be able to run the HexBright Prime and HexBright Flex through a series of tests to qualify them as \"tactical\" lights. Tactical lights are typically at least 250 lumens and cost over $200. How cool would it be for you to own a 350 lumen tactical light for a $35 pledge?\nThanks again for reading and I hope you like the unique look of HexBright!

No worries! Pre-order yours directly at www.SnapStylus.com\nCompatible with iPad 1 & 2.\nShipping within the USA is FREE. (INT'L please add $8).\nNot long after I bought my iPad I discovered certain applications in the App Store that were simply better with a stylus. Games like Flight Control, Apps like PenUltimate, etc., were just not as good using your finger. However, the keyboard-use necessary in many of the most used apps like Safari and Mail left me without my stylus when I eventually did need it. For this problem, I began designing clip-on stylus holders that would hold styluses much like the top of clipboards do. The problem with this method, I soon figured out, was that the vast difference in stylus sizes (i.e. Cosmonaut vs. MORE/REAL Stylus Cap) would leave me with an overly universal stylus holder that just wouldn't match the iPad's crispness.\nThis is where the idea for the SnapStylus was born. As you can see above, the SnapStylus works for both iPad 1 & 2 and is the simplest solution possible. It also matches the iPad's color and ingenuity.\nMy funding goal is able to be kept low since pre-fabricated, high quality styluses are simply modified with magnets to work in this awesome manner.

YOUR EMAILS OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUGGESTIONS HAVE SPURRED ME TO WORK EVEN HARDER.\nI WILL SOON SEND OUT A SURVEY TO OUR BACKERS ASKING YOU FOR YOUR ADDRESS, MODEL OF iPAD AND ANY FEEDBACK YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE.\nIF YOU ARE VISITING HERE AFTER THE KICKSTARTER PROJECT HAS CLOSED, PLEASE FOLLOW US ON TWITTER; and FACEBOOK FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ORDERING AN IKEYBOARD WHEN OUR E-COMMERCE WEB SITE IS UP AND RUNNING.\nAND, AGAIN, THANK YOU.\nFREE YOUR HEAD\nThe iKeyboard addresses the one drawback of a tablet computer\u2014the impossibility of touch-typing on its virtual keyboard.  \nImagine riding a bicycle having to exclusively watch your feet on the pedals. Worse, you have to think about where each foot is every second and tell your legs to \"push right foot down. Okay, my right foot is all the way down, now push left foot down.\"  You can't ride like that. You'll either fall over or crash into a pole.\nNow imagine sitting in a classroom trying to take notes but having to exclusively look at a virtual keyboard so you'll be able to hit the right letters. If you're thinking about where the next key is to tap, you can't take notes because you can't simultaneously think about what the teacher is saying.\nReview after review of the leading tablet, the iPad, has cited the virtual keyboard as its one imperfection. Good for short, quick notes and emails. Inadequate for real writing.\nThe reason it\u2019s inadequate is that the user can\u2019t touch-type, but must \u201chunt-and-peck\u201d instead.\nTouch-typing is vital for productivity, because it produces greater speed and accuracy than hunt-and-peck typing. \nBut even more important, touch-typing frees up your brain to focus on other tasks besides the mere physical act of finding and hitting the right key.\nTouch-typing and hunt-and-peck typing use different parts of the brain. Touch-typing uses what\u2019s called muscle memory, which enables an action to become automatic. Touch-typing is like riding a bicycle, or playing a musical instrument, or just walking.\nHunt-and-peck typing \u201chijacks\u201d the thinking part of your brain, making it unavailable for more important tasks. Your brain is monopolized by having to ask a series of questions and issue a series of instructions: \"Where is the 'W\u2019? Touch that spot.\" \"Where is the 'H\u2019? Touch that spot.\"\nBy making touch-typing possible on a tablet computer, the iKeyboard sets the thinking part of the brain free. Free to listen, free to learn, and free to think.\nWHY YOU CAN\u2019T TOUCH-TYPE ON A VIRTUAL KEYBOARD\nA virtual keyboard is an image of a keyboard that is displayed on a tablet\u2019s touch-screen. You type by touching the image of the keys. One advantage of a virtual keyboard is that it doesn\u2019t increase the footprint or weight of the device. Another advantage is that when it\u2019s not needed, the virtual keyboard disappears, freeing up space on the screen.\nHowever, a virtual keyboard deprives you of the positioning cues and tactile feedback provided by a \u201creal,\u201d or physical, keyboard. \nThat\u2019s because the touch-screen is super-sensitive, so it\u2019s impossible for you to lightly rest your fingers on the virtual keys without typing the characters. And the keys themselves are just images, so you can\u2019t know by feel alone where your fingers are on the keyboard.\nInstead, you must suspend your fingers over the screen and must keep your eyes on the virtual keyboard\u2014at all times\u2014to know where to type. So the only kind of typing you can do is the two-fingered, hunt-and-peck variety.\nHunt-and-peck typing increases errors and decreases speed. Instead of watching what you\u2019ve just typed so that you can instantly correct an error, you must keep your eyes on the virtual keyboard. Copying something from a book or newspaper using a virtual keyboard takes far longer than with a real keyboard. Taking notes at a lecture or business meeting is almost impossible, because you can\u2019t keep up with what the speaker is saying or watch the blackboard.\nTo touch-type, you need a real keyboard. A real keyboard permits your fingers to rest on the keys without typing. A real keyboard lets you know\u2014without looking\u2014whether your fingers are on the correct keys. A real keyboard lets you feel whether you have actually typed a character.\nA real keyboard, however, increases a device\u2019s footprint and weight. A physical keyboard is contrary to the very idea of a tablet computer.\nTHE BEST OF (BOTH) WORLDS\nOne solution is to carry around a Bluetooth real keyboard. However, using a Bluetooth keyboard with your iPad adds weight and bulk and gives the device a bigger footprint (so it needs a desk to sit on instead of a lap). If you're going to carry around an iPad plus a Bluetooth keyboard, you're much better off just taking a laptop computer with you. \nAdding a Bluetooth keyboard to an iPad amounts to turning a prince back into a frog.\nMy solution is to provide the feedback missing from a virtual keyboard by \u201cgrafting,\u201d or piggybacking, a real keyboard onto the screen. My invention\u2014the iKeyboard\u2014will sit atop the virtual keyboard and be lightweight. It will add little bulk and not increase the footprint of the tablet. It will be easy and fast to deploy and remove.The iKeyboard will improve accuracy and typing speed, letting tablet users do real writing. It will set the brain free. In certain settings\u2014the lecture hall, the library, the classroom\u2014the iKeyboard will be an essential tool rather than just a useful accessory.\nTo bring my idea to life, I've been working with the excellent industrial design firm IDEAZ.\nWe started by identifying the tactile characteristics of traditional keyboards that we needed to mimic in order to make the iKeyboard useful. Two characteristics were of paramount importance: the force needed to activate a key, and the distance a key must \u201ctravel\u201d to type a character.\nThe designers at IDEAZ have managed to match the force required to depress a key on the iKeyboard to the force needed to depress a key on an Apple keyboard. They\u2019ve also succeeded in making the iKeyboard's keys travel a distance equal to that of Apple keys. We now have a fully functional prototype that works pretty well.The highest hurdles have been jumped. \nWHAT'S LEFT TO DO\nIDEAZ is continuing to work on optimizing the geometry of the keys and matching that geometry with the best polymers for the task. Need money. We\u2019ll need to make additional prototypes to test those refinements. Need money. I\u2019d like to expand user testing to a larger focus group than we\u2019ve used so far. Need money. We also want to do mechanical testing. Again, money.\nI need to have an e-commerce web site designed and coded. Need money. Plus, tooling for the actual manufacturing. More. Money.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here on Kickstarter.\nHelp.\nA HAPPY ENDING\nThis process of taking an idea from napkin doodle to concrete product has been exhilarating\u2014from thinking the iKeyboard through and sketching out the design (after teaching myself how to use rudimentary 3D CAD software), to finding smart people who know industrial design and intellectual property law, to looking for and evaluating manufacturers.If you, too, have come up with a great idea, now's your time.

This is a uniquely designed case that can finally keep up with your imagination.  Just choose the right straps, put them on the case in any position you like, and use your iPad in all new ways.  Be sure to Watch the Video!\nThe Mypadlife is constructed on a hard plastic shell and wrapped in a premium nylon material that provides a look of carbon fiber.  The interior is a soft suede-like material to ensure your iPad is not only protected on the outside but also free from scratches on the inside.\nSince you, like myself, probably don\u2019t like taking your iPad out of its everyday case, the Mypadlife was designed with elastic sides to easily fit your iPad + OEM case (as well as other iPad cases) and arranged to ensure you have full access to your volume, on/off buttons, headphone jack, and camera lens.  The case was designed to fit either a first of second generation iPad.\nThe Mypadlife was created with several sets of \u201cnotches\u201d and \u201cslits\u201d that ensure you can arrange the straps in different orientations for any unique situation.  The straps are created out of the same neoprene material that is used on countless iPod and iPod Nano cases. \nEvery Mypadlife comes with:\n      2 pairs of straps that are 48 inches and 36 inches long (4 straps total).\n      1 strap that is 18 inches long.  \nThe longest length was designed to go around something larger like exercise equipment, the medium sized to go around things like car headrests and tray tables on airplane seats, and the shortest is for hanging your iPad in the kitchen, on the wall, and whatever else you can dream up!\nSo here is where you come in.  I have recently left my job to pursue my entrepreneurial interests, and the Mypadlife is my first venture.  This has been, without a doubt, the most exciting period of my life.   My next project is an online educational tool to empower our youth and help them follow their dreams, as well as generate their own income. Meanwhile, it takes a tremendous amount of resources to manufacture and distribute a product like this.  I am hoping that everyone will contribute to the project and help me realize my dreams, while offering you something incredibly useful.  By pledging $25, you are pre-ordering your own Mypadlife, for delivery by June 2011, and expanding the way you use your iPad.\nThank you!!!!\nWant to learn about or share more great ideas for the Mypadlife?  \nFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Mypadlife\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mypadlife/151897004874888\nNote: Mypadlife will retail for $29.99.  iPad not included.\nShipping Charges:\n       Continental US - Add $5 to your pledge\n       Canada/Puerto Rico/Alaska/Hawaii - Add $10 to your pledge\n       Europe \u2013 Add $15 to your pledge at the $25 and $50 pledge levels. \n       Outside North America and Europe \u2013 Add $20 to your pledge at the $25 and $50 pledge levels.

If you missed out on our Kickstarter campaign head to iRemoco.com where you can sign up to be notified as soon as iRemoco is available to order. You can also follow us on twitter @iRemoco and onfacebook.com/iRemoco to stay up to speed on our activities.\nHi Kickstarters, thanks for checking out our project! We've spent the last 18 months developing a toy controller for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, and now we need your help to get it produced.\niRemoco - What's In the Box\nThere's also a full-color User Manual in the box, that fits neatly on top.\nThe iRemoco App - Main Menu\nTo fly the iRemoco helicopter, you'll need to download and install the free iRemoco App on your iPod touch or iPhone which is available from iTunes. The iPad App is done and will be submitted to iTunes before we ship (you can install the iPhone App on your iPad if you want to check it out anyway).\nBelow is a screenshot of the iRemoco App's main menu;\nThe iRemoco App - Control Screen\nBelow is a screenshot of the joystick control screen, with the throttle joystick on the left. You can swap the position of the joysticks around if you want (under Settings), so the throttle is on the right. This is particularly useful if you want to hold your iPhone or iPod touch in your right-hand when you use motion control.\nFAQs\nIs iRemoco easy to use and fly?\nYes, very! We have tested our prototypes extensively, to make sure the helicopter behaves impeccably when in the air. It's very easy for beginner pilots to master the basic hover, and the motion control, which utilises the accelerometer inside the iPod touch, iPhone and iPad, makes the flying experience fun and intuitive. If you've never flown a remote control helicopter before, this is a perfect way to learn.\nWill my iPod touch, iPhone or iPad work with iRemoco?\nYes! We have designed iRemoco to work with all models of iPod touch, iPhone and iPad. \nCompatibility with;\niPod touch 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th Gen\niPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS & iPhone 4\n+ our own extensively tested compatibility with iPad 1 & 2.\nPlease don't expect iRemoco to work with the iPod Classic, iPod Nano, or iPod shuffle, though! :)\nWill iRemoco fit my iPhone/iPod with its case on?\nIt will fit an iPhone 4 with an Apple bumper case, and we've designed it so there is a gap to accommodate many cases on the market. However, we can\u2019t guarantee it to fit all cases, as there are some very bulky, \"military grade\", bullet proof cases out there!\nWill I need to buy any batteries?\nNo! The iRemoco Controller and helicopter are both fitted with rechargeable batteries and each box comes with a charger that plugs into a USB socket. You won\u2019t need to charge the controller as often as the helicopter, as it's good for many flights. So, if you pledge for more than one helicopter, you'll be able to keep flying whilst the other helis are charging.\nWill iRemoco drain my iPod iPhone battery?\nNo way! We know how precious your iPhone or iPod battery life is to you, which is why we designed a solution that includes a Controller with its own built-in rechargeable battery which powers the data transmission to the helicopter.\nWhere can I fly iRemoco?\niRemoco is designed to be flown inside, with a range of up to 10 meters away.\nWhat if I crash my helicopter?\nWe have looked at this issue carefully and done our best to provide you with one of the most robust and flight-stable helicopters of its type. The helicopter is made with a lightweight metal chassis for extra strength, and the rotors and landing skids are made with an extra flexible plastic to reduce the risk of damage in any crash. Most importantly, we've ensured there's a motor protection system built-in, so if you forget to power-down when you crash, the motors will automatically cut out, preventing any damage to your helicopter that would otherwise occur. If you do damage your rotors, we've included a spare of each rotor type within the box, so you can replace a damaged rotor using a screwdriver. Chances are though, if you're following the advice we give in the User Manual, your helicopter will see another flight, even after falling to the floor or crashing into furniture, etc.\nWhy is iRemoco better than other infra-red, 3-channel helicopters?\n1) Because you can fly it with your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad! And that means having motion control, which is a lot of fun, and takes the flying experience to a new level. It's a very intuitive way to control helicopters. Our innovation isn't so much the helicopter, as the means to fly it. \n2) Also, not only are standard helicopters missing the motion control, their standard controllers often use 6 AA batteries and eat through them in no time. Think of the cost benefit, and environmental benefit in having a single, re-chargeable Controller.\n3) That's right, a single Controller - we plan on introducing other toys for your iRemoco Controller, if our project is successful, saving you from having to buy yet another battery-eating controller with each remote control vehicle, or toy. We also plan some iRemoco App updates too, and will feature these in a video update during the project.\nI have made a pledge, when will I receive my iRemoco package?\nThe minute we reach our funding target we'll get cracking, and we're preparing as much as possible in the meantime to manufacture quickly after funding. As you can imagine, there is a lot of work to do in organising the manufacture of this type of product but we will deliver your pledges as fast as we're able, and we pledge to keep you fully updated as we go along. We hope to have the first batch of iRemoco controllers and helicopters ready for dispatch towards the end of June/beginning of July.\nWant more than one of the same reward?\nSimply enter a multiple of the reward level in the \"Pledge Amount\" box and select the appropriate rewards. For example, if you want 2 lots of the $99 reward, simply pledge $198 and use the $99 + reward selection. We will then send you 2 lots of the $99 reward. If you're still confused about what to pledge for single or multiple rewards, please send us a message and we'll be happy to help you out.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Backers List now in the App", "update_content": "Hi All,\nTuesday was a great day - thanks to you our project funded successfully!

Take \"earbuds\" for example, this product seems poorly executed.  There is no reason that a set of earbuds can't be designed to sound good, be durable, look nice, and be reasonably priced. This is just good engineering. Today, this doesn't seem to be the case with the earbud market fragmenting into two rather odd categories:\n\n1) Throwaway Earbuds - The inexpensive, blister-packed kind you see everywhere. These delicate, all-plastic affairs deliver mediocre-to-average sound quality, and because they break so often, are considered \u201cdisposable electronics\u201d. This results in millions of pairs being discarded every week.\n\n2) Premium Earbuds - These are often branded by recognizable audio companies and carry premium price tags. They usually offer quality construction and good sound, but still can be damaged during active use. This resulting in the product category being small in terms of sales volume; after all, who wants to replace $50-$150 earbuds every few months?\n\nConclusion:  Even though premium earbuds exist as an option, the marketplace has driven \"reasonably-priced\" earbuds into a low-performance, disposable product. The reason for this? We believe it's due to the fact that earbuds, in general, break often and you can't repair them. It's basic economics at work: people are less likely to invest in high quality, high performance products if they have to throw them away constantly.\nOur Solution: Lets be smart about this. There are several facets to the best solution, it\u2019s not as simple as \"just make them more rugged\u201d. This is what we suggest:\n\n1) Modular Design \u2013 by separating the product into components, if problems occur, damaged parts can be replaced. No more \u201cdisposing\u201d the whole set because of small issues.\n\n2) Strengthen Known Failure Points \u2013 for example, earbuds usually break where the cord meets the earbud housing. Strengthen this location and other known failure points. Then test to make sure the solution works.\n\n3) Assume Customers Want High Fidelity \u2013 some say that today's mobile device listeners don\u2019t require high quality audio. We do not agree. Earbuds should offer audiophile quality because we think everyone enjoys fine audio.\n\n4) Sell Direct - consumers always get a better value if manufacturers sell direct. This eliminates the dealer profit step and generally saves the consumer some 30-50%.  This can be a substantial advantage alone.\n\nIRONBUDS - Accordingly, we propose IRONBUDS, a modular earbud system that we want to build with your help. Here's our feature list:\n\nExcellent Sound \u2013 Audiophile-quality components throughout \nDurability \u2013 Several levels of cable integrity and strength available\nEasy Repair \u2013 Being modular systems, simply swap out the damaged component\nUpgradeability \u2013 Want something different? Just add the parts you want\nAffordability \u2013 Absolutely, how about $21 to $47\nGreen Sensibility - The concept greatly reduces electronic waste\n\nCan we make it happen? Yes, we are manufacturing and design guys with a few decades of experience. This is quite within our skill set. We have already arranged for manufacturing and assembly. We are also collecting your input on many of the options so please feel free to contact us with requests!\n\nPledge Levels: We suggest three different pledge levels that you can participate at. These kits may expand slightly as suggestions roll in but we believe the current feature sets achieve the goals that most everyone wants. By the way, we can assure you that you will be quite satisfied with your pledge.  If after you receive your kit, it doesn't meet your expectations, send it back and we will refund your pledge amount.\nSTANDARD IRONBUDS KIT - (details here)\nDELUXE IRONBUDS KIT - (details here)\nAUDIOPHILE IRONBUDS KIT - (details here)\nIPHONE/ANDROID IRONBUDS KIT - (details here)\n\n\nWhat happens after this Kickstarter Project is over? This is the last step in our solution: Sell Direct. We are working on a website, ACOUSTICFORGE.COM (please bear with us, this is not 100% completed yet) that will allow you to interface directly with the company. This will be a place where you can get spare parts, post opinions, make suggestions, etc., not just a site to \u201cbuy stuff\u201d. This site will be for you.\n\nWhy such an immersive approach to a product as common as earbuds? Well, we think this is a great business model. Lets tackle earbuds first and change this product category intelligently.  With your collaboration, we believe we can make products that we all want, not just want the mass market dictates.\n\nBut we need your help!  By pledging to this Kickstarter Project you become part of the process but the real magic occurs if we can get a lot of people on board. Please spread the word too!  This is a golden opportunity to drive the \"forced medocrity\" of this product category into what we want.

We are very excited about the olloclip and we hope you can help make it a reality.\nolloclip, a simple and elegant solution to a problem that has until today not been solved, \u201chow do I get extra lenses on my iPhone?\u201d \nThe olloclip is a quick-connect lens solution for the iPhone 4 that includes a fisheye, wide-angle and macro lenses in one small, convenient package that easily fits in your pocket. Nestled in the palm of your hand, the olloclip connects to the iPhone within 2 seconds so you\u2019ll be sure to capture the image you want\u2026if you don\u2019t see the picture you\u2019re looking for just flip it over to switch the lens. \nThe fisheye creates about a 180 Degree field-of-view while the wide-angle is around double the normal view and the macro up to 10X. If you\u2019re looking for that special macro shot, just unscrew the top of the wide-angle lens to reveal the macro lens underneath. Sure, there are apps available that will apply a fisheye \u201clook\u201d or vignette to an image, but it\u2019s impossible to increase the field of view of the original image with any app\u2026what you see is what you get, and we\u2019re confident that once you see what a real fisheye lens can do you will be amazed. \nBoth an elegant design as well as complementary to the iPhone we believe the Kickstarter community will love this project. Everyone who has seen the rapid-prototypes in action inevitably asks, \u201cwhen can I buy one?\u201d and that is where the Kickstarter Community comes in.\nManufacturing is an expensive proposition; one that requires complicated tooling and expensive setup fees. If you pledge at least $45 you will be pre-ordering an olloclip. If you pledge $90, you and friend can each have an olloclip. While the design is finished and the factory is ready to go, we will be working around the clock to get these out in record time. We anticipate shipping the first olloclip units in about 4 weeks or sooner once the project funds. \nThanks for being a part of a new era in iPhone photography\u2026\nUSA and Foreign Patents Pending.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "The journey is the reward", "update_content": "Today we celebrate olloclip's FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY since our campaign funded on June 6th, 2011 for our original 3-in-1 Lens for the iPhone 4 on what was then a tiny little platform called Kickstarter.

Help us build ProfCast Mobile for launch this fall!\nProfCast Mobile is an app for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad that will allow you to create, give, and record presentations from your iOS device.\nBack in 2006, we launched a revolutionary new product for presentation recording called \"ProfCast\".  ProfCast made it easy to record and share presentations you were already giving.  Students could review your lessons on their computers or mp3 players.  People really liked it!\nProfCast worked smarter than other screen capture tools.  It created really small movie files with the slides synchronized with the audio recording.  The recording included chapters that were derived from the slides themselves, so people didn't have to do a lot of work after they finished their presentation to be ready to publish it.\nWell, now it's 2011 and there's this mobile revolution happening with iPhones, iPods and iPads being adopted at a rapid pace in education and business.  In January 2010, we released a cool little app called SonicPics that lets you create and narrate custom photo slide shows.  It's great for digital story telling and people really like it too, but it isn't a full presentation app that you could use for, say a board meeting or a lecture. That's what we want to build with ProfCast Mobile.  \nProfCast Mobile builds on the foundation of SonicPics, but adds full presentation creation and editing capabilities.  This includes the ability to have animated transitions, add text, shapes, photos and change the layout and theme of your slides.  Animated transitions will help dazzle your audience.  Once your presentation is created, you can give it directly from your iPad or iPhone using ProfCast Mobile.  Use the video out capability and the Apple Digital AV Adapter (sold separately) to connect your iPad to your HDTV or projector. Even better, you can record your presentation as you give it.
