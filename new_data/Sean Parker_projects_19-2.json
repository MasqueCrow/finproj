The Dark Veil is a surreal gothic horror film that balances the romantic with the macabre.\nSTORY\nAfter the burial of her grandmother, a woman reconnects with a former lover. They go to the empty house of the deceased and are interrupted by a haunting that pulls them into the world of the dead. \nWHO WE ARE\nWe are filmmakers from Portland, Oregon. This production merges the talents of actors Sara Robbin and Jefferson Thomas with the directorial prowess of Scott Ballard with a script written by Jefferson Thomas. \nSara and Scott have worked on multiple projects together, their films have earned them acceptance and awards in numerous film festivals across the country and around the world.\n Jefferson hails from the frozen shores of Cape Cod Massachusetts where the ghosts of dead sailors would howl through the streets of his home town and inspire his writing.\nTONE & FEEL\nImagine you\u2019re in a cavernous attic with the sound of rain cascading down on the roof. It\u2019s almost cozy but your head is full of ghost stories. \nWe want to tap into that thing that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Not a visceral violent experience, but a chilling haunting one. \nIt just so happens that ghost stories and love stories have a nice way of complimenting each other.\nOkay, now imagine the kind of relationship that drifts together and apart, and every time it drifts apart it\u2019s a lot to shake. People who spiral together. Passion on a razor\u2019s edge. \nWe want to capture the tension and catharsis of those sorts of feelings in a way that is humanistic and natural. Not a romance in an overly embellished hollywood sense, but real people with real issues who love each other. \nTHE FUNDING\nWe\u2019re world building for this film. As the story steps into the world of ghosts and dreams the more we can acquire the richer the visuals will get. There\u2019s an ornate quality to the dreamscape, securing the right locations and props is paramount to getting the look of the film right. \nIt will ensure our amazing team gets to use the best equipment for the job and everyone gets their share for their incredible work and that we can smoothly transition into post production with the right editing, sound design, music, etc, etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe surreal aspects of this film require us to build from the ground up. We\u2019re working with some locations that don\u2019t exist in reality, for example we have a Ballroom, but it\u2019s an Egyptian themed ballroom from the 1920s, there\u2019s a baseline minimalistic approach to bringing such a location to life, but the more we can show the better. There are resources to making such a set piece possible. It's going to be hard work, but it's also an exciting challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Copy of the Film!", "descp": "A download link via private screener.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Special Thanks!", "descp": "You'll get a special thanks in the credits!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "The Screenplay!", "descp": "A signed copy of the screenplay.

Update: We reached our goal in just 9 days! So, it\u2019s time to move the goalposts: Let\u2019s raise $350,000 and we'll build a screening room !!!\nMovie Madness is a Portland institution. Known for its vast collection, knowledgeable staff, and display cases full of legendary film props, the iconic Belmont storefront has a deserved reputation as one of the best video stores in the country.\nBut now Movie Madness is in danger of closing forever. The Hollywood Theatre has the chance to purchase Movie Madness and fold it into our nonprofit, ensuring that this invaluable collection remains available to Oregonians for years to come. We must raise $250,000 by November 10 or Movie Madness will close and the collection will be sold.\nWith your help, we can save this important piece of Portland\u2019s culture and ensure its collection of 80,000+ titles remains accessible to movie lovers everywhere.\nMovie Madness was founded in 1991 by Mike Clark. Mike is now ready to retire - and he\u2019s offered the Hollywood Theatre the chance to acquire his beloved business for $250,000. (The collection alone was recently appraised at $585,000.)\nIf we succeed in raising our goal, the Hollywood Theatre will buy Movie Madness - the business and the 80,000+ title collection - and transition it into our nonprofit. We will continue to rent the Belmont storefront for the foreseeable future, and Mike will continue to display his remarkable collection of film props in the store\u2019s film museum. We will also retain the store\u2019s current employees.\nThe Hollywood is the right organization to buy Movie Madness and ensure its long-term survival. We\u2019ve lovingly restored our 1926 movie palace, and opened our new microcinema at Portland International Airport. We brought 70mm film presentation back to Portland. And we\u2019re a thriving nonprofit with 3,200+ members who believe in our mission of preserving and promoting the art of film.\nBy acquiring Movie Madness, we\u2019re not trying to save a dying business model - we\u2019re going to help it evolve by rethinking the role it plays in the community.\nWe\u2019ll expand our popular membership program to include benefits at Movie Madness. \nWe\u2019ll explore community engagement opportunities through construction of a new screening room and the development of new partnerships. \nWe\u2019ll partner with Free Geek to provide affordable access to VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray players. \nWe\u2019ll continue to preserve and grow the collection, adding new releases and found treasures to ensure that Movie Madness remains a \u201cliving collection\u201d that reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of the community it serves.\nWe\u2019ve already secured a $90,000 grant from the James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation to provide two years of operating support for the project, contingent on this campaign succeeding. We are prepared to invest time, energy, and money into this project to ensure the long-term viability of Movie Madness.\nThe single most important reason for acquiring Movie Madness is to keep its extensive collection accessible to the public. A collection of this size is an irreplaceable cultural resource.\nThere are 80,000+ titles in the Movie Madness collection. In 2016, according to Variety, Amazon had 18,405 movies and 1,981 TV shows; Netflix had 4,563 movies and 2,445 TV shows; and Hulu had 6,656 films and 3,588 television shows. (Read more about Netflix\u2019s \u201cabominable selection of classic cinema\u201d in this recent Newsweek article.) Movie Madness has twice as many titles available as all three platforms combined.\nStreaming services offer only the illusion of choice. In reality, their constantly shifting lineup is dictated by studio licenses and distributor contracts, with titles subject to vanishing without notice.\nAdditionally, plenty of movies never make it to these services in the first place. Whenever there is an industry transition to a new format, movies are left behind - obscure and cult titles rarely make the cut.\nThese movies are not just entertainment - they represent diverse perspectives in a time when diverse voices are sorely needed in public discourse, and provide snapshots into our cultural history that can enlighten our present. By acquiring the Movie Madness collection, we\u2019ll keep these titles available to the public, and we\u2019ll make sure that the rare and one-of-a-kind titles in the collection are preserved.\nPledge today, and help us keep this irreplaceable community resource alive.\nWe're excited to offer some unique rewards in return for your support!\nFor $25, you can get your hands on a wool felt pennant in either the Movie Madness or Hollywood Theatre design.

You can email us at feedback@revivalprod.com or join the discussion on Forums.\nVR SUPPORT AND BUILD!\nWe just announced full VR support for Overload, plus there's a playable build for Oculus Rift!  Check out Update #20 for more details.\nWHAT PLAYERS ARE SAYING ABOUT OVERLOAD\nThe creators of Descent are proud to present the ultimate 6-degree-of-freedom shooter, OVERLOAD.  Revival Productions is continuing where Parallax left off and creating an all-new single-player game that combines the best of classic 6-DOF gameplay with modern graphics and technology.  Destroy robots, rescue hostages, blow up the reactor, and escape before the whole thing explodes.\nMULTIPLAYER EXPANSION!\nDue to overwhelming demand, we are now committing (if the Kickstarter makes it) to creating a MULTIPLAYER EXPANSION for Overload. We always wanted to have multiplayer and believed we would eventually, but we did not feel comfortable making a public commitment to it. It's too easy for something like multiplayer to blow up the schedule and adversely affect the single player game. We want to hit our single player date with a great game.\nSo, here's our plan: We will deliver the single player game in March, 2017. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, we will deliver multiplayer as an expansion sometime after that (likely 6-8 months). Everyone who backs the campaign at the DIGITAL EDITION reward level and above will receive a free copy of the multiplayer expansion. We are not sure on the scope, but it will include the competitive modes and key features that kept Descent going for over 20 years.\nFREE COPY OF INFERNO 2 FOR BACKERS!\nAll backers at the DIGITAL EDITION reward level and above will receive a free copy of Inferno 2 from Radiangames on PC (Steam or direct download).  Inferno 2 (gameplay trailer) is an atmospheric twin-stick adventure-shooter from Luke Schneider, Lead Designer on Overload. \nBonus Trivia: Inferno was also once the name of the game now known as Descent.\nGAMEPLAY TRAILERS\nIn 1993, we founded Parallax Software to build our dream game, Descent. It was the first 3D game that allowed you to move, turn, and fire in any direction. The mind-blowing--and sometimes nausea-inducing--gameplay was matched by the technology behind it, which pushed the limits of what was possible in rendering, AI, and multiplayer. It was a milestone game that sold millions of copies and spawned two sequels.\nBecause of our desire to be close to family, Parallax Software eventually split to form Outrage (Matt Toschlog) and Volition (Mike Kulas). Outrage and Volition remained sister companies and shared in each other\u2019s knowledge and expertise. We\u2019ve remained close friends, but have always wanted to find a way to work together on a project again. The one project that we both really wanted to work on, that we couldn\u2019t not make, was an all-new six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nIn 2014, after years of talking about it, we began working on Overload. The core objective with the game is to take elements of classic 6-DOF shooters and use modern technology to push Overload to a whole new level. We\u2019re thrilled with the progress we\u2019ve made so far, but there is still a lot left to do, and that\u2019s where Kickstarter comes in. We need your help to ensure Overload will be the ultimate six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nIntense single-player action in 6-degrees-of-freedom\n15 level campaign filled with explosive combat and exploration \nStory by the writer of Freespace 2\nBreath-taking graphics and spectacular sound, with a soundtrack by Dan Wentz & Allister Brimble\nMore than a dozen sinister robot types and 3 massive bosses\n12 upgradeable weapons\n5 difficulty levels let you tune the game to match your abilities\nFully customizable joystick, gamepad, mouse and keyboard controls\nReleasing on PC/Mac/Linux, PS4, and Xbox One\nMany 3D action games have four to five degrees of freedom in their motion controls. Space combat games allow 3 axes of rotation, but usually only 1 axis of movement, while first person shooters generally allow 2 axes of rotation and 2.5--if you count jump as half an axis--axes of movement. A six-degree-of-freedom shooter gives you controls for all 3 axes of rotation and all 3 axes of movement. While this creates complexity for moving and controlling the player\u2019s character, the reward is an experience unlike any other. Combat and movement are more dynamic, as you are able to interact in 3 full dimensions.\nThough 6-DOF shooters surged in popularity in the 90's, the genre has laid dormant for over a decade. Overload\u2019s early development has focused on merging modern technology with natural and intuitive 6-DOF controls, all while still providing intense robot-annihilating action. Overload has a fantastic feel to the game already, and we can\u2019t wait for everyone to experience the sensational six-degree-of-freedom combat.\nThe primary objective in classic 6-DOF shooters was simple: Find the reactor, destroy it, and escape. Carrying out your objective is where the true essence of the game lay, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on with Overload. Each level will be full of gameplay reasons to move and look and shoot all around you, with secrets to discover, traps to trigger, powerups to find, and cryo-frozen hostages to rescue. Along the way you\u2019ll encounter plenty of robots to battle or flee from. There will be keys to collect, shortcuts to take, and reactors to eliminate. You\u2019ll race to the exit as the timer counts down and be thrilled when you make it out just in time.\nThough Overload's primary focus is on gameplay, it will also have a rich backstory and universe ripe for expansion. The details of the story will be revealed later, and we're happy to announce that it's being penned by the writer of FreeSpace 2.\nWhen we were figuring out how to build a full-3D world for a full 3D shooter in 1993, we decided on deformed cubes and portal-based rendering as an efficient method of creating an indoor environment. That decision was based primarily on the rendering and AI needs, along with making levels relatively easy to edit and create. But it also had a positive side effect of the levels being easier to fly through, and the level designers were able to build levels that we never imagined would be possible within those cube-based constraints.\nLevel concept art\nWith Overload, we\u2019re returning to our roots and using a deformed-cube structure again, but now we\u2019ve added a 3D geometry decal system that allows us to add more detail in a very efficient manner. On top of that, we\u2019ve created a deformation tool that takes a basic cubic structure and turns it into a beautifully constructed cave. We still have the benefits of the deformed cubes, but now they been enhanced to look amazing.\nNot only that, but we\u2019ll be able to share our custom level editing tools with the community and you won\u2019t need to use Maya or 3DS Max to build amazing levels on your own*.\n*You can still use Maya/Max to build geometry decals if you want.\nDestroying a robot is extremely satisfying in Overload. It needs to be, because you\u2019ll be destroying tons of them. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time refining the feel of the combat, the way robots move and fire, and the many ways robots take damage and explode, but we\u2019re not done yet.\nWe\u2019ve established the basic AI archetypes for robots, and every robot type will have customized AI that gives them a unique personality and combat behavior. Part of that personality comes from the sounds they make as well. When you hear the alert scream for a robot, it not only lets you know that danger is coming, but it can fill you with fear as you cringe in anticipation of getting hit. Already the sound of unexpected grinding blades makes us immediately dodge up or down if at all possible.\nThe other major element of combat is the weapons. Though we\u2019ve only done initial passes on 4 weapons, they each feel great to use and have roles that they\u2019re ideal for. We have big plans to expand the weapons system with multiple upgrade types per weapon that you\u2019ll unlock over the course of the game.\nOverload has a classic inspiration, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll look pixelated or have an 8-bit soundtrack. It uses the latest graphics technology to immerse you in the world. With physically-based rendering, dynamic shadows, and realtime global illumination, your eyes will be as engaged as your heart. Even when you can\u2019t see a robot hiding around the corner, its shadow could give it away. And when you turn the tables and blow the robot to pieces, you're rewarded with some beautifully rendered particle effects.\nOn top of the fantastic visuals, we\u2019re pulling out all the stops to make Overload sound amazing. We're excited to announce that we've enlisted the talents of Dan Wentz and Allister Brimble. Dan worked on sound and music for Descent 2, FreeSpace, and Red Faction, and has maintained an active presence in the Descent community for the past 20 years. Allister worked on the CD soundtrack for Descent along with many other hit titles over the years including Dungeon Master II, the Team 17 range of Amiga games, Rollercoaster Tycoon & Driver.\nOverload is being developed for PC/Mac/Linux, Playstation 4, and Xbox One.  Though it will look best on high-end PCs and consoles, it will still run great on a broad range of hardware. The game is being built to play well with a gamepad, joystick and keyboard, or mouse and keyboard, so regardless of the platform of controller you choose, you'll still be getting a fantastic experience.\nWe expect the console versions to launch simultaneously with the PC/Mac/Linux version, but they may be a month or two later.\n MOD TOOLS & EDITOR DOCS: We'll add support for custom robots and weapons (data and 3D models) in addition to releasing full Level Editor documentation.\nRevival Productions' team has helped create other milestone gaming franchises, including FreeSpace, Red Faction, and Saints Row. All the team members are seasoned veterans who've worked together on multiple projects and shipped dozens of products between them.\nIn addition to the primary team members above, and the two sound designer-musicians, many former Parallax alums will be contributing their expertise to ensure that Overload becomes the ultimate six-degree-of-freedom shooter.\nREWARD CLARIFICATIONS\nBecause we can't change the reward descriptions, and we added 3 new reward tiers, we want to clarify these issues even though the reward listing does not show them.\nKEYCHAIN: All tiers at $75 and above get the Overload keychain.\nSNEAK PEEK FORUM: All tiers at $200 and above get access to the Sneak Peek Forum.\nLEVEL DESIGN ALPHA: All tiers at $900 and above can choose to get the Level Design Alpha.\nREWARD ADD-ONS\nWe're also happy to offer the following digital add-on rewards to any tier at $25 or more:\nEXTRA DIGITAL COPY: Add $20 per extra copy to your pledge.  You will be able to specify the platform for each of your extra copies at a later date.  PC/Mac/Linux copies include both a Steam key and a DRM-free download (via GOG or another service to be determined).\nThese extra physical rewards are available to all tiers at $120 and above:\nEXTRA BOXED COPY: Add $30 per extra copy to your pledge. No additional shipping applies.\nEXTRA T-SHIRT: Add $35 per extra T-shirt to your pledge. No additional shipping applies.\nWe're very passionate about Overload, and have self-funded the prototype, but now we need your support to finish what we started.  The Kickstarter campaign funds will enable us to finish Overload and make it into the game we've always wanted to make.\nWe also want to get the community involved in the game, and Kickstarter is a great way to engage those who are as passionate about the game as we are.  At Parallax Software, we were heavily involved with and influenced by the community, and we want to get to know and interact with the players again.  Your passion and feedback on Overload will help make it the best it can be.\nDescent to Overload on Imgur\nDescent to Overload Visual History on Imgur", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping videos games is an uncertain and risky endeavor. For starters, development schedules are notoriously hard to forecast. Perhaps the primary reason for this is that the key attribute desired of the finished product \u2013 fun \u2013 is so subjective and hard to pin down that games often require extensive revision as original ideas prove ineffective and new solutions must be found. And since games often strive to innovate (in terms of gameplay, visuals, audio, and so on) it\u2019s often the case that there are not established workflows for creating content, leading to further risk.\n\nFor the following reasons, we believe we can manage the risk and deliver a solid game mostly on schedule and with the funds provided by a successful Kickstarter campaign.\n\n1. We are working in a genre that we understand \u2013 one that, in fact, we created. We have a deep understanding of what Overload will be, what it should look like, and what will make it fun.\n\n2. We have a team with incredible experience. Our project leaders, Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, have each been developing games for 30 years or more, and other key members of the team also have deep professional backgrounds. We have a long history of making games together.\n\n3. We\u2019re already pretty far along in the development of Overload, as you can see from the game footage included in our video. The look and feel of the game is already established, and most major systems and tools are already implemented. \n\n4. The additional funding we seek now will largely be used for relatively lower-risk development such as game balancing and creating the content (enemies, weapons, and levels) needed for the full game.\n\nThe only significant risk is that the game will not launch by the intended date. We intend to make Overload the best game in its genre, and that could mean a slight delay to ensure its quality meets our standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "March 2019 Update", "update_content": "Hello Overload backers!\nFor some time, we've wanted to provide an update on Revival and Overload.

The album is a collection of songs written over the past four years, dealing with love and loss, pain and resolution, personal struggles and deep self-examination.\nThis is an album of powerful songs, heartfelt vocals, beautiful guitar work, funky bass lines, intricate drumming, haunting piano, strings, horns and delicate harmonies, meant to stir your emotion, tickle your ears, and touch you right in the heart. We\u2019re collectively investing hundreds of hours and many thousands of dollars to make the best album that we can.  This is a labor of love, already four months in the making, and there is so much farther left to go.\nCheck out some song snippets on SoundCloud at https://soundcloud.com/palacewhite.\nWhat We Need\nBy contributing to this project, you will help us finish recording, mixing, and mastering the album, along with producing the artwork and physical discs.  Furthermore, you'll help to compensate those who have worked so incredibly hard for so little money for so many weeks.  We're offering a wide variety of rewards, from CDs and downloads to private shows, full band shows, energy healing, songwriting lessons, a private listening party, backstage passes, cowriting, and more.  Our interlude package even offers you a chance to be on the album for like...ever.\nBecause of Kickstarter\u2019s all-or-nothing approach, we\u2019re only asking for a small portion of what we really need, in hopes that we will meet and then greatly exceed our goal.  We've already personally invested more than $17,000 into the project and need your help to reach the finish line.\nOur Journey\nIn late summer of 2015, Aliina Champion (Worth, Medicine for the People) added her lush harmonies to two original songs that Scott was playing on piano.  A few days later that collaboration resulted in two demo recordings.  When friend and producer David Rueda stopped by and heard Scott and Aliina singing together, he realized that the time was right to make the record that we had talked about making more than a year before.  \"I haven't felt more real emotion in six months than I felt listening to you play those songs.  And I just got back from Burning Man!  Dude, it's time.  Let's make a record.\"\nLater on, as we began pre-producing the songs and recording more demos, we realized that the album would be MUCH larger than we envisioned, and we got really excited for where the music was taking us. Then, in a moment of deep inspiration, we found our vision. We found our voice. We found our sound. And we realized that we were going all the way to make the best album that we knew how to make. \nWe're thrilled to be recording these songs at such a high caliber with this team of musical professionals. It\u2019s a dream becoming real, and we hope that we can take this music far beyond Oregon. \nSome of our recording journey is captured here on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/palacewhiteband/\nAnd please 'Like' our brand new Facebook page (currently with limited content!) here.\nTrack Listing\nIf you\u2019ve seen Scott perform an acoustic set in Portland, you\u2019ve heard some of the songs on this album, but never like this.

These 3 Effects Packs are for whenever you need to blow something up, or burn something down, in your Film projects. \nThese 3 packs will be launched together with our new website, ActionVFX.com. It will be a new stock footage website dedicated to nothing but Action Movie Stock Effects. That means no lightleaks, timelapses, or shots of girls touching tall grass.\n View Press Kit\nThese effects will help you create realistic visual effects for your films. The 3 main packs are Explosions, Fire, and Fireballs, but to make compositing (and your life) easier we're also including smoke elements and Shock/Dust waves that will add more realism to your shots. \nBefore/After applying an Explosion and Dust Wave effect to a shot.\nEarly backers get all 3 packs at 50% OFF!\nThis was a feature we HAD to get right. Effects that are cut off are useless for most wide shots, so we're keeping them all in frame. This wasn't easy to do, but we did it! We shoot the explosions vertically to increase head room without sacrificing detail.  \nThe effects will be delivered in 4K or 2K resolution! The 4K version is perfect even for HD projects because it lets you resize the effects without losing quality. We were going to offer a 720p version, but then realized we're in 2015!  \nSlow motion was also a highly requested feature, so every clip in these packs will be at least 60fps. So far all the effects have been shot at 60fps, but if this Kickstarter is successful, then we plan on shooting at even higher frame rates!\nBehind the scenes of us shooting window-framed fires.\nYou know how hard it is to composite a burning building using ground fires. Window and door framed fires were one of our top requested features, and we're delivering! We've already shot some of them, and we want to do many more. The reason these are so important is because the fire gets to actually wrap around corners, which means compositing the effect over a door or window looks more realistic. We're also burning various other shapes and structures.  \nNow this will help you burn down a house!\nWhen it comes to shooting these types of effects, the more latitude and information the better. That's why we're shooting all these effects flat in 4:2:2 color space. Shooting these in LOG allows us to capture the full range of the explosion/fire without over-exposing the image. Which means there are no blown out white spots, and you have more flexibility in post!  \nThe effects are pre-keyed (they have a transparent background) so you can drag and drop them on your video and start working without worrying about keying out the background.\nWe'll also provide un-keyed raw versions of the effects, for those who want to do the keying themselves.\nVariety was another big request from users. We've film (and will film) different types of explosions and blasts, fires, and fireballs. That way you're not limited to only one type of effects.\nVariety in Explosions - We're varying the sizes, angles, debris amount, and chemicals used. Some will be big and fiery, while others will be more concussive.\nVariety in Fires - There will be ground fires, structural fires (windows/walls/doors), trails, and ignitions. We're burning using gas, wood, gels, etc for different looks.\nVariety in Fireballs - The size, shape, and direction of each fireball will vary. Some fireballs will run on the ground, and some will blow through windows!\nSince these are stock footage, they will work with a wide range of Editing and VFX software. Including but not limited to After Effects, HitFilm, Nuke, Premiere, FCPX, Motion, Fusion, and Sony Vegas. So if you have an editing software, there's a high chance you can use these!  \nEarly backers get all 3 packs at 50% OFF!\nLack of Diversity.  \nEveryone has been using the same action effects in their videos for the past decade. Literally! Having more diversity in the Action Stock Footage world is one of our main reasons for doing this. High quality and affordable effects are so rare that it's blatantly noticeable how the same explosions, the same fires, and the same muzzle flashes are used in everything from low budget Youtube videos to million-dollar blockbusters. But that's not just it...\nWe can do it better.\nThe lack of competition in this area allows Stock Producers to be mediocre in their work. After all, why push the envelop when no one is challenging the status quo? Do they listen to the users? Do they care enough to find out what they want? We do, and that's why we're creating ActionVFX\u2122.\nBehind the Scenes of our first shoot in Chicago.\nWe listened.  \nBefore a single frame of explosion was shot, we opened a dialogue with you, the users. We put together a survey to get insight into the ideal first package. With the help of hundreds of Filmmakers and VFX artists, we were able to find out what you guys want in an Explosion and Fire pack. We're still listening, so do let us know your suggestions!\nWe have a proven track record.\nRodyPolis released the popular Shootout Stock Pack 5 years ago. Since then we've released more quality products, and over 10 thousand users happily use our effects worldwide. We have the experience, and we're using everything we've learned for these past 5 years to make ActionVFX the best it can be.\nSome of our packs currently being sold on RodyPolis.com. We're not new to this whole effects thing!\nWe hire professionals to blow stuff up!  \nIf these type of effects were easy to make, everyone would do it. That's why we hired some of the best Special Effects teams to handle the explosive side of things.\nIt was great to have the guys at Windy City FX, who've worked on Transformers 3 and Chicago Fire, create some amazing work for our company! Every bit of effort has been worth it so far, and we can only improve from here.\nBetter product.  \nShooting these effects are expensive. From equipment rentals, crew salary, necessary material purchases, locations, and permits, creating these effects is a very costly process. Everything we film will also need to be prepped before distribution, and digital assets will need to be created.\nBecause of this extensive Production and Post-Production process, we need additional funding to create these effects with the quality you deserve.\nFaster release.  \nSince RodyPolis is an established business, we could fund most of this project ourselves over time. That would mean that the release date would be significantly further away though. The funding we get through Kickstarter will help accelerate the whole process and allow us to get these 3 products out to you by March 2016.\nYou'll receive a small pack containing 10 effects from our ActionVFX\u2122 packs. You'll get 3 Explosions, 3 Fires, 2 Fireballs, 1 Smoke, and 1 Dustwave in 2K resolution! Your name will also be in our Action Heroes wall, which will be posted on our website and in every package.\nGet 1 of the full 4K packs. Your choice between the Explosions, Fire, or Fireballs pack.

We want you involved!\nWe've been Greenlit on Steam!\n\u201cPeople always say they want more creative stuff. They don\u2019t want more of the same all the time. ... I think [Nick Bruty] fits right into that mold, because nothing he does is normal. ... For the people who are looking for fresh ideas: [First Wonder] is a perfect project.\u201d \n- Brian Fargo\nCEO of inXile Entertainment, Kickstarted Wasteland 2, Torment: Tides of Numenera, Bard\u2019s Tale IV\n \u201cI\u2019m really excited to see [First Wonder]. Very excited! We know that you\u2019re not going to give up and that you\u2019re going to get this thing done.\u201d\n - David Perry\nFounder of Shiny Entertainment, CoFounder/CEO of GaiKai \nFirst Wonder blends third-person shooter elements with aerial acrobatics in a fantastical and vast world ripe for exploration. \nMonstro has formidable abilities that allow him to leap over obstacles, charge at opponents and exploit the environment to unexpectedly traverse vast areas. His only aim is to use his talents to overcome any obstacle between him and mysterious prophecy relics hidden in the many Majorcan Islands.\nThe Cargonauts take to the skies using their rocket technology in an attempt at matching Monstro\u2019s natural gifts. To find and capture the terrifying beast, the Cargonauts must use their wits and a variety of tools and inventive traps that they selectively equip from their mobile gear depot, the Big Rig. They need to take Monstro down since they unwittingly set him loose on Planet Majorca in the first place.\nOver the course of the campaign, players will alternatively take the reigns of Monstro and the ragtag team of Cargonauts as they scramble to put a stop to him and his path of destruction. The living, breathing chain of Majorcan Islands offers a dynamic world with unique inhabitants and natural resources awaiting player interaction. Many secrets lay hidden within First Wonder, as tiered plateaus, surreal geological features, and surprising environmental effects create a rich and unpredictable alien world.\nLike the single player campaign, multiplayer will focus on goal based play rather than head to head shootin' and smashin' (though you can try to do that too!). A player will guide Monstro through a series of island goals, while a team of players as the Cargonauts work together to stop him.\nIn case you missed our TwitchCon feed, we recently we did a press virtual tour live on Twitch, which covers the main demo and we answer live questions from the press that participated:\n\"There are certainly not very many Shiny-like games around these days, so if developer Rogue Rocket can capture some of Shiny's famous wit and weirdness, they might be on to a winner.\" PC Gamer\n\"First Wonder is the spiritual sequel to games you really ought to play: MDKand Giants: Citizen Kabuto\"\nPCGamesN\n\"First Wonder Has the Makings of an Indie Classic\" \"...if anyone deserves to be funded it\u2019s these guys.\" First Wonder has all the makings of another indie classic by the same people that worked on Giants and MDK.\"\nCliqist\n\"...when you have frigging jetpacks versus giant monsters, what else needs to be said?\"\nThe Robot\u2019s Voice\n\u201cIf you enjoy physics-based destruction, kaiju monsters, jetpacks, sci-fi weapons, asymmetrical multiplayer, an actual single-player campaign and a giant beautiful game world to explore then you might want to consider giving First Wonder a look-see and scope out the features to see if it\u2019s something you might want to help bring to life with a bit of financial backing.\"\nOneAngryGamer\n\u201c... the opening minute of this First Wonder trailer with Monstro had me thinking about movies like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, It Came from Beneath the Sea and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and how awesome it must be to kick some ass as a huge beast. Then when Monstro finally meets up with the Cargonauts he\u2019s slamming a tree trunk into the ground trying to smash the tiny dudes, you can\u2019t ask for more than that!\"\nWeekly Gaming Recap\nThe story\nThe Cargonauts are a team of deep-space salvagers that come across an incredible fossilized creature: Monstro. They unwittingly deliver it to Planet Majorca, an intergalactic resort planet where the management intends to turn this huge fossil into the crown jewel of their extensive collection of artifacts from across the galaxy.\nUnfortunately for resort-goers, Monstro awakens and begins to wreak havoc across the planet. Is he a mindless beast, or is there a motivation behind the destruction? What is he up to, and what will happen if he\u2019s allowed to fulfill the newly discovered prophecies of the planet? The Cargonauts don\u2019t intend to find out.  \nTo tell the story, we aim to bring back the dry-and-sometimes-wet witted sense of humor that First Wonder\u2019s spiritual ancestors are often remembered for, through entertaining cutscenes as well is surprising moments of unusual gameplay.\n\u201cI think Giants was one of the funniest games I\u2019ve ever played.\u201d\n - Brian Fargo   \nCEO of inXile Entertainment\n  Monstro is an ancient creature on a mission to fulfill a prophecy inextricably linked to the mysteries of Planet Majorca. He seems to know a lot more about the planet than anybody realizes, and he\u2019s capable of taking advantage of its unique features in ways nobody expected. You\u2019re pretty sure that if he achieves his goals, it might be bad for everybody.\nMonstro's size and agility makes him a powerful and elusive foe, able to leap over obstacles, charge at opponents, and exploit the natural formations of the game's expansive Majorcan Islands for quick traversal and strategic strikes. \nHe honestly couldn\u2019t be bothered with these tiny creatures, but if they get in his way, he isn\u2019t terribly concerned with carelessly pulping them either.\nThe Cargonauts manage to talk themselves into the biggest job of their lives: transporting a never before seen giant fossil to its new destination on Planet Majorca. This job could finally change their fortunes and restore some family pride.\n In reality, they are completely out of their depth, but nothing that some luck and a good dose of blind optimism can\u2019t cure. While their technology is antiquated, it still has brute power going for it and can get the job done. Not so bad looking after a lick of paint.\nCargonaut and rig gear concepts\nFilled with vast mountain ranges, unusual rock formations and beautiful water features, the Majorcan Islands are filled with delights for vacationers and explorers alike. Jetting around the islands will reveal all sorts of eye catching landmarks that will spark curiosity at what secrets lie with them.\nPlayers will need to discover Majorca\u2019s secrets to accomplish their goals, either as Monstro or the Cargonauts.\nSketch to In-game island\nThe Majorcans\nEven our silly temp block Majorcans look adorably squishable!\nThe native inhabitants, the Majorcans, are a peaceful lot and tend to see the best in everyone and everything. For generations, their beautiful island has supplied all their needs in abundance. Yet, the Majorcans have a plucky curiosity that keeps them wide-eyed and interested in all things. \nThen The Corporation comes, with its prefabricated instant luxury resort descending out of the sky and landing like a soft blanket over the Majorcan islands. \nThe Majorcans are shoved out of their homes and relegated to the underside of the island. Of course, with their unquenchable politeness they don\u2019t see it that way. They were simply in the way of what must be a very important project. Indeed, they must help out whenever they can.\nHey, you guys! Take these drinks to table 5. Why certainly, whatever you need. Oh, look they\u2019ve given me my own outfit, how thrilling. Clean out the toilets? I don\u2019t know what that is, but lead the way, good sir!\nRogue Rocket is co-founded by long time game industry veterans, and partnered with other long time collaborators such as Limited Slip Studios in addition to our core team in San Francisco. This experience is crucial in limiting unknowns, and starting off on strong footing. We have a proven track record of building great games reliably with a variety of publishers as well.\n\u201cNick Bruty is probably the best game designer I\u2019ve ever worked with... I created the character Earthworm Jim, but people really loved the game. And if you love the game, then you love what Nick Bruty did.\u201d\n- Doug TenNapel\ncreator of Earthworm Jim, Neverhood, and Armikrog\nWith our core team of five developers, Rogue Rocket has managed to build only original games in many formats since 2011, including working with Microsoft First Party games and other publishers, and is a registered PS4 and XBoxOne developer.\nWhen Giants: Citizen Kabuto and MDK originally released, they were games that ignited gamers\u2019 imaginations because they dared to buck the trends at the time. They brought original and interesting gameplay mechanics, and environments that showed vibrant worlds unlike any that gamers had seen before.\nEventually, publishers became increasingly risk intolerant as game budgets skyrocketed, and these kinds of novel games had a difficult time finding a place in the world. Today, many still remember these games and wonder why sequels never came to be. But with crowdfunding, and highly capable and affordable out-of-the-box engines like Unreal Engine 4 and Unity3D to limit development risks, these ideas can be revisited anew.\nFirst Wonder is our way of revisiting these classic ideas. We will once again visit colorful alien worlds reminiscent of the ones fans came to love and let players enjoy an unusual experience. First Wonder aims to recapture the sense of wonder and discovery from those early games in a modern, high-quality game that is only possible with your support.\\\nKickstarting a game is a two way street, and that\u2019s a great thing! In the old days, you had to do your best to guess what gamers want, and you have one shot to get close enough before you press it onto a disc for all of eternity. With Kickstarter, and the widespread marvel of e-connectivity now available through the Internet, we can connect directly with you, the gamers, and find out what matters to you, and give unprecedented access to the process of making games!\nWith this in mind, we have set up a really nice First Wonder community site dedicated to this project, created in partnership with Innervate. Here, backers will have special access to a \u201cBackers only\u201d forum section where we\u2019ll be regularly telling our backers what\u2019s new with the project, answering questions, and getting feedback on parts of the game as we make it.

Many of the most fun experiences of the First Wonder demo have been the results of emergent gameplay through organic discovery. This can sometimes create unpredictable bubbles in a resource limited schedule (which everybody except a very lucky few must usually work within).\n\nThe key to reducing these risks is to rely on our extensive experience across a wide variety of games to more accurately assess the work required for features. It\u2019s also critically important to focus on the most important elements of the game that make the game better and different instead of trying to fit every last idea in.\n\nThe other dimension of risk is simply scope. We must be smart about selecting a game content size that is appropriate for the level of backing our Kickstarter produces for the project. We are committed to not overpromising and under-delivering, and will make the game that you, the backers, tell us should exist through the support we get. This, combined with being smart about how we apply those resources for greatest impact, is the path to a great game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rogue Rocket Games\nFirst created \u00b7 5 backed\nComposed of industry veterans, we are a creative and dynamic team dedicated to bringing original, fun and thematically compelling games for...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Update 8: The Future of First Wonder", "update_content": "Hello, noble supporters of First Wonder.

Thirty years ago, The Bard\u2019s Tale put Brian Fargo and Interplay on the map and launched a storied career crafting some of the most beloved cRPGs in gaming history.\nToday, we return to Skara Brae for the long-awaited dungeon-crawling sequel to the Bard\u2019s Tale trilogy -- the games that helped define the genre.\n[French Translation] [German Translation] [Spanish Translation] [Polish Translation] [Russian Translation]\nA single-player, party-based role-playing game, rich in exploration and combat\nDungeons filled not just with dangerous fights but with challenging puzzles and devious riddles\nDynamic phase-based combat, where the pace of battle is animated and fluid, but still gives you time to think and respond to your enemies\nA game set to beautiful Gaelic music, where the Bard\u2019s songs and melodies affect gameplay\nCo-funded by fans and inXile: if this game hits its $1.25 million goal, inXile will put in at least $1.25 million of its own money to double the initial budget!\nBuilt using Unreal Engine 4, for PC, Mac and Linux.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo. Brian was directly involved in the creation of all three The Bard\u2019s Tale games in the 80s, the first game launching his long and storied career at Interplay and inXile through the 90s to now.\ninXile has embraced the crowdfunding model fully, delivering the fan favorite Wasteland 2 (over 70,000 backers raising over $3 million), and following it up with Torment: Tides of Numenera (over 90,000 backers raising almost $4.9 million and still going). We doubled Wasteland 2\u2019s crowdfunded budget with our own funds, and continue to support it with the upcoming Game of the Year Edition, which will be released as a feature rich and extensive free upgrade to all PC backers and buyers.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is spearheaded by the same team that delivered the award-winning Wasteland 2.\nAs always, inXile Entertainment is proud to be a part of Kicking It Forward, pledging to spend 5% of our eventual profits back into crowdfunding projects.\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged at any tier $20+, you can include add-ons with your pledge.

If you can make it but your friends can\u2019t, you get a point! Repeat the process as you place more platforms to make the level crazier and more dangerous.

Up to 4 players can play with a single controller.\nIn the single player mode, solve tricky puzzles by building a path to the end using a limited set of platforms, and discover how to use new blocks and traps to your advantage. Explore the world as you venture further and further from the farm, finding new places to play and new animal friends to play with!\n We got Greenlit on Steam!

No collisions between characters... yet\nBest for 3 - 4 players\nIf two or more players tie, sudden death kicks in and you need to race to the flag, first one there wins!\nParty mode can be chosen by jumping on the big red button when you are setting up the game at the Treehouse. This is where you pick which animal you want to play as, and vote on which level you want to play.\nHave more friends than controllers?

That\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll be your friend. Try our story puzzle mode, where you can explore new worlds and find new friends. The levels become increasingly difficult as you're presented with more challenging platforming tasks and you need to find ways to use dangerous blocks to your advantage. You'll have to reach the finish with only the platforms we provide for you, specially tailored to make each level solvable in many ways, some easier than others.\nLooking for intense platforming, and less strategy? You can grab levels from the server online and test your skills by trying to beat the level in record time or by using the smallest number of blocks. We may use the Steam Workshop, or might use our own setup. We'll see!\nThe game is played using a wide assortment of blocks. As development continues, we will be listening to the community about what blocks they like and what new blocks they would like to see added to the mix.

From what we've seen when people play the game, you'll be fighting over characters pretty quickly! Which is your favourite?\nIn the single player mode, you adventure through a wondrous world, away from the farm to find new animal friends who want to play the game. Start out at the farm, then move to the pasture, the city, and out into the wild as you discover increasingly exotic animals to join the fun.\nThe soundtrack for this game is planned to be a semi-live-recorded funk soundtrack, with influence from different instruments from around the world depending on where our characters travel in the game.\nWe\u2019re fortunate to be working with an incredibly talented team at Vibe Avenue. FX Dupas, Mathieu Lavoie and their team are an award winning group of amazing sound artists who are bringing the game world and characters to life.\nWe\u2019re also inviting guests in for voice-recording sessions, which up to now have been hilarious and fun.

We're already in talks with Sony and Microsoft to get the game on PS4 and/or Xbox One, but this will likely depend on whether or not we hit our stretch goals and what our backers want.\nWe've carefully crafted all of our reward tiers to try to make something for everyone, so please take a look and see what fits. \nSpeaking of fits... Have you seen our t-shirts?\n*Design and colors might change based on feedback and manufacturing capabilities!\nSome other highlights in our reward tiers include the ability to work with us to design a block of your choosing, because the ones we have now aren't insane enough...\nBeyond this, you can get your music solo in the game by contributing to our awesome funk soundtrack. We'll send you a track that you can jam along to and you send us back a recording. (guitar, bass, keyboard / organ, drums, flute, trumpet, trombone, saxophone, clarinet... let us know what you have in mind and we'll figure it out). \nYou can do all sorts of things with this Kickstarter; you can have your message and drawing appear on the Ultimate Chicken Horse barn wall, or even get your portrait (drawn in our art style) in the game! If you're feeling truly bold, you can even work with us to design a final character in the game, and make your permanent mark on Ultimate Chicken Horse history.\nClick on the image below to see the full grid of rewards available!\nWe have many things in mind for different additional stretch goals, including new game modes, release on consoles (PS4, XboxOne, PSVita, WiiU, etc.), new characters, and more. We're going to release more stretch goals based on backer feedback and really make sure we give you everything you're looking for! Let us know what you want,in backing this project you have a hand in the development of Ultimate Chicken Horse!\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work full-time on this game for 7 months now, and we need your help to finish it. We need to pay for the music, the voice recording, art for new characters, implementation of new game modes, the online server to quick-save levels, and the port to other platforms.

Since then it has spread across the known world, a waking nightmare that takes hundreds of horrible forms. Ghosts howl in the night. Skinchangers lurk in the wilds. Fallen soldiers rise to slaughter the living. Entire cities fall to a Chant that turns all who hear it into mindless killers. We don\u2019t know why this is happening. We don\u2019t know how to stop it. All that we know with certainty is that we are fighting a war and we are losing. Over a third of the Empire has been lost to the Dread, and each day brings new horrors. In this dark time we have one hope: Phoenixes are returning. Every citizen knows tales of the Phoenixes, champions who can face death and return stronger than before. In the centuries following our brutal civil war the Phoenixes have become legends\u2026 and now you are one of them.\nPhoenix: Dawn Command is a card-based roleplaying game with a unique approach to character death. In Phoenix, players assume the role of supernaturally empowered champions bound together to defend a fantasy world under attack by threats that no mortal could withstand. These heroes face harsh odds every mission, and many won\u2019t survive. But death isn\u2019t the end of your character\u2019s story; it\u2019s the start of the next chapter. Phoenix is also a new fantasy setting, and you can learn more about the world of Phoenix here.\nCARD-DRIVEN ROLEPLAYING\nPhoenix is a story-driven roleplaying game that uses cards to resolve actions. Every player has a deck of cards that represent a character\u2019s abilities. To accomplish an action, a player needs to lay down a set of cards with a total value that equals or exceeds the difficulty of the task. A player can get an extra push by using a trait - a card that describes a unique aspect of a character. If the player can explain how that trait applies to the current challenge, the value of the card is increased. This encourages cinematic storytelling, driving players to describe an action beyond the simple numbers. In addition, each player has Sparks - a pool of mystical energy that can be used to boost the value of an action. This allows a character to succeed at a normally impossible task\u2026 but when that pool of energy is exhausted, the character dies. You can see a video example of this system here.\nWhile Phoenix has a gamemaster who drives the story and controls the challenges the characters face, the card-based system places a significant amount of narrative control in the hands of the players. Success isn\u2019t based on the roll of a die; it\u2019s a question of what a player is willing to sacrifice to make an action succeed. Because death isn\u2019t the end of the story, character survival isn\u2019t the most important part of a mission. Instead, the challenge is to make each death meaningful, and to achieve the objectives the Phoenixes are willing to lay down their lives for.\nThe Phoenix system is simple and flexible, and even someone who\u2019s never played a roleplaying game before can master it within thirty minutes. The story and setting of the game give players a clear purpose and reason to work together, and the mechanics of the game encourage teamwork. While the options provide depth of play for experienced gamers, it\u2019s very accessible to new players.\n DEATH MAKES YOU STRONGER\nIn Phoenix: Dawn Command, you don\u2019t gain power by killing others; you gain power by dying. After each death, you add additional cards to your deck and new abilities representing the lessons you learned from your previous life. However, there\u2019s a catch: you can only return seven times. So each death makes you stronger, but it also brings you closer to the end of your story. In addition, you don\u2019t return right away and you don\u2019t return in the place where you died. The fate of the world is in your hands and should you and your friends fall without completing your task, your mission will fail. Friends may be lost, regions may fall, and when you return you\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences of your failure. Because death isn\u2019t the end, the odds will often be stacked against the characters; to succeed, players must take risks and make sacrifices. \nWe'll provide more information about the setting of Phoenix in updates, or you can read Keith's updates on Phoenixes and the Story.\nWhat\u2019s In The Box?\nPhoenix: Dawn Command will include the following components.\n280 Tarot-sized cards, including Action cards, Lessons, School cards and Challenges.\nA softcover book (approximately 120 pages) containing the rules to the game, a guide to the fantasy setting, and a seven-mission story arc.\n32 Health tokens and approximately 70 Spark tokens.\nCondition tokens to track temporary effects.\nPlayer booklets will be provided as a free PDF download. These provide an overview of the setting and the rules, giving each player easy access to everything they need to know to get started.\nAll together, this is sufficient to support a gamemaster and a group of four players. The missions provide an initial story arc, and the manual provides all the information a gamemaster needs to develop new stories.\nAll materials shown in these images and the video are prototypes and may change in the final product.

HELP GET SEAWORTHY ACCEPTED\nExperience an interactive fast paced pirate adventure: A game about building up your pirate crew, then watching their tales unfold and facing their gut wrenching decisions. As the Captain of a pirate ship you are in charge of commanding crew in battle, managing resources, improving your ship, and staying afloat through engaging encounters. Seek glory, adventure and treasure all while avoiding the dangers of a mystical procedurally generated world.\nFeatures\nA story about cursed pirate treasure and a mystical creature hunting you down. Every game's story will evolve naturally as your main quest to restore the stolen cursed treasure takes you through numerous quests, encounters, and sub plots.\nDeep random encounters make each game of Seaworthy a brutal pirate epic. Experience a pirate adventure unfold as you establish a respectable crew and perilously lead them to glory. Well crafted procedurally selected random encounters will keep every playthrough fresh and exciting. Survival in Seaworthy means taking calculated risks, success means taking them often.\nPermanent death provides tension and weight to every decision. Successful pirates are pragmatic rebel survivalists who must keep both their blades and wits sharp if they hope to prosper. Seaworthy will have players questioning every choice as they learn that although opportunities are plenty, they rarely come without danger.\nProcedurally generated maps and continual progression through them ensures that no location ever become too familiar.\nBrutal real time strategy combat! Seaworthy offers a new take on naval combat that emphasizes controlling crew and tactically placing shots rather than sailing in circles and spam firing cannons.\nStagnation is death! With doom on the horizon, the luxury of stability and safety will never stay true for long. Upgrading and improving both your ship and crew is essential to keeping afloat in the harsh world of Seaworthy.\nStory\nYou were one of the few crazy enough to journey through history\u2019s largest expedition to the forgotten seas. You were one of far fewer to return. The horrors witnessed were unspeakable and haunt you to this day. Thankfully the tales of mystical ancient artifacts proved true. You sold your share of the treasure to buy a ship and hire her crew. Finally you were free to follow your dreams and become a respected pirate captain. For many months you sailed the high seas in search of fame and glory. Recently tales have spread of unnatural occurrences, as well as the disappearance of many fellow forgotten seas survivors.\nYour journey begins when the old and familiar one eyed messenger parrot of your former captain lands on your deck and squawks a message that chills your blood. Your suspicions were true, the artifacts recovered in your expedition were cursed!  For the sake of self preservation it is up to you to recover and return all the artifacts to the wretched, forgotten seas.\nGameplay\nCommand your men where to go and what to do to survive deadly ship and boarding combat.\nNavigate through our open world consisting of randomly generated maps and quests.\nExperience challenging decisions as you struggle to stay afloat while reacting to various random encounters.\nUpgrade crew and ship to reflect your play style as you take on an ever increasing challenge.\nEncounters\nWhen you\u2019re not fighting for your lives or sailing the seas, you\u2019ll have to make moral, tactical, and economic decisions about what risks to take, what sacrifices to make, and what adventures to pursue. This all happens in the Encounter screen.\nA Text based encounter screen allows us to enrich our story and easily give players a variety of choices to navigate through along with variable rewards or troubles depending on your decisions and status.\nRandom encounters vary every playthrough and adapt to circumstances such as environment, time of day, items carried, crewmembers, as well as decisions made from previous encounters.\nEncounters happen randomly or in response to reaching points of interest such as Towns, Ports, Villages, Quests, Ships, and Treasure.\nEncounters will be the most rewarding aspect of our game so we plan to spend a lot of development time creating huge varieties of encounters with depth to each one.\nEncounters often result in combat situations which occur in either the ship or boarding screen.\nShip Combat\nWith Seaworthy we wanted to recreate the feeling of being an actual pirate captain rather than a ship. With the ship\u2019s crew as your focus, control where men go and what positions they man.\nA big inspiration for what we wanted combat to feel like was from the film \u201cMaster and Commander.\u201d Splintered wood, men falling all around, and water flooding in from hull breaches; Through the smoke and fear, a captain has to maintain his cool and give the orders that will save the day!\nWhat do you do when an enemy broadside breaches your hull in multiple locations? Do you:\nkeep your men on the cannons to get off that last shot and kill your enemy\u2019s cannon crews? \nput more men on the sails to gain speed and run from the battle before you take more damage? \nrun the bilge pump and send men down to patch the holes to keep your ship from sinking? \nsend your wounded to the medical room to get patched up before they get killed? \nman the navigation room so that you can better avoid the next barrage while you go straight for the enemy ship in a last ditch attempt to board?\nBoarding Combat\nGiven a greater view of the top deck, control your captain to send crewmembers of different specialties across the deck to fight it out with the enemy.\nChoose amongst  different types of boarding equipment to give your seamen, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\nUtilize your officers weapons and abilities to strategically cut down enemy units and take control of the deck.\nTactically use your captain to boost morale, damage enemies, call in special strikes, and give orders to keep crewmembers from dying.\nShip & Crew\nSHIP:\nAny ship can be taken and customized! If you can manage to kill off your enemies without sinking their ship, you can take it as your prize!\nOutfit the ships rooms as you see fit. Equip figureheads, weapons, and ship equipment to best fit your needs.\nVarious types of equipment can be can be assigned to any ships modularly designed rooms to express your pirating preferences. For example, rather than having another cannon room the player can make the decision to assign more storage rooms in the hopes of striking it rich as a trader or slaver. They could alternatively make that room another healing room so their crew members don\u2019t need to travel as far to get healed and can get back to the fighting sooner.\nEquipment can be found and bought all throughout the world and ranges from: sails, cannons, bilge pumps, med kits, and steering wheels. Each of these items come in different tiers of quality. In order to have the best ship possible, it is up to the player to look out for new types of equipment wherever they may be.\nIn addition to upgrading equipment, the ship's walls are also a source for improvement. Building thicker walls will better protect your crew from incoming fire. Your wall's health is represented by the circle in the center of the room button. As your walls become damaged, enemy projectiles become much more likely to penetrate and kill your crew in an explosion of splinters.\nYou ships speed is tied directly to its weight and sails! Having thicker walls and hoarding equipment might feel safer, but lacking the mobility to evade incoming fire can be very detrimental to the survival of your ship and crew.\nCREW:\nYour crew consists of two tiers, seamen , and officers. Throughout your journey you will find both officers and seamen willing to take the oath and join your crew.\nSeamen are your basic units that perform all the manual labor onboard the ship as well as providing the bulk of your force as they bravely storm enemy ships in boarding scenes. Without the hardworking seamen, all your ship's equipment is useless. Small circles in every room allow you to assign and unassign seamen where you want. These circles also show the health of every seamen assigned to that room.\nOfficers are natural leaders of men, specialized crewmembers who help organize and inspire the seamen to work and fight harder. Officers are also battle hardened and not afraid to show it. When boarding, each class will have devastating attacks and unique abilities.\nOfficers start as mates, untrained candidates ripe with potential. As your mates gain experience and perfect the art of yelling at seamen, they gain the option to specialize in one of their 5 skills and become an officer. The five classes of officers are: The Bosun, Gunner, Master of Sails, Surgeon, and Navigator.\nThe Mate, an apprentice that can train to become any skilled officer. Armed with an 8 ft boarding pike of steel and ash, the mate hangs back in the boarding party and skewers the enemy from afar.\nThe Master of Sails, a swashbuckling adventurer in charge of the men working the sails and rigging. Quick to start a brawl and just as quick to end it, she rushes to the head of the boarding party armed with cutlass and buckler and isn\u2019t afraid to get bloody!\nThe Gunner, a towering hulk that is the heavy weapons expert in charge of the men working the cannons. Years of lifting heavy ordinance have given him the strength of many men, and when part of the boarding party he brings a swivel gun to deliver thunder and death!\nThe Surgeon, a man of medicine skilled in the removal of limbs, the humors of the body, and also the shaving and cutting of hair. His Hippocratic oath only applies to his mates; on the deck of the enemy's ship he brings his blunderbuss to deal death and destruction.\nThe Navigator, the woman in charge at the helm and guided by the stars. A good Navigator is an indispensable member to your crew, and in boarding combat she is a quick and deadly pistoleer that lays waste to the enemy before they can even touch him!\nThe Bosun, a mighty axman and the taskmaster of repairs and heavy labor onboard the ship.\nTraining and experience As your officers continue to level up, they gain buffs and special abilities that can greatly turn the tide of battle when used appropriately.\nMusic\nThe sea shanty in our Kickstarter trailer is \"Roll the Old Chariot,\" sung by the very talented David Coffin (www.davidcoffin.com)! \nWe currently are interviewing various artists and will have to wait and see how we do on Kickstarter before we can really be certain what will happen with our soundtrack, so please spread the word and help us reach our funding to hear more!\nOur theme song at the end of the trailer and in our teaser is Pirate Treasure (Harpsichord) from the artist Spooky Music.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe love making games, and since we started work on Seaworthy last year it has become hard to focus on much else. We\u2019re dedicated in our desire to make Seaworthy but currently restricted by money and time. We\u2019re going to finish it whether we get funding or not, it\u2019s really just a matter of time and quality.\nWe've come to kickstarter for two reason, remaining independent, and community involvement.\nRemaining independent is important to us because we love gaming as a medium and don't want to let publishers ruin our visions with a lack of understanding of gamers. We want to make seaworthy a great experience that sticks with people, not just another rushed product made for a quick buck. \nWe want our players to be part of development. If you have a suggestion, please share! Throughout development, when we're unsure of a decision, we will be asking the community what they think is best. If you want to be part of development, please, make Seaworthy better by participating in our soon to be made forum. Together we can make Seaworthy live up to the great potential it has.\nWhere the money goes?\nIf funded we will be able dedicate ourselves full time to Seaworthy, allowing us to complete the game sooner and as close to our vision as possible.\nFunding will also help pay for the various business and legal costs of making a game.\nAdditionally, it will give us the means to pay for music and art assets that will give Seaworthy a greater level of polish.\n All money we get will go back into the project in the form of polish or additional content.\nProgress + Status\nTransparency in game development is important to us, we want to make sure our backers know exactly where we are in development as well as where we need to go. We\u2019ll be making monthly updates to our backers throughout development detailing what we\u2019re working on as well what\u2019s next. Please, if you have any questions about the status of the game, send us a message and we'll be sure to answer.\nThe game is currently in pre-alpha. Up to this point work has been focused on programming the framework that will run Seaworthy, solidifying gameplay, world building, and creating and incorporating the large number of animations and art that can be seen in our trailer.\nWhat\u2019s next? With the framework nearly finished, the biggest task ahead of us is asset and content generation: quests, encounters, equipment, items, officer abilities, ships, boarding animations, map art.\nAlpha + Early Access\nWe anticipate the Alpha version of seaworthy to come out towards the end of 2015. We will release it as soon as it's ready, but we expect December to be a safe estimate. This state of Seaworthy will be feature complete, but still lack some content of the final game. The purpose of the alpha is to get feedback, start testing, and fix bugs so that the game is ready for a functional Early Access. \nEarly Access on Steam will be released approximately 3 months after the Alpha is released. We strongly disagree with the trend of developers putting buggy, unplayable games on Early Access and will make sure Seaworthy is fun and mostly stable before we start Early Access. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have completed much of the up-front work on Seaworthy before coming to Kickstarter so that you, our awesome backers, can take faith in what our vision is and our ability to complete it.\n\nWe're confident that the risks are minimal. Our game design is mostly complete. Our art style is feasible and tested with lots of the base art already completed. The most challenging programming jobs have already been completed and we can faithfully rely on our third-party game engine Unity to handle the lower level complications that might arise when making a game. We have allocated a budget and have a plan to acquire additional funding through early access if need arise.\n\nIn concern to challenges, video game development presents constant challenges, but we are confident in our abilities to overcome them. Tons of research, design and learning has happened just to get where we are today, and undoubtedly much more will follow. We don't claim to know everything we might have to yet, but we do feel confident in our abilities to keep trying and learning until we do. As long as we remain mildly competent, we will keep going until we find a way. If funded, we will deliver the game and expect the worse case scenario being a delay in when we can release it.\n\nThank you for reading to the end of our Kickstarter!

But Jack won\u2019t be going out quietly. Over the next six months, he\u2019ll be going all out to fulfill a dream: earn half a million dollars, any way he can. That might be play money for a corrupt cop, but up until now, Jack has been playing by the book. Even with overtime, in six months he wouldn\u2019t make fifty grand. But a police chief has access to all sorts of\u2026 informal income. Bribes, weapons and drug sales, deals with the Mafia, skimming off the budget, kickbacks \u2013 you name it. And Jack is tired of playing nice. He\u2019s is ready for anything, but only you can decide how far he\u2019ll go.\nJack Boyd has never been great at making friends, but over the next few months he\u2019ll be meeting a lot of interesting people.\nThe next 180 days won\u2019t be just a mad dash for money. Jack will need to keep up his police work too. He\u2019ll send his cops out to handle situations, he\u2019ll coordinate action on scene, monitor the progress of key investigations, oversee the budget, hire and fire \u2013 every day, it\u2019s dozens of key decisions that affect countless lives. Even just regular cop business poses lots of problems: a drunken patrolman might gun down a bystander while he\u2019s aiming for an unarmed bully. And it\u2019s not just the staff, it\u2019s the increasingly crazy orders from the mayor's office \u2013 not to mention the press and their uncomfortable questions. It\u2019s all a part of life as a police chief.\nThis is only one part of Freeburg, the most prosperous area. Some areas are so challenging that even the most experienced and gritty cops hesitate to go in.\nYou can either ignore or fulfill the orders that come from the mayor's office. Either way, there\u2019s bound to be consequences.\nJack doesn\u2019t always play it safe, and his actions affect all those around him. The corrupt mayor has been at his throat \u2013 and it\u2019s him who sent the retirement memo as soon as Jack turned 60. Freeburg is a great town, but it has its crime problems. There\u2019s major civil unrest brewing, people in conflict, struggling for power. There\u2019s criminal gangs and cartels fighting for territory, businessmen, trade unions, and the church fighting for influence. And the authorities fight for the right to rob the rest of them with impunity.\nYour employees like to party, sometimes even the night before their shift begins. If an employee comes in with a hangover, you can fine them and send them home, but some of them just can\u2019t seem to get enough.\nFreeburg has its share of criminal gangs, but Jack doesn\u2019t always catch them.\nYou can love the police, you can hate the police, but you can\u2019t argue that the police wield enormous power. Each major step Jack takes will shift the established order of things. On your words hang many of the city\u2019s most powerful forces. You can\u2019t win without compromise; you\u2019ll have to find friends somewhere. But who you\u2019re fighting can change every day. If you finish the game broke and out of work, don\u2019t feel too bad \u2013 you might have ended the game in prison, or with a bullet in your guts.\nThe success of any operation hinges on which personnel you send.\nIs This Is the Police similar to other games? Partly. To some extent it is a strategy game: you have an array of forces with various attributes, who you send on a variety of missions across the city map. But at the same time it\u2019s an adventure game, and an interactive novel: you get to investigate the relationships between the characters, handle press conferences, and encounter various crimes across a wide range of scenarios. This is also partly a tycoon game, since a lot of the game is tied to money. You\u2019ll want to keep an eye out for new avenues of income, and keep your books \u2013 the official and unofficial. \nThere\u2019s a variety of game mechanics, and which parts play the dominant role will depend on many factors: your style of play, the decisions you make, and sometimes on the particulars of the case you\u2019re faced with. One day you'll be working the big cases, putting the real crooks behind bars. The next you might be outwitting a suspect, or breaking down a crime scene. There\u2019s plenty of gameplay variation, but our chief task is to ensure that everything that happens on the screen is an important part of the overall story. You won\u2019t get bogged down with the numbers and the attributes of your units, and it\u2019s not just a set of puzzles to solve. As you move from one event to the next, the city of Freeburg will change around you, in response to your actions. The story is not constrained by a particular genre or narrative format, so you can truly take part in the life of a desperate man trying to regain his self-esteem \u2013 and you\u2019ll never know how the story will evolve, just around the next turn.\nThe press love Jack Boyd, because he tends to answer questions directly and openly. But recently things have been changing.\nHonestly, we don\u2019t like Kickstarter campaigns that hit you with a huge wall of text. We didn\u2019t want to overload you with an expansive document describing all the details. So, we tried to make it short and exciting, and share all the critical stuff. But we\u2019re happy to share all the extra details, not just about gameplay, but also about the world and the characters in the game. We\u2019ve been thinking about how best to present this information, and we decided to create 10 issues of the Freeburg Tribune \u2013 one of the daily newspapers published in the fair city. The Tribune will tell you all about the events that are taking place across the town. We will publish one issue every time the campaign reaches another 10% of its goal. \nBut we\u2019re not limiting ourselves to the Tribune; we\u2019ll have further announcements and explanations, so stay tuned!\nOf course we welcome your questions, and will try to answer them as quickly and fully as possible.\nThe kiss of death has nothing to do with love.\nOver the next 180 days, Jack will put a lot of people behind bars. Some might even deserve it.\n* If we get into Steam, you can get a DRM-free copy of the game, and a Steam key as a gift. If we release console versions, you can also get a DRM-free copy of the PC version of the game, and a key for any platform you choose as a gift.\nIf you want to ask a question before backing, please contact us at ask@weappy-studio.com\nEvery backer will receive a digital copy of This Is the Police OST\nTwitter\nFacebook\nBlog", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team is quite experienced, having split our time between working in game studios, and in the gaming press.

A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\nThe lure of a quick payday draws you from Seattle into the neon glow of Victoria Harbor\u2026 and into a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making. A terrifying threat looms on the horizon - a supernatural force that corrupts and consumes everything it touches. Dragged into the shadows of Kowloon City, you will need to forge new connections and gain \"face\" to survive.\nHong Kong contains fantastic elements for a new Shadowrun setting: an underworld of triads, tongs, and gangs to navigate, wild magic to harness, and bleeding edge cybertech to equip. Plus, Hong Kong\u2019s culture is steeped in \"guanxi\" - a network of influence and relationships based upon a combination of social status, and prestige. All of these elements add up to a great new setting for running the shadows.\nShadowrun: Hong Kong has everything you expect from a Harebrained Schemes Shadowrun game: strong storytelling and sharp writing, lots of morally gray choices, a crew of memorable characters with distinct personalities, challenging tactical turn-based combat, a robust character creation system, and a one of a kind cyberpunk-meets-magic game setting that\u2019s endured for over 25 years. \nOur Backers voted for Hong Kong as the next city for us to bring to life and we\u2019re excited to be working on it! \nYour New Crew\nJust as in Dragonfall, our Hong Kong story will feature a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that can only happen in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. \nAnd, as introduced in Dragonfall, you'll be able to guide your crew's advancement by choosing special abilities on their Growth Tracks to complement the choices you make for your own character. \nGobbet is an ork street shaman and a follower of Rat. Her devotion to her totem has granted her unique abilities to control the battlefield, trapping her enemies behind barriers of coruscating magic and herding them with clouds of blistering poison.\nTerritoriality Track: Focuses on battlefield control by buffing Gobbet\u2019s barrier spells (increasing damage, increasing the number of tiles affected) and planting AOE damage spells, such as Toxic Fog. She also gains the ability to destroy or consume summoned spirits, eliminating threats from enemy shamans.\nSpiritualist Track: This track focuses on improving Gobbet\u2019s control over summoned spirits. She can reduce the chance that they slip out of her control, and even seize control of hostile spirits summoned by her enemies. Progressing down this track turns Gobbet into a versatile and powerful summoner.\nWu is a veteran security expert with years of sprawl-site combat experience. He has the muscle and the weaponry to either beat his targets into submission or to break them outright, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nCrowd Control Track: Focuses on a variety of non-lethal attacks that inflict stun (-AP) effects. Progressing down this track unlocks a shock baton, tear gas grenades, and zip ties to subdue stunned enemies.\n  Lethal Force Track: Focuses on inflicting lethal ranged damage. Progressing down this track gives Wu attack abilities such as Mercy Kill, which does additional damage and has a higher to-hit percentage on targets who are close to death.\n\nIs0bel is a dwarf decker with the tools and the expertise to clear her own way to a target mainframe. Trained for combat by a cabal of hacktivists, she\u2019s as deadly in meat-space as she is in the Matrix.\n\nEspionage Track: Increases Is0bel\u2019s decking skills and her Mark Target ability. Progressing down this tree unlocks new custom programs/abilities for use in the Matrix, as well as custom Expert System Programs (ESPs).\n\nSabotage Track: Is0bel carries a sniper rifle for meat-space skirmishes. Her arsenal also includes proximity mines that she can use to create traps for her enemies. This track increases and adds to the effects caused by these weapons, unlocking higher-yield explosives and Flechettes that strip armor from enemies.\n\nWith your generous support, we're adding Racter to your crew!\nRacter is a highly specialized roboticist-turned-rigger who fights with the aid of \u201cKoschei,\u201d his custom walker-form drone. He also carries an engineering toolkit that he can use to repair Koschei and enhance its abilities during combat.\nMangler Track: Makes Koschei into a melee-ranged wrecking machine. Progressing down this track unlocks movement boosts for the drone and bolts close combat weapons onto its chassis, such as rotary saws and clawed feet. These attachments unlock new close combat attacks for the drone.\nPredator Track: Turns Koschei into a walking artillery piece. Progressing down this track bolts new ranged weapons to the drone, such as an auto-shotgun or a grenade launcher.\n\nWith your generous support, we were able to add Gaichu to your crew! And don't forget, now that Racter and Gaichu are unlocked, their COLLECTIBLE FIGURES have been added to THE TALISMONGER Reward Level!\nThanks to his elite Red Samurai training, Gaich\u00fb has access to close combat abilities that are inaccessible to other characters. These take the form of stance-based katana attacks that flow together in sequence, each of which has its own unique animation.\n\nRed Samurai Track: A mixture of offense and defense. Includes additional sword attacks, such as a coup de grace that can be used to dispatch stunned targets. Gaich\u00fb also gains self-buffs that can temporarily boost his armor, or give him the effects of cover when standing in the open.  \n\nGhoul Track: HMHVV infection has its advantages. This track includes a bite attack that inflicts damage and heals Gaich\u00fb, and claw and spit attacks that inflict damage and cause debuffs on enemies.\n\n\nShadowrun: Hong Kong contains all the features of Shadowrun Returns and builds upon the engine and gameplay upgrades we added to Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut (including the ability to save your game anywhere). \nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: The Shadowrun series hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart 12+ hour non-linear story with a diverse cast of all-too-(meta)human characters. (Some funding goals will add more hours of gameplay.)\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. \nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions. Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. \nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\nPowerful Game Editor: Create Your Own Stories! With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor. Our new Hong Kong setting will add tons of new weapons, spells, characters along with oodles of new tiles to the long list of editor assets from Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut!\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Shadowrun: Hong Kong will be composed by fan-favorite Jon Everist, composer of the award-winning Shadowrun: Dragonfall -Director's Cut. Here's an example of Jon's work:\nPC Only Release\nShadowrun: Hong Kong is being developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems only. We have elected to focus all our efforts on PC in order to deliver the best game we can without the current processing and memory limitations of tablets. This focus allows us to have higher-fidelity visuals, larger map sizes, and more stuff on screen.\nBecause we want to do more.\nWe're totally committed to making Shadowrun: Hong Kong and we're already several months into development. The project is budgeted, fully staffed, and on-schedule for a mid-2015 release. We also have a story we're really excited about. At our current budget, it's going to be 12+ hours long and at the quality level of Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.\nBut this is Harebrained Schemes and, as always, we have more ideas than we have budget. \nThat's where you come in.\nBy backing the project, you'll increase our production budget and get more features, more improvements, and more game. Take a look at the funding goals below to see all the stuff we want to add.\nNow, we could always talk to traditional publishing partners, but we\u2019re pretty independent-minded around here and we only want to serve one master - our audience. \nWe're gonna ship a great game and it can be even greater with your help. Our last adventure together was a blast and we think the results speak for themselves. So help co-fund our third Shadowrun game, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and let's make the best Shadowrun game yet!\n$100,000 - Enhanced Player Controls! In addition to all the new Tech, Magic, Weapons, Consumables, Creatures, and Enemies we're already planning, if we reach our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll add a bunch of interface upgrades. These include the ability to decide which team member picks up an item in free-move mode, item swapping between party members, a player-initiated turn-mode toggle so you can position your team before you enter combat, and a spread-range indicator for shotguns and sweeping melee attacks.\n$150,000 - Animatic Scene Transitions! These are short animated slide shows with voice narration that play at key points in the story - the opening, end of Act 1, end of Act 2, and at the end. \n$200,000 - Racter joins your team of runners! Racter is a Russian rigger with a wry smile who relates better to his custom drone than he does to people. We'll tell you about Racter's unique gameplay abilities and player-influenced upgrade paths when we get closer to unlocking him.\n$250,000 - More Animatic endings! If we hit this goal, we'll be able to create multiple animatic endings for the story to reflect the choices you make in the game.\n$300,000 - Gobbet's personal side mission! Dive deep into the backstory of your team's resident Rat shaman. Gobbet's absurdist philosophy and impulsive nature have led her on a twisting path through life. In her personal mission, you'll get the chance to walk that path with her and see for yourself where Rat takes you.\n$350,000 - More better sound! We can only describe smells (for now) but we can definitely improve on our audio. Dynamic combat music will ebb and flow as a battle progresses, providing more atmosphere and tension. Enhanced Ambient Sound is a catch-phrase for lots of technical babble about making your play environment sound more real and less repetitive.  \n$400,000 - Gaichu joins your team of runners! Gaichu was a member of the Renraku Corporation's elite Red Samurai security force. Infected with the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV) on a mission gone wrong, he was forced to abandon his pure-human unit as the virus slowly twisted him into a ghoul. Now a shadowrunner, Gaichu could prove a valuable ally, but his loyalty comes at a price\u2026\n$450,000 - Enhanced Cyber! If this goal is reached, we'll add a new skill to our character creation system that enhances a character's cyberware and unlocks the ability to install powerful new cybernetic enhancements. This system will further differentiate characters with 'ware from their flesh and blood counterparts. We'll also add cyberweapons that you can install into your characters' arm slots, complete with new animations and visual effects.\n$500,000 - Is0bel's personal side mission! Born to immigrant parents of Somali descent, Is0bel has experienced life in the slums of Kowloon first-hand. Escaping at a young age, she retreated into the cold perfection of the Matrix, but her family still languishes in the depths of the sprawl. Her personal mission will take her back to a place that she barely escaped from - and you'll come along for the ride.\n$550,000 - Expanded magic! If we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll add new gameplay options and equipment for magic-using characters. Shamans will gain the ability to summon Shrine Spirits at specific locations in the Hong Kong environment. These great-form spirits are far more powerful than their mundane counterparts, can\u2019t break away from your control, but are limited in duration. Hermetic mages and physical adepts will gain access to Foci - enchanted weapons and objects that can boost a spellcaster\u2019s magical power or allow an adept to deliver devastating magical attacks.\n$600,000 - Gaichu\u2019s personal side mission! When Gaichu became infected with HMHVV, the Red Samurai code that he'd sworn to demanded that he take his own life. Instead, he took to the shadows, dishonoring himself and the rest of his team in the process. In Gaichu's personal mission, you will square off against a squad of highly-trained warriors who will stop at nothing to destroy their old teammate... and you alongside him.\n$700,000 - Revamped Matrix: Art and Gameplay! If we hit this goal, we'll add more people to the team to revise the look, feel, and gameplay of the Matrix. We want the Matrix to feel more like you're traveling in the digital world. We also want to add new types of Intrusion Countermeasures and new ways of interacting with them so that decking feels more like an illegal entry into someone's system. \n$1,000,000 - Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign! We have our plans set for the story we want to tell in Shadowrun: Hong Kong, but if we hit this funding goal, we\u2019ll create an ADDITIONAL 4-5 hour Hong Kong Mini-Campaign that takes place AFTER the story ends. The Mini-Campaign will allow you to IMPORT your high-karma Hong Kong character for a challenge only a prime runner could accept.  The Shadows of Hong Kong Mini-Campaign will come out sometime before the end of 2015 and will be FREE to Backers at the $15 pledge level and up. \n\nWe know from experience that fulfilling lots of physical rewards is a big, distracting, and expensive undertaking and we want your funding to go into making a quality game - not into shipping a bunch of tchotchkes. Remember, the people making your game are also the ones making and sending your stuff! So, we created a bunch of cool digital rewards and TWO sweet physical rewards. We hope you like them and we hope you support us. \nHey! Here's a special BONUS for Backers at the $35 Reward level and above!\nEveryone who backs the project at the $35 Reward Level and above will get access to an AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACK from the Shadowrun Development Team. Hear the writers, designers, artists, engineers, and composer discuss how the game was made, the challenges they faced, and the fun they had while making the game. The audio commentary will arrive in an update after the game is released.\nAND everyone who backs at the $35 Reward Level and above will also get TWO HIGH-RES DIGITAL POSTERS that, when placed together, combine into a beautiful Shadowrun Panorama. The first poster contains a Timeline of Shadowrun History. The second contains a Glossary of Shadowrun Slang. Tell your friends!\nAll rewards starting at the CHUMMER ($15) level come with at least one copy of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.\nThe actual figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted and numbered!\n Here she is along side a Golem Arcana figure.\nThe power of a Fire Ram is no match for the cunning of a Rat Shaman!\nHer final figure will be 5 inches tall, fully painted, and numbered\nCreated over 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of The Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world should have ended on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic returned to end our world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.\nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\n Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere's the good news - we've done this before. More than once. \n\nWe've run successful Kickstarter projects and we've made two Shadowrun games plus a Director's Cut, so we know how to deliver. \n\nThere's always risk in game development, though. In this case, we have a few new team members who need to learn the ropes - but we've got a pretty damn good track record for hiring talented, dedicated people, who go the extra mile for their game and their Backers and they've already distinguished themselves as great additions to the team.\n\nBeyond that, the standard game development caveats apply. Some new features may take longer to make than we thought. Some piece of gameplay may not be as fun as it sounded on paper and we need to revise it several times until we're happy. A critical bug could take a whole week to fix while others take ten minutes. \n\nSo while we've done Shadowrun games before and have a solid idea of what we're doing and how our tools work, we haven't done THIS Shadowrun game before and you never know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd that's part of the fun of making games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "The Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign Is Here!!", "update_content": "We are pleased to announce that the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign is now available as part of a free update to Shadowrun: Hong Kong.This update also adds the developer audio commentary Kickstarter reward and a variety of small game improvements such as new visual effects, updated dialogue, and editor features for User Generated Content.\nSo, we\u2019ve rebranded the title asShadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition to reflect all the new content.

Kickstarter backers will have beta access to the game for a month prior to launch. This counts for ALL tiers that include the game. Check out Update #7 for more details. This applies to the Mac & PC versions of the game.\nJourney Down the River: Travel down a long, winding and completely unique procedurally-generated river, through environments inspired by the Everglades, Mississippi Delta, Louisiana Bayou, and other quintessentially American places. Your journey has an end. Will you survive long enough to reach it?\nAuthentic Survival: With survival tactics and wilderness dangers based on real-life references, staying alive until the end will mean staying warm, staying dry, staying healthy, and avoiding the ravenous wildlife that wants to eat you.\nA unique world inspired by backwater America: Post-Apocalypse or just Post-Society? Did it all end with a bang or a whimper? The world of The Flame in the Flood explores what happens on the fringes when civilization gives up the ghost.\nMusic from Chuck Ragan: Featuring an original full length soundtrack by acclaimed Alt-Country rocker Chuck Ragan featuring The Camaraderie, The Fearless Kin and other special guests.\nSurviving the hostile post-societal wilderness is no picnic. Scrounge for food and supplies, evade the ravenous wild-life, seek out shelter, maintain your raft, and stay healthy. And most important of all, make sure you\u2019re gone when the rains arrive.\nLooting and Crafting\nThe land is dangerous but bountiful, and if you know what you\u2019re looking for, you might just live. And if you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, perhaps you can make it, if you have the pieces.\nAfflictions and Remedies\nSnake bites, fatigue, hypothermia, open wounds, and infection are just some of the ways the world will try to kill you. Happily every affliction has its remedies, whether traditional herbal cures, wound-dressings, or simply a solid night\u2019s sleep. Knowing which remedies slow or stop which afflictions is what separates a babe in the woods from a master survivalist. \nOne piece of advice: address your afflictions in a timely manner, before they develop into something worse.\nAI Ecology\nEverything needs to eat to survive, and to your predators, you\u2019re just a sack of food wrapped in a buckskin parka and cute hat. Like the river itself, our AI encounters are procedurally generated, and the NPCs behave according to rules governing hunger, fear, aggression, and territory. You\u2019ll need to use stealth, traps, distractions, timing, and your wits to avoid becoming a feast for scavengers. \nPermadeath\nWhen you\u2019re done, you\u2019re done, and if you don\u2019t make it, you go back to the head of the river to try again.\nBut remember: Aesop your faithful hound, will be back with whatever he was carrying at the time of your last death. A small mercy from an otherwise cruel fate.\nIt was clear the time to move had come when the first rain fell and the cloud mass that spoke of the coming flood rolled south. Scout lashed her few belongings to her raft and set out for higher ground as the water drowned her cook fire. Her only companion the dog whom she had raised from a pup after finding it tangled in a muddy old sack in a river eddy. Her journey would take her through unfamiliar lands of crumbling relics from long ago. It would be a hungry trek, with scarce supplies, cold winds and rain always chasing and weakening her. She would have to build her own supplies from the pieces of scrap she could scrounge, conserve her food for long tracts of barren scrubland, ration what clean water she could find for the days ahead.\n\u201cSalvation lies at the end of the river\u201d people say. Scout and her old dog have a long and terrifying journey ahead of them.\nScout You play as Scout, a lone wanderer schooled in the art of wilderness survival. She's seen a bit of everything as she's come of age, and knows how to deal with the challenges of staying alive in a land that isn't interested in helping.\nAesop \"It was not my fault, master; my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not help mine infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am.\" - from Aesop\u2019s Old Hound\nAesop is Scout's companion and beast of burden. He's been by her side for years, and though he\u2019s not much use in a scrap, he can carry supplies, call out clues and warnings, and generally help you navigate the wilderness.\nThe Raft Your \"piece of ship\", a lashed together junk pile that can take a beating and keep floating. You\u2019ll need to take care of it on your journey, fixing it up if you have a hard crash, but if you do it\u2019ll get you where you\u2019re headed. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll take a swim and it\u2019s game over.\n\u201cI do not know much about gods; but I think that the river Is a strong brown god\u2014sullen, untamed and intractable\u201d ~ T.S. Eliot\nThe river journey is a story that stretches from mythology, through classic literature (Huckleberry Finn, Life on the Mississippi, Heart of Darkness) to the film and television of today (Mud, Beasts of the Southern Wild). In The Flame in the Flood, we want to translate all of the poetry, adventure, quirkiness, and melancholy of those works into video game form.\nThe River is the central character of the game. It is the road that sweeps you ahead of the coming storm. It is a place of rest and calm when it slows and of frantic action and danger when you hit the rapids.\nRiver Tech The Flame in the Flood might not look like your typical roguelike, but it does have one important aspect in common with that genre -- the use of procedural generation algorithms to pseudo-randomly create the world as you move through it. Why \u201cpseudo\u201d random? Because driving the randomness are a set of rules for making rivers that are fun and challenging to navigate, and provide for the many interesting choices you, the player, will face: risk the rapids to get ahead of the coming rain? Hit the store on the eastern bank or the gas station on the western? If I miss that gas station, when will the next one be?\nOur river creation process is divided into a number of steps, including layout, island packing, flow generation, decoration, and rendering. More on all of this in an update soon!\nThe music for the game is being created by Chuck Ragan featuring The Camaraderie, The Fearless Kin and other special guests. You may know Chuck Ragan for his solo work, his time with post-hardcore trailblazers Hot Water Music, or as founder of The Revival Tour. He's writing an original full length album to accompany the release of the game.\nChuck is releasing \u201cThe Flame in the Flood\u201d on iTunes. This is the song used in our video. Go pick it up!

You can get a publisher to fund development, seek out private investors, fund it out of pocket, or seek help via crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter. We\u2019ve elected to go with a mix of self funding and crowdsourcing.\nUltimately, we\u2019re making the game for the people who want to play it. That wouldn\u2019t change regardless of how we fund, but by going straight to gamers we can keep ourselves limited to a single boss. We don\u2019t have enough cash individually to bring this game to completion, which is why we\u2019re turning to you, our backers, to help get us the rest of the way and help make the game the best it can be.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games is a difficult process filled with unknowns. Lots can go wrong. We\u2019re a small team and it will still be possible to fail, even if we successfully kickstart.\n\nTeam: sometimes life can hit people in unexpected ways. Everyone on our team is necessary, so if extenuating circumstances prevent any individual from working on the game, the whole project will be at risk. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much we can do to eliminate this risk, without holding enough money in the bank to pay a competitive salary to replace someone should some catastrophe occur. In games, hiring an engineer or an art director can easily cost our entire budget, so without doubling or tripling our budget as an insurance policy, this will simply be a risk we need to take.\n\nCreative: Making games involves taking creative risks, and they don\u2019t always pan out. You can lose time correcting from choices that don\u2019t end up working as well in practice as you imagined they would. This is often why games go over budget and dates slip. We have a production plan in place that allows for a large amount of leeway prior to the actual date we\u2019d like to ship. We know the creative process can take time, so we\u2019re scoping in order to hit our dates.\n\nTechnical: usually games can present enormous technical challenges. This is a low risk for us, as we\u2019re using Unreal Engine 4, an engine that we are all very experienced with. Collectively, we have decades of experience working with Unreal. This is a new sort of game for some of us, so of course there will be unknowns to overcome, but each member of the team has shipped multiple games across multiple platforms, and we know how to successfully ship a technically sound title.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "An update on Drake Hollow, our next title!", "update_content": "Hi Folks,\nWe've not updated this thing in a long while, because well... there's not been much to share, but today we finally have something new to announce.

You can sign up at drakehollow.com\nSo what is it? Oddly enough, it started as a sort of 1.5 version of TFITF. Fix up some things we didn't like, and maybe add co-op. Well... as we got going we started asking bigger questions. What if it wasn't the player that needed to do the surviving? What if it was more of a sandbox? Do we even need the river in that case? What about a new setting? What changes in a new setting? Bit by bit we ended up with what we're showing off today: A co-op action sandbox game about building villages to protect fun little creatures called Drakes that need your help. It's not rogue-like, or permadeath, or survival. It's still procedurally generated, but that's about where the similarities end.

There are several stretch goals that would make Pathologic an even more fulfilling experience if achieved. They are listed below. If you want to learn about the game, please scroll down to the original pitch.\nAs is stated in \u201cRisks and Challenges\u201d below, we do have investments that would allow us to make Pathologic in any case, and this whole Kickstarter is like a huge stretch goal for us. The money we ask for is what we need to create a perfect game. We don\u2019t want to add superfluous entities on top. Still, we do have more ideas that we believe will fit Pathologic. These are things we really want to make, but they would require a bigger team (or postponing the release, which is something we\u2019d like to avoid). If we get more funding, they will become possible by the planned release date, though.\nHere are our stretch goals:\nACHIEVED The Town Extended ($300,000). This stretch goal seems pretty self-explanatory, and yet it\u2019s the toughest one to explain. We\u2019ve launched this whole campaign to make an extended version of the game after all, didn\u2019t we? Thing is, it\u2019s always possible to add more. More unique objects, more dialogue options, more questlines, more events happening around you. And it won\u2019t be filler content either. Say, there are plot-dependent areas planned in the warehouse district; but what if you could also find caches and hideouts there? What if street NPCs had additional reactions to your activities? What if there were simply more questlines? You would become even more hard-pressed for time, sure, but we\u2019ll balance it. The Town is a finished place, but we can always improve it intensively, adding more small locations, hidden corners, nooks and crannies. Also: more quests, more NPCs\u2014more content in general.\nThe Steppe Extended ($350,000). The Steppe is rather poor in terms of content right now, and that makes sense, since the plot of Pathologic takes place mostly in a single location, the characters being unable to leave The Town. While we don\u2019t intend to change that, we can sneak in some loopholes, inviting the characters to explore new and fresh locations in the steppe (close to The Town, of course). It can even lead to them having new activities there. That also obviously means more quests, more steppe NPCs, more weird creatures, and generally more steppiness.\nLucid Dreaming ($400,000). Thoughts and ideas are an important part of Pathologic, and it\u2019s known that the Plague \u201cspeaks to its victims, scrutinizing them\u201d. We would like that to become an even more prevalent motif, adding dreams in form of interactive experiences. Got infected? Go see the Plague in person. Found out new crucial information that completely changes everything? Same here. All those hints and omens dropped and mentioned everywhere will now appear in the flesh. Also more weird and creepy imagery. And these are not random events\u2014they will depend on how you play and how the plot you create unfolds.\nTermitary and Abattoir ($450,000). The original Pathologic only showed you a chart of these behemoth constructions rather than their real innards. The poor interiors did nothing to reflect their grandeur. We\u2019ll change that in the remake anyway, sure, but reaching this stretch goal would allow us to make a full-fledged ethnographic expedition into The Termitary and The Abattoir. You\u2019ll be able to see the daily life, the traditions, and the culture of a very peculiar working community of steppe butchers that live inside and retain multiple traits of a primitive society. It\u2019s \u201ca town inside The Town\u201d, and it\u2019ll contain loads of new content, quests, and experiences.\nA Small Prequel ($550,000). Pathologic is plot-heavy, and a lot of important stuff happens right before the start of the game. As a player, you\u2019ll uncover the partial truth behind the events that have shaped the current state of The Town, but you\u2019ll never be able to see the perfect and complete picture. You\u2019ll never be able to see them at all\u2014only speculate. Simply showing these events would be a spoiler, but we\u2019re keen on making an additional day-long story with unique content. It won\u2019t be Kickstarter-exclusive. Please keep in mind that it won\u2019t feature the same playable characters. The whole point of the prequel is to show you the things that the main trio would never be able to see and learn. But you will.\nA mysterious and deadly disease breaks out in a remote town built upon old tanneries and butcheries. Whilst the disease can be identified by physical symptoms, its roots and origins remain mysterious. The disease is highly infectious and deadly. It affects the neural and the blood-circulating systems, crippling both body and mind.\nTo fight the epidemic the local authorities first send a learned doctor, then an inquisitor ordered to assess the situation, then a military commander. The first has to investigate the disease and find an optimal solution; the second has to save as many lives as possible while executing said solution; the third has the right to exterminate the whole Town should the others run out of options.\nAlong with the authorities\u2019 agents two volunteers find their way through the Town along with the learned doctor, who goes by the name of The Bachelor. One of them, The Changeling, is a strange girl who believes she can heal with her hands, and the other, The Haruspex, is a talented amateur who\u2019s fond of experimental surgery.\nTaking on the role of one of these doctors, you\u2019ll explore the town, its weird traditions, and the complex relationships of its inhabitants. You will only have twelve days to defeat the invisible enemy called the Sand Plague.\nTime will become one of your most precious resources. Choices will haunt your every step. You\u2019ll want to get closer to your goal, but sometimes it\u2019ll all come down to mere survival. In a time when everyone is in danger, would you lend a gun to a person who may use it with ill intent? Would you try to save someone who claims they don\u2019t need to be saved? Would you share your medicine with important figures who will unveil the Town\u2019s numerous secrets in return, or would you rather help an ordinary stranger in need? Or maybe even selfishly keep the pills in case you get sick? And sooner or later you will\u2014Pathologic is a bleak and harsh survival adventure that\u2019ll make sure of it.\nIt's all about choices\nIt\u2019s a place where the main factory is ruled by a five-year-old girl, where districts are named after body parts, where bulls can only be slaughtered by the initiated, and where ideas and projects banned from the Capital somehow thrive.\nIt\u2019s also the main character of the game.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing games are good at, it\u2019s creating a sense of place, immersive and real. Imagine a remote town\u2014so small it doesn\u2019t even seem to have a name, a town where obscure traditions intertwine with progressive ideas and industrialization. You are an outsider here, and yet the town is yours. You\u2019ll be the one to secure its fate, you\u2019ll be the one it\u2019ll open up to, sharing its secrets and mysteries. Its inhabitants will confide in you, its history will come back to life before your eyes, and its architecture will tell you stories.\n\nNow imagine this town ravaged by an invisible and merciless enemy. The Sand Plague.\n\nBut we\u2019re not just building a body\u2014a physical place. We want to make an immersive town that feels alive, yes, but our main goal is to create a town filled with ideas. We want to make you feel that every nook and cranny is worth investigating, that it\u2019s there for a reason.\nThe town is remote and thus relatively small, but it\u2019s also very dense, open for exploration. Every second building has a name, every district is there for a reason, every street is a thread in the story. It\u2019s a steppe town formed around a behemoth slaughterhouse, but paradoxically the locals worship bulls. A huge construction defying the laws of physics, called The Polyhedron, lies to the west. The air is thick, and for some reason there is a sacrificial site right inside the town. It\u2019s hard to understand how it all holds together.\nWhich is why you\u2019ll have to become a kind of sleuth. Why is it forbidden to dig wells here? How on earth does The Polyhedron not fall? Do actors in the Theatre really perform even when there\u2019s no audience to watch their plays? We want to make each step you make intriguing and meaningful.\nPathologic is hard to define, so we\u2019d rather describe what it feels like and what you can do there. If you\u2019re impatient or hard-pressed for time, it may be a good idea to scroll down to the feature list.\n\nAnd speaking about time! \nThe plot of Pathologic is broken down into twelve days, each of them carrying new stories, quests, and events. Time flows mercilessly: if you fail to finish a task when it\u2019s due, the opportunity is lost\u2014as are human lives. You are completely free to roam and explore the Town, bartering, talking to strangers and generally surviving (which is hard enough to begin with and becomes harder and harder as time goes by and the Sand Plague becomes more and more deadly).\nYou\u2019ll have to keep your body healthy. The hero needs to eat and sleep, to take care of their immune system\u2014it\u2019s the only thing that can preserve them from being infected with the Plague. To do all that, you\u2019ll need resources (fresh water, bandages, bullets; even bread and coffee beans!), and procuring them in the Town torn apart by the epidemic is not an easy task: inflation and panic will try to strip you naked, making merchants greedy and townsfolk suspicious. You\u2019ll have to be creative while bartering, try to avoid fights, even scavenge infected houses, and you\u2019ll still feel hard-pressed for stuff.\n\nBut your scariest enemy is not a bandit armed to his teeth, but rather the disease itself. Man can kill man, but the Plague slowly kills the whole Town, devouring it district by district. So the sick will come to you begging you to save them\u2026 and exposing you to the infection. Is compassion still possible even when it puts you in direct danger? \n  After the district is ravaged by the disease, muggers and looters find their way there. They are searching for food, weapons, perhaps even clothing\u2014in other words, for resources you desperately need to survive (or are you perhaps a marauder yourself?). And the Plague hides everywhere\u2014in every man and woman, in every object\u2014waiting to strike where it hurts most.\nSo you, one of the best doctors in the Town, will inevitably get sick. Sickness doesn\u2019t necessarily mean imminent death though. You can fight the disease in your own body\u2026 but infection makes you a threat\u2014a vector, albeit an unwilling one. You will find yourself killing the Town with your very hands while trying to save it. It will take all you\u2019ve got to bring more good than harm, and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll do that not by providing medicine and pills, but by thinking outside of the box and uncovering the Town\u2019s numerous mysteries.  \nBut it\u2019ll be worth it, because the Town will be yours. You will be there, and every minute detail, plot-defined or AI-generated, will matter.\nA handy list of what to expect of Pathologic for those who want definitive descriptions, not some babbling about towns, entities, and invisible enemies. \nFight the disease. Do you think doctors are only there to ease pain? What if it means you have to cut out someone\u2019s heart in order to produce the medicine? Your instruments are crude, and you\u2019ll have to fight the Plague on many levels. Searching for its roots to help the Town is your main goal, but the Plague is also right here, in the streets, in your own body. It\u2019s great to finish a quest and come one step closer to your goal, but it won\u2019t matter if you\u2019re dying.\nThe epidemic is realistically simulated, which means that it\u2019ll unfold in real time, affecting both the gameplay mechanics and the plot. Do you need to cut corners in a hurry, or perhaps you have to find someone? Tough luck\u2014if the district you need is infected, it\u2019ll become a danger zone. Shops will close, houses will lock down, and the air itself will become poisonous. But you may not have another option. \nSurvival. You\u2019ll find no zombies here\u2014it\u2019s the real deal. Hunger, thirst, fatigue, immune resistance, and reputation are all gameplay mechanics, but you\u2019ll also find out that sometimes your affection towards certain characters or your weariness can\u2019t be expressed in numbers. Your enemy is relentless and heartless. Ask yourself: does survival only mean preservation of the body?\nScavenge, gather, trade. You\u2019ll always be hard pressed for resources, money not excluded. But money can\u2019t save your life\u2014you can\u2019t eat it, you can\u2019t heal with it, and at some point you may find out that money is worthless. So you\u2019ll barter with townsfolk, and that\u2019ll keep you afloat\u2026 if you\u2019re fine with taking bullets from kids and trading your only gun for a loaf of bread.\nFights are both simple and hard. You\u2019ll find threats here and there: the bandits at night, the marauders, the sick insane with pain, and simply those who don\u2019t like you. Pathologic is not a shooter\u2014it doesn\u2019t take many bullets to kill someone. But you may only have one left, or your gun may misfire, or perhaps you simply won\u2019t like killing innocent victims. Running or hiding is generally preferable, but you can\u2019t run forever.\nExplore both the town and the characters. In Pathologic nothing is accidental \u2014 every place and every person has a story to tell. You are free to go anywhere, knock on any door and enter any house while making your own story, but remember that no one and nothing will wait for you to finish your business.\nThe town is living and breathing. The weather and the time of day are not the only things that keeps changing: the prices rise and fall depending on the situation, and various events happen in the streets\u2014everything realized in full immersive 3D. People will die, meet one another, perform rituals, and generally live. Sometimes you\u2019ll be there to intervene. Sometimes you won\u2019t.\nTime is always running, and for the most part it\u2019s running out. There are so many things to do in the Town\u2026 which means you\u2019ll have to choose. You can still pause the game and save whenever you want if needed, but while playing you\u2019ll have to remember to manage the most precious of resources\u2014the one you can\u2019t buy or barter for.\nThree playable characters with different storylines. Pathologic isn\u2019t your generic \u201cchoose the race and get called differently\u201d game. The Bachelor\u2019s, The Haruspex\u2019s and The Changeling\u2019s storylines contain different quests and events. Each of them will lead you to an answer\u2014but you\u2019ll also find out that it\u2019s just a fraction of the whole truth, a single person\u2019s perspective. \nChoices matter. Once again, it works on many levels. Do you finish a sidequest risking to die tomorrow, or do you let it go? Whom do you save, a man of noble intentions that have backfired or his less-than-honorable father who is innocent in this particular case? Do you try to keep your cool, or do your emotions get the better of you? \nPathologic is a big game. The full walkthrough with three characters will take you up to 72 hours. And it\u2019s not grinding: each in-game day you\u2019ll face new quests, new events, new plotlines, and new circumstances.\n\nWe have a huge picture listing all rewards you can get, but we've moved it to a different location so that it doesn't clutter the pitch. You're welcome to look through the pledges and rewards to the right of the pitch or here.\nTabletop Pathologic\nWhile most pledge rewards are pretty self-explanatory, we feel the need to elaborate what tabletop Pathologic is a bit further.\nTabletop Pathologic is an asymmetrical stealth action game intended for 2\u20134 players. Three of them become doctors trying to save the Town, while the fourth takes on the role of the Sand Plague. In order to complete missions the doctors have to risk themselves and their Entwined companions, but it\u2019s their only chance to win. The Plague remains unseen until it decides to strike\u2014and then it strikes mercilessly.\nTabletop Pathologic is designed after Pathologic the videogame and strives to keep what made its predecessor special: the atmosphere a town in agony, the feeling of doom and the desperate hope of those who have nothing else left. It\u2019s precisely this hope that makes the three doctors pursuing the same goal become rivals. There\u2019s only one winner in the game, so contesting other players is unavoidable.\nRead more about Pathologic the tabletop game in an update on it and on the website.\n\nThe Tragedian and The Executor\n...are these guys:\nThey are your everpresent companions who guide you through the game\u2014or perhaps deceive you; whatever the case, they are definitely following your progress very closely. The Tragedian is a platzhalter hero, a shade of what could have been were it not for you; like all mimes, he\u2019s gently compassionate and moderately useless. The Executor is a plaguebringer; if you see him, it means you\u2019ve failed to save someone, yet he also seems to care for you in his own fashion.\nIt\u2019s hard to say how many tragedians and executors there are in the Town and if The Tragedian and The Executor appearing here and there are the same two guys or not. They wear masks, after all. You can try to get into their heads by getting these masks through pledging, and The Tragedian\u2019s mask is also available as an add-on.\n\nYou can also choose a Bendy Tragedian. It's a plastic figurine ready to suit your needs and phobias. To find out more about it, please read the update on how it's being produced!\n\nYou may well have, since what we\u2019re doing now is a remake. Pathologic was first released in 2005 to a critical acclaim in Russia, and it does have an international fanbase.\nStill, it succedeed in spite of numerous flaws. The ideas behind the game were novel and interesting, but the implementation turned out to be mediocre, to say the least. Pathologic was our first project as a game development studio, so a lot of things were done impromptu. Turned out learning by trial and error is charming, but leads to cutting lots of features and details out. The game was clunky, it looked outdated even back then, and the translation was atrocious.\n\nWe do have everything we need to make Pathologic work now though. One of the major strengths of the game is its premise which allows for the story to be told multiple times. Whenever you see a good play staged by a different director, you find new layers of meaning in it. We strive to do the same here.\n\n\nSo what exactly are we planning to do? We will keep the following untouched: \nthe atmosphere; \nthe setting;\nthe ideas that lie in the very core of the game;\nthe general storyline; \nthe characters; \nthe map, the general feel and the concept of the Town; it\u2019s already an existing place for us, so we won\u2019t change it, but rather add more detail to it.\n\nThere are also several aspects we plan to correct\u2014or rather reconstruct, bringing them closer to our original vision.\n\nThere\u2019ll be new quests, events, and plotlines, and some filler quests that were added for the sake of adding something will be rid of. \nGraphics will be much better. We\u2019ll do everything we can so that the game looks adequate even ten years from now. \nGameplay will be way more balanced. We\u2019re not talking about making it simpler and survival easier, mind you; but fights used to be annoying rather than tense and emotional, scavenging was very rudimentary, and the economy of a plagued town was hardly a system at all. We plan to change all that, making all these mechanics robust. That doesn\u2019t mean the game\u2019ll become a breeze, it just means we\u2019ll replace artificial challenges with real ones.  \nStreet NPCs will have advanced AIs that\u2019ll make them feel way more alive. Once again, we\u2019re not abandoning the concept of them being \u201cextras\u201d in this play, we just want those extras to perform better. \nWe\u2019ll also add realistic behavior patterns to the disease. \nLocalization will be done internally or with the help of trusted outsourcers who are not only native speakers, but also talented writers. We understand that Pathologic is extremely hard to translate, so\u2014once again\u2014we won\u2019t try to do it directly, but rather reconstruct the game in different languages.\nIce-Pick Lodge is a Russian game development studio founded in 2002. So far we\u2019ve released four games: Pathologic (2005), The Void (2009), Cargo! A Quest for Gravity (2011), and Knock-Knock (2013).  We wouldn\u2019t go as far as call ourselves artists, but our general philosophy is that games should give players food for thought, not just fun. \nWe\u2019ve been making survival games before it was mainstream. Pathologic (2005) was novel for its time. We\u2019re glad that gaming has embraced survival\u2014a genre that allows us to put the player in a really uncomfortable situation, not hold their hand on a walk through a theme park.  \nSo now we want to help the gaming industry make the next step, fully exploring the potential of survival.\nWait, haven\u2019t I seen you before?\nOur latest game, Knock-Knock, was funded via Kickstarter. The campaign was successful, and we\u2019re eternally grateful to the backer community for their help in releasing this game.\nWe\u2019ve made mistakes during the Knock-Knock campaign. It was a peculiar project; we\u2019ve tried to intrigue our backers, but have overdone mysteriousness in the end. Communication should\u2019ve been more frequent and have more substance; we definitely should\u2019ve hit the deadline. It was our first experience with crowdfunding, and we\u2019ve learned a lot. Now we\u2019re ready for a more mature campaign with Kickstarter as one of our main outlets for communication.\nUpdates are going to be frequent and hopefully engaging.\nWhat we want to make is a unique game, but the uniqueness of Pathologic lies in the ideas that permeate its fabric, not in its genre or setting (though we like to think that they\u2019re pretty unusual too). We also hope that it\u2019s a valuable experience. In Pathologic it\u2019s the player, not just the character, who explores the nature of miracles, stands up to a real evil, and finds the ultimate truth.\nAny human being longs to be more. We all desperately look for a world that\u2019s bigger, fuller, more complex than the real one. And it\u2019s games that provide the best medium to create interactive, immersive places; it\u2019s games that seem like the best doorway to the aforementioned bigger, more complex world. They give us unrivalled freedom; they give us abilities impossible in reality.\n\n\nYet, again and again the miracle turns mundane. We get impossibly big swords, impossibly intricate strategies, impossibly stunning landscapes.\n\nBut more often than not they don\u2019t change us for the better.\n\nWell, we don\u2019t like that. Can you name a game that\u2019s left a bigger impact on you than your favourite book? Perhaps you can. Still, that\u2019s not what mainstream gaming tries to achieve\u2014its goal is entertainment.\n\nOur goals are ideas and values. We want to make a game that would reach deep into your soul and leave an impact\u2014like books, and songs, and movies do.\n\nWe think it\u2019s boring to:\n1. make someone fight monsters made of pixels and polygons;\n2. lie that a supervillain is the root of all evil;\n3. lie that you can save the world.\n\nGranted, a lot of indies push the boundaries nowadays, and that\u2019s a great thing\u2014the best possible thing for gaming. But what we want to do is big. It\u2019s not a game to play while commuting; it\u2019s a huge world to live in, to immerse yourself into, to feel for, and to think about. We cannot possibly do that without your support.\n\nDoes that sound like a pitch that would make a publisher excited? Perhaps it could, but we aren\u2019t making a game for a publisher. We\u2019re making it for you, so we want to communicate directly. A game (or any art object, for that matter) is always a dialogue between the author and the consumer. We don\u2019t want to put additional walls between the two parties speaking.\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe traditional risks of game development are: going over budget, failure to meet the deadlines and failure to overcome technical and creative challenges that the process poses. When a project gets crowdfunded, the flexibility (and possible lack) of funds becomes an additional challenge: you never know how much money you\u2019ll manage to collect and if you collect them at all.\n\nThe good thing is we\u2019re more or less protected from most of these risks. We do have investments that would allow us to make Pathologic regardless of whether our Kickstarter campaign is successful, and we do have a roadmap. We are planning to make this game no matter what, and we already have the funds to do it. That would be a simpler, humbler version of the game though, and we really want it to be more detailed.\n\nIt\u2019s not a cosmetic issue either. We don\u2019t just want more polygons, more trees, and more character models. The world of Pathologic is crafted so that every detail is meaningful and adds to the story, the mood, and the atmosphere (a Town of ideas, remember?). Any additional funds will add complexity, beauty, and new layers of meaning.\n\nThat\u2019s where real risks and challenges come in though. In Pathologic nothing is simple, and there\u2019s always a risk of us failing the creative challenge. Game development is an iterative process that demands exploration; you never know when a new idea comes to you, so while we\u2019ve tried to set realistic deadlines, some delays are still possible. We\u2019ll do our best to mitigate them though by sticking to our roadmap, but most importantly, we\u2019ll keep you in the loop and maintain communication so that you know how things are going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "PS4 keys are finally here", "update_content": "We want to thank everyone who waited for PS4 release for their eternal patience.

Support us for $1 or more, and join in on the experiment!\nYou play as Bolt Riley, a poor boy from Trenchtown, Jamaica, on his pathway to stardom.\nBolt is struggling to survive and has to deal with a gang of Rude Boys. You go through a journey of self discovery, of love, friendship, and inspiration, where you are introduced to Reggae music, you have to form your band, get inspiration, write and produce your songs and then perform them. The story consists of three parts each focusing on a different aspect of Bolt Riley\u2019s passage into becoming a Reggae legend.  \nThis is the true story of the underdog who breaks out and becomes a worldwide sensation.\nBolt Riley performing for the first time in front of an audience\n\"Bolt Riley - Chapter 1\" is complete game that's part of a trilogy series. It has a self sustained story that should last a few hours of gameplay, all depends on whether you click every little thing on the screen or not, and how fast you solve the puzzles, and if you listen to every dialog line in the conversations... Getting a full indie game with hours of unique gameplay and dialog, for only $10, is not that bad.\nTry Bolt Riley's Alpha Demo Today!  \nYou can play Bolt Riley's Demo Alpha here: http://bolt-riley.com/alpha\nHowever, before you play, please read this and remember it's a very early build.\nWrite-ups and Reviews:\n\"That\u2019s definitely something new for the adventure game world; I absolutely love this concept and the artwork is gorgeous.\" -- Nerdy But Flirty\n\"Do you love point and click adventure games? Is reggae your jam?

So why not make a campaign just for those days and forget about the long dead period in the middle?\nIt can be done. ZeFrank did it with $146k\nAlso It takes a LOT of effort running a campaign, then it takes time to get the funds from Amazon. So a shorter one, will also let us get funds quickly and help us resume development sooner, so we can focus on game development.\nWill we be able to reach our goal in such a short time? We sure hope so, but that's up to you! Despite not reaching our goal, we did manage to reach a higher sum last time thanks to you.\nIs 31K enough to finish Bolt Riley? How did you calculate that number?\nFirst, We eliminated all physical rewards from the budget. Our original campaign budget included calculations for high reward fulfillment costs (around 48k)  for t-shirts, game boxes, books, posters, shipping from Israel, and the Cole's flight to Israel. Without those costs, we can focus on game development, and not merchandise making. We also didn't take the OUYA fund into account last time.\nFinally, we are going to focus our budget fully on the first chapter of the game, which is a complete self sustained story line.\nSo the answer is: Yes. We can do it for that much, If we assume we actually get the OUYA fund.\nHere's our new budget plan:\n(click to view interactive version)\nSo, Double Our Fun(ds)! We're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help Bolt Riley get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv. (Notice - OUYA exclusivity doesn't mean PC/Mac/Linux, where the game will be on at the initial release date.)\nThe game features hand drawn 2D background artwork and hand drawn cel animation. It combines all the elements of a classic point and click adventure game and includes funny dialog puzzles, exploration, wacky inventory items, and of course, a rope. \nWe introduce a sort of second inventory, where Bolt can use special Inspirational powers he learned during his journeys. This is similar to how spells worked in the later Quest for Glory games, where you had a separate inventory for spells.\nWe also want the game to be fully voiced by professional voice actors like I have done in my previous game Pizza Morgana. More on that, later.\nThe game is made with the amazing Unity engine and will be available on any platform we can export it to, like I have done with my previous game Star Shipping Inc.\nGame availability depends on the final sum we will raise. The basic funding goal will let us start with the desktop versions (PC/Mac/Linux) of Chapter 1, as desktop is the easiest to develop for, without spending too many resources on platform optimizations, and soon after we will add OUYA as part of the Free The Games Fund which we applied to, so we can increase our budget and make a better game, all in exchange for an exclusivity period. All money received from the Free the Games fund will go directly into reaching stretch goals.\nAfterwards, we hope to get this game to any additional platform we can: Steam, Humble store, iOS, Android, Windows 8 store and Windows phone 8, Amazon Kindle, Gamestick, Shield, Gamepop, and maybe even nextgen consoles. We want you to play the game wherever it's most convenient to you, and we want to make this game available on each and every platform Unity supports. \n\nBolt with his best friend Smokey and Girlfriend Thelma in front of the old man's house.\nRegarding steam availability: To enable us to hand out Steam keys to backers, please vote for Bolt Riley on Steam Greenlight:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=185655454\nWe want to have the game released by 4/20 of 2016.

I wrote an entire text adventure game in Basic at the age of 10. I've been working in the industry since 1999 and indie adventure games are my favorite kind of games, even though I have made dozens of games from different genres as well.\nI\u2019m a big geek with tons of interests and hobbies that include music, photography, cooking, flying airplanes and shooting fireworks.\nI started a Facebook group called Fellowship of GDC Parties that helps connect people who go to game developers conferences like GDC, Gamescom and E3. I also volunteer at the International game developers association (IGDA) and ran the Israeli chapter for a few years and love to contribute to the community.\nI am a true believer in crowdfunding as the way of the future and have been involved in over a dozen campaigns and ran a few of my own, like the one that recently got me over to E3. I've also been doing crowdfunding before that word was even invented, through my website \"Buy a Car for Ron Gilbert\".\nOran Bar-Tal, Producer and Art Director\nOran specializes in animation with 5 years of experience in producing projects and computer games. After working in television, web and even biotechnological 3D simulations, Oran\u2019s main passion for games brought him to Adventure Mob in hope to create a successful world class gaming company in Israel.\nOran holds a B.ed.des in visual communication degree (with honor)\nLori and Corey Cole, Game Designers\nLori and Corey Cole have been making and playing games for... let's just say, \"forever\". \nAt Sierra On-Line, they created one of the first hybrid graphic adventure/role-playing games. The award-winning Quest for Glory was one of Sierra's most successful game series. Corey's Castle of Dr. Brain puzzle adventure game was another top-selling, critically-acclaimed game that spawned a successful series. In 2012, they have successfully raised over $400k for Hero-U.\nThe Coles took an important role in designing the entire game, while most of their work was focused on the second chapter of Bolt Riley, which will hopefully be released in the future.\nCorey and Lori Cole with Oded Sharon\nMusic  \nWe're still talking to a bunch of musicians to collaborate with on the score for Bolt Riley. One of them is Omri Lahav.   \nOmri Lahav is an accomplished composer for video games - including the award winning, open-source \"0 A.D.\", as the Music department lead for Wildfire Games and countless other titles, Having produced and played guitar, bass, keyboards and percussion in several reggae projects, he aspires to create the ultimate reggae masterpiece for Bolt Riley! http://omrilahav.com\n\nHere are three tracks he composed for Bolt RIley. These will be included in the soundtrack along the other tracks Omri will compose for the game.\nVoice Actors\nRight now, we are talking to several voice actors who auditioned for different roles. One such actor we're talking to is Anthony Sardinha who is well known for his of Bwana on the adventure game The Journey Down\nA bit more about Anthony: \nAnthony Sardinha is a Toronto Based voice actor with almost 10 years of experience under his belt. Lending his voice to many Video games, Cartoons, Films, Corporate videos, Radio commercials, Documentaries, Web-Based animations and games, working with producers and directors all across the world from places like Australia, Sweden, Germany, Israel & Brazil. You can hear him as the lead voice of \"Bwana\" in Skygoblin's \"The Journey Down\", as well as many others on his website antfish.webs.com.\nI am going to use many of my connections in Hollywood as I am friends with a bunch of talented actors who I plan to ask to voice the game for the best results. \nAs you can see I've worked with some in my previous games.\nYou can snoop through my Facebook albums to see pictures of some people I met and know... But... I hate name dropping... (Actually, no I don't!) \nOne Album. Another Album.\nI'm hoping to be able to make some announcements during the campaign.\nBolt Riley and his band backstage preparing for their first big show.\n\n\nSome of the many characters from the game\n\nOther than pledging, we could use your help in the success of the campaign.\nYou can start by telling your friends about it, share, tweet, post, like, comment, instagram, tumblr, tube, pinterest, or just get on stage with a microphone and sing a song about the campaign. Anything and everything counts, even if it\u2019s something little. In order for the campaign to succeed, dozens of thousands of people would have to hear about it, and we need your help to reach them. \n\nBe active! Ask questions, share your ideas with us, tell us your thoughts, and let us hear your feedback. We\u2019ll be very happy to answer everything.\nHave fun!  It\u2019s very important to have fun. Especially in times of struggle. We do this game because we think it\u2019s fun to make games and tell good stories, and we want you to have fun too. If we can help you have fun, then we\u2019ll be happy too.\n\nPersonally, I have been involved with several campaigns, both large and small, and I've backed as of now, 221 different projects myself. I\u2019m a true believer in the power of crowdfunding and think that this is the way to go as far as fundraising to make adventure games, and I plan on Kicking It Forward: http://kickingitforward.org\n  Remember, only you can help make this game a reality.

You can always go back in and select a prize once that happens (check the other prizes for price equivalents).\nI am back for another round, ready and excited to give the world more amazing author photographs.This calendar will bring you twelve different photos of world-famous fantasy authors in gorgeous custom costumes I create myself.\nBut I need your help! I\u2019ve got the ideas, I\u2019ve got the authors, and we\u2019re ready to bring you another outstanding fantasy calendar. But the costs of making over a dozen custom costumes and props, and the travel involved to shoot the photos all over the United States in a six-month period, are more than I can finance alone. So I need your help to bring Fantasy Calendar 2.0 into existence.\nEach photo will tell a story, and though they will range from light to dark in essence, overall there will be a dreamy, ethereal feel to the images. From what I\u2019ve seen, this project is the first and only of its kind to bring authors together in such a way and is truly something unique. I had such an amazing time creating the first calendar that I wanted to continue this wonderful project. \nMy name's Lauren Zurchin. Some of you may know me from my award-winning photography (including last year's Beyond Words calendar), others may know me from Lytherus.com and The Inheritance Cycle Book Club podcasts on Shurtugal.com. But basically I\u2019m a fantasy-loving bibliophile who does photography to make a living and manages a book department on a scifi/fantasy website for fun.\nThis calendar is a way to bring fantasy images and the creators of fantasy together in a fun and unique way. the initial idea for this project came after experiencing some wonderful fine art photography and wanting to put a distinctive twist on the concept. Who better to be the subjects of fantasy-based photos than the creators of fantasy themselves? Thanks to my author connections from the website I work for I was able to do some great networking, and the project was born. I also wanted to make sure the images were available to fans of the authors, and to the world in general. A calendar seemed like a great, accessible way to achieve that.\nAfter months of coordinating, I've put together an amazing line-up of authors who are excited to participate in this project:\nLeigh Bardugo (The Grisha Series)\nJim Butcher (The Harry Dresden Files, The Codex Alera)\nMelissa de la Cruz (The Blue Bloods series, Witches of East End)\nTony DiTerlizzi (The Spiderwick Chronicles,  The WondLa series)\nKami Garcia (The Beautiful Creatures novels, The Legion Series)\nLev Grossman (The Magicians series)\nRobin Hobb (The Liveship Traders Trilogy, The Rain Wild Chronicles)\nTahereh Mafi (The Shatter Me Series)\nGarth Nix (The Abhorsen Trilogy, The Keys to the Kingdom Series)\nRansom Riggs (The Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children Series)\nMargaret Stohl (The Beautiful Creatures novels, The Icons Series)\nScott Westerfeld (The Leviathan Trilogy, The Uglies Series)\nLike last year's calendar I\u2019m going to be designing and creating custom costumes for each author and putting together custom props that fit with the themes of the individual photos. I am deliberately not going with expected themes (an author becoming one of their characters, for example), but the overall vibe will be one within the broad term of \"fantasy\". \nLast year I was lucky enough to exceed my Kickstarter goal by around $6500. Even so I still ended up going over by a few thousand. After everything got distributed (see chart below), I ended up having around $500 per author for travel, and $500 per author for costumes and props. This wasn't a lot, and I was able to make it work by grouping the shoots into a few big trips (and couch crashing when I could), and by getting creative for the photos -- and due to the generosity of some awesome people who helped me. This year's finances are shaping up to distribute in a similar fashion, with some adjustments to make a few parts of the project more financially efficient. \nOf course, I'd love to do even more (bigger sets, fancier props, more elaborate costumes, pay my graphic designer extra, etc.), but it will completely depend on what sort of funding comes in. The more Kickstarter funding, the better the final product.\nHere's how the money last year was spent (I rounded for ease):\nFEES: $2,200\nBoth Kickstarter and Amazon take a cut of the total, plus you have to figure in credit cards that didn't clear. This is gone right off the top.\nEXPENSES: $7000\n This was the cost of the costumes and props, general things like the t-shirts and duct tape to make the costume busts I needed for measurements, paying my graphic designer, and anything else I needed to actually acquire for the calendar itself, whether for the shoot or general creation.\nTRAVEL: $5000\nThis was mainly gas, the occasional hotel when I couldn't stay with a friend, and food while traveling around to get the photos. The authors are extremely busy, and for this to work I had to come to them and they'd fit me into their crazy schedules. Even though it's a large chunk of the money, it's a necessary part of the project.\nPRODUCT: $4500\nThis is what it cost to make all the Kickstarter prizes and various packaging things for mailing them out.\nSHIPPING: $6000\nThis was for sending out the Kickstarter prizes and for shipping things to the authors to be signed. This is where I lost money; I wasn't prepared for the sheer amount of cost for this. I will be better prepared this year.\nTHIS IS A 2016 CALENDAR. What does that mean and why? \nLast year, I shot and made the calendar by October of 2013, which gave me some time to get it ready for sale for the 2014 year. However, all the big chain bookstores like B&N and Books-a-Million, because of the way their budgeting is, purchase calendars a year in advance. For me to have a chance of getting this calendar into the big stores, which is my intention, I needed to push the actual release a year forward. I will be shooting the images this summer and fall, and plan on having a completed product by the beginning of 2015, which will allow me to submit it for approval to the big stores for the 2016 year. This is also why prizes aren't until early next year, because I will be spending the rest of this year shooting, editing, and producing the images and the final product.\nPrizes for Kickstarter have to relate to the project in some way. All of the authors were awesome enough to sign various items, like prints and bookplates, in a limited quantity. There are also nice combo packs with personalized items, and even a few different prizes, like a skype chat with me, a behind the scenes book, and the big prize of a photo shoot with me (one girl did this last year and we had a blast!). If you're interested in getting one of these items, especially the limited number signed things, make sure you move fast before they're all gone. But be sure to scroll to the end, there are lots and lots of goodies being offered!\nThis is a chance to create fantasy art with the masters of fantasy themselves as the subjects. Nothing like this has ever been done before in this exact manner. This is also a chance to see your favorite author in a new light, from a new perspective. These photo concepts are the best I've ever had in my creative life, and I feel confident that these will be the best photographs I have ever taken.\nYou can get something extra with add-ons! You just include the amount for the add-on to your pledge, and then let me know what you want. (If you've already pledged and want to add-on you will need to click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, then adjust the total amount to include your add-on).

One of the prizes was sent out much later than expected, because I was at the mercy of author travel schedules and when they could fit in the signatures. I'm going to try and mail things sooner, and hopefully I left enough time to realistically get prizes out to everyone.\n\nAlso, to save money, I'm going to group more than one photo shoot per trip, which should help keep costs down. But the main challenges with this will be in coordinating each author\u2019s schedule within a single trip. Each author I spoke with has approved a shoot during summer or fall, allowing for a great deal of flexibility in coordinating with them. Should I face a setback with one author\u2019s schedule, that photo shoot can be scheduled on its own with a time that works best for that author. I'm sure other things will come up, but like I said above, timing and schedules are the greatest challenge. However, all of these authors are willing to work with me, so I'm not worried about getting all of the photos taken. :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Clearing Out calendar swag!", "update_content": "Hi all!\nI finally managed to get the leftover calendar swag online to clear out, so I wanted to send along a link for any of you who want to pick up some more goodies!\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/LZStudiosImagery\n50% of proceeds are still going to Worldbuilders, Patrick Rothfuss's kickass charity, so every purchase will go towards making the world a better place."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Jim Butcher swag is on the way to me finally!", "update_content": "Quick update.

I am an illustrator living in Portland, OR. I really love calm and reflective scenes that emphasize the internal. In the past I've worked with animation companies and various personal clients to bring ideas to life. I grew up in Michigan and moved to Oregon in 2009 to pursue schooling in Media Arts & Animation at the Art Institute of Portland and then I went on to study Illustration at PNCA.\n_________________________________________________________________\nBen Luce\nHi I'm Ben Luce. I'm an animator in Portland, OR. I love animating 2D characters and effects with exaggerated and fluid motion. I'm originally from Connecticut, and I went to school at MICA in Baltimore, MD. I've freelanced for big clients like ESPN and Stevia, animated for Liz Miele's web series Damaged, and created Sinitus Tempo's music video Blue Alley Waltz. You can see examples on my website and my demo reel below.\nWhat's the video about?\nThe video is a pastiche of 70s and 80s fantasy and scifi. Influences include Moebius, Heavy Metal, Ralph Bakshi films, 80s anime, and Fantastic Planet.\nAn evil wizard sends his minions across the desert to steal a magical crystal from a peaceful village. Without the crystal, the villagers' plants begin to wilt and die.\nAs the minions enter the wizard's castle to hand over the crystal, suddenly one of the other minions attacks him. The attacker is revealed to be the first hero in disguise. Our second hero jumps down from the rafters and joins in the fight. The story continues, but that's all for now...\nHow will you make the video?\nBen will animate the characters and effects using TVPaint to simulate cel animation techniques. Flash may also be used for some effects shots. The final video will be composited in After Effects to add extra motion, detail, and effects.\nJames will use Photoshop to design background images, like this one:\nHow long will it take?\nWe estimate that the final video will take 3 months to complete. We are shooting to complete the video around the beginning of November.\nWhat's in it for me?\nNot only will you get to be a part of an awesome animation project, but there are some great prizes to accompany your generosity (see our full prize list).\nWhere will the money go?\nThe funding will allow James and Ben to survive for a few months while working on something they enjoy. Fang Moon will get some great exposure and a piece that they can show off when introducing their brand, without having to fund it out of pocket. We're a small collection of creators looking to do what we love to do - create. With your help we will be able to accomplish that goal.\nHow did you all meet?\nLydia works at a local bar in Portland, Oregon. One night, Ben struck up a conversation and found out she was in a band. The topic of a music video arose, and the idea was born.\nBen and James were linked up through an event called \"The Burst,\" put on by After Effects PDX, a local AE user group. Ben and James were given the theme of \"float,\" and had one week to create up to a minute of animation. Their entry \"Ghost Garbage\" won first place.\nAfter developing the idea with the band, Ben realized that he could use an extra hand on the project.

For more updates remember to visit our website, follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook!\nIt all began in August 2013 during the 7 Day First Person Shooter game challenge, where we decided to make something that really stood out in the genre. Our concept was a title that felt dynamic and satisfying, while not requiring superhuman reflexes. Something like a game of real-time chess, except that all the pawns are out there to murder you. We released a public demo...\nYou can also check out the video reactions to our prototype: [Markiplier] [OfficialNerd\u00b3] [CupQuake] [JackSepticEye] [FavijTV] [JackFrags]\n... and then - the Internet went crazy. We have been featured on Kotaku, The Verge, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and WIRED among many others. SUPERHOT made it to the front page of Reddit (twice) and went through Steam Greenlight during a single weekend. Thanks to the amazingly positive responses we've decided that we want to develop SUPERHOT into a full blown game!\nSUPERHOT is a unique, stylized FPS game where the time moves only when you move. With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.\nYou're not hiding behind cover - you're dodging bullets flying past you like in The Matrix. You're not waiting to reload a gun - you're picking the next firearm from the hands of your fallen foes. You're not waiting until your wounds heal - in SUPERHOT a single bullet means death. However, there are no reload screens - you're instantly back in the middle of the action. \nSUPERHOT wouldn't have made it this far if not for the support of gamers, the press, and fellow developers. Since the original prototype we've basically rewritten the game from the ground-up to make it more expandable, dynamic and resulting in a much smoother experience. \nDuring these eight months we've fixed a lot of the problems with the original version of the game, heavily reiterated on the art style, and experimented with fun scenarios for the players to \"solve\" - shootout in a subway train, showdown on the top of a skyscraper in rain, jumping into a moving elevator, and more.\nWe've still got a lot of work (new mechanics, more levels, better animation, rigorous testing and optimization) ahead of us, but the core of SUPERHOT is in place and it's unlike anything you've seen before.\nTurning to Kickstarter ensures that we have access to a constant stream of feedback and ideas, while maintaining control over the development. We have the skills and experience needed to complete the game and we've been working on SUPERHOT non-stop for the past eight months, but we need your help to make it even better!\nThe initial goal of $100k will allow us to cover the costs of living for the team, purchase required hardware, software licences and assets that will allow us to finish the game faster, and to hire additional help - graphic artists, animators, level designers and sound technicians - that will assist us in making SUPERHOT a complete game. All funds over $100k will go directly into making the game better and covering the costs of promoting the game on various gaming events around the world.\nStory driven single-player campaign. SUPERHOT is more than just a shooter with a gimmick. We want to deliver a solid, interesting campaign built around a carefully constructed, not overly in-your-face story.\nImproved visuals. We are keeping the original game's minimalistic artstyle while making everything look a lot better. SUPERHOT is all about style.\nInfinite mode. A lot of people have asked us for an endless, arena-style mode that will allow them to play SUPERHOT for as long as they want. Master the game's mechanics and get ready for the ultimate time-bending challenges.\nMore weapons - shotguns, machineguns, grenades that change the way you play around with the time-bending mechanics.\nMore enemy types - thanks to improved AI the foes will use tactics and be able to work together to hunt you down.\nMore levels - imagine fighting in the middle of a motorway during rush hour, or close combat in an elevator - and other amazing, movie-like scenarios.\nSlow-motion explosions!\nOculus Rift support. Dodge bullets flying right in front of your face and lean behind corners for increased immersion!\nAnd a lot of other surprises!\n Piotr is a seasoned team leader with a portfolio that pushes the experimental boundaries of puzzle games in titles such as Rektagon and Tetravalanche.  \nJakub is an experienced programmer with a portfolio of games released for various platforms, including PC, PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS. \nLuke previously worked at Wastelands Interactive (Worlds of Magic, 1946).

Just take a look at this chart:\nNotice something? Sure these games are popular and you might even call them \"fun\" but they harbor a horrible bias in today\u2019s gaming world. Most are blind to it but it's all right there, that's right, none of these games has you playing as a bear.\nIt's quite clear the fat cats in Washington with their stove top hats and contemporary jazz music don't want us playing as bears, it's about time to fight back against the tyranny.\nThe title gives you all you need to know as it's pretty much a bear simulator. You play in FPB (First Person Bear) and do bear things which include exploring, eating fish and plants, striking down anything that dare stand before your might, increasing your stats, sleeping and discovering mysteries of your forest home. Watch the alpha trailer above or right here on youtube to give you an idea.\nTL;DR - It's like a mini Skyrim but you're a bear\nThe estimated release date is November(ish) 2014.\nKeep up with Bear Simulator news and updates on the official Twitter and Facebook pages:\nTwitter.com/BearSimulator\nFacebook.com/BearSimulatorGame\nTrailers and other videos will be uploaded here:\nYoutube.com/FarjayStudios\nYou can discuss things on the subreddit:\nreddit.com/r/BearSimulator\nIf you want to contact me (the person making this bear game) here's my twitter. I'll be using this a lot during production:\ntwitter.com/JohnFarjay\nAll questions here:\nbritnie@farjay.com\n Stretch goals are tricky because I can't add a whole lot of things or else it would put things behind schedule. So a lot of the goals are stupid/fun/freelance and popular requests will be added after the games release.\nA few games in the past got it right and have been rewarded with universal praise, notably Banjo-Kazooie and EnviroBear, but there hasn't been many solid, somewhat realistic bear simulation games (if at all). That's where this comes in.\nSure it may seem like a \u201cdumb idea\u201d or a \u201creally dumb idea\u201d but you can't honestly tell me you've never secretly wanted to be a bear wandering around the forest. That's just an outright lie.\nScreenshots and Game Footage are from an early version of the game. Take extreme note of this.\n Larger screens here.\nSome of the key features you should expect in this finished bear game:\nFantastic first person camera, motor and control.\nThe first person view and bear control will play an extraordinary part in the game as it adds a huge amount of character. This is a number one priority and will be worked on until it's perfect. You'll be mostly crawling around in the fully featured game, standing to examine things and waddle about.\nMelee fighting system.\nAnother important feature which ties into the previous feature but deserves it's own bullet point.\nLarge multi-environment world with lots to see and discover.\nWhile it will be a realistic setting, the game won't be based on any specific real world place.\nA variety of different living things that will populate the land and beyond.\nOne of the main points of Bear Simulator is to be an exploration game (and being a bear) so it wouldn't make sense if there was nothing to search for.\nA catastrophic amount of secrets.\nThe game will be like 30% secret areas and stuff.\nEvents\nEvents will be explained later with a flashy trailer or something since summarizing them in a bullet point lacks that dramatic punch.\nMountain goats(!)\nAn extremely important feature.\nLots more!\n\"Lots more!\" includes: Unlockable bear abilities, animal friends, ways to customize your bear and possible Oculus Rift support.\nPOSSIBLE FEATURE:\nMultiplayer\nEven though I have a few awesome ideas for some multiplayer modes, most of the development time and funding will go towards crafting a glorious single player experience. So count multiplayer as being a possible feature that may or may not be added. Also this has nothing to do with me being unable to get multiplayer to friggen work correctly \u10da(\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0\u10da)\nBear Simulator is the first project meant to 'kickstart' a new game studio: Farjay Studios. Sure it's just one person so it's kind of odd to call it a studio but I don't know what else to call it. Anywho, this game was chosen since I already have a solid design for it and it's pretty simple at it's core. Plus it will be crazy fun to promote, you have no idea.\nHere's the production blog which will eventually be filled with updates on the game's progress.\nBearSimulator.com\nI'm being lazy with web stuff so the official site for Bear Simulator is a bit lackluster at the moment. I'm not really really a web designer which is a good excuse for the laziness. If the game does get funded some of the funds will go towards making it more fancy and forest-y.\nAlright, this sounds a little strange but I'm 80% sure it will turn out fantastic. Since I'm using Kickstarter and needed some interesting, lower tier pledge rewards, why not feature a region dedicated to these things? Boom, right here, Kickstarter Island.\nAvailable for all to explore and existing outside the realm of the somewhat realistic Bear Simulator world, the island will be similar to an amusement park allowing for the creative freedom to host plenty of nonsensical things. This means a bunch of backer submitted stuff can be incorporated in a way that won't break the immersion. Check the reward section for some info on what to expect.\nThis reward has been updated with an in-game credit.\nSome of the rewards might be a little confusing so you can ask a question in the comment section or through email.\nEmail: Britnie@Farjay.com\nAlso no advertisements for submissions, because that would be lame.\nFirst of all, Bear Simulator is mostly done on a base level meaning that much of the tedious and time consuming parts are complete but a lot of the game is fairly rough and using placeholder art, sound and models.\nWhat remains are the fun parts like buying the needed pieces to replace the placeholder stuff so it looks nice, hence this Kickstarter campaign.\nHere's a rundown of how the funding would be spent for a good bear game. Some of it involves commissions and freelance so there's a tiny bit of guesstimating going on here.\nModels/Textures: 7,000$\nBecause I can't model organic things AT ALL, a good fraction of the funding will go towards environmental and creature models/textures. See my spherical bee hive for reference of said modeling skills:\nMost of the models and textures needed are readily available on sites like TurboSquid and the Asset Store. Others will be commissioned and several of them can be modified and reused to save on cost and give a sense of variety.\nHardware: 2,500$\nAn updated Mac for OSX testing and some other hardware like additional storage, software and maybe an Oculus Rift.\nLicensing and Various Fees 4,500$\nEngine licensing, premium site templates, Amazon and Kickstarter fees.\nSound: 2,500$\nYou don't want cheap, artificial sound in your bear game, if you want quality sound effects you gotta lay down the cold hard cash.\nArt/Graphic Design: 3,500$\nIllustrations, better menu and hud design, premium stock photos, etc.\nAdditional Programming: 3,500$\nAdvanced scripts from freelancers, mainly camera control and movement and a more intuitive menu and loading system.\nRewards: ~5,000$\nProducing all the physical items and shipping. It's difficult to give an estimate on this since the price is based on if all the physical rewards are claimed or not.\nMisc: 1000$\nCovers all the small things that might pop up like refunds, guesstimation underfunding and unforeseen shipping expenses.\nBig book of the Berenstain Bears: 10$\nFor the powerful life lessons that can only be taught by bears.\nSomething will be set up to update backers where funds would be going, either through twitter, on the main site, or some other way.\nForums! Bears are a coveted animal on the internet, right up there with cats and that dog with the constant inner monologue. So a forum will be vastly important to this whole production. Aimed to be the grandest animal simulator in all the land, this message board will be used extensively for feedback, polls, updates, and soul crushing criticisms.\nWill be using Reddit.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/\nContrary to the screenshots and trailer, your bear in Bear Simulator won't be walking around on two legs all the time. In the fully featured game you'll spend most of your time crawling around and leaping about like an actual bear.\nThe constant \u201cbipedal/two-leg mode\u201d was used for a few reasons, for one it makes it easy to test things, second, it gives a good idea on how your bear would interact with stuff and lastly, I didn't want to animate and program everything with a placeholder bear model.\nYour environment is divided up into large \u201cRegions\u201d. Each region is a different theme and contain different \u201cAreas\u201d. The harder to reach places tend to be dangerous but contain the rarest food and creatures... Not the mention the occasional \u201cMysterious Being\u201d:\n\"Mysterious Beings\" are basically powerful, fictional creatures.\nThese are the planned regions, they don't have names yet:\nMain Forest\nThis is the \u201cHub\u201d region. There aren't many aggressive enemies here and only the basic foods. It's also where your den is located.\nMountains\nA snowy, rocky region. There are definitely going to be mountain goats here, EVEN IF IT COSTS ALL THE FUNDING.\nOcean Coast\nThe ocean coast. The huge body of water probably bewilders most bears. Err, forest bears, not polar.\nSpooky Woods\nThe way this region is planned easily earns the name Spooky Woods, in fact it's probably going to stay named Spooky Woods.\nUndergrounds\nA system of connected caves without much to eat. It also contains an ancient evil.\nFields\nA flat, wide open land.\nKickstarter Island\nRead about it above. ^\nWelp, that's all of them. Definitely not keeping any more regions secret.\nPlenty of animals other than bears will populate your world which come in all sorts of different flavors depending on where you are.\nSome animals will only appear under certain conditions.\nA scientist can correct me but I'm fairly sure real bears have a mental menu where they track their stats. Here's a few of them which might change so they aren't final:\nStrength\nHigh strength means more powerful swipes and the ability to get through any area blocking barricades.\nVitality\nPretentious word for Health Points.\nForaging\nIncreases your chance of successfully picking some berries, stealing honey, etc. Because as we all know, plucking grapes from a vine takes some serious skill in the bear world.\nIntelligence\nDisplays important info for what you're about to eat before diving right in.\nSwim\nHow long/fast you can swim before getting bear cramps and drowning.\nJump/Leap\nAllows you to dunk other bears that talk smack bout you on the court. (How high you can jump)\nLuck\nI have absolutely no idea what this stat will do. WHY DID I EVEN ADD IT.\nWhile fumbling about on your crazy bear adventure you may come upon curious things that stand out from the generic tree or frog. This all has to do with the grand Bear Simulator quest that will explore the mysterious heritage of bears with a storyline so compelling it will win several Oscars including Best Lead Actor.\nSure it's optional so you can ignore it but why would you want to do that.\nMarch 19th Edit:\nSeveral rewards lowered in price. Added an in-game credit to the 40$ Mystic Bear tier to increase value.\nMarch 21th Edit:\nUpdated social media links and stuff.\nMarch 26th Edit:\nUpdated stretch goals.\nMarch 31st Edit:\nUpdated stretch goals again and took out some old information.\nSites I got stuff from to make this page.\ncgtextures.com\ncommons.wikipedia.org\nsxc.hu\nvideocopilot.com\nincompetech.com - Wallpaper, Suvaco do Cristo - Kevin MacLeod\nturbosquid.com\ncustomink.com\nimdb.com/name/nm0000158/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk 1:\nGetting physical rewards all shipped out correctly.\n\nRemedy:\nIf the rewards prove popular, they're capped so things can't get out of hand.\n\n\nRisk 2:\nHaving the game able to run on a variety of systems.\n\nRemedy:\nBeta testing should help a bunch and the graphics/performance of the game will be given an in-depth menu with presets and custom options so you can manually or automatically adjust settings.\n\n\nRisk 3:\nNeed to make sure the game appeases bear fans lest I incur their wrath.\n\nRemedy:\nBeing active on message boards/twitter and getting feedback on major design choices should alleviate this risk.\n\n\nRisk 4:\nNot making the planned release date on time.\n\nRemedy:\nA pretty solid production schedule is set up, plus a lot of the tedious and time consuming parts of the game are complete. If it does get funded then I'll have a bunch of internet people breathing down my neck to finish the game. That's some awesome motivation to get it out on time.\n\n\nRisk 5:\nNot getting the game on Steam and/or other distribution services.\n\nRemedy:\nThe plan is to get it on Steam so keys can be sent out to backers. I'll put it up on Steam Greenlight when I'm further along and happier with the way the game looks. If that doesn't work out there's always the Humble Store, GoG, or some kind of makeshift way to distribute by just sending the game installer to backers but that wouldn't be very exciting now would it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "Campground Released + a Sale", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Campground Teaser + Questions?", "update_content": "Have the campground region prepared (think it's good to go, tested it a bunch but there may be unforeseen problems) here's a trailer I put together for it, think it turned out neat:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Behind the Scenes Stuff", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Island Posters + Another Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "Game Update (Fixes, additions, and upgrades)", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Campground Update Preview #3 + Bug Fixes Coming + Features", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Fan Stuff + Some Updates/Questions + Campground Update Preview #2", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Campground Region Preview + Other Things", "update_content": "First of all look at this trailer, it's an early preview for the Campground update:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Island + Better Update + Campgrounds Preview + Game Update #2 + Soundtrack + Frasier Review", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "An Update", "update_content": "Well the game didn't have a great reception, has a stigma against it's name and there's plenty of other problems so making any updates or going further is basically a lost cause now.

Former U.S. Navy SEAL Cutter Slade is given the job of escorting three scientists (William Kauffmann, Anthony Xue and Marion Wolfe) on a mission to this alien world to recover the probe and stop the threat. Arriving in this alien world, Cutter is separated from the other scientists and is hailed by the natives as their messiah, the Ulukai.\nWant to know more? Check this excellent review of the original game:\nYou can also learn a lot more about the making of Outcast by reading my article here.\n\nTo quote GamesRadar:\n\n\"Okay, so the hero\u2019s name is stupid and the plot sounds like a rehash of Stargate, but trust us, this action-adventure game was revolutionary. You could freely explore open world cities, mountains and forests (two years before GTA III). You could commandeer extraterrestrial vehicles \u2013 in this case, dinosaur-like creatures - for quicker transport (two years before Halo). You could pick and choose missions in the order that suited your playing style (nine years before Fallout 3).\"\nOutcast has been critically acclaimed to the point it has reach some cult status among many PC gamers. However, the software-only nature of the original engine meant the game has been ignored by many at a time when hardware-accelerated 3d polygons was becoming the norm (and they loved flat corridors apparently :P ).

The studio founded in 2004 and headed by Yann Robert and Franck Sauer, has a significant experience in developing games for PC and consoles and has worked on several shipped games on PC, PS2, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.\nMost members from the core team were present in the old days, when developing the original Outcast, and we are delighted to have them on-board to help develop this HD reboot.\nI am CEO and Technical Director at Fresh3D. For over 26 years, I have been developping and trying to push the limits of the hardware on the various platforms I had the chance to work on Amiga, PC, PS2, PSP, PSVita, PS3, X360, XB1, PS4. I like this alchemy between art, technology and gameplay.\n  It all started at Ubi Soft in 1987 where I put my hand on a Commodore 64 and never left the industry till then. My first game released was 'Unreal' on Amiga in 1990. Then, during 3 years, I developed several coin-up games on our own designed hardware board, the most successful was 'Ultimate Tennis'. In 1995,  I co-founded Appeal and was Technical Director on Outcast. Among the games I've worked on, Outcast is certainly the one I am the most proud of. I truly believe that players feel the passion you put in the game while developing it.\nI'm Co-Owner and Creative Director at Fresh3d and was co-director on the original Outcast. I have over 26 years of industry experience, and you can read details about all the games I've been working on at my website francksauer.com\nI love video games. Like many, I like playing them, but my real passion is about making them. To me, video games is the most creative and complete form of entertainment. It combines all other forms of entertainment and adds interactivity on top. What makes me tick is the intricate combination of art and technology that is required to make a game. I love to make visuals, sounds and music, write stories, develop universes and implement interactions. Don't we have two brains? Maybe we've been designed to make games!\nI started my career In the eighties with the creation of my first commercial games for the Commodore 64 and the Amiga. Those games were 'No', 'Iron Lord', 'Unreal' and 'Agony'.\nThe success of these products gave me the opportunity to start two game development companies, the first one was dedicated to coin-op game development and the second one was Appeal, the company that created Outcast.\nIn 2001, I embarked on a new adventure, Elsewhere Entertainment, a game development studio focused on innovations in game design and game production excellence. After several products, this was followed by the creation of AMA Studios, a Belgian game development company linked to Ubisoft and focused on motion gaming.\nI'm an engineer in computing from the Namur University and have been working in the field of real-time 3d graphics for more than 18 years. I was a programmer of the original Outcast team. I later worked as product line manager at NeuroTV where I developed a real-time 3d engine for broadcast applications. Recently, I worked at AMA Studios as a graphics programmer and I also teach at the Albert Jacquard University College in Namur since 2005.\nFrom 1993 to 1997, I started my career as a 2D/3D artist at Art&Magic on several sprite-based coin-op games, like 'Stone Ball', 'Western Shooting' and 'Cheese Chase'. From 1997 to 2002, I joined Appeal to work on Characters, animations, environments and concepts for Outcast and Outcast2. Then I joined 10Tacle Studio Belgium, working on projects like 'David Douillet Judo' (animations and motion capture) and 'Totems' (art direction). From 2008 to 2013 I worked at Softkinetic Studios (art director) on several gesture games, like 'Silhouette', 'DanceWall', 'Kickers FC', or 'Sorcerers' Apprentice' (product for the marketing campaign at the launch of the Walt Disney Pictures movie). After I joined AMA Studios as a freelance artist, to collaborate on the environments and Interface assets for the Game 'Fighter Within', published at end 2013 by Ubisoft. Since 2008 I'm also a teacher in the video-games group at the Albert Jacquard University College in Namur.\nI'm a technical character artist and animator. My main interests are video games, animation, technology and music.\n\nI have worked in the video games industry since 1995 when I began my career as a 3d artist at Art & Magic, an arcade games development studio. From 1999 to 2000, I worked on creating production pipelines, I improved my skills in animation and character modeling at Neuroplanet, a 3D animation studio. From 2001 I became lead animator at Appeal, where I worked on the unpublished Outcast II project. Thereafter, I worked as a freelance on several productions as technical artist and animator. I worked with companies such as Liquid Entertainment, Fresh3D, AMA Studios and various Belgian animation studios. Since 2003, I'm a part-time teacher at the Albert Jacquard University College in Namur, where I teach rigging and animation at the video games group.\nWith a passion for drawing, comics, and video games since a very young age, it was quite natural for me to embrace an artistic career. When 3D modeling software became available on PCs in the mid-nineties, I was hooked for life. I started in the industry as a 3D artist, but quickly specialized in character sculpting and texturing. I now have about 15 years of experience in the game industry. I worked for studios in Belgium (Appeal, AMA Studios/Daoka), US (Liquid Development), Australia (Krome Studios), and UK (Microsoft), on IPs like Starwars, Outcast, Hellboy, Dungeon and Dragons, Guildwars, to name a few. I have recently worked on the XBox One game Fighter Within as lead character Artist, responsible of the production pipeline (Art and Tech) and the management of the team. I like to share my passion as instructor at the Albert Jacquard University College in Namur.\nI started my carrier by developing in C, C++, Java and Actionscript for industrial and financial projects and also worked for several web agencies, for about 10 years.\nDuring that time, I never dropped my passion which was, since when I was a kid, modeling with various packages.\nAround 2002, I jumped into 3D starting with architectural work. Later on I joined Liquid Development, then moved onto European production companies.\nSince then, I've been production supervisor, lead modeling and/or texturing, and senior lighting artist on Animation and Games projects.\nNow I live thoroughly from my initial passion, and probably won't ever drop it, even more now with Outcast being the project I've been patiently waiting to work on, since the first realease, in 1999.\nMy favourite quote is one from Sir Chaplin : 'Stubbornness is the road to success'\nI'm a programmer at Fresh3d since 2004. I'm an engineer with strong C++ and low level programming background. I have a solid working experience with parallel processing, graphics APIs, shader development and have solid foundations in 3d math, algorithms and modern computing fundamentals. I've had the opportunity to work on many different platforms such as PS2 (Vector Units), PSP (VFPU), PS3 (SPUs), VITA, Xbox360, XboxOne and PC. I have also a strong experience in code performance analysis and optimization for both speed and memory usage.\nIt's been my experience that the world needs just a little more fun and I'm having a blast being one of the people trying to fill that need. I was part of the original Outcast team where I designed quests and wrote dialogues for the game.\nI'm graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a BA in Pre-production and Cinematography. I'm also graduated from the Digipen Institute of Technology with a AA in Video Game Design and Programming.\nI now specialize on meta-game concepts and usability.\nFor over 25 years, I've been a composer, orchestrator and arranger of music for videogames, commercials, film, and television. My credits include Fighter Within, Red Orchestra 2: Rising Storm, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Kinect Disneyland Adventures, Halo Combat Evolved 10th Anniversary, The Walking Dead Motion Comic, Watchmen Motion Comic, MTG: Duels of the Planeswalkers, Dirty Harry, Dragonshard, War of the Ring, and of course Outcast.\n\nI've also developed and taught courses in Composing for Video Games at USC, UCLA Extension, and developed the first accredited degree program for Game Audio and Interactive Media at Pinnacle College.\nDelivery timeline\nThe expected release time frame for the initial goal (Windows PC) is late 2015. Other releases will follow (if stretch goals are reach) depending on digital stores policies. We will do our best to ship as fast as possible on all platforms and will announce updated release schedule during development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe usual main risks in games development are to go over budget, miss deadlines, ship unfinished/bugged products or even sometimes go bust before the game's release. Often, these go in pair with immature technology, bad design, bad management and intense publisher pressure.\n\nBy doing a reboot of an existing game (one that we know very well), we pretty much remove (by definition) some of the design risk.\n\nAs we are going indie, we don\u2019t have artificial deadlines arbitrarily fixed by a publisher. We will ship the game when we think it\u2019s ready. We will make sure the game is polished, bug-free and meets the backers\u2019 expectations.\n\nStill, nothing is entirely risk-free. One could still go over budget, and that is a significant risk. Also, unexpected problems or difficulties could arise and that can cause delays.\n \nTo mitigate these risks, we rely on mature technologies and we work with a world-class team of experienced programmers, designers and graphic artists that have worked on, and shipped, many games (including launch titles), on many platforms, worldwide.\n\nDepending on the stretch goals, we might need to deliver the game on several platforms, each with specific constraints and limitation and that can introduce some delay in the delivery.

A humble, young blacksmith loses everything to war. As he tries to fulfill the dying wish of his father, Fate drags him into the thick of a conspiracy to save a kidnapped king and stop a bloody conflict. You will wander the world, fighting as a knight, lurking in the shadows as a rogue, or using the bard\u2019s charm to persuade people to your cause. You will dive deep into a sweeping, epic, nonlinear story from Daniel V\u00e1vra, an award-winning designer from the Mafia series. Our unique, first-person combat system lets you wield sword or bow in both one-on-one skirmishes and large-scale battles. All of this - and more - brought to life beautifully with next-gen visuals delivered via Cryengine.\nSummary\nPlanned platforms: PC, Xbox One*, PS4*, Mac, Linux\nRelease date: Q4,  2015 on PC, Mac and Linux\nApprox. gameplay time: 30 hours (Act 1), 70+ hours (all 3 acts)\n* Publishing on closed platforms is subject to approval by the platform holder. This can also influence release date there.\n\nNon-linear story lets you choose between being a villain or a savior. Every quest can be solved in multiple ways.\nA revolutionary combat system based on inverse kinematics, the only one of its kind to offer a rich, authentic yet easy-to-control, first-person melee experience. Based on actual 15th century fighting techniques and designed in cooperation with medieval martial arts experts.\nImprove your character. Different play styles - warrior, rogue or bard - can be mixed and matched as you see fit. You can develop your skills, earn new perks, and fine-tune your equipment.\nLarge realistic, medieval-themed, open world landscape covering 3.5 square miles and 30 hours of gameplay (in first act, out of 3 total).\nLead the charge in enormous, open field battles and sieges. You are no superhero. If you\u2019re going to take on an army of enemies, you better find one of your own to back you up.\nTake a trip through the Middle Ages: Traverse sprawling cities, magnificent castles, towering, dark forests, and muck-strewn villages.\nDiscover this huge world from horseback or on foot. If you can see it, you can visit it.\nA dynamic world comes alive. Every inhabitant plays a role in their communities, and as night follows day, you can watch people work, help them when needed, or try to interfere in their routine and see what happens.\nBuild relationships with characters, become a criminal or a local hero, seduce local women, threaten your enemies or pardon vanquished opponents.\nCreate your own weapons, cook, brew up potions, or dig around for silver. All crafting occurs in-game, using clever mini-games, rather than boring, soulless menus.\nYou will not find any dragons, half-naked Elven warriors, or wizards in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. At no point will you have to collect seven pieces of a legendary magic staff to defeat an ancient evil bent on destroying the world with an army of demons. We think there are enough such games out there.\nWe want to bring you a strong story rooted in the height of the Middle Ages, brought to life in all its glory. So what is Kingdom Come: Deliverance? Think of it as Braveheart: The Game. Majestic castles, armored knights, large, open field battles, and political intrigue set in a vast, emergent world. We want to make the experience as authentic as possible \u2013 real-world locations, real castles that don\u2019t look like something from Disneyland, period-accurate armors and costumes, combat and fencing systems designed in collaboration with the most knowledgeable, skillful swordsmen around, and a story based on actual, historic events.\nAll this, on a foundation built capably upon the solid game mechanics of a true, hardcore RPG \u2013 nonlinear quests with multiple solutions, branching dialogue choices with points of no return, several roles to play (warrior, bard, thief), a mountain of different stats, skills, perks, and ultimate character customization details (including 4 layers of clothing and armor in 16 equippable slots), as well as alchemy and crafting professions, the need to sleep and eat to stay healthy\u2026even food that goes bad if it sits in your inventory for too long!\nWe\u2019re mixing the freedom and mechanics of Skyrim, the setting of Mount and Blade, the storytelling styles of The Witcher and Red Dead Redemption, and the tough combat dynamics of Dark Souls into a single, gorgeous package. You could say we\u2019d like to give ArmA (a franchise many of us worked on) an RPG makeover, streamlining the systems and controls and polishing the overarching world while keeping the unique, genuine feeling of its action and environments. Interested?\nOur tale is based on historical events and takes place in 15th century Europe.\nThe year is 1403, and it is most certainly not the best of times. The old king is dead and his heir is weak. The new king\u2019s brother, hungry for power allies himself with a faction of the nobility that sees this moment as an opportunity for advancement, kidnaps the king, invading the country with an army of his own to plunder this defenseless land. The aristocracy is divided between which side to support. Civil war is coming...\nThe hero\nIn the midst of this plunder and chaos, a son of a blacksmith will emerge as a hero. His home destroyed and his family murdered by the invading army, he must redeem his failure to protect those he loved and set things right again. Avenging the dead, safeguarding the kingdom\u2019s rightful ruler, and restoring order will prove no small feat for our adventurer. But beware - this is not a fantasy fairytale, and you are not the chosen one! This will be a tough, dirty job that only a champion with enough wits and strength will survive.\nFreedom of choice\nYour character is defined by your choices. Your abilities and stats grow depending on what you do. You decide how you want to appear. Every quest can be solved in multiple ways. Branched dialogue trees grant you the freedom to express yourself. Your reputation is based on your choices, and every choice you make carries appropriate consequences. There are no class restrictions, you can do anything you want to.\nStand tall as a brave knight in powerful armor, going it alone or finding allies to lead into battle. Complete quests with brute force. Intimidate and threaten your enemies. Be confident, arrogant, or righteous.\nSneak behind enemy lines as an invisible thief and assassinate the enemy. Stab. Snipe. Strangle from behind. Resolve difficult situations as an invisible phantom, stealing important evidence and threatening people to get information.\nWin hearts as a popular bard, persuading nobles with your silver tongue and convincing them to fight one another. Use your wits rather than your muscles to get the job done. Share drinks with people, be the funny guy everyone likes\u2026 and then stab your rivals in the back when they least expect it.\nWe\u2019re not trying to create the biggest game ever; we want to concentrate on quality rather than quantity. Instead of 200 generic dungeons, we\u2019d like to focus on just a few, crafting each one as something unique, memorable, and special. Our world is large, but again, the focus is on creating a natural, organic space, not one so overpopulated (find out more about this in our blog, here). The same philosophy applies to quests. We don\u2019t want to inundate players with an insane amount of quests, but rather ensure that those we have are rich in detail, with multiple solutions (including non-violent approaches, where appropriate) suiting different play styles and making an impact on the world.\nDeath to the tired clich\u00e9s!\nSick of killing rats in the basement? Or being treated like a messenger, transporting stuff from point A to point B? So are we! That\u2019s why our quests are different. Play as a medieval investigator searching for a mass murderer, lay siege to a bandit fort with an army at your back, experience epic battles between armored knights, interrogate, bribe, threaten, love, help, fight\u2026 It\u2019s up to you to decide what to do. There are multiple ways to finish every quest - use your sword, quick fingers, or your wit.\nBranching dialogue\nConversation is an integral aspect of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, just as important as combat and just as difficult. It isn\u2019t possible to absent-mindedly click through every dialogue option. Your time to make decisions is limited, your choices affect your relationships with others, and you cannot take back what you say. Just like in real life, you have to think carefully about what you say to whom.\nSkill-based mini-games\nAlmost everything that can be turned into a game will be playable \u2013 and that extends to crafting, as well. Blacksmithing doesn\u2019t happen in menus but rather with a hammer at a forge. These mini-games are skill-based and affected by the player\u2019s stats. You\u2019ll be able to forge, sharpen, and repair weapons, create potions and ointments through alchemy, pick locks and pockets, distill alcohol, and prepare food.\nFreedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want\nThe exploration of the world is free. If you don\u2019t want to play the main quest line, it will \u201cwait\u201d for you, and you can go about exploring the world and doing other stuff \u2013 side quests, random events, hunting, crafting, small side stories, and much more. A giant world based on beautiful, real-world locations\nCryengine allows us to quickly create huge areas of landscape. The world covers approx. 9 sq km2 (3.5 sq. miles), with a sprawling city, vast forests, majestic castles, and dozens of villages and hamlets devastated by war. Of course, there will also be underground locations to discover, like mines, secret passages, and catacombs.\nEmergent Gameplay\nOur world is a living, breathing, and COMPLEX ecosystem, ready to be toyed with. Everything happens for a reason, every character has his/her daily routine, and every routine can be affected by the player. Characters are able to react properly to all player actions and adjust their routines to them.\nAdvanced reputation and law system\nThe world will organically react to your deeds. NPCs will report your crimes to authorities, who will punish you for your crimes accordingly, either with a fine, time in jail, or by subjecting you to the stocks or torture. Crime will affect economics and NPC behavior; people will get suspicious or aggressive after unresolved crimes. Your reputation will spread by word of mouth.\nCreating intriguing, enjoyable, first-person melee combat systems has been a real challenge for developers. It's hard to mix easy, intuitive controls with a first-person view and sufficient variety of moves. Many have tried and failed.\nOur combat mechanics are the most challenging feature of our game. They\u2019re based on actual 15th century techniques and designed in cooperation with medieval martial arts experts to be as authentic as possible. The controls are as intuitive as in first-person shooters and, thanks to a few tricks, we have a large amount of different moves and combos. On top of that, the whole thing is based on real-time physics and inverse kinematics, so when you hit something, your hands and weapon, not just your target, react accordingly, which is something that was not possible on last-gen hardware.\nWeapons\nYou can specialize in different fighting styles and weapon classes and will constantly learn new moves and techniques, as well as unlock new weapons and armors. Every weapon has its own uses, pros, and cons. The sword is universal, but weak against plate armor; hammers are ideal against plate armor, but weak against sword; the longsword is strong, but slow, and cannot be used from horseback, etc.\nWe will have several weapon classes: swords, longswords, daggers, sabers, axes, hammers, shields, bows, and crossbows.\nBattles and castle sieges\nYou are no superhero - fighting multiple enemies at the same time is very difficult. It is often a good idea to have allies at your side (and, at times, a lot of them). Our goal is to have as many characters in fights as possible and to offer players big battles and castle sieges to take part in. Not many battles, mind you - more like one or two in the first act. For us, a battle is a climax, not a \u2018wow\u2019 moment that needs to happen every two minutes. The precise scope of these battles and the amount of characters on screen are still things we are evaluating \u2013 they are complicated feats to pull off even on next-gen hardware.\nHorses\nHorses are your primary means of transportation in our sprawling world, but you can fight from horseback, as well. War horses can be used as living weapons with special moves and attacks (strafing, running backwards, several different kicks, etc.). Horses also serve as a secondary inventory for the player. We\u2019ll have three types of horses in-game (courser, destrier, rouncey), and each offers different abilities, stats, skills, and perks. Your steed levels up on its own throughout the journey, and even comes with five slots for armor and attachments.\nWhat would a role-playing game be without character development and customization? Your character in Kingdom Come: Deliverance will have STATS (Strength, Speed, Agility, Vitality, and Speech), CONDITIONS (Stamina, Health, Hunger, and Sleep), SKILLS (Swordsmanship, Archery, Alchemy, and many others), and PERKS (special combat moves, crafting abilities, or varying advantages). Conditions change as you become injured, exhausted, etc. Stats and skills will increase when you use them. Perks can be unlocked or learned. Stats and conditions can be temporarily or permanently modified by alchemy. You must also eat and sleep - you need to keep your character alive, after all!\nCharacter customization\nThanks to our clothing system, you can create the ultimate armored knight. We have 20 slots for weapons, clothes, and attachments, as well as 4 layers of clothing or armor on every character. That\u2019s a lot of customization options! Different types of armor are effective against different weapons. Your clothes and their state affect your charisma and reputation, which, in turn, influence NPC reactions toward you. They also affect your visibility and the noise you produce, which affect your stealth skills.\nSince we are going to self-publish the game and are asking for the help of the community, we are also willing to give something back and develop the game with the community.\nWhat does it mean? In about 6 months, we will release an early build of the game, with one smaller location (village and a part of the countryside) where you will be able to test core mechanics of the game. We will start with the basic mechanics (interaction with the world, inventory, map, NPC cycles) and we will constantly update this build with new features as we progress with the development (dialogues, bows, hunting, crafting, combat, horses). This is the access to Alpha version of the game and it will be available to all tiers from the Baron onwards.\nWhen the game is in Beta stage, we will release the full game beta as Early Access on PC (or any other platform where it\u2019s going to be possible) for all backers up from the Knight Tier.\nOur backers can influence the development, help us improve the game, and give us feedback about our game mechanics.\nWe are using Cryengine to power our game. It\u2019s a powerful, out-of-the-box toolset that runs on all major platforms and allows us to concentrate on the game instead of technology. It's been used to create cutting-edge games like the Crysis trilogy and Ryse, as well as the crowd-funded project Star Citizen. Cryengine affords us with unparalleled macro and micro details, including unlimited viewing distance, HD textures on all objects, and a functional day/night cycle with varying weather patterns, all set in a vast, beautifully lit, seamless world, free of load times.\nOn top of that, we are developing our own proprietary RPG-MAKING TOOLS for easy development of this and any future content, including custom support for game design, animations, branching dialogue, clothing definitions, etc. We plan to release these tools to the modding community.\nWe plan to release the game on all major platforms: PC, Mac, Linux and next-gen consoles. You will be free to choose any platform the game will be released on as your reward. Regarding Early Access to the game, at the moment we can guarantee it only on PC, however we will do our best to make it available on as many other platforms as possible.\nAs a studio, Warhorse may be new to this industry, but the people behind it are not. Our team has worked on games like Mafia, Mafia 2, ArmA,  Operation Flashpoint, Crysis 3, and Forza Horizon, to name a few. Most of us have worked together in the past, so we know each other well. As of now, we have about thirty people on staff, which is, of course, not enough to make the kind of large RPG we have in mind in any timely fashion. Ideally, we\u2019d like to grow our studio to about 75 people for a project of this nature.\nMost of us have experience working on open world games (Mafia, Flashpoint), so we\u2019re already quite familiar with the typical challenges, roadblocks, and potential pitfalls that come with their development. We want to avoid the common mistakes that can bog down a project of this nature, and that starts with having a clear vision, detailed design, mature technology, efficient internal processes, and an experienced team.\n\nSpecifically, our plan asks for another 1,000 months of manpower, which means we need another 20 months to finish the game (this includes a six-month period for tuning and testing). We also believe that direct input from the community will help us a lot, allowing us to create an experience that people actually want to play, and we\u2019re currently devising ways to make transparent our development process to Kickstarter backers, as well as non-investors still interested in the final product.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn a little more about our attitude as a company and as game makers, we invite you to take a look at our blog. In addition, below you\u2019ll find a little information about some of our key team leaders:\nDan V\u00e1vra\nDirector and Design Lead for Mafia, Designer and Screen Writer for Mafia II. Over a decade of industry experience, starting as a 2D artist on 16-bit computers. Nominated for a Game Developers Choice Award for Excellence in Writing for Mafia. Mafia won Game of the Year and Best Screenplay awards in a number of countries and has an 89.5% score on GameRankings. Dan\u2019s games have sold more than 5 million copies combined. He also contributed to Hidden & Dangerous, among other projects.\nMartin Kl\u00edma\nThe author of fantasy pen-and-paper RPG Dragon's Lair. In 1997, Martin founded ALTAR Interactive as an Executive Producer. After releasing Fish Fillets in 1997, the studio created the real-time strategy game Original War three years later. Martin later moved to Codemasters in the UK to work on Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising.\nViktor Bocan\nDesigner and screenwriter of computer games for 17+ years. Started with self-published text games for Atari 800 and then he worked as a lead designer in Bohemia Interactive (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, OFP: Resistance). Later Viktor helped to produce ArmA, a spiritual successor of Operation Flashpoint, and then worked in 2K Czech on new, not yet announced title. In his spare time, Viktor creates games for 'smaller' platforms, including Nintendo DS, XBL, iOS, etc.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Blaho\nTomas was a Senior Graphics Programmer at Illusion Softworks (later 2K Czech), where he worked on multiple games, including Mafia 1 & Mafia 2 and Hidden & Dangerous 2. After finishing Top Spin 4 for 2K Czech, he moved on to Playground Games in the UK, working as Senior Graphics Programmer on Forza Horizon. He has a great deal of experience with development on non-PC platforms, having worked on Dreamcast, PS2, Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, and iOS.\nRoman Zawada\nOne of the most accomplished 3D artists in our country. Roman started at Bohemia Interactive working on Operation Flashpoint and later ArmA. He then moved to 2K Czech to work on Mafia 2, and later to Crytek to work on Crysis 3. His intimate knowledge of CryEngine is especially valuable to our current project.\nTo find out more about our team, you can visit us on Facebook or visit our web. You can also follow our YouTube channel.\n After seeing our trailer, you might ask: \u201cwhy are we here? This is a big, expensive game that\u2019s sure to cost a lot of money, right? Does no major publisher want it? This sounds suspicious.\u201d The answer to those questions might surprise you.\nWarhorse is a comparatively small studio. We now have about thirty people, and it took us more than eighteen months to develop what you've just seen. All this time, we\u2019ve been funded by a private investor, to the tune of almost 1.5 million dollars in total. We hope the product you\u2019ve seen reflects that.\nOur plan was to develop a prototype, pitch it to publishers, and finish development with the subsequent money. We tried to do it that way (and you can read about our experiences on our blog), but in essence, even though everybody we met commended our work, praised our game\u2019s visuals, and believed in our ability to deliver, negotiations would inevitably hit a dead end at the point where the publishers' marketing departments got involved. Why?\n\"Your game is too niche. There\u2019s no magic. People want wizards and dragons.\"\nWe beg to differ. The response from players has always been great. We think gamers like history \u2013 look at the success of Total War, Assassin's Creed, Mount and Blade, and Red Dead Redemption. There is no medieval first-person RPG out there, but it does not necessarily follow that nobody wants one - only that there is no easy box for marketing to pigeonhole it in.\nOur investor is strong and capable of funding the complete development of our project. But he does not follow the game industry very closely, and needs proof that publishers and marketers are wrong about our game - that you are indeed interested in a mature, medieval RPG that emphasizes freedom and authenticity. And so we stand, as a studio, at a crossroads. Either those naysayers are right, and there truly is no desire for the game we are making, or we are right. Either way, we think Kickstarter is a great way to find out.\nThe sum we are asking for is about ten percent of our total budget; for our investor, however, it is proof that there is real demand for the game, and that there is a point to keeping it funded. Every extra dollar will allow us to make the final product that much better because it means more money for development and more support from our investor.\nShould our Kickstarter campaign fail, it will mean that we were wrong, that there is no interest to play a game with the atmosphere of Braveheart, and that we will have to start considering working on some mobile MMO, because that's where the money is these days (or so everybody tells us). We are, however, positive that our instincts are right.\nSo help us to make our vision a reality. Help us to make not the 176th free-to-play mobile RPG MMO Elven village-builder with DIAMONDS\u2122, but to make the kind of unique, engaging experience we think you\u2019d like to play.\nForum access & badge: You will be able to post on our forums with your unique Kickstarter backer's badge.\nDigital copy of the game: You will be able to download and play a copy of Act I of our game.\nDigital manual, Soundtrack, Making-of video: You will get PDF copy of the game manual, complete game soundtrack in mp3, and permanent link for streaming video of our making-of documentary.\nBoxed copy of the game: You will receive your own copy of Act I in standard DVD box.\nDigipak copy of the game (w/soundtrack, making-of video and manual): You will receive your own copy of Act I in a nice digipak box. This box will also contain soundtrack CD and DVD with the making-of video, as well as a printed manual.\nCollector's edition box: This will be an exquisite collector's box edition that will take a place of pride in your collection.\nT-Shirt: CE will contain a T-shirt with Kingdom Come: Deliverance motifs.\nArt book: CE will contain a 100+ pages art book printed on quality stock paper, with artworks for the game.\nPoster/Signed poster: CE will contain a 24\" x 36\" full color poster of the game. In higher tiers this poster will be signed by members of the development team.\nDice: CE will contain a set for playing authentic medieval precursor to computer games.\nCommemorative coin: CE will contain unique coin with original design, stamped in limited quantity for our backers. In lower tiers, the coin will be made of brass; for higher levels, it will be made of sterling silver.\nAction figure: Your CE will include a quality die-cast 6\" action figure of Henry, Kingdom Come: Deliverance lead character.\nActs II & III: You will be able to download Act II or II & III of Kingdom Come: Deliverance if and when they are released. We assume that it will take us nine months to develop Act II and further nine months for Act III. Please note that we cannot guarantee developing these Acts; while it is our best intention to do so at this moment, circumstances beyond our control may force us to alter our plans.\nIn-game Calvary memorial (crucifix): The world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is dotted with small memorial crosses \u2013 small stone or wooden crucifixes on a stone plinth. The plinth carries an inscription that can include your name.\nIn-game Conciliatory cross: Similar to the Calvary memorial above, but smaller and less conspicuous. These crosses were usually put up on places where a crime has occurred, as a gesture of reconciliation. The cross will carry your name.\nIn-game Church painting: Every town or village in Kingdom Come: Deliverance will have a church, sometimes two. You face can appear in one of them as the face of a saint, or some other figure, on paintings inside.\nIn-game Statue: We shall create a statue of a saint of your choice and endow him or her with your likeness. The statue will be a prominent feature of one of the in-game churches.\nCopper engraving: This will be an original, numbered, 6\" x 8\" print made from copper plate in limited quantity. It will feature a motif from the game.\nAlpha access: You will in-effect become part of our development team, getting access to the earliest barely playable version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Your comments and observations will help to shape the game.\nBeta access: This is similar to Early access on Steam. We are hoping we will be able to use the Steam platform itself.\nSword: You will receive hand made, forged, one-handed sword. It will be sharpened and ready for battle. This is not a toy!\nShield: This will be hand-decorated shield adorned with coat-of-arms of a noble family related to the events within the game.\nGuided tour: We will treat you to a two day trip through the real-world locations that served as models for the places within the game. We shall have a professional archaeologist/historian to guide you and explain everything and you will be able to get to places that are normally off limits.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRPGs are big games with complex, layered mechanisms and components, perhaps more so than any other genre out there. They are definitely complicated to create, and there are many risks involved in their development. We\u2019ve tried to minimize those risks by selecting proven technology and assembling a strong team with proven experience shipping open world and AAA games.\n\nThe biggest risk for us would be falling behind schedule and releasing the game later than we planned. We\u2019ve constructed a carefully laid-out strategy to prevent such an outcome, complete with detailed game documentation, clearly defined milestones to achieve, etc. But video games require a great deal of R&D - especially ones that want to innovate - and no one can predict for all potential possibilities or problems during such a process. Production delays unfortunately happen all too often in our industry.\n\nOur most resource-intensive features are our combat and large-scale battle systems. These are mechanics we\u2019re implementing in ways in which few people on our staff have much direct, prior experience, and there are risks associated with that. We may run into implementation issues in executing those systems, requiring us to work around them.\n\nThe good thing for us is that we have strong financial backing, which greatly mitigates any chance that we will run out of money before completing our project, even if unexpected obstacles arise during development. Moreover, in the potential event we\u2019re forced by such time constraints to remove some features from the game in order to meet our release date and stay on-budget, we would most likely be able to include those features through a later patch or further acts of the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #77", "update_userinfo": "Modding Tools Released", "update_content": "Modding Tools Released\nYes, these are the tools, we used to create Henry's world!

You go through a journey of self discovery, of love, friendship, and inspiration, where you are introduced to Reggae music, you have to form your band, get inspiration, write and produce your songs and then perform them. The story consists of three parts each focusing on a different aspect of Bolt Riley\u2019s passage into becoming a Reggae legend.\nThis is the true story of the underdog who breaks out and becomes a worldwide sensation.\nBolt Riley performing for the first time in front of an audience\n\n The game features hand drawn 2D background artwork and hand drawn cel animation. It combines all the elements of a classic point and click adventure game and includes funny dialog puzzles, exploration, wacky inventory items, and of course, a rope. \nTrenchtown, Jamaica. Where it all begins.\nWe introduce a sort of second inventory, where Bolt can use special Inspirational powers he learned during his journeys. This is similar to how spells worked in the later Quest for Glory games, where you had a separate inventory for spells.\nWe also want the game to be fully voiced by professional voice actors like I have done in my previous game Pizza Morgana. More on that, later.\nThe hang out place of the Rude Boys gang.\nWe're thinking of a bunch of unique features, one example is cloud-save where you can have the ability to save your game on the cloud so that you can continue playing the game where you left it, no matter which platform you\u2019re playing on. Start on your PC, continue on you iPad, and finish it on your OUYA.\nThe game was built as independent chapters. Each with its own unique stand alone story, and serve as sequels to one another. Right now we have Chapter 1 in a playable Alpha, while Chapters 2 and 3 are almost fully designed and partially drawn, animated and coded.Backers will get all the chapters of the game that will be made with the campaign's money.\n The game is made with the amazing Unity engine and will be available on any platform we can export it to, like I have done with my previous game Star Shipping Inc.\nGame availability depends on the final sum we will raise. The basic funding goal will let us start with the desktop versions (PC/Mac/Linux) of Chapter 1, as desktop is the easiest to develop for, without spending too many resources on platform optimizations, and soon after we will add OUYA as part of the Free The Games Fund which we applied to, so we can increase our budget and make a better game, all in exchange for an exclusivity period. All money received from the Free the Games fund will go directly into reaching stretch goals.\nAfterwards, we hope to get this game to any additional platform we can: Steam, Humble store, iOS, Android, Windows 8 store and Windows phone 8, Amazon Kindle, Gamestick, Shield, Gamepop, and maybe even nextgen consoles. We want you to play the game wherever it's most convenient to you, and we want to make this game available on each and every platform Unity supports. \nA 2D point and click adventure game Oculus Rift? Sure! If the guys from City Quest can do it, we can try too.\nDouble Our Fun(ds)! \nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone!

The team is composed of Israel\u2019s best and brightest, including top of their class graduates from Israel\u2019s best school for visual arts, programmers from an elite unit in Israel\u2019s intelligence corps called 8200, and legendary game designers.\nMembers of our team have made several independent games by themselves, and we also created several games for various clients. Here are a few examples of our work: \nGames we worked on.\nYou can check them out here: Cocktail run, Comfy, Pizza Morgana, Knights in Shining Armor, and Star Shipping Inc. \nWe were also involved in a few other games that also had Kickstarter campaigns: Freshbiz, Nancy Drew, and Leisure Suit Larry (you can check out old posts at our Facebook Fan Page)\nAdventure Mob circa July 2012 (Part of the team)\n  You can find a full credit list on everyone who ever worked on the game here\nOded Sharon, Founder, CEO, and Game Director/Producer\nI've been making games ever since I got my first Apple ][ computer when I was 6 years old. I wrote an entire text adventure game in Basic at the age of 10. I've been working in the industry since 1999 and indie adventure games are my favorite kind of games, even though I have made dozens of games from different genres as well.\nI\u2019m a big geek with tons of interests and hobbies that include music, photography, cooking, flying airplanes and shooting fireworks.\nI started a Facebook group called Fellowship of GDC Parties that helps connect people who go to game developers conferences like GDC, Gamescom and E3. I also volunteer at the International game developers association (IGDA) and ran the Israeli chapter for a few years and love to contribute to the community.\nI am a true believer in crowdfunding as the way of the future and have been involved in over a dozen campaigns and ran a few of my own, like the one that recently got me over to E3. I've also been doing crowdfunding before that word was even invented, through my website \"Buy a Car for Ron Gilbert\".\nOran Bar-Tal, Producer and Art Director\nOran specializes in animation with 5 years of experience in producing projects and computer games. After working in television, web and even biotechnological 3D simulations, Oran\u2019s main passion for games brought him to Adventure Mob in hope to create a successful world class gaming company in Israel.\nOran holds a B.ed.des in visual communication degree (with honor)\nLori and Corey Cole, Game Designers\nLori and Corey Cole have been making and playing games for... let's just say, \"forever\". \nAt Sierra On-Line, they created one of the first hybrid graphic adventure/role-playing games. The award-winning Quest for Glory was one of Sierra's most successful game series. Corey's Castle of Dr. Brain puzzle adventure game was another top-selling, critically-acclaimed game that spawned a successful series. Exactly one year ago, they have successfully raised over $400k for Hero-U, and now return to Kickstarter with Bolt Riley.\nThe Coles designed the second chapter of Bolt Riley, in which Bolt has to assemble his band, get instruments, and find the inspiration for his songs, and took an important role in designing the entire game.\nCorey and Lori Cole with Oded Sharon\nMusic  \nWe're still talking to a bunch of musicians to collaborate with on the score for Bolt Riley. One of them is Omri Lahav.   \nOmri Lahav is an accomplished composer for video games - including the award winning, open-source \"0 A.D.\", as the Music department lead for Wildfire Games and countless other titles, Having produced and played guitar, bass, keyboards and percussion in several reggae projects, he aspires to create the ultimate reggae masterpiece for Bolt Riley! http://omrilahav.com\n\nHere are three tracks he composed for Bolt RIley:\nVoice Actors\nRight now, we are talking to several voice actors who auditioned for different roles, one choice we still have is whether to make this a union (SAG/AFTRA) project which means all the actors has to be union, higher salaries for actors- but more well known and experienced actors, or make a non union project, which will allow us to allocate those resources to other aspects of the game, like it\u2019s soundtrack, art, design, or code. I don't want to hire someone just for their name, but instead someone who can really portray the characters according to our vision.\nOne actor we're talking to is Anthony Sardinha who is well known for his of Bwana on the adventure game The Journey Down\nA bit more about Anthony: \nAnthony Sardinha is a Toronto Based voice actor with almost 10 years of experience under his belt. Lending his voice to many Video games, Cartoons, Films, Corporate videos, Radio commercials, Documentaries, Web-Based animations and games, working with producers and directors all across the world from places like Australia, Sweden, Germany, Israel & Brazil. You can hear him as the lead voice of \"Bwana\" in Skygoblin's \"The Journey Down\", as well as many others on his website antfish.webs.com.\nI am going to use many of my connections in Hollywood as I am friends with a bunch of talented actors who I plan to ask to voice the game for the best results. \nAs you can see I've worked with some in my previous games.\nYou can snoop through my Facebook albums to see pictures of some people I met and know... But... I hate name dropping... (Actually, no I don't!) \nOne Album. Another Album.\nI'm hoping to be able to make some announcements during the campaign.\nBolt Riley and his band backstage preparing for their first big show.\n(or: what makes a good adventure game?)\nThe question of what makes a good adventure game cannot be simply answered or even at all. Everyone has their own opinions and tastes when it comes to any type of content. \nHowever, we think that there are a few factors that unite most quality creations - Story, Game design, Art, Technical, Music and Voices and community.\nHere's our vision of how we tackle all of these\nWe think that every good game needs to start with good game design, and in adventure games the story is as important. Our story is compelling, deep and well written, and it contains twists and character progressions. Excitement, Conflict, Friendship, Love, Peace, Inspiration and Humor are only a few emotions we tried to convey when writing the story for Bolt Riley's adventure in 70's Jamaica. Working with Lori and Corey Cole on Game Design has been an enlightening experience. The puzzle design and integration with the story go hand by hand, and brings you back to the golden era of adventure game playing where you had to think.\nWe believe that the visual look of an adventure game is very important. We've spared no expense when it comes to the way the game looks. We have stunningly beautiful  hand drawn backgrounds, some of which you can see here. We also drew thousands of cel animation frames for all the 2D character animations. We use modern techniques and tools provided by Unity 3D to create closeups, parallax, visual effects and give you a more cinematic experience while remaining true to being a 2D game.\nSound is important in any game, but in this game, telling the story of a Reggae musician, we think music is way more important than in other games. We don\u2019t want to just use library music, instead we want incorporate original soundtracks both enabling us to create a score that fits the atmosphere of the game and adds to its dramatic effect, and also be able to help some independent musicians along the way.\nWe know that voices done properly with professional actors create an unforgettable experience, and we want to have the best we can for this game, while still on budget.\nThe technical aspects of the game are really important to us. We want the game to be robust, with minimal amount of bugs, and be advanced technically, for example the ability to cloud-save your game so you can continue playing the game where you left it, no matter which platform you\u2019re playing on. Start on your PC, continue on you iPad, and finish it on your OUYA.\nIt\u2019s needless to say that the reason anyone is making a game is for people to play it. Without you, the players, the game has no meaning. We want you to like and enjoy the game and want to give you the best experience while playing it, thus we want to be heavily involved with the community when developing the game and of course its future installments. Especially since you will be part of the game, helping it to see the day of light.\n\nBolt with his best friend Smokey and Girlfriend Thelma in front of the old man's house.\n\n  Anything we get over the basic funding goal (including late backing, pre-orders, or Free the Game Funds) will go toward our stretch goals.\n\n$120,000 - Bolt Riley lives! Backers will receive Chapter One when it gets released on initial platforms (PC/Mac/Linux/OUYA).\n$250,000 - More Stuff!  We will add more availability platforms and features according to suggestions and feedback from backers.\n$500,000 - More Game! We will go into details if we get close to this amount. \n\nWe want to hear your thoughts as to what would be the best thing to have as more features and what's more important to you as there are plenty of options and ideas, for example:: EFIGS subtitles, new platforms (iOS/Android), more gameplay, better soundtrack, director's commentary, cloud savegames, and more stuff to be given to backers as rewards...\n\nBut let's not get carried away. First, we need to achieve our initial funding goal...\n\n  What do we need the money for? \n\nYou've heard it before: Making a game is expensive. A lot of people ask me: \u201cSo, how expensive is it to make a game\u201d, to which I usually answer back with another question: \u201cHow expensive is it to buy a car?\u201d.  There\u2019s a huge difference between a pre-owned old car and a new Mercedes Benz. So we chose a target budget for this game considering the production values we thought the game should have.\n\nWe managed to fund raise $320k from angel investors in the past for Adventure Mob which were used to create the alpha of the game, as well as design and partially code two more chapters.\n\nWhy Kickstarter? \n\nUnfortunately, our original estimated target budget for the game required to finish the first chapter was around $450k, and we couldn't secure all the funds we needed from private investors. We were hoping to get some profits from other projects we were working on, but that never happened.\nWe went around and met a bunch of publishers over the past year, and got the common response publishers usually give us: \u201cThe game looks great! Talk to us again when it\u2019s done and we\u2019ll distribute it for you.\u201d\nIn the past two years, because of some successes and despite some failures, Kickstarter is the most prominent way for adventure games to get funded and made.\nI have been involved with several campaigns, both large and small, and I've backed over 130 different projects myself. I\u2019m a true believer in the power of crowdfunding and think that this is the way to go as far as fundraising to make adventure games, and I plan on Kicking It Forward: http://kickingitforward.org\n\nIt\u2019s also a great way to know if there\u2019s true interest by people to play the game, and this campaign will prove whether Bolt Riley will see the day of light or get canned and never released.\n\n\n\nSome of the many characters from the game\n\nOther than pledging, we could use your help in the success of the campaign.\nYou can start by telling your friends about it, share, tweet, post, like, comment, instagram, tumblr, tube, pinterest, or just get on stage with a microphone and sing a song about the campaign. Anything and everything counts, even if it\u2019s something little. In order for the campaign to succeed, dozens of thousands of people would have to hear about it, and we need your help to reach them.\n\nBe active! Ask questions, share your ideas with us, tell us your thoughts, and let us hear your feedback. We\u2019ll be very happy to answer everything.\nHave fun!  It\u2019s very important to have fun. Especially in times of struggle. We do this game because we think it\u2019s fun to make games and tell good stories, and we want you to have fun too. If we can help you have fun, then we\u2019ll be happy too.\n\nIf you like analyzing data you can track the campaign's progress with KickTraq:\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BoltRiley\n\nFollow on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/BoltRiley\n  Remember, only you can help make this game a reality. So, we hope you'll be generous and help us make this dream come true.\nOded Sharon, \nAnd the entire Adventure Mob and the Bolt Riley team.\nBolt Riley's house", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn every project there are risks deriving from unknowns and uncertainties. \n\nLuckily, Bolt Riley has a few big advantages that give it better chances.\n\nAs we said before in \"What makes a good adventure game\", we're very fortunate to have great people working on this game, with lots of experience making adventure games in the past.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the game is already in alpha stage, and just needs the final push to polish and finish it. \n\nOf course we will have to deal with multiple challenges including business challenges like music licensing, production challenges like finding the perfect voice actors, and technical challenges like adapting a game that was made for Unity 3.0 to Unity 4.2 (or whatever is available) and making it a true cross platform experience.\n\nWe also want to get your feedback during the beta. So we will listen to it and make changes accordingly, if we can, hopefully it will bring us to having a better game, rather than just having a game that's released on the estimated delivery date.\n\nIn any case, we will keep you guys involved and strive to bring you the best adventure game we can produce with whatever funding we manage to raise with your help.\n\nThanks for reading the very last line on the campaign's page!\nhttp://bolt-riley.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Oded Sharon\n3 created \u00b7 327 backed\nI'm Oded Sharon, CEO of Adventure Mob.

If you pledge right now, you\u2019ll get a DRM free copy of SCALE and a Steam key! We\u2019re aiming to make SCALE triple-A quality\u2026 no, quintuple-A quality! But when it\u2019s done, we\u2019ll probably charge a quadruple-A price. Pledging or pre-ordering now is the surest way to get the game at its lowest price for the foreseeable future.\nAre you the type of gamer who just types WASD over and over to the exclusion of all the other awesome keys? Well no longer! Steve also made a game that uses EVERY KEY! Every key! That's right the fun and the inputting never stop because they are the same thing in Inputting-- the game! You can get it packaged together with SCALE for just $15!\nSold out!\nUsing the power of friendship, we condensed five tremendous games into a single value pack! For just $20, you'll get a DRM-free copy of SCALE on MAC, PC, and Linux. You'll also recieve four additional amazing games donated by super-group Friends of Scale: OSMOS, Incredipede, Electronic Super Joy, Noitu Love 2, and Inputting! Like friendship itself, this offer is limited!\nDo you like tunes? And jamming to them? We want to help! The SCALE OST is going to sound amazing! Did you look at the musicians involved!? Did you see them!?? Did you?!! Scroll down and look at them and then come back down here when you\u2019re calm. Yeah, it\u2019s out of control. This album is going to be like sunshine-- hot, sparkling, and DRM free! Pledge now and you'll also get SCALE's OST as a digital download.\nA lot of great musicians have approached us with ideas and work for SCALE, so many that we won\u2019t be able to fit them all in the game. But we love them and want to do anything for them because their music is so good! Thus we have no choice but to release a second ALL AWESOME companion album, so called in the music industry because ALL THE TRACKS WILL BE AWESOME and there may be some risk of you bopping until you drop/can\u2019t stop, etc.\nOnce we feel SCALE is ready for a limited audience, but not quite ready for prime time, we\u2019ll release it to a limited audience. You can be among that select number and your feedback will help shape the final game! Watch as friends and enemies burn with jealous rage as you shrink and enlarge stuff before anybody else in the (SCALE) universe!\nMost concept art for games is buried deep underground with the artist once the game launches to ensure an auspicious reception for the title in heaven. But SCALE is different! We\u2019ve promised all the talented artists involved that they will escape with their lives. And what\u2019s more, we want to pick through the vast pile of amazing art littering the floor of their forbidden temple and put it into a big book! This transcendent volume will feature, among other items, sick sketches, storyboards, mockups, and renders from SCALE\u2019s development, all for your perusal as a high quality PDF download!\n Before SCALE is ready for a limited Beta audience, we\u2019ll be doing Alpha testing, so called because it is the leader of the pack of all testing! If you\u2019d like to see the game before anyone else and give us feedback, pledge in a tier with Alpha access, and you\u2019ll get an extra-first look at SCALE as we\u2019re putting it together! This may be the only place in which you will be able to glimpse the creative team\u2019s true forms as they flicker in and out of existence briefly during the strenuous act of creating something from nothing.\nContrary to what the internet advises, you can\u2019t go naked all the time. You just can\u2019t. These tees, intended to cover and accentuate the chest and the top of the arms, are designed by Mr. Swink himself, with designs printed on tasteful grey, red, green, or blue cloth. Once this shirt arrives, place it on any part of your body and move about through the world to collect \u201cmad props\u201d, \u201cinstant respect\u201d, and fistbumps ad libitum. Transformation into a marmalade tabby is rare. After several weeks of wear, you will probably turn into some other sort of cat. \nPart of what we love about SCALE is it\u2019s potential for wild and abstract visuals made from the distorted hash of everyday objects like flowers, houses, cars, trees and even the landscape itself. It\u2019s already made for some fantastic and unique art. So we\u2019re really excited about putting together a series of slick posters! We don\u2019t have a final designs to show you yet, but we\u2019re planning on at least 5 of them. (One of our cat interns whipped up the prototype above). But rest assured, we will not feed our cats until they forge the finest print ever seen in their secret workshop underneath the stairs\nFor those of you who left a part of their heart in the 90s, we have just the thing: the SCALE OST in CD form. Glimmering sides caparisoned in delicately wrapped custom-designed packaging, this item will provide great comfort to those whom, when they listen to music, want to know that somewhere, somehow, there is a disk silently spinning.\nIf you are someone who enjoys existing in physical space and possessing objects likewise endowed with tangible properties, this is the reward for you! The Scale Meatspace Masterpiece Possession Form of SCALE includes a custom designed physical box for the game (artist and final design TBA), the game on disc, an instruction manual full of unique content/dubious advice, and a CD copy of the OST. All items possessed of mass and composed entirely of matter!\nWe\u2019re gonna\u2019 cut the SCALE OST and the ALL AWESOME COMPANION Albums to a pair of Vinyl discs housed in beautifully designed dust jackets. Why? Because we like vinyl\u2019s charm and warm sound. Those who obtain such an item should be prepared to instantly become cool(er?) and stay that way for the rest of their life.\nWhen the apocalypse comes and all your buds are vainly thumbing the blank screens of their uncharged mobile devices, won\u2019t you be glad you opted for the SCALE Masterpiece Meatspace Artbook with analog-style pages? In this volume, we will collect all the goodness of the digital artbook, wrapped up in retro physical form, amazing cover design, and custom packaging. Once it arrives, place it on a coffee table or bookshelf to seduce anyone instantly!\nSteve is a game design instructor who has experience helping game designers refine and scope their ideas into manageable, fulfilling projects. If you select this reward, he\u2019ll work with you to hone your idea into the best possible game it can be, and playtest, and offer feedback. Includes a trip to get ice cream. Not valid at participating locations offer void if coupons vouchers.\nAs Penny progresses through a universe she has skewed seemingly beyond all repair, her inherent curiosity compels her to collect all the subatomic particles that now drift as big as life through the detritus such as tachyons, fermions, muons, quarks, inflatons,and even those that have yet to be discovered like the benbernankion, the orgon, and the emoticon. If you pledge at a tier that includes a particle, tell us what you\u2019d like to see, and we\u2019ll craft it for you into a classy model.\nPenny is confined in a miniprison, carefully SCALEd and crafted by the Poetic Justice System so that her punishment fits her crime. Just like PJS, we will uniquely craft a miniprison of your very own, complete with advertisements for popular near-future prison contractors such as Nev-R eScape Therapy Cell and EZ Kwik & Accurate Memory Trappers, LLC. This item sits nicely on any desk, table, or secret shrine behind the bookcase.\nCertain recently resurrected species of the Silurian period have been genetically enhanced to provide the ultimate in prisoner rehabilitation. These brain parasites work with their host to overcome and correct a wide array of antisocial tendencies and mental difficulties. But to those on the straight and narrow, they just make great hats. If you feel you are virtuous enough, consider sporting a lovingly crafted Silurian Brain Parasite Hat.\nThe SCALE device streams the \u201cSCALE-ness\u201d or \u201cSize Juice\u201d out of one thing and into another allowing the user to really mess up the universe big time. We are planning five different versions of THE DEVICE for usage in game, each more refined and magnificent than the last, especially because the first one is basically whatever Penny could build out of the garbage on hand in her mini-prison. They get cooler though. If this is your chosen reward, you will receive one (1) Hollywood prop quality version of the in-game SCALE device, for you to use on your very own quest to discover the ultimate nature of matter.\nThis would be the perfect opportunity to make a joke about how the quality of the game will SCALE up to match your contribution (huh? get it? get it?) but that\u2019s really not the case. We don\u2019t believe in holding mechanics, levels, or key features ransom behind ludicrous stretch goals. We\u2019ll be able to make a great game if we hit our initial funding target, and if we make it, you won\u2019t have to settle for \u00bd the systems you got excited about when reading about our project.\nBut there are some things we\u2019d like extra money to do, and we do think that they\u2019ll make the process of making the game swifter and easier.\n100K - Oculus Rift support\nDue to how we\u2019re making the game, it should be pretty easy for us to add support for the Oculus Rift, which is why Oculus support is our first and lowest Stretch Goal.\n125K - Unlock Dale\u2019s SCALE custom companion comic\nDale\u2019s writing the game by using up the last jot of love and passion in an otherwise cold and robotic heart. But with some extra money we could activate his for-profit subroutine and tap into a rich dark vein of wild SCALE-themed comics undreamt of in this modern age. Dale experts tell us it\u2019s dark magic would create a special companion comic for the game that would go with you wherever you went.\n150K - Hire Additional 3D Artist\nAn additional 3D artist means we\u2019ll not only be able to have more art in the game, but we\u2019ll be able to have better art, as there will be more time refine for the artists to refine their work.\n175K - Level Editor\nWith a level editor, you\u2019ll be able to build the worlds you\u2019ve always dreamed of, and then make them really, really big or really, really tiny and watch your friends play them. However, you\u2019ll need to supply your own Zoolander style \u201cwhat is this, a _____ for ANTS?!?!\u201d jokes.\nOfficially, we call our company CubeHeart, a Voltron-like flesh monstrosity of game development talent, lead by Steve \"I'll form the head\" Swink for the purpose of making SCALE a good video game that humans will enjoy. Steve is SCALE\u2019s designer and principal developer, and he has made a bunch of other great games, taught game development course, and even written a book. You can learn more about that by checking out the biography section in the sidebar.\nCubeHeart's other robo-parts include:\nDale Beran, Writer (A Lesson is Learned but the Damage is Irreversible, The Nerds of Paradise):\nDale forms CubeHeart's writing core located in a jaunty robotic hat and is responsible for SCALE's excellent story, dialog, and world building.\nEddy Boxerman, Physics Ninja (Osmos): Eddy is our physics guru extraordinaire, and forms CubeHeart's adamantium skeleton, upon which bugs are righteously shattered. A true warrior poet.\nAndrew Coggeshall, Polygon Wizard (RedFrame): Andrew's abilities in the eldritch world of 3D art are not to be underestimated. Andrew is CubeHeart\u2019s raw brawn, beefy arms, and rakish good looks all in one package.\nMax Geiger, Producifier (Unfinished Swan, Deadliest Warrior): Max forms CubeHeart\u2019s robo-codpiece. What that conceals, no one knows, but it is responsible for the potency and chutzpah of CubeHeart\u2019s planning and project management.\nMike Wright, Soundsmith and Composer (Miscrits): Mike is SCALE\u2019s audio designer, and CubeHeart\u2019s shining ears. His shimmering platinum lobes make lesser golden ears seem crude and unrefined in comparison.\nWith Voiceover work by:\nAshly Burch (Hey Ash, Watcha Playin\u2019?, Borderlands 2)\nSarah Elmaleh (Gone Home, Skulls of the Shogun)\nForming CubeHeart\u2019s sonorous vocal cords, Ash and Sarah have agreed to lend their considerable talents to SCALE as the voice of Penny and Penny\u2019s Silurian brain parasite therapist, respectively. Their euphonious stylings will carry you to new emotional highs and lows over the course of the game.\nFeaturing tracks by:\nBen Prunty (FTL, Gravity Ghost)\ndanny B (Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Issac, Drifter)\nThe sweet grooves of these two maestros need no further introduction, but we\u2019ll try anyway. Like the golden fingers of CubeHeart\u2019s left and right hand caressing the smoothest saxaphone you\u2019ve ever heard, Ben Prunty and DannyB are laying down the finest tracks we\u2019ve ever heard to accompany what we hope will be the finest game you\u2019ve ever played.\nTogether we are CubeHeart. THE CUBEHEART IS BEATING!!\nWhy are you Kickstarting this project?\nBecause we think Kickstarter is the best avenue for raising the funding we need while putting SCALE in front of an audience of people who will have a vested interest in the success of the project. We also like that with Kickstarter, there\u2019s the expectation that we\u2019ll keep our backers updated. We think building SCALE is going to be a fun ride, and we\u2019d love to bring you along with us, rather than toiling in secret.\nWhy is your goal $87,000?\nBecause we\u2019ve run the numbers, and the advice we\u2019ve gotten from everyone has been \u201cask for the money you need, and don\u2019t try to lowball it.\u201d We think 87K will be enough to cover development expenses for the time it will take to make SCALE, as well as pay the talented people who are contributing to the project. We\u2019re also keenly aware that a lot of project underestimates fulfillment costs and Kickstarter/Amazon Payment\u2019s 5% and 3-5% shares, respectively, and so we\u2019ve tried to build this in to our estimate.\nHow are you making SCALE?\nSCALE is being developed in Unity, which is a familiar and comfortable development environment for us. Steve has been using Unity since version 1.6.\nWhich platforms are you targeting?\nCurrently, PC, Mac, and Linux are all viable platforms we\u2019d like to see SCALE on. Targeting Linux means we\u2019ll be on SteamOS/Steam Machines as well. We are also considering next-gen consoles, and are in talks with a few different publishers about the viability of bringing SCALE to a those platforms, but a getting the game out on personal computers is our first priority.\nHere's an interview Steve did with Adam Sessler at the INDIE MEGABOOTH this year at PAX.\nJohn Walker, Rock Paper Shotgun: \"This was undoubtedly the star of the afternoon. Receiving gasps of delight, along with multiple bursts of spontaneous applause, it was a concept that just kept delighting.\"\nTaylor Cocke, GameCenterBlog: \"Steve Swink's first-person puzzler might be my most-anticipated game of this year.\"\nJared Rosen, Indiestatik: \"What instantly struck me about Scale was how it seized on such a pure, childlike focus on exploration.\"\nNorthernLion did a \"Let's Look At\" preview video of the PAX build of SCALE.\nA Carl Sagan Quote because Carl Sagan:\n\u201cIf the cosmos is closed...there's a strange, haunting, evocative possibility...one of the most exquisite conjectures in science and religion. It's entirely undemonstrated...it may never be proved, but it's stirring. Our entire universe, to the farthest galaxy, we are told...is no more than a closed electron...in a far grander universe we can never see. That universe is only an elementry particle...in another still greater universe and so on forever. Also, every electron in our universe, it is claimed...is an entire miniature cosmos...containing galaxies and stars and life, and electrons. Everyone of those electrons contains a still smaller universe...an infinite regression up and down.\u201d - Carl Sagan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISK 1: SCALE's project schedule is not final yet.\n\nSCALE is a videogame, and frankly, video games take a long time to finish and get right. There's a morbid joke in game development that building the features and levels of the game is the first 90% of the work that a development team does, and the second 90% is fixing all the bugs in that work and polishing it up. The official answer for when SCALE will be complete is \"when it's good,\" but we anticipate that we'll be done way before the heat death of the universe. For some perspective, Steve has been working on SCALE in bits and pieces since 2012, but retooled the art and started serious work on the game in early 2013, and as of now we estimate that the game is currently 25-30% done.\n\nWe know a lot of people have been mislead on Kickstarter, or feel like backing a videogame on Kickstarter is a risky proposition, and that's not without good reason. But we're a team of veterans who have a solid track record of shipping quality games and projects, and we're confident that given enough time, we'll be able to ship the best possible version of SCALE.\n\nRisk 2: Hey, aren't you the guy behind Shadow Physics? That game turned out to be vaporware, won't this one too?\n\nCutting right to the hard questions, eh? The story of why Shadow Physics was canned is simple: you gotta know when to fold 'em. It just wasn't working. We worked our butts off and the game just wasn't fun. Lessons were learned and have been applied. The past 9 months of development on SCALE have resulted in more enjoyable gameplay than the entire two and half years of work on Shadow Physics.\n\nRISK 3: Will you guys be able to fulfill all these physical rewards in a timely fashion?\n\nYes. We are currently planning on working with Fangamer, the folks who are doing the fulfillment for LA GameSpace, and we have the advice of friends and mentors who have successfully Kickstarted their projects and fulfilled them before.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #62", "update_userinfo": "Alive!", "update_content": "Hey everyone!

BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started.

It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.

They are both hardworking and experienced video game developers who have invested many years into Raindrop and its previous versions. They strive to continuously improve and ripen Raindrop into the full fruition it deserves.\n (ingame screenshots of the factory area, source engine 2009)\nRaindrop was initially conceptualized as a Half-Life 2 total conversion modification around five years ago when Nihad Nasupovic, the project lead, began developing its core maps and game play mechanics. Shortly after, Max Ramirez joined the team as the lead production artist for the project.\n (the residential blocks, source engine 2009)\nAs the team behind Raindrop grew, unexpected issues began to surface. Despite its progress, Raindrop was discontinued as a modification due to a variety of technical and social setbacks. Development ceased due to the inability to balance work and life among the team, coupled with limitations inherent to the Source engine.\n (the swamp, source engine 2009)\n  (the residential blocks and amusement park, source engine 2009)\n(ingame screenshots of danilos bar, unity3d engine 2013)\nNihad Nasupovic and Max Ramirez have re-connected and revived the project, but in a new light. They started re-designing and prototyping a new and improved version of Raindrop. This time, after vigorous research and with some combined experience, they choose to use Unity3D as their desired game engine, while using Kickstarter to push Raindrop into the full time dream Nihad and Max have been striving for.\n \n(outside of danilos bar and playground area, unity3d engine 2013)\nRaindrop has had some major aesthetic improvements since switching from Source to Unity3D. This versatile and powerful engine have allowed Nihad and Max to greatly increase the complexity of the environments without penalizing the overall performance of the game.\nA great amount of time has been invested solely into researching and developing new and existing features that are being integrated into each build of the game. These features range from purely aesthetical enhancements, such as complicated wet surface shaders; to game mechanic improvements, such as hierarchical event triggers for puzzles and conditions.\n (outland, farming area, unity3d engine 2013)\nDuring the the development of Raindrop, we will continue to interact and build upon with the close knit community we gained during our years as a Mod. We want every single backer and supporter to have a voice, and we want to hear it! Keeping our plans, development logs, features, bugs, issues, and progress plainly open to the public is not a \u201csecurity factor.\u201d It is crucial that we improve the game with your feedback, and most importantly, our plan is to allow you to shape the overall outcome of the game.\nEvery few weeks, we will deliver a development log, featuring various packages including maps, in game screenshots, information and details regarding our progress and plans.\n We call these releases Re-Hydration Logs. Screen shots, and in game footage will be dissected through environment breakdowns, where backers and supporters can see how each level pieced together.\n \nYOU get to sway Raindrops final appearance. YOU are the voice that we both look forward to hearing, and rely on to help troubleshoot. It\u2019s an indie game inside and out, and it would be impossible to achieve without the help of our already passionate audience.\nClassifying Raindrop as a job would not be appropriate at any level. We have dreamt of this project for years and have finally breathed life into the final vision. If anything, its more of a close reality than a dream. But in order to fully develop and invest all of our resources and time, it is imperative that we raise funds in order to deliver the project to its full potential.\nSo far, Raindrop has been down some adventurous roads, and a great amount of content, environments, and features have already been developed. Now is the time to piece together the environments and core game mechanics, while polishing and developing Raindrop Chapter 1.\nRight now Nihad and I have worked on Raindrop without receiving any funding. If anything, we've invested a good amount of our own money into purchasing extra assets, packages, hardware, and software packages. We are extremely passionate about every aspect of this project. We've devoted an astonishing amount of personal time and energy into thinking, developing, and establishing this game.\n(To a point where people think we have some loose screws in our heads.) However, working part-time on this just isn't sufficient anymore. Which is why we are here to begin with.\n\u2022 Hire staff and contractors that are just as passionate and motivated about Raindrop as we are\n\u2022 Purchase the required licenses, hardware and software packages in order complete all tasks\n\u2022 Purchase additional assets, packages, and add-ons for Unity3D\n\u2022 Pay for our basic survival requirements (rent, bills, food, etc)\n\u2022 Pay for rewards, legal, and online maintenance costs\n\u2022 Pay for marketing and advertisement costs\n\u2022 Extend the entire development of Raindrop along with the long term stretch goals\nAlthough this kickstarter is dedicated to raising funds for Raindrop: Chapter 1, we are thinking even bigger and larger than just the prelude. Raindrop will be a trilogy with three distinctive chapters, each with unique environments, and sections of the game. The main reason why we split the game into three chapters is to integrate agile development into our pipeline.\nWe also want to gather as much feedback as possible from the first chapter in order to improve the overall trilogy.

When circumstances permit, we also make weird and wonderful original games like Shantae and the Mighty Series. \nIn all that time, fan letters, support emails and interviewers have made our most frequently asked question, \u201cWhy don't you guys make more original games?\u201d  \nKickstarter allows us to do just that! With your help we can create a large-scale multi-console game that's well beyond our usual self-publishing budgets.  \nBest of all, we have our ducks in a row. Half-Genie Hero is already approved for development on Wii U, PS3, PS4, VITA & VITA TV, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Steam (Windows PC). Now it's time to start making the game.... all we need is your support!\nWho is Shantae? Why, she's the star of our game! She\u2019s a human/genie hybrid (a Half-Genie) who hair-whips monsters with her ponytail, and belly dances to transform into magical creatures. She explores Sequin Land, solves labyrinths, trashes epic bosses, and foils the busty buccaneer Risky Boots, always managing to save the day! She's been featured in three daring adventures, all designed exclusively for Nintendo handhelds. Now Shantae's headed for the living room, but her core gameplay elements will remain intact:\n-Whipping! Destroy monsters, topple bosses, and solve puzzles with your hair\n-Belly Dancing! Dance to transform into a variety of creature forms\n-Platforming! Run and jump through deviously designed levels\n-Exploring! Navigate a world of interconnected levels and Labyrinths\n-Customizing! Earn new abilities, unlock stat-boosting artifacts, magic & costumes\n-Storytelling! Flirtatious characters and wonderfully off-beat humor\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero continues the tradition of action/adventure in the spirit of Metroid, Castlevania, and the Legend of Zelda. Our goal is to introduce Shantae to a whole new audience with a fresh art style and a brand spanking new storyline. As always, we're putting pitch perfect controls in the front seat.\nIn our story, Shantae is roused from a deep sleep, suddenly alert. She plunges into the moonlit forest in search of answers. In nearby Scuttle Town she discovers a mysterious trapdoor, and beyond that, a luminous subterranean cavern. A familiar voice calls out, drawing Shantae to a beautiful fountain. Touching its waters she is immediately spirited away to the fabled Genie Realm. At her feet a magical seal swells as some powerful evil seeks escape. The chamber trembles with a deep, bellowing roar and everything goes white. Shantae sits upright, back in her bed. Was it just a dream? Or a vision of things to come?\nAs the player it's your job to find the source of this new evil power and banish it once and for all. The story is doled out in CHAPTERS, with each chapter introducing new subplots, friends & foes, a new Transformation to discover, puzzles to solve, hazards to overcome, and a Boss to conquer. Revisiting past chapters with newly acquired abilities will unlock the next set of paths, powers & plot-lines.\nOur funding price will allow us to create an action-packed opening stage (with boss), 3 Chapters, and an exciting conclusion; similar to previous Shantae games. But why stop there? Together we can make this game truly epic by reaching our STRETCH GOALS!\nMatt Bozon: Director of Contra 4, Mighty Switch Force!, and the Shantae series is back in the director\u2019s chair, making odd noises and leading the charge.\nJake Kaufman:  Fund this pup for the soundtrack alone! He composed the previous Shantae OST's and we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\nWF Animation Team: Character animation and visual design provided by our battle-hardened feature film veterans... the same crack team that brought you a Boy and His Blob, Batman: the Brave and the Bold, and Ducktales: Remastered.\nInti Creates: The developer that brought you the Mega Man series is providing character concepts and illustrations!\nMariel Cartwright: the Lead Animator for the much acclaimed 2D fighter Skullgirls is also animating Shantae!\nGigi Digi: Best known for her work on Cucumber Quest!  Gigi is the source of these beautifully stylized backgrounds.\nWF 3D Team: From environments to VFX, our diverse 3D talent has amazing range. Who else can build both Duckburg and Silent Hill? \nWF Engine Team: Our engine tech is world class. PC based, 1080p, and the silky smooth 60 frames-per-second our games demand. \nWF STAFF: Last but certainly not least, our programmers, level designers, directors, department leads, writers, testers and producers (defenders of your funds and our deadlines) are all on board.\nStretch Goals are an important part of this project, because they will shape the game's content in a big way. Animated sequences, Extra Chapters, and Unlockable Costumes will add something special to the final product and make an already great game even greater!

For over a decade Shantae games have won awards and acclaim the world over:\nShantae (Game Boy Color): Risky Boots transforms a simple steam-engine into a magical monstrosity! Can Shantae save Sequin Land from disaster? The game that started it all. Reviewers named Shantae the Game Boy\u2019s swan song. It earned a perfect score from Nintendo Power and was deemed a \u201cBest Nintendo Game of All Time\u201d in their final issue. Distributed by Capcom in 2002, Shantae has become one of the rarest and most sought after collectables out there. It was recently re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.\nShantae: Risky\u2019s Revenge (DSiWare): Risky returns with a magic lamp capable of stealing Shantae's \"genie half\". Is this beginning of the end for Shantae and her friends? The sequel was a long time coming -- but was worth the wait, earning the highest Metacritic rating across all handhelds in 2010. The game was ported to iOS the following year. It was named Game of the Week by Apple and has since been featured numerous times as an \"essential\" platformer in the App Store. \nShantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse (coming soon to Nintendo 3DS eShop): When a curse falls upon Sequin Land, Risky Boots and Shantae must join forces to battle unimaginable evil.

A job known as \u201cThe Watcher,\u201d Elion, has one last assignment as a \u201cWatcher,\u201d which if she can solve will lead to a promotion.\nThe reward?  Elion will gain the ability to take her own time trip and gain information as to the whereabouts of her missing family, and the inner workings of Reality Check. She discovers along the way that corruption begins on a personal level. A decision she makes in the past will change the course of her future forever.\nFor a short film, you\u2019re going to go on a crazy trip.  Violence, love, relationships, deceit, told in a visually-kinetic style, and with a suspenseful story.\nIt features a strong female protagonist, in the vein of Alien or Serenity, and a tale that will excite, emotionally engage, and entertain you.  The best stories are not just situations, but events that unfold, and we follow a character study about what someone will do to get ahead, and what they will leave behind to get there.\nSTYLE AND INFLUENCES:\nElion's eye computer\nThink \"Memento\" meets \"Minority Report,\" or \"Primer\" and \"Twelve Monkeys,\" all within 15 minutes. A style best described as a glass of Hitchcock, a splash of Aronofsky, and a slice of Christopher Nolan.  It's a story where we as a viewer uncover the truth by moving backwards in time, and forwards in the story. If you like the concept, have been screwed over by insurance companies, or really dig time travel movies you\u2019re going to like this film.  Another key influence has been Chris' fascination with mathematics, primarily the Fibonacci sequence found in nature. It represents a powerful symbol in the film, and is a source of inspiration for its many aesthetic elements.\nPast Work\nPast Work\nWE ARE HERE:\nWe have been in pre-production for over a year, with our key crew members generating ideas, scouting our locations, completing the special effects tests, and polishing the storyboards.  We really have taken our time to map out this story, and create a universe that will surprise and delight you, the viewer.  \nThe director, Chris Buchal, has worked with the majority of the crew since he started filmmaking.  He and key crew members have come up with visual concepts that are striking, and a plan to make something truly memorable.\nChris Buchal, who has an English degree from University of Oregon, grew up reading both classics like Shakespeare and more Philip K Dick and Robert Heinlein than can be considered healthy by today\u2019s standards. His love of film is second to his love of story, and this love can be seen within the very short two-year time span he has been in the movie-making business.   Now it's time to show you a deeper glimpse into the worlds that reside within his imagination.\nDirector Work Samples:\nA Commercial prize winner, \u201cBaquon\u201d\nhttp://youtu.be/FnFwwDF8tTo\nCity Liquidators (Commercial)\nhttps://vimeo.com/55829018\nBad Cop Bad Cop - Monopoly Man (Comedy)\nhttps://vimeo.com/46905617\nFunny Thing Is (childhood)\nhttps://vimeo.com/61402702\nCloudy October - 4play (Music Video)\nhttps://vimeo.com/57033865\nFemale - A Slam Poem (One of his first film projects)\nhttps://vimeo.com/42261481\nCAST:\nCora Benesh, Lead\nCora, plays the lead role of Elion, and is a talented actor, writer, and producer. City Baby, a feature film she co-wrote, produced, and starred in, is currently on the festival circuit. Her acting, was noted as, \"a striking lead performance\" by Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter. She\u2019s a SAG-AFTRA actress, and brings a level of professionalism, experience, and leadership necessary for the role.\nhttp://corabenesh.com/\nKc Guyer, Phillip Heinlein\nKc\u2019s character is named after two of the greatest science fiction writers of all time, and Kc will be playing a character whose scene will bring to mind echoes of \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Inception.\" Kc is stoked to play the CEO of Reality Check, and add some flavor in a visually stunning scene that is sure to excite and entertain.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm4610939/\nGreg James, Tom Bombadil\nAlthough Greg and Chris met under unusual circumstances, a friendship formed, and this will be another collaboration between the two. Greg is an experienced actor who loves the work, and will attack the material to get the best performance possible.  He plays Tom Bombadil, a genius scientist in the film, aka the \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d of time-travel, whose life comes under scrutiny, and whose inventions prove valuable.\nhttp://thegregjames.com/\nColtron James, Leland\nColtron plays the role of Elion's love interest, and has worked with Chris Buchal on a variety of projects in the past. There are very few actors who work as hard on the craft as Coltron, and he is sure to provide behind his blue eyes, a true embodiment of real emotion.\nJeffree Newman, Stranger\nJeffree is looking forward to delivering an emotional performance, and a real one.  The role calls for darker overtones.  He'll be in the opening scene by setting the mood of Reality Check.\nPriscillia Prosser, KHLOE\nShe will be playing \u201cKHLOE\u201d and represents an insurance agent we all feel we have seen before...\nOUR GOALS\nIt would be delightful to gain access to a Big 3 film festival.  We\u2019d personally love to get into South By Southwest [SXSW].  We hope on a long-term scale to use this as a showcase to launch a feature/TV show/web-series.  We have been generating content for awhile and have some cool and well defined ways that this can happen, via this project's good execution.  That\u2019s where you come in.  We would love to have everyone on the crew have what they need to make this film. We know that the money we are trying to raise will barely cover costs as it is, but we wanted to see if the community could help us get what we need in order to get over the top.  We want to tell a story that has social commentary, plot twists, and is emotionally engaging.  We feel confident that with your help, we can show you something you\u2019ve potentially never seen before, and accomplish a character study on ambition and corporate America.  We are also very keen on gaining camera sponsorship, or access to above DSLR grade cameras, but still content to film the movie on them if necessary, as we believe that its merely a tool to tell the story.\nUPDATE: We are now shooting on the REDONE cinema camera, thanks to our newest Producer, Todd Freeman!\nKEY CREW\nDirector of Photography: Paulius Kontijevas\n\nPaulius Kontijevas, is a full-time freelance cinematographer.

He has shot a sci-fi on the 7d, and along with Chris and Harrisen, developed the visual structure of the film over the past year.\nVisual Effects Supervisor, Post Production:  Chris Herrick\nChris cracked his teeth on a past sci-fi \u201cAmbrosia,\u201d and has been developing the special effects with Buchal over the past year.  Extensive tests and pre-production planning have gone into this project, and with his talent, we are able to create some effects that are truly breathtaking on the indie level.  Herrick and Buchal have a music video coming out called \u201cBurning\u201d about a man who comes to consciousness as gasoline is poured on his head, by a woman whose body ignites into fire. They\u2019re pretty excited about it, and it should come out during the kickstarter run!\nVFX Reel:\nhttps://vimeo.com/36073120\nAshlee Branham: Wardrobe\nAshlee has worked with Chris for over 5 years, and is the costume designer for \"Reality Check.\" She is a very hard worker, a talented writer, and without her this project would not be possible.

She also is a terrific storyboard artist and possesses infinite practical skills in both regular life and on a film set.\nClaire Brooksbank: SPFX Makeup\nClaire and her husband Damien, will be doing the special effects makeup on this project.  They have a true love for the craft and more experience creating gorey and gruesome stuff than this writer would care to admit!\nhttp://clairebfx.carbonmade.com\nAssistant Director/Executive Producer:  Rowan Spiers Floyd\nAssistant Director, organizer extraordinaire, and producer on \"Reality Check.\"  He helps the ship run smoothly, handles scheduling, and is very organized.  Also a director in his own right, he works with TRIFECTA FILMS out of Portland, Oregon.\nTodd Freeman: Producer\nTodd Freeman, runs Polluted Pictures, and is the director of the horror film CELL COUNT, which has gone on to many festivals worldwide.

Having a great eye for detail and problem solving, he will help the ship run smoothly.\nProduction Designer:  Clifton Chandler\nOur Production Designer has been a part of the project for the past year and is itching to see it start production. He brings an enthusiasm for the process and a knack for making it work (and believable) within a limited budget. With a rich heritage in storytelling, he is excited to be a part of bringing this story to life.\nSound:  Johnny5\nOur post sound man extraordinaire, Johnny5 will be behind the post production foley and sound design mixing work. He is a true class act, and without him we would not be able to do the film to the best of our abilities.\nSound:  Shawn Willis\nShawn, who is also a fan of Darren Aronofsky, will be providing production sound. We love sound in our movies, and so he will have a very important job bringing to life all the snaps, hisses, wheezes, and sounds that make a sci-fi come to life.  We have done some sound tests in pre-production, to ensure high quality in this department.\nSound:  Shawn Hale\nShawn will help in mixing and creating sound effects for the film for use by our post sound supervisor, and he is also a musician within the 12 Angry Artistry Collective.

She will be lending her voice for music+effects. Chris is a fan of her style and hopes to implement echoey and surreal sounds with her voice for distant sounds in the film.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dralapdx\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\nBudget\nThere is money already set aside for this film, but we need your help to actually push into principle photography. We estimate that the total cost of production will be ~$15,000 and want to use kickstarter to help us get the additional $10,000 we need to be successful.  The money will breakdown into the following:\n\n$3,000 for SPFX + Post Production\n$1,000 for Camera\n$1,000 for Sound\n  A. $500 for sound recordist\n  B. $500 for post sound Foley artist Johnny 5\n$1,000 for Art Department\n$1,000 for Actors\n$1,000 for Crew\n$1,000 for Lights\n$1,000 extra (kickstarter taxes, prizes, gas, food, etc.)\nPlease help us reach our goal.

We love our cast though, and excited to be working with them)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilming a sci-fi on the indie level is a challenge. Filming a movie that has good special effects requires time and money. We have the talent within our crew, but need your help so that while we work on this project, we can feed our stomachs, and pay our rent! While the majority of this film is going to be told via macro shots and cool cinematography, a vision of the future worth seeing requires massive post-production techniques. The right camera package and lenses will enable us to create a movie worth seeing. Also personally, I've lived in a less than ideal living situation, and have been saving up every dollar I have to make this film, because I know that with your help it will kick some serious ass. Since we are a SAG-AFTRA project, all actors will be paid on this project, and that means additional costs for every day we shoot.

We will be able to produce hours of additional content and achieve a higher level of detail and beauty throughout the game.\n$700,000 (Mega Awesome) - If we get to this level, we will be able to include more locations, more characters, a deeper story, and deliver a very high level of polish.  We expect to release a Linux version at this level as well -- if we hit this goal we will dedicate an engineer, tester and art person to Linux.\n$800,000 (Badonk) - This level allows us to pretty much do everything we want to do for Precinct.  In addition to more gameplay, more characters, more story, more polish, we expect to bring Precinct to iOS, Android, XBLA and PSN as well.  You can also expect subtitled versions for the French, Italian, German and Spanish markets at this level too.\nHISTORY\nABOUT SIERRA Located in the small mountain town of Oakhurst, CA, Sierra On-line was founded in 1979 by husband and wife team Ken and Roberta Williams. Through Ken and Roberta\u2019s hard work, vision, and talent, Sierra became a pioneering force that was instrumental in shaping the video game industry and bringing home computer games to mainstream culture. Since the 1990\u2019s, several mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, liquidations, and the departure of Ken and Roberta effectively rendered Sierra defunct. The company\u2019s brand and remaining assets were last owned by Activision.\n\"There are few more storied franchises in adventure gaming than Sierra's Police Quest series.\" - Kotaku\nPolice Quest is a trademark of Activision Publishing, Inc. All rights reserved.\nCREATING POLICE QUEST Jim is a retired California Highway Patrol officer who left the force in 1984 after being traumatized in a violent shootout. During his recovery from the incident, Jim serendipitously met video game pioneer Ken Williams who was in the early days of growing Sierra On-line with his wife and company co-founder Roberta Williams. Ken asked Jim to design gameplay and write a story for a realistic police adventure series Ken wanted to make. Police Quest was born.\nJim Walls (second from right) with the early Sierra On-line design team. Company co-founder Roberta Williams in front.\nUpon its release, Police Quest was an instant hit, wowing early gamers with a unique point-and-click adventure style and unprecedented realism for the time. Police Quest went on to have five sequels, selling millions of copies.\nMost games fade to black in the game industry but the interest in Police Quest still burns brightly almost thirty years later. Possibly because of its deep storyline and the dedication it takes to play Police Quest successfully, the series has amassed a legion of fans from all over the world.\nPRINCIPAL TEAM\nJim with wife Kristy\nJIM WALLS Jim has been in the video game business for almost 20 years and is considered one of the original pioneers of the adventure game genre. His game titles include Police Quest 1, 2 and 3, Codename Iceman, Blue Force, Blade Runner, Pirates \u2013 Legend of Black Kat, and Earth and Beyond.\nPrecinct Executive Producer, Robert Lindsley\nROBERT LINDSLEY  Robert began working at Sierra On-line at just fifteen years old. Although already precociously well versed in programming, Ken and Roberta Williams brought Robert into the company to help box games and copy floppy discs.  Robert was eventually given a shot at programming and it wasn't wasted on him.  Robert soon began coding professionally and eventually began producing.  At Sierra, Robert worked on several classic Sierra titles including King's Quest V & VI, Laura Bow 2, Mixed Up Mother Goose, and Phantasmagoria 2.  After Sierra, Robert worked for Microsoft Games where he wound up on Microsoft's Xbox launch team.  Robert has also led development at Atari and Harmonix, shipping over 80 games in his career.  Most recently, Robert's credits include Rock Band, Ghostbusters, and Dance Central.  Robert is currently Jim's partner for this project. \nPrecinct Art Director, Scott Butler\nSCOTT BUTLER  An early employee of the pioneering game studio Argonaut Software, Scott has worked in the video games business for over 24 years. 11 of those years were spent at Sony Computer Entertainment as a senior artist and art director. Scott has shipped over 50 games in his career, including Kingsley's Adventure (PS1), Croc: Legend of the Gobbos (PS1 & Sega Saturn), Neopets: The Wand of Wishing (PSP), Eyetoy: Play (PS2), and Ren & Stimpy (SNES). At just 17 years old in 1989, Scott began his career making games for the Amiga and Timex Sinclair computers. Over the years, as game technology, tools, and business models have evolved, so has Scott. He has worked on virtually every game platform possible, Scott holds a US patent for a game engine technology he invented in 2009.\nPrecinct Production Director, Jason Crawford\nJASON CRAWFORD Jason has spent nearly two decades as an entrepreneur and creative professional in technology. The last 12 years of his career have been in the video game industry.  Jason has launched multiple companies, including a game development studio in 2001 with Precinct's Executive Producer, Robert Lindsley.

Our entire team is intensely aware of this issue and know we must be vigilant in managing it responsibly. Leading this effort is Precinct's Executive Producer, Robert Lindsley, who has over 20 years experience producing video games. Working on small games up to hundred-million dollar AAA titles, Robert has a proven and unbeatable track record for shipping products on-time and on-budget. As with any game development project, Precinct will undoubtedly throw out its own unique challenges but those challenges will be met by a team of seasoned video game industry veterans that know how to solve problems effectively and responsibly.\n\nTECH & PRODUCTION DESIGN\nIt's going to be an enormous undertaking building a lot of our own tech and tools above the already robust Unity3D platform. We created a game prototype of the world that not only shows off the art style, it was as an exercise to vet if Unity3D and our proprietary game editor will be possible given our minimum budget range.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAlthough upgraded to modern gameplay standards, we believe audiences will enjoy the fun of a realistic police adventure because of Jim's past success with Police Quest. \"If you've played Police Quest, you know exactly what Jim Walls is like, because that game is Jim Walls.\" - Al Lowe, creator of Leisure Suit Larry and programmer on Police Quest.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jim Walls\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nExcept for the few short years I lived in Nevada, California has always been my home.

Make sure to read the FAQ) PayPal contributions so far: $1,753\nGreetings!\nHello, I'm Lars Simkins. I'm a VFX artist by trade and an indie game developer by passion. I'm here to make that first person exploration/survival game we've all been dreaming about.\nI can still remember the first time I played Daggerfall. Yes, it was uglier than a monkey's armpit and controlled worse than a bumper car on a frozen lake. \nBut it also created the feeling of a world that lived on even after I'd stopped playing, and that feeling still sticks with me all these years later. A world where you could spend hours searching every pixelated nook and cranny. A world of potential. A world of EXPLORATION...\n...and then a Dragonling would chomp my face because I hadn't spent ten hours grinding in the easy regions. Arg! So frustrating! \nOther games have touched on that elusive feeling, especially Elder Scrolls and early Fallout games, but as fun as they are and as much as I love hardcore RPG mechanics, I've always dreamt of a game that emphasized exploration above all else.\nFRONTIERS is that game\nDalarna - North Tower View\nBenneton Gateway\nIn 2011 I finally decided if no one else was going to make it, I'd give it a try. For a full feature list check out the 'Game Features' section below. The trailer you see is the result of hundreds of hours of work and many thousands of dollars out of pocket.\nI'm close to finishing this thing. Another six months ought to do it. But it needs a push - and that's where you guys come in.\nI've taken stock of exactly where the game needs attention and I've already got a small team of hand-picked programmers & artists lined up to flesh out the content that will take this game from scrappy Alpha to polished final release. Finishing the base feature set will take $50,000, broken down roughly like so:\nBeyond the bare minimum to finish the game there are stretch goals. These are features that aren't strictly necessary, but which I scream, you scream, we all scream for because they're awesome and fun. As many of you know I've spent several weeks listening to and discussing your feature requests. Until now I've avoided making promises about most of them (especially when it came to co-op, the most requested feature of all), but after crunching the numbers I can finally tell you what we're shooting for, and what we need to make it happen:\nPayPal contributions so far: $1,753\nCan't pledge with Kickstarter / Amazon? You can use PayPal! All PayPal contributions are put towards stretch goals.\nMajor features\nHere are the base features that are already prototyped / in progress / completed in the alpha.\n\nOther cool features\nRelaxing Pace & Tone \u25cfThis isn't a hack & slash game or a deep, complex RPG. It's an exploration game, and the pace & tone reflect that. There are challenges and tense moments, but they're something you seek out, not something that's thrust upon you. And while there is some complexity to be found in the skills and weapons system, it's not overwhelming.\nImmersive Fast Travel \u25cf Unlike most open world RPGs where fast travel feels like teleportation, fast travel in FRONTIERS won't break your sense of immersion. You get to watch as your character makes the journey, with the sun rising & setting and the landscape rolling by. (To see it in action check out the Videos section.)\nSurvival & Hunting \u25cf Stay fed & warm using your Survival skills. Hunt live game with bows & traps, or gather nourishing mushrooms with book smarts. Eat it raw and damn the consequences or become a master chef and prepare filling recipes  The survival elements in FRONTIERS are engaging and fun without being oppressive. Whether you want to hunt, gather, buy or steal, you'll be able to find a play style that matches your tastes.\nMinecraft-Style Crafting \u25cf Craft almost any item in the game - from weapons to potions to chocolate cake - with grid-based blueprints.\nBeautiful Fantasy Soundtrack \u25cf Steve can't wait to get started on new tracks for each region. I don't even have to tell you how good he is, just give the trailer another listen.\nImmersion Settings \u25cf My goal is to let nothing break your immersion. Everyone has a different threshold for GUI intrusion - you'll be able to tweak sounds, your HUD, glowing paths, your crosshair and even object highlighting styles.\nI'm shooting for January 2014 - but take that with a grain of salt. Even the least ambitious, most experienced teams can slip behind schedule. And if we start hitting some of the bigger stretch goals all bets are off.\nThe good news is that a venn diagram between game dev and VFX has a lot of overlap, broadly speaking, and no skill carries over better than time management. After six years of delivering complex shots for TV shows & films with pressure cooker deadlines, I know a thing or two about creating high quality material with changing requirements under intense pressure. I've also got a great infrastructure for working with an offsite team.\nPlatforms & Distribution\nFRONTIERS will be available on PC, Mac and LInux.\nIf all goes well the plan is to distribute the game on Steam, but I will also be trying to make it available on GOG.com for folks who like to keep their games totally DRM-free. (If your reward includes a copy of the game, I'll make sure a DRM-free option is available for you.)\nGeneric Assets\nQuick side note for all you game developers out there: I plan to make any generic assets I create or commission for the game freely available - tree models, textures, weapons, C# scripts, etc. I wouldn't have made it this far without support from sites like Open Game Art and the Unity community, so this will be a chance to contribute to the growing pool of high quality art & code available to aspiring game developers.\nIf you want to know more about the game, check out these links, videos and screenshots! I talk about features in a lot more detail elsewhere, especially on Greenlight.\nOfficial Pages / Information\nFRONTIERS Official Page\nIndieDB Page\nAAD Games Devblog\nArticles\n\nPC Gamer - Exploration, discovery and survival in a one-man made indie RPG\nPolygon - How one man is creating open-world exploration in Frontiers\nIndie Game Magazine - Trailblazing with Lars Simkins\nIndiestatik - Do It Yourself: Frontiers Is An RPG-Sized Exploration/Survival Game Made By Just One Person\nScreenshots\nFor all kinds of pretty images, check out the Greenlight gallery.\nVideos\nFor more videos, check out the AAD Productions YouTube channel.\nEnough of the jibber jabber! Let's get to the good stuff!\nAdd-Ons!\nWhat are add-ons? They're fun extras that you can add to your existing pledge, regardless of the reward you claimed.\nIf you want an add-on, just increase your pledge without changing your existing reward. For example, if you already have an Early Bird Ranger reward and you'd like to add a Butterfly, pledge another $50. Then at the end of the campaign you'll receive an official backers' survey asking which add-on you wanted.\n(Using PayPal? Same basic procedure - just make sure to shoot me email after you've contributed the difference!)\nStandard Rewards\nIf you have questions about any of these rewards let me know and I'll answer them in the FAQ.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm proud of the fact that I've never missed a VFX deadline, but with a game this complex there's always a chance that January 2014 will slip through my fingers.\n\nIf I ever feel the deadline slipping you will know before anyone else. My policy is the simplest policy - transparency across the board. (I can guarantee you'll be sick of hearing about my problems within a month.)\n\nI should also address the elephant in the room - is it even possible for one guy to create a game this big? The short answer is no, and that's why I'm bringing on a small team! But the other thing to keep in mind is how simple this game is compared to its influences (like Daggerfall). The focus on exploration allows me to prune mechanics and prevent the game from getting overwhelmingly complex. That's how I've been able to make it as far as I have, and that's how the team will be able to finish the game in the end.\n\nThanks for reading!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "The Final Update", "update_content": "FRONTIERS is Finished\nA new build - the final build - has been pushed to Steam.

They crash land on a weird planet and end up locked in a mysterious fortress called Armikrog. Then...the adventure begins!\nThe Game\nArmikrog is a point and click adventure game that features all of the characteristics of TenNapel's unmistakable style:\nQuirky and lovable characters\nUnique worlds\nA compelling story\nMind-bending puzzles\nGreat animation\nTons of clay!\nThe Music\nTerry S. Taylor -- the award winning composer of The Neverhood soundtrack, will be composing and performing an entirely new original soundtrack for the game. Hooray!!!\nArmikrog will be available DRM-free for PC (WINDOWS), MAC OSX and LINUX, and distributed though GOG.com, The Humble Store and several other digital distribution platforms. For those of you who prefer Steam, we are now on Steam Greenlight. Click the link below where you can vote YES for Armikrog and boost our popularity!\nArmikrog on Steam Greenlight\nMaking this game will be a labor of love, and a \"thank you\" to all Neverhood fans and adventure gamers.\nArmikrog is being developed by Pencil Test Studios, an independent game development company located in Lake Forest, CA. Along with Doug TenNapel, the team includes core members from The Neverhood, as well as puppet fabricators, sculptors, and animators that will help to create the stop-motion that makes this project so unique.\nArmikrog will also feature the voice talents of:\nThe Neverhood was conceived and created from the ground up over a 12 month period. Armikrog will be developed using the Unity engine for PC, MAC and LINUX in order to secure the goal of completing the project within one year. We'll also be using many of the same animation, modelling, sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods we've used before\u2014keeping the overall game design scalable so that we can create a fun and exciting experience within our targeted funding goal, but still have the flexibility to expand, should the opportunity present itself.\nOf course, none of this happens without your support, which is why we are reaching out to you through Kickstarter. Why Kickstarter? Funny you should ask...\nKickstarter is our most direct link to you, the fans. This is your opportunity to express whether or not you'd like to see another clay and puppet, stop-motion adventure game. Armikrog is a unique and creative project that we would love to make for those of you who have, over the years, dreamed of the chance to immerse yourself in another world made of clay. We're here to offer you the opportunity to make this project a reality.\nWhile our funding goal is considerably less than The Neverhood cost to produce in 1997, it is still our biggest hurdle. But in light of what it will cost to create, the real question is this: Would you support and play this game for $25?\nIf enough of you support it, you will get this game.\nThe Armikrog game will be comparable in size and scope to The Neverhood. It's been noted that our initial funding goal is significantly less than the cost of the original Neverhood game--this is possible since we are now utilizing technology that was not available to us 15 years ago (Unity engine, post-production and editing software, etc) which will allow us to create this game more efficiently with a overall higher level of quality.\nIn addition to our more conventional game production pipeline, we are also utilizing many of the same stop motion techniques used in such feature films as Paranorman and Nightmare Before Christmas. A significant portion of our budget is allocated toward puppet fabrication and sculpting, set building, lights, cameras, and lots and lots of clay!\nStop motion animation is an art all of its own. Each puppet, set and prop is individually hand-crafted by artists, while each and every frame is painstakingly animated. This specialized process is what makes this game unique--and we feel the time and talent that it takes to bring a project like this to this to life is worth every penny.\n100% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. To date, we\u2019ve invested over $100,000 into the preproduction, design, and development, and we can see how fun and amazing this project will be. We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and applying 100% of your contributions toward development is the only way this will happen.\nIllustration by Earthworm Jim poster artist, Mike Koelsch\nRewards fall into two basic categories: Digital Rewards that are distributed though Steam and/or comparable download venues, and Physical Rewards that will be distributed through the mail. Note that all physical rewards under $1000 have an additional shipping cost for supporters with addresses outside of the United States.\nRewards that are not dependent on the production of the actual game will be fulfilled before the date specified in the reward tiers. Since we can't predict the amount of rewards that will need to be fulfilled, all rewards have been given the same fulfillment date as the game's ship date (July 2014). Once the campaign has ended, we will notify you of the fulfillment dates for those rewards that will ship sooner.\nBoxed Edition in the big, old-school size (mockup - design not finalized)\nKickstarter Exclusive Armikrog T-Shirt ($200 tier and above)\nTommynaut stop-motion production puppet\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\nArmikrog is already getting a lot of great press.

Having many of the original members of The Neverhood team is a tremendous asset, as we already have the experience of creating this type of game. All games face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, but we have yet to face a challenge that we couldn't overcome. We have already begun to detail the entire scope of the game before production begins, which will help to define and minimize risks--which is key to the successful development of any game.\n\nWe've already invested a substantial amount of time and money into preproduction, laying the groundwork for an amazing game and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this project.

View it here.\nThe Arborlight, A Fairytale:\nThe Arborlight is a story inspired by the traditional folklore of the British Isles. Not so very long ago the things we readily consider fairytale were thought of as a very real part of this world. Elves and fairies, or the \u201cfair folk\u201d as they are sometimes called, and their realms, were a natural part of the mystery in our world. The fair folk were very curious about mankind. They could be benevolent towards us, but they could also be tricky and dangerous. Households would protect themselves against enchantment with the use of charms, such as carven roosters or wreaths made out of certain kinds of wood. It was important to do this, because an unprotected home would be vulnerable to bad luck and all other manner of wickedness, including the abduction of your children.\nStory Synopsis:\nThe Arborlight is set in the 1700\u2019s in a small cottage at the edge of a forest. Thomas\u2019 young daughter Elly has become terminally ill with tuberculosis and it becomes clear that she won\u2019t survive. For Thomas and his wife Liz there can be no worse thing in this world than losing their beloved daughter, who by doctor\u2019s orders is confined to her bed in an effort to prolong her life. But Thomas starts to wonder if holding on so tightly might have more to do with what he and his wife want, rather than what is best for Elly. His doubts are magnified when he discovers a mushroom circle out in the forest, which is considered to be a gathering place of enchanted beings and a portal to another realm, a place without illness or death. He feels compelled to show the magical place to Elly, and when her doll is left behind, strange things begin to happen back at the cottage.\nWho are we? The Cast and Crew:\nMy name is Phillip Harvey, and I\u2019m a writer and independent filmmaker from Seattle, WA. My twin brother Kevin and I have been producing videos and films together in the Seattle-area for about six years. We\u2019ve worked with a variety of local artists, including Sir Mixalot, and Chris Ballew of The Presidents of the United States of America, and sold commercials to companies like Pepsi and Calloway. Many of our recent films have done very well in competition, repeatedly winning 1st and 2nd place awards, best direction, editing, special effects, and more. Most recently, Kevin completed all the video work done for the Seattle EMP\u2019s new fantasy exhibit: World of Myth and Magic.\nAwards on our film '100 Hours'\nLimbo. A 24-Hour Film Festival Winner. (click to watch)\nIt\u2019s time for my brother and I to take the next step in our filmmaking path. The Arborlight is bringing together a collection of fantastic artists throughout the Pacific Northwest.\nHelping to produce the film will be Collin Joseph Neal with Faith vs. Fate productions.\nCinematography will be done by Dom Barbero, shooting on a RED Epic.

View her website here: [http://kaudick.com/]\nMake-up by Erika Seward. See her work at: [http://www.erikasewardmua.com/]\nProduction Assistants Tyler Arns and Garrett Meyers.\nAn ORIGINAL SCORE will be composed by Jeff Heim, a composer out of Boston, MA. Performing Jeff\u2019s score will be a Chamber Group from the Boston Conservatory. Jeff and I have worked together before and I'm very excited to have him on board for our next project. He is hard working and professional, and will be able to bring an emotional underscore to the entire story. This guy is going somewhere, and we\u2019re very fortunate to have met him at this stage in his career (Shh, don\u2019t tell him.) His music can be heard in our kickstarter video (although it is not the original score for the film.) Check out his website here: [www.jeffheim.net]\n\nThe Cast\nOur talented cast includes actor/producer Brian Sutherland, who has appeared in shows like NBC\u2019s Grimm, and recently starred in the feature film Ghostlight by Jeff Ferrell, Fat Kid Rules the World by Matthew Lillard, and Nothing Against Life by Julio Ramirez. He was also winner of Best Actor in one of our recent films, 100 Hours. When not in front of the camera, Brian is teaching youth actors around the country for Celebrity Star TV out of LA. My brother and I have been working with Brian since we first started making movies and are excited to have him play the lead role of Thomas on this new project. Brian is a prolific actor in the Northwest and having worked with so many people has been invaluable in bringing together many other members of the cast and crew on The Arborlight, and we're happy to have him as a producer on the project. View his demo reel here: [https://vimeo.com/59534082]\nLisa Coronado will be playing the part of Liz, Elly\u2019s mother. Lisa is a local actress from Washington state, and a producer to boot. She recently played alongside Brian Sutherland in Jeff Ferrell's Ghostlight, but can also be seen in the movie Different Drummers, which just won the Platinum Remi at the Houston World Fest for best feature film! She wrote, produced, and acted in the pilot The Divine Marigolds, and won Best Supporting Actress for Divination at the Macabre Film Festival. The film has also won Best Feature at the Fallbrook Film Festival 2013 and has been picked up for distribution.\nThe part of Elly will be played by Eden Campbell, a second-grader from Seattle, Washington. Eden has done a lot of commercial work, including having been in a nation-wide CenturyLink commercial. The Arborlight will be her second film. We're very excited to work with Eden. Not only does she have experience, but she comes highly recommended and is a remarkably bright girl. She will do a wonderful job playing a young girl wise beyond her years, and she is super excited to have a lead role in a fairytale!\nThe part of Dr. Knowles, the stern, initially well-meaning antagonist will be played by Russell Hodgkinson, a theater and film actor out of Seattle, WA.\nThurman Kellogg has been cast as The Constable.\nAbsolutely everybody working on this project is bringing a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and ability to the table. We are trying to raise enough money so that people can be compensated to some degree for what they\u2019re doing, but there isn\u2019t a person involved who isn't working for as little as possible on this project. Such is the nature of making independent films, but I also believe that is what will allow us to make an incredible movie. We have the makings of something very special here.\nWhat\u2019s the catch?\nWell, there is no catch! But this here is a kickstarter campaign, and you know what that means!\nWe need to raise 7500 clams to meet our minimum budget requirements for the film. For those of you that have made movies before or donated to projects, you\u2019ll know that for a twenty-minute short, this money is going a long way! We will be hosting at least one fundraiser here in the city of Seattle to supplement what we raise here on kickstarter, as well as adding personal funds.\nPlease help us meet and exceed our goal! Any extra money will allow certain members of the crew to get paid a little more reasonably and it will also greatly enable us to create some truly awesome visuals, be it the circa-1700\u2019s cottage sets, or the enchanting portal to another realm.\nWe're offering great incentive for your donations! You'll notice that we've made an effort to stay green by keeping the majority of our rewards digital. But there's some very cool options, including opportunities to appear in the movie, and even opportunities to sit down with the directors/producers and discuss your thoughts and opinions on edits of the movie before its been seen by anybody else, even the cast/crew!\nThank you for reading! There will be more updates in the near future, and maybe a couple new reward options!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Arborlight story presents a multitude of challenges beyond those of a typical movie. The first big challenge is that it's a period piece, and that means finding special locations and costumes. When finding locations for a period piece, it's not always easy to find everything in one place, which creates a lot of extra turmoil in scheduling and moving around your cast and crew, as well as actually editing the movie together seamlessly. For me, I find these challenges to be part of the fun in filmmaking, because we're creating a time and place that doesn't actually exist, and to see that world built on screen is a really magical experience. I'm also attracted to period pieces because there's something very cinematic about them. On screen, they seem somehow simpler, more romantic, and closer to their morals.\nI wrote The Arborlight screenplay to be conservative enough in its scope that it can be accomplished at a low budget. It takes a little extra mojo on the part of the cast and crew, but we have a small number of main characters and reveal just enough of the world to establish an older time period without biting off more than we can chew.\nOne of the other primary difficulties in The Arborlight are the special effects. Fortunately, my brother and I have a lot of experience with post production effects, and The Arborlight is actually quite practical in nature. It will rely upon effects mostly to supplement the work done by our excellent cinematography and lighting team.\nThis movie is going to be an adventure to create, and it will take all of us using our experience and resources to the fullest, but we're ready to meet the challenges ahead, and you can help to give us the opportunity!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "A Note on Posters", "update_content": "Hey ya'll,\nI should have been more specific in my poster comment in the update.

But the event is destined for disaster as Becca, Tom and the Altered Egos regulars all try to mix their social lives with their gaming lives \u2013 with explosive results.\nMatt Voisine and Rebecca Teran.\nSounds interesting!

I'm so excited!!!!!!!\"\nWeek One Recap Video (more on updates)\nThe Warrior Reborn : The Adventure Game\nWe\u2019ve been deliberately coy about the specifics of the Adventure Game and for good reason. For one, the game is in early pre-production and everything is subject to change (but this is kickSTARTER and not kickFINISHER so folks asking for final game art might want to rethink their question...)\nBut all that is over now.\nWith AbbeyCraft now in the rear view mirror we\u2019re ready to stretch this all the way out to our beta launch and see just how fast the Long Patrol can run.\nPartial Specs:\nGenre: A 3D Progressive Adventure Game in, around (and under) Redwall Abbey\nPlatform(s): Primary is Mac/PC \u2013 probably via Steam. Also a slightly nerfed version on iOS and Android tablets. Consoles like Wii U, PSN or XBLA are realistic options but no commitment there.\nCharacters: Three playable species, current leaders are Mice, Squirrels, and Badgers\nGameplay: Heavy on exploration, interaction and puzzles\nCombat? Yes, there will be combat...just wouldn't be Redwall without it!\nHours of gameplay? Why? Do you have to be somewhere?\nGame Engine: We\u2019re using Unity3D as our game engine. We\u2019ve been using Unity for years and absolutely love it! The screen shots below are in-engine test renders for shaders and lighting...NOT FINAL ART. \nStay tuned...more to come....\nCloister Interior 1\nCloister Interior 2\nCloister Second Floor\n---------------------------\nThe Redwall Series of books by Brian Jacques has captured the hearts of kids and adults for over 20 years. With over 30 million copies sold around the world, it ranks as some of the bestselling fiction of all time.\nWe've recently had the remarkable honor of announcing the first ever Official Redwall Video Game. The project is now ramping up, but it will take time - time in which the massive and deeply engaged audience will be hungry for news, images, video, and communication about anything Redwall-related.\nEnter AbbeyCraft.\nWhile we develop the Adventure Game we want to give you a way to engage, participate, and access special features like exclusive art, beta programs, development forums and more. And what better channel to use than another game in which building is a core concept - Minecraft.\nThere is no official blueprint of Redwall Abbey. So our first task in the creation of any kind of 3D game is to layout a full representation of this storied edifice. Given the challenge, we'd be using Minecraft as a prototyping tool anyway which makes for a perfect opportunity to build an adventure map and possibly a multiplayer server. Within that world we can share, communicate and leak news to the people with the tenacity to follow in Matthias' footsteps across the sandstone floors of this mythical structure.\nWe originally planned to dive right in and get busy creating the full adventure game without any preliminary steps. But then we thought \u201cWe want the most important people, the Redwall fans, to have a say in making this something Brian Jacques would be proud of.\"\nAnd as Minecraft has become a major part of the game community with largely overlapping audiences the fit seemed obvious.\nSoma Games is the lesser-known alter ego of Code-Monkeys. As a team we have built over 300 apps and games on several platforms, but primarily for outside clients like Intel, Aruba Networks and Belkin...so it's easy to have missed our name. But this is in no way our first time around the block.\nSoma and Code-Monkeys are award winning shops (including a MacWorld Best of Show award and Best UX in Intel's Ultimate Coder Challenge) and sought after speakers at events like Casual Connect, Serious Play and NRB.\nShoring up the Soma Games team, we are working closely with Sean Rubin. Sean has been the official Redwall artist for several years now and the unofficial curator of the canon. His participation is of immeasurable value in making sure we properly convey not just the coarse strokes of the books, but also the fine details.  \nAll of the rewards have been selected to reward the True Redwall Fan. Our biggest (non-financial) goal here is to find and engage the kinds of fans that live and breathe Redwall. We know that this story is so loved, so admired, so formative for many people that getting it right is a big priority. But we'll never be able to do that without the input from fans like you. Did Matthias wear a hood, or just a robe? Was Constance 3 mice tall or 4 - it all matters, and our reward list has been designed to attract the die hard fans who refuse to be left out of the worlds first official Redwall game. \nThe work behind the larger game has already started in earnest but there is still a lot of work between here and launch day...and funding is only one of the potential threats to the Adventure Game. This is a place where Kickstarter could do\nso\nmuch\nMore.\nIf this campaign catches a wind like the screams of a hundred eagles and it starts looking like a Double-Fine kind of story, we've still got a ton of headroom here. Those extra funds will go directly and immediately to the Adventure Game game project, opening up levels for extra content, more races, more platforms and just making the generally Bigger, Better and Badger!

Quite a lot, I guess, but we think one of those things is an interesting premise for a horror adventure.\nThe game is heavily based on atmosphere and exploration, and using the two year old child\u2019s perspective. For example you\u2019ll be able to see your own body at all times, and you will have to interact with the environment to find places to hide from dangers.\nOur gameplay prototype from last summer:\nFresh environment teaser:\nThe teasers we have published are captured entirely in-game.\nThere might be threats hiding in every shadow, but there\u2019s no traditional combat. Instead, players will actively have to find places to hide, and avoid confrontation to survive. For example in cupboards and under furniture.\nWe\u2019re aiming to include some puzzle and adventure elements as well, but our main focus lies on exploration, atmosphere and horror.\nMore screenshots \u00bb\nWe've done a lot of experimenting with environmental interaction, so for instance you\u2019ll be able to push, pull and climb objects to reach places, open and close doors, make a staircase out of drawers, peek around corners, carry and place small objects, and the list goes on.\nWe have many goals with Among the Sleep, one for instance being our desire to tell a compelling story both through an interesting storyline and through metaphor, relating to what actually evokes this fear and confusion in the child. We aim to include the surrealistic theme of dreams and children's imagination, both as a setting and an active part of the game.\nMore concept art \u00bb\nWhile travelling through diverse environments inspired by our dreams and driven by the endless imagination of the child, you will have to search for comfort and safety.

As a creative collective of friends, we started our current project Among the Sleep as our thesis project, and we decided to continue working on it after graduating.\nWe love this medium, and want to craft unique and interesting experiences to drive it forward. This means that we experiment all the time, for instance by making and releasing creative side projects for free.\nWe're now at the point in development where we have finished the core gameplay, but there is still a lot of production, as well as a ton of polishing and testing left to do. We want to take our time and make the game as good as possible.\nThe only obstacle we see going forward, is that everyone at Krillbite still work part time jobs on the side to survive while developing Among The Sleep. This inhibits our focus and productivity on the game, and we don\u2019t want to lower our expectations to the quality of the finished game, or delay the release. We hope this Kickstarter will help us deliver the best possible experience we can, within a reasonable timeframe. Another reason to use Kickstarter is our wish to stay independent, and free from the creative boundaries of a publisher.\nWe've found that $200.000 is the amount we need to quit our part-time jobs, and continue working all hours of the day on finishing Among the Sleep.\nIf we are fortunate enough to receive more than our goal, what would we spend it on?\nWe are very satisfied with the existing design of Among the Sleep, but there are numerous things that we\u2018d like to be able to offer you on the side of the game itself.\nLike we mentioned in the Oculus Update Video, we\u2019ll be including a basic implementation either way, but we\u2019d really like to spend some time optimizing and exploring some amazing possibilities with the technology.\nWe\u2019d also very much like to include a proper in-game Commentary Track, so that you can hear our thoughts, anecdotes and other stories from the development of Among the Sleep should you choose.\nYou'll find a ton of rewards to your right, including copies of the game, OST, Boxed limited edition, Art book, T-shirts, Alpha testing, your name in the credits a Skype conference with the team and a Personal plush-Teddy, handmade by us at Krillbite!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the moment, our biggest challenge is that all of us work part time jobs to finance Among the Sleep.

The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well. Just like you, we want Torment to be the best it can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Updated Our Journal (68): Servant of the Tides", "update_content": "tl;dr: Oom\u2019s debut, Content Update, new bonus rewards from Monte Cook Games, and a check-in on backer rewards.\nHey Exiles,\nEric Daily here.

No, we\u2019re not making this up: some people were terrified just by reading the script alone, and we\u2019re striving to top it with the most immersive, oppressive, depressive, (and many other words ending with 'ive') atmosphere ever seen in an adventure. Don\u2019t be fooled by our excitement or apparent silliness; we\u2019re very serious about making Asylum a disturbing and horrifying game that you won\u2019t easily forget.\nCheck out breathtaking in-game screenshots!\nWe\u2019re deliberately keeping details of the story under wraps. We firmly believe that the less you know about the game, the more it will surprise you. There are plenty of inside looks available though: screenshots, promotional videos, trailer, the Interactive Teaser (or really short demo), and more. When it comes to the story, everybody wants to know what Asylum is about, but we\u2019re only willing to reveal what we said in the pitch video and hinted on the trailer...\nYou\u2019ll have to take our word for it: the plot is very twisty and satisfying. The deeper you go and the more attention you pay to your surroundings, the more Hanwell Mental Institute will reveal about its true nature. Every room is bursting with detail, mood, and backstory. There is a lot to investigate and discover and, quite literally, an entire asylum available to explore. Close to 100 rooms, in fact. You might think we\u2019re a bunch of slightly deranged people to have created a game of this scope on our own and with close to no budget\u2026 and you may actually be right.\nHere's a short but polished glimpse into what Asylum has to offer. Yes: playable stuff readily available! You may download for Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. To play, unzip and launch Dagon. Please note that the teaser has mostly been tested on Ubuntu for Linux platforms. For more information and system requirements, visit our website.\nYou can also watch the following videos featuring Bertrand (aka \"Subject E14\") in a most uncomfortable situation. These were released anonymously and went viral before the game was announced: Session One, Session Two, Session Three, and Last Session.\nSenscape is a young company based in Argentina but we have decades of combined experience. Agust\u00edn Cordes has been addicted to the adventure genre ever since he dwelt in the kingdom of Daventry at the tender age of 7. Over the years he has become an active member in the adventure gaming community, has written many reviews, and went on to design and develop Scratches, widely regarded as one of the best horror adventures ever made (he disagrees, but still...). Scratches became a cult sleeper hit and sold over 250,000 copies. Its soundtrack and chilling atmosphere were highly praised at the time but, most importantly, the game is still being actively discussed for its mysterious and gothic plot, equally influenced by H. P. Lovecraft and Hammer Horror films. Asylum aims to build upon that, with an even more immersive atmosphere and story that will haunt you for years to come.\nDownload the Backer Pack to help promote Asylum!\nAgust\u00edn, together with the rest of the Senscape team, also took part in one of the biggest game projects in Argentina, the educational adventure Risk Profile. While this humorous title was never translated to other languages, it was extremely well received in the country, with thousands of kids still clamouring for a sequel.\nYeah... another one. We develop games for art\u2019s sake but we still need funding to make it happen. For starters, we need to pay our rent and buy food, clothes, and loads of coffee. Perhaps in a different timeline our civilization has sorted out the problem of money \u2014 for example, with players allowing us to eat them after they have played our games, but alas, that\u2019s not how it works in our world.\nIt\u2019s true that Asylum is in advanced stages of production. The Hanwell Institute is virtually complete and fully explorable. The script and design have been ready for a long time, most characters have already been modeled, the Dagon engine is mature enough, and the programming is well under way\u2026 In a nutshell: Asylum will happen. But we need your help to make it happen sooner.\nMerely one floor of the Hanwell Mental Institute.\nYour contribution, even if it\u2019s one dollar, will help us tackle this final lap of development with a proper schedule and resources. Right now this is still a \"garage game\" with most team members dedicating time to the project as they can from their homes. If we reach the goal, we will lock ourselves inside an office for the remainder of the year until Asylum is complete. Being able to work together every day in the same room makes a huge difference, especially for such a large project. If you can\u2019t contribute by actually pledging money, spreading the word is more than enough: tweeting, liking on Facebook, just talking about it will also help.\nOh, stretch goals you say? Yes, we have them. We certainly do. And depending on the success of the campaign, we will start revealing them as soon as we approach our initial goal...\nNo publisher today would dare to produce an edition like this. But, we are not publishers, we are huge fans of adventures just like you (hopefully!), and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this delightful edition reminiscent of Infocom games, including the iconic flip cover and booklet attached to the box. In this case, the booklet will be our fancy Record Book of the Insane. This is a fictional look into the Hanwell Mental Institute, its past and present, including character profiles, newspaper cuts, testimonies, and the Register of Patients which can include your name if you pledge for one of our select rewards \u2014 all in glorious quality.\nDoes this bring back any memories? The cover artwork is subject to change, though. We haven't decided yet, but chances are we'll stick to a lovely hand-drawn painting...\nAlso, the box will include feelies. Yes, feelies! In the good old days, veterans used the word 'feelies' to describe quirky extras that were included inside game boxes. We\u2019re committed to producing a few of them, but we won\u2019t spoil the surprises. Just rest assured that you\u2019ll be getting more than just a box and DVD.\nThe Record Book will include all sorts of background information on the Hanwell Mental Institute and its patients, visitors, staff, etc.\nWe have no intention to deliver a big, bulky box whose sole purpose would be to occupy shelf space, but instead we're aiming for a neat, tidy and quality package (slightly nostalgic too!) that we\u2019re positive you\u2019re going to love.\nStretch goals have been announced! For more information about these, check out the updates The Dream-Quest of Stretch Goals and A haunting revelation of our final stretch goal...\nHere\u2019s some of the things you can get from us exclusively on this Kickstarter campaign. Boy, oh boy! Gorgeous T-shirts, beta access, signed boxes, the chance to become immortalized inside Hanwell from just your name to your very own cold and gritty cell, and so much more.

New gameplay footage!\nUpdate #20: GameSpot reveals The Longest Journey Home!\nClick here for MORE updates!\nDreamfall Chapters: The Longest Journey is a 3D adventure game for Mac, Linux and Windows PC that takes the player on an epic journey across the twin worlds of Stark and Arcadia; from a futuristic cyberpunk vision of our world, to a realm of powerful magic and dangerous beauty.\nWith Dreamfall Chapters, we will finally continue the darkly magical story that began in the critically acclaimed and award-winning adventures The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.\nIndependently developed by Red Thread Games, this project brings back the core team behind Dreamfall, including Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist, creator of The Longest Journey saga.\nThe world of Arcadia exists in parallel and balance with ours. It is a world of magic and chaos, a counterweight to Stark, the world of science and order. The Balance between the twin worlds is watched over by the Guardian, who channels the energies of Chaos and Order between Arcadia and Stark.\nSome people are able to move freely between worlds. These very special individuals are called Shifters. There are not many left, and those who can Shift keep it a secret to the world.\nSome people can travel in a different way, dreaming themselves into other worlds, existing in two places at once. They are called Dreamers.\nAt this point, there is only one known Dreamer in the twin worlds: Zo\u00eb Castillo.\nDreamfall Chapters concludes the Dreamer Cycle and the gripping story of Zo\u00eb, the Dreamer.\nRevisiting familiar locations and characters, and introducing new sights and sounds, new faces, new game mechanics, new thrills and challenges, Dreamfall Chapters takes players on an epic journey -- from the dystopian cyberpunk future of Stark, through the mysterious and dreamlike Storytime, to the magical landscapes of Arcadia.\nDreamfall Chapters is a game made for both fans of the saga and new players who are looking for an adventure unlike any other: one that crosses the divide between two completely different and original worlds.\nWith this latest game in the saga, we will recapture the heart and soul of The Longest Journey and improve on the immersion and game mechanics of Dreamfall in order to bring you a fitting, satisfying and emotional conclusion to the Dreamer Cycle.\nExperience a deep and complex storyline that continues the epic saga of The Longest Journey\nExplore a beautiful, rich, detailed, interactive and living world that mixes a cyberpunk vision of the future with magical fantasy, along with a broken and decaying dreamworld\nPlay as three different characters, all on journeys across worlds, through life, and into their own hearts and souls\n3D point-and-click interface and engaging adventure gameplay\nAfter more than six years, we're excited and grateful for the chance to make a sequel to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey! It's been our dream to tell more stories in The Longest Journey universe, and we've brought back the core team behind the saga for this long-awaited sequel.\nThe previous games in the series were made by Funcom but now Red Thread Games has licensed the rights to the saga.

There are massive spoilers ahead.\nWe will release an interactive graphic novel, retelling the story so far, prior to Dreamfall Chapters. There will also be a comprehensive in-game recap, and the game has been designed to introduce new players to the characters and story.\nZo\u00eb Castillo (in-game screenshot)\nThe Undreaming is Unchained.\nThe last time we met Zo\u00eb Castillo, the Dreamer, she was in a deep coma. She had saved the world from the ghost in the machine that had taken residence in the ethereal realm of the Winter, but in the end Zo\u00eb was betrayed and left for dead. Her body is now in a hospital in Casablanca.\nHer mind, however, is elsewhere.\nTrapped inside the mysterious Storytime, Zo\u00eb must learn to control her dreams and confront the past before she can resume her life.\nIn Arcadia, we witnessed April Ryan, the Shifter, mortally wounded by one of the Azadi, foreign invaders of the Northlands. Kian Alvane, an assassin working for the rulers of the Azadi nation, has been sentenced to death for treason. He awaits execution in the prison tower of Friar's Keep.\nIn our world, Stark, the shadowy corporation WatiCorp has released the Dreamer. Half the world is hooked up to the dream machine, and society is crumbling. And in Marcuria, the Azadi are cementing their power once more, while their mystical tower continues to harvest dreams.\nUnless something is done, unless our heroes can awake and be reborn, the future is bleak. What is WatiCorp planning? Who is the Prophet? How are the Azadi involved?\nThe answers to those questions will be found in Dreamfall Chapters.\nPlenty of familiar faces will return, along with many of the original voice actors from both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall.\nPlayers will experience the story through the eyes of three different characters as their unique paths and separate plots intersect.\nThe central character of our story is Zo\u00eb Castillo, a twenty-one year old girl who saved the world in Dreamfall before falling into a deep coma over a year ago.\nPlayers will once again play as Zo\u00eb as she learns to use her emerging talents, escapes the Storytime, travels to Europolis and eventually crosses the Divide into the magical world of Arcadia.\nZo\u00eb (actual in-game model)\nThe second playable character in the game is Kian Alvane. We will have more information on this character soon, on our official website.\nIn-game real-time screenshot of Kian Alvane\nMany favourite characters will also return, including Crow, sidekick extraordinaire; Blind Bob, the not-so-blind beggar; Benrime Salmin, innkeeper of the Journeyman Inn and member of the resistance; Roper Klacks, author of 'Farewell to my Wizardin' Days'; the enigmatic Vagabond; the equally enigmatic Brian Westhouse; April's old friend Emma; and Zo\u00eb's ex-boyfriend Reza Temiz, whose identity was left in doubt at the end of Dreamfall -- and more!\nAnd, of course, players will learn the destiny of April Ryan, and see the continuation of her storyline. From unlikely heroine to haunted rebel, April's life is central to The Longest Journey saga, and we will answer the question that has haunted everyone:\nIs April Ryan dead?\nStark is a cyberpunk vision of future Earth. Having suffered a setback with the mysterious Collapse in 2209, society was on the rebound when Dreamfall began.\nIt's now 2220, and WatiCorp's Dreamer has been released. Society is slowly crumbling as billions find themselves hopelessly addicted to lucid dreams. Linked up to the dangerous machines at home and in opium den-like Dream Factories, they escape reality by dreaming themselves into oblivion.\nArcadia is a magical mirror to our world; a realm where science and logic are replaced with magic and chaos. It is a wondrous world of strange species and grand cities, of epic armies and vast, unexplored landscapes.\nZo\u00eb meets a Tree Spirit in Dreamfall Chapters\nFrom the Northlands and its capital, Marcuria -- now occupied by the Azadi army -- and the distant Southlands, where the Iron Court rules over a dangerous and wild continent, to the mysterious west, where the Azadi nation have built their powerful empire, Dreamfall Chapters opens this magical world even more.\nAutumnal Marcuria, from Dreamfall Chapters (in-game screenshot)\nAnd finally there is Storytime, the place where every story begins, and where dreams come to life...\nThe Storytime in Dreamfall Chapters\nDreamfall Chapters is a 3D adventure game featuring a combination point-and-click and direct control interface. For a look at our prototype, check out this video:\nSunset in Shady Quay (real-time, in-game screenshot from Dreamfall Chapters)\nWe are combining the best parts of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall to create what we hope will be another classic adventure; a game filled with mature dialogue and challenging puzzles, exciting exploration, complex and fun characters, thrilling plot twists and an engaging and emotional story.\nDreamfall Chapters will have the magic, heart and soul, and the lush, interactive environments of The Longest Journey, filled with things to look at and explore. It will have an interface that harkens back to traditional point-and-click adventures. It will have the detailed 3D worlds of Dreamfall, where players can lose themselves in expansive locations and living environments, along with puzzles and challenges that are completely plot-driven and an integral part of the game's narrative.\nWe've brought back the core team members from Dreamfall: The Longest Journey to make Dreamfall Chapters, including award-winning writer and designer Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist, creator of The Longest Journey saga; Dag Scheve, co-writer of Dreamfall; and Christer Sveen, art director on Dreamfall.\nJoining the team are lead designer Martin Bruusgaard (Age of Conan, The Secret World), technical directors Kjetil Hjeldnes (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, The Secret World) and Eigil Jarl Halse (Dreamfall, The Secret World), artist Sigbj\u00f8rn Gal\u00e5en (Dreamfall, Age of Conan, The Secret World), producer Rakel Johnsen (Age of Conan, The Secret World), and programmers Quintin Pan (Age of Conan, The Secret World) and Audun T\u00f8rnquist (The Longest Journey).\nThe Dreamfall Chapters team is highly experienced, talented and passionate, and we know, respect and love The Longest Journey universe.

It has allowed us to create a playable prototype, featuring several locations, characters, and a working GUI and control system.\n\nWe have also joined forces with Blink Studios, the talented team behind the upcoming action-RPG Skar: The Hammer Returns, to ensure that we have some of the best artists in the business working on the game.\n\nWe started development on a prototype several months ago, in order to be able to make some key design decisions and to reality-check our ideas and ambitions.

The link is here.\n\nLATEST UPDATE: 48 hours to go! And a thankyou video. \nPREVIOUS UPDATES: Multiplayer unlocked! Customisation stretch goal announced.\nPhysical reward tier details, reward tier changes: New tiers!\nA design for the t-shirt and a brand new video. Take a look!\nWe've announced a multiplayer stretch goal at \u00a380,000. Please help us get there!\nWe're funded! Thanks, everyone. Check out our stretch goals just here. Three of them have already been unlocked.\nYou can find all our other updates, including our gameplay video, over here.\nSir, You Are Being Hunted is a single-player first-person game of desperate survival in a world where mechanical aristocrats hunt humans for sport.\nOur game world is brought to life by what we call The British Countryside Generator: a procedural engine that means that every player gets a different experience. We can generate the islands on which the action takes place in mere seconds, creating unique, highly detailed environments and an experience that is different each time you play. Thanks to the work we've done with this engine, Sir, You Are Being Hunted takes place in a recognizably British landscape, the inhabitants of which are a mockery of the aristocratic gent and his ecosystem.\nWe love our weird heritage of British science fiction and horror, and we're aiming to bring it to life with some of the best tools that game development has to offer.\nRobots meet and drink tea in abandoned villages, poachers lurk in reed-beds, and red-eyed hounds patrol the moor: these are the things you will be dealing with as you fight for survival across our open-world environments.\nSir, You Are Being Hunted gathers up elements of our favourite things: exploration, non-linearity, AI interaction, survival, robots, sinister butlers, and hot drinks, and blends them into a rich pixelly pulp.\nCombat is a big part of the game, but choose your battles wisely. This is primarily a challenge of brainy stealth: so flee across the countryside, hide in dense woodland, and sneak into villages to loot the haunted buildings for biscuits and shotgun shells. The approach you take in escaping the island is up to you.\nAnd do be careful: you are being hunted.  \nGentlemen automata hunt humans for sport.\nWhat Are The Key Game Features? \nSir, You Are Being Hunted is a first-person game set in an open world. Your mission is to escape from the archipelago on which you have been stranded. That means surviving being hunted, looting abandoned buildings, and collecting up scattered fragments of a mysterious machine which should enable you to get home. \nSir, You Are Being Hunted includes: \nProcedural tools to generate, save, and explore your own landscapes.\nOpen-ended gameplay: choose how you want to play. Complete the game non-lethally, or use whatever you can find to bring down the tweedbot menace. \nA Thief-style visibility-meter combined with our own foliage-based stealth system. \nUnique generative soundtrack. \nA disembodied sinister butler! \nPubs! \nNo DRM! \nVaried loot including weapons, traps, booze, marmalade, tea, something that may or may not be bacon, and a dead rabbit. \nFires to cook that rabbit on. (And other things besides!) \nMac, Windows and Linux versions. \nStrange lore and pipe-smoking moustache-wearing mechanical locals. \nPlease note that all of what we've listed here is already present in our prototype, but much of it is currently in a early, undeveloped state. Kickstarter will help us deliver the game with final, professional art. It already looks pretty good, but we want it to look and sound breath-taking. \nHunters stalk the player through crop fields.\nWhat Will Kickstarter Money Do? \nThe target we're aiming for here is going to allow us to complete the task that we've already put so much time and effort into. We've invested so much in the prototype, as you can see in these screenshots and videos, but they nevertheless contain lots of placeholder material - particularly in animation and audio - and now we need your help to make that into a full-fledged game. \nWe don't have a full time artist, so Kickstarter money will be vital to helping us commission the art and animation we need to fill the game up with exciting assets: new biomes to explore, new buildings to explore, more robots to flee from and do battle against, more strange things to collect up and pack your inventory with. Most importantly, we need money to tweak the systems that will bring this project to life: the robots themselves. \nThe robots need quality animations, and lots of them, which does not come cheap. They also need better-developed AI, which is all about giving our two programmers more time with their tools. Furnishing our robots with intelligence and personality is no simple task, and we need time and money to get on with it. This project is about us making the kind of game we want to play, and as experienced and dedicated gamers, we know that this is the kind of game many of you will want to play, too. It's an open-ended experience which you'll decide the pace and direction of as you play. \nThe better we do here on Kickstarter, the deeper that experience will become in the finished game. \nShotguns get a fair bit of use.\nBut Who Are You Guys? \nBig Robot consists of two full-time team members, two part-time team members, and a small supporting cast of artists. We've already produced two games: generative music sequencer puzzle game AVSEQ, which you can find on Steam, and Fallen City, a BIMA-award nominated educational game about the value of cities which was commissioned by Channel 4. You can find that freely available on the C4 website. \nJim Rossignol initially founded Big Robot to produce the Channel 4-commissioned educational game, Fallen City, and then went on to focus on projects based on generative and procedural design, thanks to his creative work with Tom Betts. Jim is a veteran games journalist and author of the book This Gaming Life, which was published by the University Of Michigan in 2008. Many of you will already be familiar with him from his day job at the PC-gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun, or from his time writing for outlets such as PC Gamer or Wired magazine. Jim is the creative lead on Sir, You Are Being Hunted, and is responsible for the overall direction of the project. \nJames Carey is our lead designer and production co-ordinator. You may know him from his work on Bohemia Interative's Arma II, his time at Total War devs, The Creative Assembly, or from our own previous games Fallen City and AVSEQ. James has a hand in all aspects of the game, and is particularly interested in simulationist approaches to design. \nThe man behind the majority of the maths involved is Tom Betts, a veteran programmer with a keen interest in generative and procedural systems. Tom designed and wrote our generative music puzzle game AVSEQ, and has been working on digital installations and in videogame academia for many years. Tom's work is what powers our procedural world generation, and he has also created a generative music system which will be furnished by audio from digital artist Andy Holbrook. \nDan Puzey, who has been our consultant programmer, helping with all aspect of the project, is a lead architect for a major commercial software company. We've been enormously lucky to have him working with us in his spare time. \nOur art needs have been met by a small team of talented freelancers. Talented indie devs Frogames' lead artist Christophe Canon has helped produce 3D models and textures, while Martin Davies (PC Gamer contributor and talented illustrator) has produced our beautiful hand-drawn 2D art and UI elements. Sir, You Are Being Hunted is being made in Unity Pro, with our own procedural terrain engine, the British Countryside Generator. \nBleak British landscapes are generated automagically.\nWhat About Stretch Goals? \nStretch goals are additional features that we can promise if we hit higher levels of funding, now that the \u00a340,000 goal has been reached. Here's what we're planning.\n\u00a345,000 - The Landowner UNLOCKED\nAt this amount we'll be expanding our NPC roster with \u201cThe Landowner.\u201d This chap is an aberrant mechanical ultra-toff. He's a leader among hunters, and the nightmare gaze of his glowing monocle means near-certain death, and at the very least lots of peril. With The Landowner in play, the player is truly in trouble \u2013 his tracking skills and his riflemanship are peerless. Fear him.\n\u00a350,000 - Hunting! UNLOCKED\nThis stretch goal will allow us to include additional wildlife-slaying functionality. You will be able to hunt pheasants and rabbits and then cook them for sustenance. This will provide a complementary mode of survival for players aside from scavenging, as well as furnishing the world of Sir with more life. (And death.)\n\u00a355,000 - The Castle Biome UNLOCKED\nA completely new island type on which a ruined castle is procedurally generated across the entire island. This will provide the game with both a radically different terrain, and an atmospheric arena in which to be systematically hunted down and shot. (We're really excited about this one \u2013 more proc-gen makes Tom happy.)\n\u00a360,000 - Hot Air Balloon Spotter Patrols UNLOCKED\nThis will probably take a little bit of explaining. Basically, the robots will man a hot air balloon which will make passes over the islands. From there they'll be able to direct hunters on the ground, and take pot-shots at you if and when they spot you. This adds some verticality to think about, especially as balloons are silent most of the time. Keep your eyes on the skies! These balloon patrols might be slow moving, but they will provide platforms for the hunters to snipe and spot you over a large area at any one time, and as such should provide serious jeopardy.\n\u00a370,000 - The Riders UNLOCKED\n\nOur most ambitious NPCs will take on the form of a classic British fox hunt, one of the favoured bloodsports of the rich and landed. These red-coated rider robots will be the most merciless - and the fastest - hunters in the archipelago. Once they have you sighted, well, run, Fox, run. We're asking a bit more for this thanks to the additional complexity of riding characters, and we're certain they'll make the most exciting addition to our NPC arsenal.\n\n\u00a380,000 - Multiplayer UNLOCKED\n\nIt goes without saying that multiplayer is an extremely complex undertaking in its own right, and because the focus of Sir is on a single-player game, we are not going to promise multiplayer on release. We are a tiny team, and must hit one objective at time. What we will do, however, is provide a multiplayer component to all backers when this goal is unlocked, soon after the initial release of the game. We've had plans for multiplayer for a long time, and we agree with those of you who have suggested that some manner of multiplayer suits the nature of the game. \nCurrently we're planning a 4-player game, where the players can compete or co-operate with each other as they are hunted by the robots. Only one player can get off the island, and so winning will require getting others to sacrifice themselves, or you to sacrifice others. The choice, we hope, will be one that drives the game.\nWell, we can dream, eh?\n\u00a3100,000 - Character Customisation!\nThis is something that will benefit both the single-player game and the multi-player expansion to come. Right now we're planning a standard player avatar for multiplayer, and we hadn't anticipated any character creation for single-player. What we'd like to do, however, is to add character creation and customisation to the whole game, so that the avatar you create can appear in both your solo experience, and in whatever you do online.\nWhat this means is a character creation screen where you can name your avatar, customise their appearance \u2013 moustaches, tweeds, boots, monocles, and other accessories \u2013 so that you have a unique character in the game world. Furthermore you'll be able to choose a number of \u201ctalents\u201d that will have an affect in both the single and multi-player game. These will allow you to push your specialisation towards a particular direction: perhaps increasingly your constitution for a vitality bonus, or pushing up your stealth ability with the appropriate selection.\nThese won't be \u201cclasses\u201d or anything like that, but more like a couple of abilities from something like a talent tree. Small bonuses that push your advantages this way or that. This doesn't mean we're looking at other RPG elements \u2013 the game will still be about your skill and what you find in the world. It just allows you a little more depth in focusing how you want to play the game.\nBut there's more! This feature will allow us to add an optional (turn it off if you don't want to use it) third-person view. The game is still first-person, don't worry! We're just adding another option, which we hope will bring another layer of depth to the single-player game, and should help with stealth activities, as well as letting you see the character you have put together. We only have just over four days to unlock this final goal.\nLet's make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are challenges in any game design project, but we are formidably equipped to deal with them. Our team each have years of experience in their respective fields, and we've shipped two games - Fallen City for Channel 4 and AVSEQ on Steam - as a team. But more importantly: we are making the game we want to play. That alone means we cannot afford to fail.\n\nWe've already proven that the game can be made - we have a working prototype which you've probably already seen in the videos and images on this page - the challenge now is to polish that prototype into a mature and engaging experience: one that will be memorable and unusual. Our goal is to create something genuinely interesting, and we're well on the way to doing that.\n\nWith your help, we'll bring home a veritable trophy of a game.\n\nSo please Pledge!\n\nEvery dollar brings us closer to making this the game it deserves to be.

Feeling the project neither fits the generic category of music video nor a scored short film we\u2019ve termed the project a Callioscope\u2014a play on the on combination of calliope, the steam organ that supplied music to early carnivals and circuses, kinetoscope, the early motion picture device, and kaleidoscope, the optical toy that blends different elements and mediums to create a unique whole. \nThe story follows our main character, imprisoned and forced to work as a freak in a nautical carnival that is trapped inside the belly of a steam-powered whale. He dreams of flying free through the sky with his wings, which have grown shriveled and weak during his time as an indentured performer. When he finds the perfect opportunity to realize his dreams, a musical romp of mayhem and liberation ensues.\n\"From the sea, my minds afloat \n I try to row over the ocean floor\n From the sea, I listen low \n adrift my soul, over the waves that grow\n from a life so long ago\"\n Sample artwork from the \"From the Sea\" Callioscope\nStoryboard Sample\nTHE MAGICIAN:\nAnimator Austin Hillebrecht has been working in film, well, since he can remember. He attended Lifeways College in New Zealand for animation and has won awards for his short animated films The Missing Sock and Two Sizes Too Big, as well as his feature with long time film partner Sean Parker Coup De Cinema. Austin currently works for Bent Image Lab in Portland, Oregon. The \"From the Sea\" Callioscope marks his first endeavor into a mixed media musical collaboration.\nView prior projects and artwork\nhttps://vimeo.com/croonstreet\ncroonstreet.deviantart.com/gallery\nTHE TONE SPINNERS:\nJosh and Mer have been a musical force in Portland Oregon for the past year and a half. Their debut album Planet Music was produced by Jason Carter (Frank Black, Pete Yorn, Art Brut) and was met with much critical acclaim. The duo has since been playing shows veraciously including opening for national touring acts as well as playing several showcases at this years SXSW. Endlessly inspired, they will release their record The Tithe next year.\n\"Planet Music is a fantastic combination of silky vocals, distorted effects, steady upbeat drums, classic indie folk guitar, otherworldly synths, and an overall terrific grasp on a combination of indie sub-genres intertwined to create a distinctive sound that Josh And Mer can proudly call their own.\" -Indie Shuffle\n\"Schroeder and Adelaide take turns with lead and background vocals, which really helps to balance what is undoubtedly their strongest attribute. There is a wholeness to Planet Music that is maintained in it\u2019s softly building and expressive sound. Josh and Mer stay true to what they know, but show they're not afraid to experiment with reverb and drawn-out synths.\" -buffaBLOG\nhttp://www.facebook.com/joshandmer\nhttp://joshandmer.com/\nListen to \"From the Sea\"\nPhoto credits: Erik Simkins http://simkinsphotography.com \n\nWe graciously thank you for checking out our project.

One of the biggest challenges we\u2019ll face is to make sure we generate interest around the project as we move through production. We plan to give regular updates on the production of the \u201cFrom the Sea\" Callioscope posting photos and giving sneak peeks of the work via our Facebook page and website as well as on Kickstarter. Our partners Josh and Mer also play regular live shows, thus offering constant creative updates. \n \nThis project has been in the planning stage since October of 2011. While no amount of planning can anticipate all the twists and turns of the production process, we have a solid team of dedicated and experienced problem solvers that will stop at nothing to see its vision come to life.

In the story, Jack Fall(KC Guyer) is a man consumed by the loss of his wife Katie(Suzanne Tufan) and his best friend Ryan(Joshua St. James). When one day Jack is mysteriously presented with a second chance with the ones he has lost, he sets out to make things right. However, just as things are looking up, an undiscovered truth presents itself. Jack is forced to re-evaluate his loss and choose what he is willing to sacrifice for the ones he loves.\nThe beautiful Lakeview where we will be shooting Jack Fall\nSo a little about us:\nWe are a passionate group of filmmakers from the Pacific Northwest. We have all worked together on various projects but for the first time, we are all coming together to produce our first feature film. We have everything we need to make a great feature film, however, we just need to little bit more to really bring this thing together. \nIt's important to note that every dollar earned through our kickstarter will go directly to improvements on this production. Whether it's helping out with meals for cast & crew or improving some of our props & locations; you'll directly see how the film is improved through your donations. \nScouting Locations\nAlso, we have set $10,000 as our goal because it takes care of some of the basic needs for our production. Such as being enough money to bring on our SAG actors and fulfill the requirements that come with a SAG ultra-low budget film agreement. This being said, there are still many areas in which we could use funding beyond that. For instance, the building of more elaborate props, better lighting packages, better set dressing, practical stunts and effects, post production workflow, camera/lens rentals  ..etc. So please help us reach our secondary goal of $50,000 as well.\nAnother beautiful Jack Fall location.\nWe are committed to making this project happen! We've already locked down some great cast, crew & locations, we have an amazing story to tell and with your help we're really going to bring this story to life. \nSome of our wonderful cast and crew.\nBelow are just some members of our great cast!\nKc Guyer - As - Jack Fall\nWe are thrilled to have KC Guyer as Jack Fall. KC Guyer is an upcoming star who has recently been featured on shows such as NBC's Grimm.

Alan is the father of Jack and a key supporting character for Jack Fall. Simply put Dennis is an incredibly talented actor. Coming from a theater background Dennis has flown just below the radar. Dennis will truly bring Alan to life.\nJoshua St. James - As - Ryan\nWe are excited to announce that Joshua St. James will be joining our talented cast. Joshua will be playing the role of Ryan; best friend of Jack.\nBrian Sutherland - As - Jeremy\nAdding icing to the cake Brian Sutherland will be playing the role of Jeremy a Local Officer of the law.

The SE Oregon area can lead to unpredictable weather. However, after having grown up filming in the pacific northwest we have grown accustomed to these conditions and we have planned out a shooting schedule that allows us to deal with on location shooting as effectively as possible.\n\nOne location in particular that we will be shooting in is the Alvord desert. The thing that makes this location tricky is that half of the year the desert is dry and the other half of the year the desert is completely flooded.... our script calls for both circumstances. We have prepared for this by designing a shooting schedule that will start with shooting in the dry season and end during the wet season allowing us several weeks of cushion on either side. \n\nAnother aspect that makes our script tricky is the amount of twilight scenes we have. To prepare for this we have done several test shoots using sky replacement, set extensions, DTN conversions ect and have come up with a very satisfying result that we're excited to share with everybody in the final product.\n\nAll in all we have made a very strong effort to lock down as many aspects as possible and follow the age old film making tradition of prepare for the worst, hope for the best. We have backup cameras and backups to almost all of our gear, we have a 2nd unit camera team ready to send out for pickup shots, we have spent several months locking down locations and setting up backup locations in the event that anything should fall through. A lot of preparation has gone into making this the best we possibly can. We have everything we need to make a great film, but with your help, we can really improve upon some of those small details that really make a film great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Backer rewards update", "update_content": "Hello, Youtube gave us a new link for tonights Live QA at 7:30.\nyou will find the stream here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHbkoB0Q7c54Jsb-dmQs2Q/live\nSee you soon, \nMichael"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "New Link for tonight's QA", "update_content": "Hey everyone!

We want to reward you for helping us finish our game, because ultimately we're making it for you.\n(Please note: the imagery below is only a representation of the rewards and doesn't reflect the final product)\nBroken Sword is a point and click adventure game series starring unwilling hero George Stobbart, an intrepid American lawyer, and Nico Collard, a sassy French freelance journalist. Through the series George and Nico are unwittingly drawn into sinister and terrifying conspiracies, requiring them to uncover ancient mysteries and unravel myths across the globe. Nerve, cunning and guile are essential in order to conquer these compelling adventures. \nThe four games in the series have won or been nominated for many awards, including:\n4 BAFTAs (Best Adventure, Best Story, Best PC Game, Best Design)\nBest European Adventure - European Game Awards \nBest Video Game Script - Writer's Guild of Great Britain\nPocket Gamer Gold Award - Pocket Gamer Awards\nExcellence in Writing - Game Developers Choice Awards\nThe games are regularly awarded exceptional review scores: for example Broken Sword: Director's Cut (iPhone) currently has a Metacritic (average) score of 91%!\nWhen a mysterious painting is stolen during an armed raid on a Paris gallery, George and Nico are thrown by chance into the investigation together. From Paris to London and beyond, the trail becomes a race against time as dark forces from Europe's turbulent past are woken from their slumber. Broken Sword characters old and new are encountered - but who can George and Nico trust? The journey they are on reveals a conspiracy as old as the written word, whose ancient heresies will cause innocent blood to spill once more...\nWELL, WE'VE GOT THE TEAM BACK TOGETHER. Charles Cecil has assembled his team - including many of the original Revolution crew. Rolf Saxon (voice of George) is brushing dust off his microphone and other former voice actors from the series are ready to roll.\nTHE 2D ARTISTS ARE BACK IN TOWN. Yes we are going back to our 2D roots. We've searched high and low for the best artists to translate the original charm to a contemporary adventure.  We've sourced artists that have worked at Disney, Dreamworks, Nickelodeon, Universal, Aardman, Sony and 20th Century Fox. Backgrounds are drawn in 2D by experienced layout artists. Game characters are created and animated in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved as 2D frames so we can deliver ultra high quality visuals in full HD glory. \nThe game will be fully localised, with speech, into German and French and, we hope, other languages including Spanish and Italian. \nRevolution adventures have had considerable success - but the traditional publishing model has prevented us receiving the required royalties to fund future games. With limited financial reserves we have been unable to fund our own titles and so we have not benefited from their success. Now you can help us to change this. For the first time in our history, we will be funding an original adventure game: Broken Sword - the Serpent's Curse. This will give us full creative freedom, and let us work with you. We promise to keep you up to date with all aspects of development and we will value your support. \nDevelopment of the game is going well - we hope that you like what you see. Kickstarter funding will allow us to proceed at a faster rate, and ensure the game achieves its ambitious design. Without this funding we will risk having to cut back features and delay the game's release.\nWhether you are able to back this project or not, if you're a fan of the Broken Sword games then please share this with your friends so they can help make the next Broken Sword the best game yet!\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST \nMEET THE TEAM UPDATES\nUpdate 7: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Tim Robins\nUpdate 8: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Tony Warriner\nUpdate 10: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Nina Roussakoff\nUpdate 12: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Joost Peters\nUpdate 14: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Robert Megone\nUpdate 15: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Craig Gardiner\nUpdate 18: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Tori Davis\nUpdate 19: Mini Update: Meet The Team - Nana Louise Nielsen\nPLEASE CLICK ON THE LINKS BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #103", "update_userinfo": "Beyond A Steel Sky!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nIt's been quite some time since we last got in touch! \nSome of you might have already spotted updates and news about our latest project on our Discord/ Twitter/ Facebook/ or Instagram channels, but for those who haven't we're super excited for you see what we've been doing since The Serpent's Curse."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #102", "update_userinfo": "Charles' Christmas Message", "update_content": " 'Another year, another Christmas video, and another opportunity to summarise what we have done through the year\u2026\u2019\n\nAnd so begins Charles\u2019 seasonal pontification (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only lasts a couple of minutes).\n\nWorld records have been gained and lost.

The Aviator Travel Jib is a professional, ultra light weight, compact camera jib (camera crane) that lets you get cinematic, sweeping camera moves anywhere in the world.\nThe Aviator Travel Jib compacts down to 24 inches, extends to 6 feet, weighs less than 3 \u00be pounds (supporting cameras up to 6lbs!) and sets up in under a minute. That makes it the perfect camera motion accessory whether you\u2019re shooting on the other side of town or the other side of the world. Use it to shoot weddings, extreme sports, documentaries, indie films, music videos, real estate, travel, commercials, corporate, and more to dramatically raise your production value.\nThe Aviator kit comes complete with a fluid pan base, a high end padded bag, mounting hardware, bubble levels, monitor/accessory mounting ports, and ballast bag.\nThanks to the included fluid pan base, The Aviator works great with any photo or video tripod rated to support 17lbs or more.\nWhat are the rewards?\nWhat will we use the money for? We are ready to start production and your pledge will help us pay for the many molds, materials, and other manufacturing costs involved in bringing The Aviator to market.\nWhen will the rewards ship? We have been through several prototypes and are ready to start manufacturing. The factory is ready for us to place the order. That means if we make our funding goal The Aviator should ship by August.\nWhat makes The Aviator Travel Jib so great? Jibs (camera cranes) stabilize your camera while moving it through space around and above your subjects creating graceful, sweeping moves that you just can\u2019t get any other way.\nUnlike normal jibs that are heavy, large, expensive, and a big hassle to set up, severely limiting the locations and situations where filmmakers could put them to use, The Aviator is super portable, lightweight, compact, and affordable.\nThe Aviator features leg locks designed by world renowned tripod makers 3 Legged Thing. And they are supplying us with their exclusive 8 core Stealth Carbon Fiber. We\u2019re even manufacturing The Aviator at their factory! Thanks 3LT!!!\nWhat skill level of shooter is this for?

My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

With one week left we are declaring it OFFICIAL CRUNCH TIME so if you haven't shared word of this project somewhere online, now's your final chance. Let's end with a big bang!\nLove and huge gratitude,\nThe Fabulous (and touring!) Downey Brothers xoxo\n(from May 31st) The Fabulous Downey Brothers are thrilled to be kicking off their first ever tour this August with America's greatest air guitar band AIRPOCALYPSE (from America's Got Talent)! After winning both the fans' and judges' pick for Best Live Band at this year's Olympia Music Awards, we started to wonder how the rest of the country would feel about us - that's why we're hitting the road with a small stint down the west coast to test the touring waters!\nAt the moment we have ten stops lined up in cities like Portland, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco. We are locking down venues as we speak and have a van on reserve, ready to go. Our swag is being made and inventoried. Our friends and fans are spreading the word. We even have someone to watch the cats while we're away...!\nWe plan to combine our earnings from Kickstarter with what we individually and collectively save between now and August from our live shows. The success of this campaign will assist us with the basics we need to tour:\nLodging (1 room w/ a AAA discount for 6 people)\nFood and Drink (2 meals / day)\nTransportation and Fuel (1 van traveling approx. 2,500 mi.)\nAAA and Repair Costs (1-yr. membership plus oil changes, safety inspection) \nAny contribution regardless of size is hugely helpful and very much appreciated and gets us that much closer to our modest goal. If you're strapped for cash, no worries there - simply sharing this campaign with others is great as well - and it won't take but a moment of your time!\nIn closing, we know that touring seems like a crazy idea nowadays. Let's face it - with gas prices skyrocketing and YouTube proving such an easy, direct outlet to fans what's the point of wasting all that time and money hitting the road? Well, the answer is simple - there is just no replacing the live show experience, period. The sights... the sounds... the energy coming off the stage and the crowd... these are things you can't replicate even with a bazillion pixels in HD 3D. We all grew up experiencing our favorite bands live and these shows were nothing short of life-changing. We firmly believe that there are simply no digital substitutes for that kind of spectacle. With your support we're confident we can offer this live experience via our summer tour - and we can't thank you enough for the chance to do so.\nXOXO,\nThe Fabulous Downey Brothers\n(All video courtesy of The Fabulous Downey Brothers and AIRPOCALYPSE)\n(\"Fizz\" audio courtesy of The Fabulous Downey Brothers)\n(All images courtesy of The Fabulous Downey Brothers, everystockphoto.com, archive.org, public-domain-image.com, and freedigitalphotos.net)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Final Goodbye and Thank You!", "update_content": "Well, the tour was great!

More information on Kicking it Forward \nDave\nHi. It\u2019s Dave again. Thanks for watching our presentation. We had fun making it and I hope you enjoyed the humorous tone, but I in all seriousness this project is very dear to me. \nI have a great passion for these Sherlock Holmes mysteries. In the original products we really had to crush the video to make it fit and Holmes deserves so much better. I\u2019d love to re-master these games for modern systems with the kind of video you saw in the excerpts. I\u2019d love to do this for both existing Holmes fans and to attract new fans that may not be familiar with how much fun it is to solve mysteries, especially in this style of a game. You see this is a very different type of game than most people are used to. \nIt revolves around using game \"tools\" where you choose who/what to investigate and where to direct Holmes and Watson to solve a mystery that appears to be stumping even Scotland Yard. Using some of these tools costs you \"clue points.\" Your goal is to solve the case in the fewest number of clue points as possible. Perusing the four newspapers does not cost you clue points and is a great way to gather your initial set of clues. Then, use that information (along with the London Directory) to decide where to send the famous detectives (or the local ruffians \u2013 the Baker Street Irregulars) to solve these cases. Watching pertinent scenes and scouring Holmes\u2019 files will cost you clue points but may very well reveal the evidence you need to bring your case before the Queen\u2019s magistrate! These games are great fun and are something you can even enjoy with friends and family as you solve each mystery. For More info on how the game plays, see the update tab above!\nWell, that\u2019s about it. We want to be good stewards of your pledges so I have posted in the FAQ at the bottom of the page exactly where the money would go if we hit our goal and if we went over.\nI hope you will back us in this effort and in return enjoy the special rewards exclusively for backers that you can read about below. Thanks again.\nNow, come Watson, on to the rewards!\nThis pledge is open to an unlimited number of people. When the games are completed, we will provide links to download ALL nine exclusive Mac or PC versions of the Sherlock Mysteries - each featuring more than 30 minutes of video! If possible, we will allow you to download the mysteries as they are produced so you won\u2019t have to wait!\n9 Video Adventure Mysteries via an exclusive download!\nEach mystery will utilize a number of in-game tools. You can find clues to solve each crime by reading the Times, tracking down suspects in Holmes' directory and, more importantly, viewing the detectives in action. Using the notebook, you can keep a running log of clues before finally presenting and defending your case before the Queen's magistrate!\nUse your in-game tools to solve each mystery!\nWith this pledge, you\u2019ll get the previously-mentioned downloads plus a digital DRM-free soundtrack by composer Greg Brown called \u201cThe Consulting Concerto.\u201d This ten-track download will feature ALL NEW music based on each of the mysteries. \nYou\u2019ll be added to the in-game credits as, appropriately enough, a Hound of the Baskervilles \u2013 based on Doyle\u2019s third Holmes novel and inspired by the legend of a not-to-be-trifled-with fearsome dog!\nA musical masterpiece based on a menagerie of mysteries!\nYou get ALL nine mysteries on your Apple IOS or Android portable device of choice (phones and tablets). These mysteries will be released to you as we publish them. You will also be listed in the credits as one of Moriarty's Henchmen (or Henchwomen if you prefer :) and all the previous rewards.\nSleuthing at its finest - at your fingertips! \nLike the first three, this tier is offered to an unlimited number of people who want to be credited as working for the illustrious Scotland Yard. Here, you get the previous pledge tiers, plus you\u2019ll also get an oversized recreation of a Times newspaper from 1889. We will ask you to supply your name (or the name of a family member) and we will insert itinto one of the articles in the paper. YOU can decide which kind of article it goes in, from birth announcements or entertainment to crime scenes or obituaries! You\u2019ll also be credited in-game as an Inspector of the Yard, making Lestrade proud!\nA personalized 1889 Times Newspaper with callout!\nThis is the last tier offered to an unlimited number of people. You will be credited as a reporter for the London Times, the only paper Holmes truly trusts. Not only will you get a copy of the reproduced London Times paper but you will be able to write your OWN article for our editors! \nA substantial article in the London Times \u2013 written by you!\nThe second reward for this pledge is from celebrated artist Arnaud Demaegd. He has created many illustrations for the new Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective board game and we will ship you a BEAUTIFUL poster from the cover \u2013 a stunning portrait featuring the master detective himself. See below! \nLastly, you\u2019ll be credited in-game as a Reporter for the Times. All previous reward tiers are included as well. \nA stunning Holmes poster!\nLimited to 450 people, this tier allows YOU the opportunity to be on the game team and get your name immortalized in one of the mysteries! (Shout outs to those who figured out the significance of 221! :)\nWe will put your name in the London Directory \u2013 the main game tool that you will use to move about the city, gather clues and solve nefarious crimes.\nYour name appears in the main London Directory!\nNot only will your name be canonized in one of the mysteries (allowing you to lord your new found fame over friends and family), but you can help us write Holmes' description or observation about you for his files. \nYour name and observation in Holmes\u2019 personal files!\nAlso, since you can send one of the Baker Street Irregulars to your in-game residence, you can write their salty description about their visit as well! (Note that in all cases, the amount of text that can be written is limited to the game interface.)\nFinally, you will be credited as a game character! All previous rewards are included EXCEPT the second $221 tier - Friend of the Good Doctor pledge rewards.  \nA description of you from one of the Baker Street Irregulars!\nLimited to 140 people, this $221 tier is the second opportunity to be on the game team, securing your fame in a Sherlock mystery. This tier is suitable for those who love to write! Along with the previous Reporter for the Times pledge reward, in which you can write an article for the physical Times paper, you have the opportunity to write an article WITHIN the game. Put on your best Victorian hat and we will assign you at least one important article for the Times. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be around to help you make it sound like it\u2019s from 1889! (Note that the amount of text that can be written is limited to the newspaper interface.)\nYou will be listed in the credits as a writer for the game. All previous rewards are included EXCEPT the first $221 tier - the  Baker Street Irregular pledge rewards.\nYou\u2019ll write at least one article for the in-game paper!\nThis is the last tier. Limited to 20 people, it includes EVERY reward from previous tiers plus BOTH the Baker Street Irregular and Friend of the Good Doctor tiers. That\u2019s right. You will not only be an in-game character but ALSO an in-game writer for the Times and listed as such in the credits! \nFor true Sherlock fans, this also includes SEALED copies of the original Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective board game and the impossible-to-find West End Adventures expansion game -- signed by designer Suzanne Goldberg if you wish!\nMINT versions of the original board games!\nAs an added bonus, you will also get the new Ystari board game. This completely updated version of the Consulting Detective game is absolutely gorgeous and recently won the Special Jury Award at Cannes. See this French link for a video that shows off the game. \nThe NEW Consulting Detective board game! Whoa!\nWell, we hope these pledge descriptions were helpful. If we were to raise more, we would first work on subtitling the video into other languages and then localizing all the text within the game. If we were to raise significantly above and beyond that, we would develop and shoot an all-new mystery adventure at Paladin Media with you serving as casting director.\nThanks for your support on this project and we hope you will join us on this adventure!\nThe Zojoi Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Zojoi\n2 created \u00b7 43 backed\nZojoi is an indy developer and producer of adventure and mystery games.

We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.

Let's keep pushing and we know we can get there!\nA Dream Ten Years in the Making\nPhoenix Online Studios first came together almost ten years ago as a group of adventure game fans who wanted to recapture and recreate the magic of the games we played when we were kids. Since that time, it's been our passion and labor of love to create our freeware King's Quest fangame, The Silver Lining, and now we're taking the next big step! What has long seemed like an intangible pipe dream is, after years of hard work and dedication, finally within our reach. We've partnered with Khaeon Gamestudio, and will be working Jane Jensen as our Story Consultant--truly, an indie dream team!--to bring you our first commercial game Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller. \nWho's Erica Reed and what's Cognition about?\nAn episodic story in the spirit of Dexter and Heavy Rain, Cognition stars Erica Reed, an FBI agent in Boston, Massachusetts, who lost her brother years ago to a serial killer who was never caught. In the high-stress hunt to save him, she began developing the strange and uncontrolled power of post-cognition: by touching an object, she can see its past, events that happened on, to, or around it. Though it\u2019s undeniably useful in her line of work, her unease with this power has caused her both personal and professional problems. And every serial killer case that comes to the bureau leaves her wondering if this one is the man who killed her brother. When she comes across a crime scene that has clues that were left specifically for someone with her abilities, a new hunt is on. Who knows her secret? How? And what do they want from her?\nWho's developing the game?\nPhoenix Online Studios are the creators of the hit King's Quest fangame, The Silver Lining. Almost ten years ago, we were just a bunch of adventure game fans looking to recapture the magic, and knew nothing at all about how to make a computer game! Our learning experience with TSL has not only taught us what to do and how to do it well, but also shaped our goal of creating modern, compelling, and innovative adventure games for today's audience. We love a great story, we love telling a great story, and we know Cognition is a really great story!\nTo bring you this game, we're joining forces with Khaeon Gamestudio, an independent studio based in the Netherlands. After playing The Silver Lining, Khaeon approached Phoenix Online to develop Cognition, a project originally conceived by Art Director Romano Molenaar, well-known for his works in the comics industry on titles including X-Men, Witchblade, and Tomb Raider. With Romano leading the art team, we're excited to expand on the graphic novel look and feel of Cognition into a fully and interactive experience.\n\nAnd last but far from least, Jane Jensen is our Story Consultant! A lot of us at Phoenix have been huge fans of Jane's work since her early days at Sierra, through to her latest release of Gray Matter this past year. To have the creator of Gabriel Knight, one of the first and most influential supernatural investigator adventure games, acting as a guiding hand on our story is a dream come true--we're honored and, let's face it, really lucky to have her on board! \nWhat are donations going to be used for?\nCurrently in pre-production, Cognition has a long way to go, and with your help, we can get it there that much faster. As we all know, money is what makes a business work, and that's what brings us to Kickstarter. The funds raised through this campaign will be used in the following ways to get the development of Cognition off the ground:\nUnity engine licenses\nEmployee salaries\nDedicated servers\nMarketing costs\nLegal fees\nESRB ratings\nAny cool rewards?\nHeck yeah there are! We've always greatly loved how dedicated our fans are, so we designed our rewards to give you a chance to get an inside look at the development of Cognition while it's in progress! Some of the highlights of our FBI Rankings rewards list include:\nSigned copies of the Cognition soundtrack\nA signed Cognition comic by Romano Molenaar\nPages of the design doc signed by Jane Jensen\nFree copy of the game upon the release of each episode\nBeta-testing access to the game\nExclusive monthly updates on the progress of the game during development\nHave your name appear in the game\nHave a character in Cognition crafted to look like you\nBecome a game developer for all four episodes! \nThank You\nThank you for taking the time to come to our Kickstarter page and learn about us and Cognition, and thank you for any donations!

Your kids are probably dead. Your grandkids (if they're alive) are playing video games. Why? Because professional gaming is the biggest sport on earth.\nAround the world, millions of players duke it out in fighters, RTS\u2019s, First Person Shooters and more. To the victors go the spoils: glory, clan contracts and million dollar endorsements. The best young gamers are recruited by elite boarding schools to sharpen their skills. The best of the best go to VGHS: VIDEO GAME HIGH SCHOOL. \nVGHS is a feature-length action/comedy web series (9 episodes, ~10 mins per episode) about best friends, first loves, and landing that perfect head shot. It follows Brian, a young FPS player stuck in a town where he doesn\u2019t belong. His fortunes change when he scores a massive kill against the world\u2019s top amateur player: VGHS senior \u201cThe Law.\u201d\nBrian rockets into the national spotlight and lands an invite into the hallowed halls of VGHS. There his skills will be tested as he fights to fit in with the most talented gamers alive. Along the way he\u2019ll make unlikely friends, fall in love with no-nonsense FPS hot shot, Jenny Matrix, and face powerful enemies \u2013 namely The Law, who vows to destroy Brian for good.\nWill Brian\u2019s dreams end before they\u2019ve even started? Or will he pull it together and become the gamer he was born to be?\nWho is behind VGHS?\nVGHS is co-created by Freddie Wong and Brandon Laatsch and Matt Arnold. In addition to acting as showrunner, Matt is also a writer, along with Will Campos and Brian Firenzi (founder of 5secondfilms.com). It is based on a concept by Will Campos and Chris Pappavaselio.\nFreddie Wong and Brandon Laatsch run http://youtube.com/freddiew, the 7th most subscribed YouTube channel of all time. Collectively their videos have over 450 million views, with over 2 million subscribers tuning in every week to watch their work. Their work has been featured on CNN, BBC, ESPN, and The Huffington Post, and they've worked with actors such as Eliza Dushku, Andy Whitfield, and Kevin Pollack.\nMost recently, they worked with director Jon Favreau for a crossover video for Cowboys and Aliens, and appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to talk about their work.\nBrian Firenzi is the founder of 5secondfilms.com, a comedy website that has churned out five second short films every single weekday since 2008. 5sf has been featured on \"Tosh.0\" and \"Attack of the Show,\" screened at SxSW and ComiCon, and they've worked with actors such as Peter Stormare and Patton Oswalt.\nMatthew Arnold is a collaborator and business partner with freddiew. After graduating USC, he was an assistant and than associate producer at Disney Interactive Studios for 2.5 years where he worked on nearly a dozen projects that polluted kids minds and emptied parents wallets (nah games are great for kids). Matt left in 2010 to start his own game company and create VGHS. His first iPhone game - an action adventure marble game - is set for release this holiday season. \nWill Campos has been a long-time friend and collaborator. He is a graduate of the USC School of Cinema Screenwriting program, and has the professionalism to make the rest of us feel like children. \nHow is this project funded? What's the funding for?\nMaking a feature-length project can be surprisingly expensive - there are numerous costs involved with doing a project legit, including production insurance, location permits, actor and crew salaries, and legal paperwork. In addition, the scale of the project means we'll have to hire on additional post-production personnel, such as editors and visual effects artists.\nOver the last year and a half of making weekly special effects laden YouTube videos, we've learned to be flexible and resourceful with our budgets. Every cent raised for this project is going into the production, so the more we raise, the bigger we can go with this project.\nAlso to put things in perspective, we're asking for less than 1/1000th of the budget for the upcoming Twilight movie.\nWhy a webseries?\nWe strongly believe the foundations for the future of digitally distributed content will be laid by webseries. We don't see a webseries as a stepping stone to get a feature film project, or a TV deal - a good webseries is an end unto itself. The webseries format is uncharted territory, and we want to explore it.\nWhat's the status of the production?\nVGHS is currently in pre-production. The scripts have all been written. Production is scheduled to start mid-October, with the project finishing early 2012.\nHow can I help?\nBy pledging an amount, you will be eligible to receive rewards exclusive to those pledging through this Kickstarter page.

Like each of us, Dylan deals with grief in his own way-- he has selective mutism and he holds on to a pet fish given to him by his recently deceased father. Over the course of the film, Dylan realizes his desire to move on, by releasing his pet to the wild and in turn learning to reconnect with his Mom. \nThe choices we make often alter the trajectory of our lives. This story captures one of these moments for a young boy who doesn't understand the bigger change happening within himself.\nOrigin: I remember family stories about when my uncle was little, he used to catch toads and bring them home in his pockets. These toads of course didn't survive the Maytag, but having pets in my family always did. \nThe initial idea for this story began with an image in my head of a betta fish kept in a mason jar. I thought what an interesting way to keep your pet with you, whether you were going to school, or on a road trip, riding a bicycle to the ocean. From there the story has mutated and become something that is very special and personal to me. \nBudget: Ideally we should be asking for a lot more to complete this project, however being a student comes with the benefit of being a part of a community of like-minded individuals who will work for free because we are gaining experience by working together. \nThe funding for this project will go towards paying for location permits, insurance, props, additional equipment, and healthy meals for my incredible cast and crew, because without them, this project would not be possible.  \nI also hope to have enough left over to enter the film into as many festivals as possible, including some of the big ones, like SUNDANCE! \nThank you for making it this far down the page and thank you in advance for any donation you might make!\nThis project is my senior thesis film for obtaining my BFA in Digital Film and Video from The Art Institute of Portland.

Live stream of the campaign's conclusion here!\nUPDATE: The campaign just hit 100%!!! It's still going until the deadline, the only change is I can't guarantee you'll get unique frames (it depends on how long the finished film is). ALL of the other rewards are still available! THANK YOU!!!\nLast chance to help make history with over 2,000 others! Man-child will become the most funded project in Kickstarter's narrative film category!\nAlso, check out this press release, which welcomes 11-time NBA champion coach Phil Jackson and Los Angeles Lakers EVP Jeanie Buss as backers! \nWhat is Man-child about?\nMan-child is an independent fiction film (not a documentary) that takes place in the surprisingly high-stakes world of youth basketball. I hope to shoot it independently in North Carolina (where I grew up playing basketball) next summer. My entire life has been leading up to this point, and so I'm asking for your help!\nIn 2009, the NCAA lowered the age limit on who can be considered an official basketball \"prospect\" to include 7th graders. While there have been a number of basketball films made about high school, college, or pro athletes, today's recruiting -- legal and illegal -- begins much earlier. It's a fascinating and treacherous world which often leaves big decisions in the hands of little kids.\nThe film explores sports, education, religion, and sex in America through the eyes of a talented 13 year-old basketball player (sexuality, I should note, is not presented in any sort of exploitative manner, and factors organically into the \"learning personal responsibility\" storyline). While it is narrative fiction, it explores a very real world. \nHERE'S A SYNOPSIS OF THE PLOT:\nAn amateur video of 13 year-old Terran \"TJ\" Jackson playing basketball hits the internet and turns his life upside down. TJ is soon nationally ranked among other 7th graders and declared to be \"the next Dwayne Wade\" despite being in middle school.\nAs a result of this exposure, free athletic gear and various hangers-on find their way to the doorstep of his small, predominantly-black Christian school. While TJ navigates the religious curriculum -- and simultaneously a sexually active relationship with his girlfriend -- he learns about the youth basketball world and the recruiting machine that powers it. With his newfound fame, he must choose between educational institutes, father figures, and belief systems.\nA few years from now TJ could be a millionaire, but right now all he has is basketball. It\u2019s a lot for anyone to handle -- much less a 13 year-old.\nIs it going to be good?\nIt's totally going to be good! I'm very happy to share that the script for \"Man-child\" was just accepted to IFP's Emerging Narrative Program, which provides mentorship and access to producers. Around 350 scripts applied and only 20 were accepted, so I would like to think this is a solid step toward Not Sucking (percentage wise, that's harder than getting into Harvard. Just saying!). I'm also honored to have been selected as one of 25 filmmakers invited to participate in the inaugural Emerging Visions program at the Film Society of Lincoln Center this October -- also because of this script.\nFor the IFP event, an oft-requested supplement is a \u201clookbook,\u201d wherein writers pull still images from existing sources in order to convey what they want the movie to look like. Instead of using still images, however, I decided to make a multimedia look book: a collage of film and TV clips to demonstrate the aesthetic of Man-child. Because it\u2019s intended for producers, it gets a bit technical, but I hope you\u2019ll find it interesting. At the very least, I hope you like the 1970s basketball clip \u2014 short shorts are always funny:\nIf this fundraising campaign is successful, with the help of the IFP and Lincoln Center programs I hope to be able to bring the right personnel on board to make this film as good as it can possibly be, and to reach a wide audience with the film as well.\nI talk about myself plenty in the video, but if you'd like a bio of what I've done film-wise so far in my life, here's a third-person bio.\nHow can I help produce the film?\nThe goal of this campaign is to raise $115,000. See the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) at the bottom of this page for exactly where all this money will go -- it's NOT going to me, it's going to the production of the film. As far as movies go -- especially sports movies -- this is a very small amount of money with which to make a feature film.\nThe campaign has a hard deadline of 11:59pm on September 23rd.\nIf you decide to help, you pledge whatever you want in exchange for cool rewards (for example, a DVD of the film when it's done, an HD download, your name in the credits, a blog post on my web site NoFilmSchool... the list goes on!).\nThe more you pledge, the better the rewards! Take a look at the column on the right to see what's available.\nIf I make the goal by the deadline, your credit card is charged what you pledged (but not until then). I get to make the movie, you get your rewards, and everyone's happy. I'd be more than happy, obviously -- I'll be more ecstatic than I've ever been in my life, and hopefully you'll feel good too.\nIf I don't make the goal by the deadline (falling even a penny short), your credit card is not charged, I get nothing, you don't get any reward(s), and the world doesn't find out what it's like to be 13 year-old, basketball-playing Terran \"TJ\" Jackson.\nWhat is this 1 frame per dollar thing?\nAn 80 minute film is 115,000 frames [24 frames per second X 60 seconds a minute X 80 minutes = 115,200].\nIf the movie is longer than 80 minutes -- which it's 99.9999% certain to be -- each dollar will actually equal MORE than 1 frame.

Artists are asking for this, and we're listening.\nA Modern Professional Editor\nIn addition to being collaborative, we're building a thoroughly modern editor:\nDesigned from the ground up for HDSLR cameras\nCan use local computers and cloud for storage and rendering\nSupport for 64-bit, 32-bit, and ARM\nDesigned with Storytellers for Storytellers\nWe have a laser focus on helping those artists who right now are leveraging HDSLR cameras to tell wonderful stories, with amazing production quality, and are doing so on shoe string budgets.\nSo the past year we've been talking with these artists, learning as much as we can.  This has been distilled in the Novacut editor UX design.\nOur strong leadership and willingness to make opinionated decisions about what we're not going to do is extremely important, otherwise we'd end up with this:\nA $300 Ticket to the Future\nWe're nearly done with hardest part of our collaborative editor (dealing with files).  And that means we're close to having a tool that can do honest-to-god real-time collaborative video editing.  By our count, this will be a world-first.\nWe'd like you to be one of the first 100 people in the world to experience collaborative editing.  So if you've got $299.99 burning a hole in your pocket for some reason, you can help us deliver the future, plus make sure you're first in line to try it.\nIf we meet our funding goal, we're confident we can deliver ground breaking collaborative editing, although likely with just a few of our planned editing features implemented.  But we're in this for the long haul, and should this project blow up in the press, that means we can charge full steam ahead for that much longer before needing to stop and scramble for money again.\nIt's about Trust\nStorytellers must take big risks to follow their dreams, so the last thing they need is uncertainty from their creative tools.  We think it's only fair that we continually earn your trust.  Here are some promises we take very seriously:\nYour edits are priceless and we will maintain backward compatibility forever\nOur roadmaps will be published, our process transparent\nWe'll ask you what you need, and we'll listen when you tell us\nOur editor will always be free and open source software\nQuestions or comments?  Chat us up on Twitter, Facebook, or IRC, and please join our Vimeo group.  We're listening.\nOh, and you have no idea how obsessed we are with multicam... this feature will land very early in Novacut.\nPlease see this wiki page for our UX designs, code, and information on getting involved with the Novacut design and development efforts.\nCredits\nNovacut brand identity design by IZO\nBlender animation by David Jordan\nNarration by James Raymond\nCloud timelapse by Nathan DeRose\nSintel character model by Blender Foundation\nExtreme Swiss Army Knife by _tnz\nTestimonials\nDon't just take our word for it!\nChristie Strong, editor and filmmaker:\nNovacut is not just a video editor, it's a revolution.

A commenter on my blog kindly alerted me to the Novacut project, a young team looking to develop a design-focused FOSS, distributed-model pro video editor and direct-to-fan venue. I was immediately intrigued that the Novacut project are very keen on developing very design-focused software as, in my experience, good design doesn't often feature in open-source projects. Not only that, but soon after my initial talks with the Novacut team, it became very clear that they were all extremely ambitious and were very much looking at nothing less than permanently changing the way people produce, distribute, fund and consume movies and TV. Knowing that these guys were fully committed to their vision, it was a no-brainer to contribute my design skills to the project pro bono.

And Ben? Well, Ben is the eternal bachelor who is eager to expose the perfect happy couples for who they truly are: deceptive, manipulative, adulterous liars.\nWe are currently in pre-production with cameras rolling on June 25-26 for this short film, the second installment in a 5-part series of revenge-themed short dark comedies. The first in the series, \"Sack Lunch\" won Best in Show at the Tasty Shorts Film Festival in Portland, OR in March of 2011 and will be hitting the festival circuit this summer. You can view the trailer for that short here. \"Dinner Party\" plans to follow suit as a hilarious look at the extents people will go to exact their revenge on those they feel have wronged them.\nThe total budget for \"Dinner Party\" is roughly $6,000, with part of the funds coming from private investment. We hope to raise $3500 of our total budget through crowd-funding with Kickstarter. \nWhile the short will likely make a decent festival run, the big picture idea is much more ambitious. When all 5 short are completed they will be formatted in sequential order and made into a feature film. In the feature film, we begin our day with Penelope and James, as Penelope makes a very creative meal for James' noon-time meal in \"Sack Lunch\". From there we visit a young boy with three older sisters who torment him, and watch as payback gets real ugly in \"My Turn\". From there we go grocery shopping with a young mother and her two wild children, and watch as she totally looses her cool at the check-out counter in \"Take the Groceries and Run\" (cameos from all four of the other shorts will be included in TTGAR).

On a practical level, it takes back your personal media from the corporations and advertisers. On a technical level, it is a really cool combination of some brand new OpenCV and FFMPEG functionality. On a poetic level, it is a tool for focusing on what is important in the record of your life rather than the ubiquitous messages that advertisers want you to focus on.\nIn short, Unlogo gives people the opportunity to opt out of having corporate messages permanently imprinted into the photographic record of their lives.\nIt's simple: you upload a video, and after your video is processed, you get an email with a link to the unlogofied version (example: http://vimeo.com/14531292). You can choose to have the logos simply blocked out with a solid color or replaced with other images, such as the disembodied head of the CEO of the company. This scheme is a bit ridiculous (which is kind of my style), but I like it because it literalizes the intrusion into the record of your life that these logos represent.\nWhat is the money for?\nThe majority of the money will allow me to work on Unlogo for another 2 months. These is enough time to get the filter out of training mode and into active recognition mode.\nSome will go towards paying off some of the debt from the money that I have already spent on programming help and server costs.\nSome of the money (probably $1k-$1.5k) will be used to pay the consultants and additional programmers who have been helping to get the filter finished and running smoothly.\nSome of the money ($300-$400) will go to the hoisting bills. The CPU power to run this filter publicly isn't cheap! I have 1 Amazon EC2 server where the filtering/encoding is done, another S3 bucket where the videos are stored, and a 3rd server to host the front-end.\nSeems tough. Can you do it?\nBased on our research and tests, what we want to accomplish is completely possible. I am bringing this to Kickstarter now because the end is in sight. I need one last push to get it done.\nLong-Term Goals\nAlthough Unlogo has a specific purpose, the code that it is built upon can be used by any artist who wants to do interesting things with non-real time video processing. That is, making what I am calling \"smart\" video filters. This is why we have released it with a free software license.

Taking as it's theme creativity and madness, the lyrics come from poets of the last thousand years who, for the most part, were writing through the lens of depression, mania and substance abuse. I came up with the idea for the album seven years ago when I read Kay Jamison's book 'Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament' and have been developing the project ever since. New music for the poems was written by myself, Elaine Agnew, Lisa Gutkin and Frank London, and there are songs from John Dowland, Violeta Parra and Leonard Cohen. The recording began on Achill Island on the west coast of Ireland in August 2008 and is now almost complete - you can hear some of the tracks in the video. Having financed the project to date on my own, I still need additional funding to finish the recording and for duplication, distribution, publicity, and a video project for the tour. The national tour kicks off with the launch of the album in New York on October 30 and many of the performances will feature discussions on the topic of creativity and mental health which will be streamed or recorded for posting on YouTube. (Tour dates in Ireland are planned for February/March). I've partnered with the non-profit organizations NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), Fountain House, BringChange2Mind, MDSG (Mood Disorder Support Group, NY) and Shine (Ireland). These groups will benefit from a portion of the proceeds raised from the sale of the album.\nThe tour dates are taking shape and so far include: Portland, ME (pre-release: Oct 16); New York (Oct 30); Boston (Nov 13); Baltimore (Nov 18); Eugene, OR (Nov 26); Portland, OR (Nov 27); San Francisco (Dec 1/2); Denver (Dec 3); Taos (Dec 4) and Albuquerque (December 5).\nI need at least $10,000 to accomplish these goals, but I'm setting a funding goal of $7,500.\nYou can learn more about the project in the video here made by my friend Maria Rosenblum.\nThanks to her and also to the CUNY team for the in-studio footage.

And hop on our mailing list while your at it.\n\nMuch love,\n\nJason, Tara, Jeff, and Ammon\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWe're developing a free open-source video editor with a unique distributed design:\n\nDistributed workflow - collaboratively edit video with other artists over the Internet\nDistributed storage - seamlessly store and synchronize video files across multiple computers and the cloud\nDistributed rendering - seamlessly spread rendering and encoding across multiple computers and the cloud\n\nThe Novacut editor is aimed at professional-grade TV and movie production using HDSLR cameras (like the 5D Mark II). These cameras have drastically lowered production costs, but we want to reduce costs even further... so we're taking the lean, distributed workflow perfected by the open-source community, and bringing it to video. Distributed teams are a big part of what has allowed open-source to amazingly produce better software, yet for less money and in less time. We can do the same for video.\n\nArtists, the Novacut video editor will help you reduce costs, work faster, collaborate with the right people, and increase your chance for success.\n\nWhy are we developing it?\n\nWe're developing the Novacut video editor because there's no reason for Joss Whedon to ever have a show canceled. We're developing Novacut because we're going to help artists leverage disruptive HDSLR technology to take entertainment back from the entertainment industry.\n\nWe want to see an explosion of financially viable independent TV shows distributed directly to fans over the Internet, funded through direct fan support, licensed under the Creative Commons. We love The Guild and think Felicia Day has blazed a trail others can now follow. If The Guild is successful with only a million fans, shouldn't there be thousands of shows like it? And on the other hand, Felicia Day does have a million loyal fans, so shouldn't she be making more money from The Guild? This is only the beginning.\n\nOf course, the Novacut editor will be completely free and open-source software, so you can use it however you see fit, regardless of our own longterm goals.\n\nWhy do we need money?\n\nBasically we need the money because software development is an all-consuming full-time job. We already have a well defined-architecture for the video editor and have some code written, but to charge ahead, we need to work on this full-time. If we reach our funding goal, the money will be used to:\n\nHelp cover the living expenses of our 4-person team so we can hack on the video editor full-time\nPay for us to travel to several conferences so we can get face time with artists and free-software developers, build a community\nFund several short, cheap \"Test Pilots\" - we take the best pilot episode scripts from the community and shoot the pilot with local actors, let everyone edit and remix the result\nPay Amazon EC2 and S3 costs for providing distributed synchronization service to our beta testers\n\nAnything we raise above our funding goal will be used to produce more \"Test Pilot\" episodes, travel to more conferences, and fund further development.\n\nWhat technologies are we using?\n\nWe're utilizing existing open-source components wherever we can. Honestly, others have already solved our hard problems, and solved them well. We're especially lucky to have a drop-in solution for our ambitious distributed features, all thanks to a quirky document-oriented database called CouchDB.\n\nSome other key technologies we're using:\n\nUbuntu because it's an artist-friendly platform that we can nicely run on everything from workstations to servers to virtual machines in the cloud\nWebkit for many user interface elements\nPython for rapid test-driven development\nGStreamer for a powerful, graph-based multimedia backend\n\nBy the way, the entire video editor will be licensed under the LGPLv3. This is a completely open-source project, not merely \"open-core\".\n\nJoin our community!\n\nSeriously, our spidey sense is tingling: a disruptive new business model is just becoming viable for TV (and pretty much any other entertainment that you can ship around as bits on the Internet). It's gonna be wild-west, and we want you (the artist), and you (the fan), and you (the free-software developer) to help us steer this wagon train to a place we can all be happy with. Novacut is building a community, and we want you to be part of it. So please strike up a conversation with us on Facebook, Twitter, or identi.ca.\n\nHeck, we even have a mission statement: \"To be the platform that enables as many artists as possible to live from their art, enables fans to get the entertainment they want and to support the artists they love.\" (Yes, we've all been reading Jono Bacon's The Art of Community... it's great!)\n\nAll software development is being coordinated through our Launchpad project.

Roach shares Josephine's appreciation for early 20th century French classical music, and as she practices her accordion, he accompanies her on the violin, unbeknownst to her. They are perfect for each other. But, alas, Josephine has approximately 45,000 times Roach's body mass, and their reproductive systems are totally incompatible. Besides, Josephine is already married-- to a brutish exterminator named Moe.\nNot one to back away from a challenge, Roach devises a plan. He crawls into Moe's brain and gains control of his higher brain functions. Manipulating Moe like a three hundred pound sock puppet, Roach attempts to woo Josephine. He fails miserably. But he perseveres, and in the end he succeeds. Josephine, never big on humans anyways, lives happily ever after with Roach, who has shed his elephantine host for his familiar exoskeleton.\nIt's Delicatessen meets Ratatouille. With a cockroach.\nHOW\nThe short will blend live action with stop motion animation, all shot on HD. The part of the roach will be played by a six inch tall puppet made out of plasticine and a wire armature. He needs to be a charming little guy, and when it comes to puppets like these, charm comes at a price. And we will need several of them.\nAdditionally, we will need funds to build a set, feed our crew members, light our stage, and generally get this project off the ground.\nWHY\n\u2026donate? Because you love inventive, beautiful films like Nightmare Before Christmas, Delicatessen, The Wrong Trousers, and Mary and Max. And because you want more films like them to exist, and because you know that they need money to exist, and because you recognize that swelling warmth in your gut as a feeling of generosity and artistic camaraderie. And because you want a drawing of a Tennessee Warbler eating a dung beetle (see: rewards for pledging $200).\nWHO\nJonathan Langager (cowriter/director), is a filmmaker, animator, composer, pianist, violinist, and all around nice guy based in Los Angeles, where he attends the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts graduate school. He has brutally slain hundreds of cockroaches, but now feels remorseful and ready to make amends. An example of his animation and music can be seen here:\nhttp://vimeo.com/13398145\nJoe Swanson (cowriter) tried pre-med, but sidetracked himself by staging elaborate plays starring costumed lab mice. His opus The Adventures of Mr. Whiskers and Sir Cheese-A-Lot was a critical triumph among bored lab-dwelling undergrads. An alum from the USC graduate screenwriting program, he has penned many short films which have gone on to garner numerous awards, including a Student Emmy for Short Comedy, and the 2010 USC Faculty Award for Outstanding Achievement in Screenwriting.\nDamon Stea (producer) is a prolific director and cofounder of Mindfruit, an artist collaborative responsible for the creation of countless short films, including some phenomenal stop motion animation. He has created commercials for high profile companies such as Careerbuilder.com and Stella Artois. He once shot an entire short film on a flatbed scanner. It was awesome. Much of his work can be viewed here:\nwww.mindfruitstudios.com\nJoshua Tate (producer) is a current USC student who has directed and produced many student projects, including two short documentaries that appeared at South by Southwest. His short documentary, \"Forgotten Lives,\" has been screened in political and educational events throughout the State of Texas, inspiring Texans to take action against the inhumane treatment of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Texas Institutions. He loves odd, grotesque films, including those that involve musical cockroaches.\nJonathan is under the gracious mentorship of Michael Taylor, the Chair of Film and Television Production at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. He maintains a career as a producer of both studio and independent films. His credits as a producer include Bottle Rocket (1996), Phenomenon (1996), and Instinct (1999), among many others. As an executive at United Artists and Orion Pictures, he was involved in the supervision of numerous projects, including The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Amadeus (1984).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "It's been a long time!", "update_content": "Dearest Backers, \nI just wanted to let you know I have a new Kickstarter campaign up - this time featuring laser engraved acrylic Christmas ornaments!

SHORT FILM about LOVE AND A CHOICE.\nLife is not always black and white and the choices we make are not always simple. Joanne and Allan are one couple, and they'll make their choice.\nSUMMARY:\nIf we are lucky we find someone. Life is happening and then this person enters the scene, makes us happy, smiles happen, fights happen, but there is love. There is good and bad in every relationship, and there are choices to be made. Joanne is a painter who has dreams of becoming a working artist. Allan is a barista who has dreams of family in his future. When there is an unexpected pregnancy for Joanne, a choice must be made. And like everything in life, it's not straight forward.\nWHY THIS STORY?:\nI was inspired to write this story and create this film because I wanted to watch a film where choosing to have an abortion is not a crime or a choice that condemns a person to a life of regrets and grief. When I began this project there was a series of films about pregnancy, but none of them ended with a woman getting an abortion. And if they did, it was a miserably catastrophic experience. This film is simply about a woman who chooses to have an abortion and how it affects her relationship, without the \"will she, won't she\" discussion of abortion.\nIT'S SHOT, WHAT NOW?\nWe've now shot over 6000ft. of Fuji Eterna Vivid 500T Super 16mm film. In other words, we've shot nearly three hours of beautiful film. Now we move into \"post\". Post-production is where the film comes together. The different takes, the dialog, the foley, the music, all of this is cut together to create the flow of the film that will tell the story as it deserves to be told. Before that happens the film must be transferred to a digital (in this case, HD) format, and beyond this long and detailed process of editing, there is also music composition, sound sweetening, color correction, titles to be created, credits to be written, and an animation sequence to be created. Beyond just the completion of the film are the promotional materials, festival submissions, other types of distribution and lots more to do! All parts of this are fun and exciting, however they're not free.\nMONEY:\nThat's why we're here on kickstarter, isn't it? I was lucky enough to be able to fund the first 2/3rds of this process, i.e. pre-production and the actual production, with my own savings (plus some catering help from my mom. Thanks, Mom!). However, this last section--the post-production--is waiting to be completed and yet the funds are gone. That's where you come in! We need this last push of money to get the Super 16mm film processed and transfered to digital HD, production stills (shot on 35mm, and 120mm) processed, artists to be payed, distribution costs, festivals fees (cause those babies aren't free), and other stuff too. To make this best of this project I need your help and will be happy and excited to offer you the rewards that are listed to the right.

Landor\nThe Film: \"Amour Sinc\u00e8re\u201d is a stylized short student film with roots in experimental film and music videos. The film explores the relationship between a man and woman, showing the duality of their relationship through a mixture of Argentine tango and Rapier sword play, to explore the passion of love, anger and how easily one can lead to the other.\nThe Production: \u201cAmour Sinc\u00e8re\u201d first started to be developed in late August. The idea kind of just sprung up on me one day, and at the time it was no more then a lingering concept dealing with dance and swordplay. It was not until September, when I brought the idea to Ally Yancy did it really start to come to life. We bounced the idea around playing with diferent concepts and interpretations. This kept up till about mid octobor before we were really certain what the film was going to be about. In November I started to pitch the idea to some friends and class mates at the Art Institute and slowly began to form a crew who wanted to be part of this project. Since the begining, I really wanted \u201cAmour Sinc\u00e8re\u201d to be a kick off project for myself and the crew. Many of us are really passionate about films and eagerly jump on as many projects as possible, from internships, to class projects, and senior shorts. These project really have helped shape and carve our skill set but, never really gave us the opportunity to really show off our creative energy. I wanted this film to be a real chance for everyone to show off their creative chops and to me that meant going the full nine yards with this project. To get local talent, locations and give our selves that chance to make this film look really great. We began pre-production around mid December. We ran interviews with talent throughout Portland, and met a great selection of actors and talented individuals. After a hard proccess of narrowing it down we finally selected our two actors whom we felt fitted the project best. We have started gathering our props for the production, including the swords and daggers, costumes, and are currently searching for our \u2018dream\u2019 location. We have been running rehearsals for our talent to learn the choregraphy for the film, and for different members of the crew to get ideas for shots, lighting and sound design. Its been a great proccess so far and we are quickly approaching our filming days.\nWhere you Come in: We have come along way already, friends and family have given us support and donations to help this project be the best it can be. Through their help, we been able to purchase the blades for the film, feed the crew and provided refreshments during rehersals and more. With Production just around the corner we are in need of a little more funding to help cover costs that we can forsee ahead. We are asking for 600$ to help us cover the expenses to bring this film to life. I am sure you are curious as too where this money will go to? All donations will go to help cover these things. 200-300$ will be going to cover the cost for our filming locations 100-150: will be going to the rental of equipment that we do not already have. This includes the possbility of a dolly, track and a Letus Lens Adapter 100: Will go to costume rental/purchase for that which we don\u2019t already have. 50-100: To fill in our catering budget to feed our crew and talent during the shooting days.\nWhat do you Get?: So what do you get for helping us with this project? That\u2019s a great question. If you take a look over to the right hand side you can see our great list of gifts we offer to those generous enough to donate to our film! Gifts include things like the offical \u201cAmour Sinc\u00e8re\u201d shirt, a copy of the film, and photo books of the production and much much more!\nWhats our plans for this film? Right now, our most important goal is to make this short film the best we can. After that we are looking into local Film Festivals in the North West to submit our work. This is hopefully the first project of many to come and we hope to use this not only as means to hone our skills and show what we can do, but perhaps gather an audience who would be interested in seeing what else we have planned for the future.\nConculusion: I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to check out our project. I hope you feel inclined to make a donation to our cause (Every little bit counts!).

It\u2019s looking really nice; we had a few issues with monitor calibration so some of the shots are brighter then we had thought. But with a little color correction and work it should look just fine.\nWe are currently in the planning process for the final shooting days. We still need to work out the finances for the final shoot due to the delays and unexpected costs that arose in our first weekend. The next shoot, we believe will have two more days. One at our location Tango Berretin( ) and another at the Art Institute Studio. We are hoping to do this in the beginning of June. But in the mean time to keep you in the loop our behind the scenes man Brian Trotter will be making you all a small short film showing you what\u2019s going on behind the camera, so stay tuned for that!\nIf you have any questions or thoughts please let us know!"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "17 backers pledged $1,000"}]}], "comment_no": 2, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1882696746/amour-sincere-a-short-film-about-the-passion-of", "project_name": "\"Amour Sinc\u00e8re\" A Short film about the passion of love and anger."}}, {"backer": "Sean Parker", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hey, we are Quarter Orange. Four film makers living and working in Portland, OR. We are all fresh out of film school, and are ready to tackle our first feature film!\nThe Northwest is well known as the stomping grounds of Sasquatch, and was thus the first thing that came to mind when we decided to make a horror feature. We chose to make a horror film because they're fun and cheap to make. The perfect combo for a group of guys that just wants to make movies. After throwing the Sasquatch idea for a bit we finally landed on our story: \"Evidence of the Sasquatch\"\nThe Story\n\nFour filmmakers gearing up for a feature film go out on what is supposed to be a three day location scout. They run into trouble their first night out in the woods when their Director of Photography mysteriously disappears. As the three remaining characters review his footage they witness him get savagely attacked by Sasquatch. As the night wears on it is a race to safety, but who will survive?\n\nThe Production\n\nWe can make this movie for $3000. We want to shoot the film in a style that has seen great success previously in the horror genre, that of hyper realism. The film will be shot completely by the four actors. Everything the audience sees is witnessed by a camera and the characters. Our scares will be created using fantastic sound design and high value creature effects.\n\nOur Sasquatch design will be a hybrid of the Sasquatch and the 'Wild Man' of Native American myths prevalent in the area. This Sasquatch will be dirty, vicious and more violent than previous film depictions.\n\nMost of our budget will be spent on our creature design and food for the six person crew. We will shoot the entire film in roughly six days at the base of Mt. Hood in Oregon. We have a tight production schedule, we are planning on shooting the first week of May, and hope to have a finished product by the end of summer.\n\nWe plan on a viral marketing campaign, utilizing video blogs by the producer character in the weeks leading up to the location scout. We're hoping this kind of marketing will create more of a world for the viewer to feel a part of, and help to build excitement for the film.\n\nAny little donation will help us to our goal of producing this film, and with any donation you will get access to exclusive behind-the-scene and production materials, such as, character designs, storyboards and video blogs.\n\nYou can find examples of our previous work at our website, www.quarterorange.com, and at our page on openfilm.com.\n\nThank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you will join us for this amazing ride!\n\n-Kyle Glenn\n-Eli Shell\n-Walker Williamson\n-Jason Windsor", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "'Evidence of the Sasquatch' on YouTube!", "update_content": "Hey all!\nIt's been a while, but we wanted to drop you a line and let you know we uploaded 'Evidence of the Sasquatch' in it's entirety to YouTube for your viewing pleasure: \nhttp://bit.ly/EvidenceOfTheSasquatch\nEnjoy!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Digital Download", "update_content": "Hello one and all!\nWe have exciting news, This Wednesday, the 27th, we will have our first screening of 'Evidence of the Sasquatch!'
