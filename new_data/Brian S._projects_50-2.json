[{"backer": "Brian S.", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "TidyBoard streamlines your food prep by placing strainers, catches and containers on the end of the cutting board. Easily chop fruits or veggies without mixing scraps. Strain hands-free and effortlessly clean up with a swipe of your hand.\nThe hanging design and collapsible containers maximize countertop space and make food prep fast and fun!\nDo you cook in a tiny kitchen?\nBy hanging off the edge of the countertop or over the sink, TidyBoard utilizes previously unused space. \nIn addition, the collapsible containers save over 50% of drawer and cabinet space, making it compact in use and in storage. \nThe cutting board acts as a lever to help hold the weight of the catch. TidyBoard\u2019s bamboo is antibacterial and maintains durability for years on end. TidyBoard is lightweight and made from the finest eco-friendly materials.\nThe large catch and containers have volumetric and measuring marks. Put food waste or chopped up food directly into containers for quick cutting and prep. The containers are also collapsible for efficient storage.\nThe strainers nest into the end of the board for cleaning or straining directly into the sink or catch \u2014 hands-free. The Strainers are all collapsible making them compact for storage.\nLids come included to make food storage easy in the containers. The lids snap-on directly to the containers and have a vent which allows them to be microwavable. Clean it. Cut it. Store it.\nThe lids also have a vent release for steaming veggies in the microwave.\nThe TidyBoard was mindfully influenced by math and physics. Our board is engineered as a lever to stay steady even with a heavy load in the containers.\nTidyBoard can hold up to 9 lbs of food in its container while hanging off your counter.\nCook and prep with ease. TidyBoard scientifically brings perfect balance to your prep. \nWe\u2019ve all experienced the cluttered counter and prepped foods mixed with food waste.\nTidyBoard keeps you organized and your kitchen clean. Never worry about where to put scraps or discarded produce \u2014 keep your space clean and orderly with TidyBoard.\nSee the difference TidyBoard makes. Say goodbye to chaotic cooking and welcome spick and span prep.\nNot only is TidyBoard cleverly designed, the quality of materials is nothing but the best.\nTidyBoard uses eco-friendly Bamboo. The lightweight 4 lbs of the bamboo wood won't dull knives, harbor bacteria, or absorb unwanted flavors and odors.\nThe containers are constructed out of BPA-free Food Grade Silicone and are microwave friendly, convenient for storage and organization. \nYou can choose your color once the campaign is over. We will send you a survey to pick your color of choice! \nTidyBoard cares about healthy eating, and we want to encourage everyone to cook fresh ingredients! We see TidyBoard making it easier to cook at home and helping prepare meals to-go, saving money and eating better when away from home.\nWe want to help connect people to their food and Mother Earth! Buying food locally at Farmers Market\u2019s helps reduce the carbon emissions during long transportation journeys as well as the added packaging materials you typically see at markets.\nWith TidyBoard, cooking and eating locally grown foods can be easier and faster. Plus, the catch makes it super easy to compost all your food waste. Cut it, clean it, store it, compost it, and make our world more sustainable!\nThe TidyBoard Team are friends from college who lived together in a small apartment with a small kitchen counter to work on. It was constantly a mess with ingredients and no space, so we came up with TidyBoard! Next came testing different prototypes and many hours of us doing 3-D drawings on Auto-CAD and patent research. We bought a 3-D printer and started testing. We then met our main man Eddie, a master of manufacturing. He helped us turn our original solid plastic design into a collapsible silicone design and here we are now!\nWe are happy to bring this vision to reality!\nMatthew is a goofy engineer who loves all things outdoors and creating new inventions!\nMark is a master of making businesses successful and loves spending time with family making delicious dinners!\nWilliam is the beloved brother who helped prototype and came up with the name TidyBoard!\nA global team of Certified Kickstarter & Indiegogo Experts.

I get to be an explorer, an inventor, a biologist. An adventurer. Through my years playing D&D, working for TSR, Wizards of the Coast, and then freelancing, I had the privilege of revealing wonders to people who share my love of the fantastic. I dissected dragons to see how they work. I found friends and companions\u2014from spacefarers in distant solar systems, to pirates and thieves and magicians, to a certain dark elf. Whole cultures, entire races, emerged into the light. Along the road I discovered a world of my own, which is still unveiling. Many of you have been with me every step of the way. Your appreciation of my efforts made it all possible.\nUPDATE: Thanks to the overwhelming support, the page count is now 336. Depending on how these last two days go, I may be able to push it to 352! That includes most of the paintings I've done plus some essential process and concept art.\nFound Worlds will be a record of our excavations together, a compilation of every world we\u2019ve uncovered. I want to put it all in this book, and that's why we're here. It\u2019s going to be big, and I want to share art and process for everything from the beginning of my career to all my finished paintings\u2014Dungeons & Dragons, Drizzt, Magic: The Gathering, Warcraft, The Evertide, and countless other realms. I'm asking for your help to make it happen. Are you ready to take another journey with me?\nIntroduction by artist and friend, John Avon, with commentary by Donato Giancola, Mark Nelson, Marie Brennan, R.A. Salvatore, and others.\nSample pages\nFound Worlds will be 9\"x12\", with over 290 pages of illustrations printed at the best quality modern printers can achieve. The time and finances it takes to make a book this size possible can skyrocket quickly, and you know I'm a perfectionist, but I want this to be a beautiful and lasting portfolio of my work. In the meantime, I'm halfway done with my second novel in The Evertide series, but illustration still pays the bills; Found Worlds may give me room to continue building this universe with story and art.\nBesides the book, I'm offering quite a few rewards as a thanks to backers. Some of these are brand new or expanded compilations of my art, while others are discounted or rarely-offered items. Take note below that we'll charge for shipping after the campaign and before the books ship next year. \n THREE 8.5\"x11\" Prints - printed on premium luster photo paper with an archival 8-color process.\n Sketchbook Vols. 1 & 2 - I've done so many black & white drawings and concept pieces over the course of my career that there's no room for all of them in one book, so I'll include them as sketchbooks instead. I'm still finalizing their contents, but one will likely feature my concept work for 3rd Edition D&D. The other will collect finished pen and ink illustrations. Between the two I\u2019ll also share additional process on some of my favorite paintings.\nNo dragons were harmed in the making of this book...\n The Special Edition - Found Worlds, but wrapped in a dragonskin textured leather and stamped with a silver foil title. Each of these books will come signed and numbered. Each edition of this book comes with a hand-drawn sketch, or Remarque, inside\u2014unique to that book.\nPLAY\n\nOur printer showcases the wonderful \u201cDragonskin\u201d leather I\u2019ve picked out for the Limited Edition slipcase and book cover. Dragons have scales in armored areas, but skin more like that of an elephant or rhino over most of their bodies. This was a perfect match. \n The Collector's Portfolio- These 13\"x19\" prints are usually convention-only. For the first time here online I'm offering collections at a reduced price. Choose from Drizzt, Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, D&D Monster Manual Dragons, and the Lady Trent Collection.\n\nFor the wyrm that needs everything\n Limited Edition Metal Evertide Print* - Offered only through this Kickstarter as a thank you to my highest backers is this 20\"x20\" Metal print of the iconic Evertide statue. Signed & limited to a number determined by this Kickstarter.\n*The metal print will ship in a separate category from all other tiers.\nI've received the proofs for the metal print in the Dragon's Hoard tier, and they are gorgeous!\nPLAY\n\nOther Limited Edition Prints - I'm only offering the metal print through this Kickstarter, but most all of my paintings are available as limited edition prints through my website toddlockwood.com \nSHIPPING- I\u2019m going to charge for shipping AFTER the campaign when the books are ready to ship. Which means you'll likely receive a survey from our Kickstarter with an opportunity to enter your address and pay for shipping then. I'll keep everyone updated with reminders when that survey is open / emailed. I've done my best to estimate realistic shipping for different countries. Again, these are just estimates, and I've tried to design the rewards so that they will ship to your door easily in one container, all except for the Metal Evertide Print. For this, and thus for the Dragon's Hoard tier, we will have to charge shipping separately from the other tiers. I'm working with some European services to decrease these costs, but please be aware of the shipping before you pledge, and feel free to email or contact with any questions. See \"regular shipping\" for all other tiers besides Dragon's Hoard, below:\nRetailers\u2014If you want to purchase 5 or more books for your own storefront, please email me: todd@toddlockwood.com\nAdd-ons - If you would like to combine tiers or purchase multiple versions of a tier, you can increase your pledge to cover the total amount of them added together. After the campaign ends, we will reach out to anyone with extra funds pledged to survey them about the additional rewards they are interested in.\nThank you so much for taking the time to visit this campaign. Thank you for believing in what I love. Thank you for coming with me on this journey.\nThe best is yet to come!\n\u2014Todd Lockwood", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've tried our best to talk with the printer in detail and hammer out a deadline for this book.

High above him, across the gorge, stands a castle. It is clear that the castle is very attractive, but the only way to get there is to first go downward. The man, terrified of what lies below, never ventures further, and wakes up soon after. \nThe game is an exploration of what strange things someone might find if they did enter the gorge, what might confront them inside, and how they might make their way out to reach the castle - if they have what it takes.\nWho am I?\nSeveral years ago I started a meme page on facebook and began writing comedic content for the internet. Since then, things I've made have spread far on pretty much every social media site out there - if you use them much, you may have seen something I've made, including many comedic images of retro-styled game scenarios.\nHow will the money be used?\nThe funding will be used to support myself while I build the game and compensate artists for any help I may need.

There\u2019s no month we would\u2019ve preferred to release Freakpocalypse more than October, but unfortunately the pandemic has thrown a wrench into those plans. Not only has it delayed routine aspects of development like voice acting, QA, additional polish and localization, but it\u2019s also delayed several aspects of game marketplaces. We won\u2019t be able to release this month like we planned and it\u2019s beyond our control.

This patent pending device brushes all your teeth at once, fully automatic, and finishes in just ten seconds. All you have to do is press a single button, wait ten seconds, and you\u2019ll have perfectly clean teeth!\nLet's face it: brushing your teeth is not exactly the sexiest thing on Earth. You have to squeeze, scrub, gargle, spit, rinse and floss every morning and evening, every day of your life. Many of us hate brushing our teeth so much that we avoid doing so whenever possible\u2014even though we know we shouldn\u2019t... Brushing our teeth at least twice a day maintains good dental health. This is why we invented Amabrush\u2014a device three years in the making with a single goal: to make toothbrushing quicker, automatic, and more efficient so you have more time for the relevant things in your life.\nAmabrush is not meant to be better than your regular toothbrush. Wait, what? That's true! Regular toothbrushes (manual and electric) are tools. And tools are only as good as the person using it! The key thing is that most of us use them wrong, or even worse, are not using them at all. \nBrushing teeth is a job where you must be highly concentrated. Toothbrushes should be held like pencils, so that pressure is as light as possible. The bristles should be soft, in order to not damage your gums. And you should just wiggle the toothbrush with subtle vibrations, instead of doing long strokes. Electric toothbrushes are handled differently than manual ones. With them, you shouldn't stroke at all. These toothbrushes are designed to be held in place, so that the micro vibrations of the bristles can do their job (they wiggle for you).\nAmabrush covers all of the recommended methods. The bristles are aligned in a 45\u00b0 angle against the gum line, and are soft enough in order to rub instead of scratch (like nylon bristles). And the pressure against your teeth is light. Subtle vibrations move the bristles back-and-forth, which allows them to remove plaque and keep your gums undamaged.\nAmabrush is for people like us - who just brush their teeth because they have to, and not because they want to.\nAmabrush was designed to make toothbrushing less annoying. Some of us hate toothbrushing so much, that we brush not concentrated enough, not long enough, not good enough, or not at all. And some of us simply can not brush correctly at all, because they are not able to do so. It is still under development, and currently for people with healthy gum and teeth. This is our goal. Right toothbrushing for everyone and automatically!\nAmabrush is made out of three parts:\nThe Mouthpiece\nThe Handpiece\nThe Toothpaste Capsules\nAntibacterial Material\nThe flexible mouthpiece has built-in micro-channels that transport the toothpaste to your teeth. The mouthpiece is made of antibacterial silicone that kills 99.99% of all bacteria and features 3D-arranged bristles on both sides to clean your teeth. It\u2019s soft enough to prevent gum damage but strong enough to clean your teeth precisely. It can be cleansed by normal rinsing, as you would do it with regular toothbrushes.\nBrushing Technique\nThe bristles are directed in a 45\u00b0 angle against your gingival cuff. This simulates the Bass method, which is recommended by dentists and experts. The bristles are comparable to soft-bristled toothbrushes. This ensures the most comfortable, safest toothbrushing and makes gum-damage impossible. We work closely with dentists and dental universities to address two concerns: clean teeth and no gum damage.\nSingle Size\nWe analyzed over 2,000 different jaws from adult females and males. The small difference between both genders is smoothed out by the flexible material of the mouthpiece. The used material has the characteristic to fit every jaw with no abnormal teeth displacements.\nReplacement\nAs with regular manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrush heads, the mouthpiece should be replaced every 3-6 months. Many studies prove that used bristles are not as effective in terms of plaque removal, as new ones. A single mouthpiece will cost \u20ac6.\nElectronics\nThe handpiece contains all of the complex technology. It creates strong vibrations with an amplitude of 9.5G to oscillate the bristles and clean your teeth. A clever algorithm ensures the generation of different vibrations. This results in a coordinated movement of the bristles, which are designed to have different resonant frequencies.\n10 Seconds\nAmabrush can brush your teeth in just 10 seconds, because all your teeth are cleaned simultaneously. Even in this 10 seconds, every tooth surface is cleaned longer compared with common toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth for the recommended 120 seconds with a regular toothbrush (manual or electric), every surface gets brushed for just 1.25 seconds (given the fact that you have 32 teeth and every teeth has three surfaces). Amabrush brushes all your surfaces for whole 10 seconds. This means: every tooth surface gets brushed 8x longer and the total toothbrushing duration is 12x quicker.\nPump, Battery & Charging\nA built-in mechanism foams and delivers the right amount of toothpaste to your teeth, and the integrated battery lasts for 28 sessions of toothbrushing. So if you go on vacation without the charging station, you can brush your teeth for at least two weeks twice a day.\nThe handpiece also comprises a low-energy wireless charging module (Qi). So yes, you could even use your wireless smartphone charger to charge Amabrush.\nSharing\nA magnetic connection on the handpiece gives you the opportunity to use Amabrush with different people. Simply put the mouthpiece near the handpiece, and the strong magnet will automatically do the rest for you. We were told that \"it really works like magic,\" and we think the same.\nNotice: if you want to share Amabrush with different people, you just need a single handpiece! Everyone needs their own mouthpiece, but you don't have to get a separate handpiece for every person!\nReplacement & Varieties\nThe toothpaste capsules are simply placed into the handpiece, automatically providing the perfect amount of toothpaste each time you brush your teeth. A single capsule lasts for more than a month, costs \u20ac3 and is available in three different, FDA-approved varieties: Extra Fresh (blue), Whitening (white) and Sensitive (rose - without fluoride). The toothpaste is specially formulated as it needs to be more liquid than regular ones.\nManufacturing\nThe toothpaste is formulated and produced by a major toothpaste manufacturer with a history of over 100 years. This manufacturer fulfills the quality norm DIN EN ISO 13485 and the requirements of IFS Household and Personal Care Products, and was one of the first manufacturers in Europe retrieving the IFS-HPC certificate.\nMagnetic Connection\nToothpaste Foam\n                                   Magnetic Connection\nVideo of using Amabrush prototype. Plaque was buildup on teeth by not brushing them for 30h. This is not meant as a proper clinical trial or plaque test, but as a demonstration of brushing teeth with Amabrush.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n          \n           Amabrush with Wireless Charging Station (included in Amabrush Pro packages)\n                                                                                                                           Further questions?\nPlease feel free to contact us any time via email or Facebook.\nPlease choose your package on the top right of this page.\nUSB-C instead of micro-USB! We got this request really often, and we too think that this is a great way to build Amabrush with top-notch technology right from the beginning. Many of you demanded such an upgrade, and your request is our command!\nFurthermore, we will offer a lid with integrated UV light as an add-on. This protects the mouthpieces of Amabrush from dust and other environmental influences, and sanitizes the mouthpieces with UV light. This is able to store and sanitize two mouthpieces. This is an accessory for the mouthpiece-storage-attachment (that comes included in the pro version). It features a door with a hinge, a mirrored interior panelling in order to get the most out of the UV lamp, and is a great addition in order to keep Amabrush hygienic and clean. You can add the add-ons to your order after the campaign ends.\nChoose between various different add-ons. The images above shown are for illustration purpose only! We'll offer a traveller case in order to store your Amabrush conveniently and hygienic when you are on vacation. Furthermore, our charging station will be modular. That means, if you use Amabrush on your own, you can simply detach the mouthpiece slots that are designed to store additional mouthpieces. All pro versions come with a charging station and two slots included. What's more, we will offer a tongue cleaner made out of the same antibacterial material, in order to keep your tongue smooth and clean. You can find additional details and choose these items after the Kickstarter campaign.\nYou requested this, we deliver it. All Amabrush units come equipped with a sound and light indicator, that is able to signal various different information about the current battery status, finished toothbrushing sessions, errors and other scenarios! Furthermore, we'll offer our specifically formulated toothpaste in big bottles, along with more durable and stable refillable toothpaste capsules. This will save shipping fees and total cost for you. Please have a look at our add-on section below the reward section for further details.\nYour request is our command! We will integrate Bluetooth to all of our rewards at no additional cost. With our Amabrush App for iOS & Android, you are able to connect to your Amabrush unit and make use of various possibilities. You can set different vibration modes (gum massage, whitening, burst mode, ...), configure cleaning time, reorder replacement parts and do many things more!\n                                                                                                 We truly believe in Kickstarter as a platform, where like-minded entrepreneurs and early adopters bring together innovative, disruptive and sophisticated projects to life. We already supported a dozen projects from other people on Kickstarter on our own.\nAmabrush is a completely new device and needs to be \"understood\" in the first place. Kickstarter connects us with people like us; fact-interested, early-adopting and technology-enthusiastic people.\nAmabrush needs your help to fully come to life. Prototypes and pre-production units were financed by ourselves. But the time has come, that we currently face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certification, studies and minimum quantity purchases. \nWe strongly believe that we've created a product that many people are craving for, ourselves included. Without your support, we can not achieve the vision of future oral care.\nWe do also highly appreciate every feedback and requests regarding Amabrush. If you have something you want to share with us, please feel free to write us any time at feedback@amabrush.com\nWe came up with the idea of an automated toothbrush, simply because we are annoyed by brushing our teeth. Standing in front of the mirror for at least two minutes twice a day, was not really satisfying for us.\nMarvin Musialek, the founder, came up with the first prototype in 2015. Together with Martin Forstenpointner, a talented mechanical engineer, and Alexander Stummer, a sophisticated biomedical engineer, we brought the project to life. Advised by Dr. Hady Haririan, a professional dentist and member of the Medical University of Dentistry in Vienna and Austrian Society of Parodontology, we developed and tested Amabrush to the form it represents now. We've established an enthusiastic and interdisciplinary team, and we work closely with medical universities, dentists, and a lot of test customers, in order to make Amabrush as perfect as it can be. We are supported and funded by the Austrian government, private institutions and the European Commission.\nOur core team:\nWe at Amabrush love high quality products. They are durable, simple and \"just work\". We are proud to say that Amabrush is designed, developed and produced in Austria, Germany and USA. This ensures high quality, quick development and low delivery costs.\n                                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne part of Amabrush is highly complex; the mouthpiece. Such a form is not available on the market, as it is build out of a single material and the sophisticated arranged bristles can not be produced by every random injection molding company. We have a close dialog with our suppliers, who have a lot of experience with such complicated structures, and we implemented their feedback early into our development process.\n\nDespite that, we kept the internal parts simple. This allows us to develop quickly, and to choose between various different suppliers.\n\nOur team has a very strong background in management, product design and mechanical engineering. We have already defined our manufacturing flow and our sourcing of the various different parts. Not only this, but we are also in talks with several manufacturers for every part of Amabrush. This allows us to scale production and logistics accordingly, even if we encounter high demand or supply shortage.\n \nWe believe that we will start shipping Amabrush to our first supporters in the pilot-tester section in October 2017.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU", "descp": "You're truly awesome!\nYour full name will be listed on our main website in our supporter section, and of course we'll keep you updated on the progress of Amabrush.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["330 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac9 or more", "title": "PERSONAL POSTCARD", "descp": "Thank you very much for your support!\nWe will send you a personal postcard with behind-the-scene images of our headquarter.\nFurthermore, your name will be listed on our main website in our supporter section and of course we'll keep you updated on the progress of Amabrush.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac79 or more", "title": "AMABRUSH BASIC", "descp": "Support us now and receive a basic version (Kickstarter special) of Amabrush for just \u20ac79.\nChoose your toothpaste variety after the campaign ends.\nINCLUDES:\nHandpiece\nMouthpiece\nToothpaste Capsule\nBasic Charger", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,945 backers", "Limited (35 left of 3980)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac99 or more", "title": "AMABRUSH PRO -

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo. We've brought several Kickstarter projects to life in the past, and have learned from our experiences. While we have been relentlessly concerned with the details throughout designing, prototyping, and planning for production, there is always the chance that pesky Murphy guy may make an entrance with that law of his.\n\nIn the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Show Some Love", "descp": "You love the look of Fidget Cube.

in infrastructure, professional and business offerings with features that cost us $$ to provide, and the long term future of Chocolatey itself.\nChocolatey is the Alternative Windows Store for the thousands of programs and tools that are not able to be part of the Windows Store. Do you hate finding the right downloads? Do you spend hours getting your apps on a fresh install of Windows? Do you spend fruitless amounts of time checking for updates that make apps more secure? Chocolatey sweetens your Windows software management experience by automating away hours of work!\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nTo invest in non-free features we believe bring more stability, safety and security to Chocolatey. We talk more about this in the next section.\nTo support improvements to the infrastructure. We currently spend under $1K/month and see a need to more than double that to support a staging environment, a build/test infrastructure, and load balancing needs as Chocolatey continues to increase steadily in popularity. Right now the costs are paid by me and the tremendous generosity of others, including AppHarbor. We believe there is a crucial need for Chocolatey to become self-sustaining to reduce unforeseen risks.\nTo give the Chocolatey team more freedom to concentrate on Chocolatey so we can get these features to you faster.\nStretch goal: To ramp up a full time staff that can support your needs and continue to deliver awesome features to you. We can't do that at the current goal, that will help but it won't be enough for any of us to be full time. \nWhat Do You Get For Backing this Project?\nMost backers get professional/business at least 2 months ahead of everyone else! T-Shirts for some levels. And chocolate, like real chocolate goodness at one level!\n$5+ Level\nA heartfelt thank you and we'll keep you informed with all the backer updates!\n$25 Level\nBacker updates\n+ A T-Shirt with \"The Chocolatey Experience\" on it - available ONLY through the Kickstarter!

That's a very special offer available only through the kickstarter and only to 5 businesses!\nAt $1,200+ - + Beta access! +Workshop!\nAt $4,000+ - + Listed!\nChocolatey Professional / Chocolatey for Business \nWe have a number of features coming. Most of these will be done by the time we deliver the professional version, but some of them will follow shortly after.\nHighlighting a few things:\nPro/business only feed(s) supporting packages that are only available to professional and above customers. \nAlternate permanent download location - A private location that contains the installers for most packages, removing the instability of downloads that are removed from their distribution point (or updated to newer versions).\nVirus checking during runtime.\nExtensions - you will be able to extend Chocolatey functionality beyond the core offering, either from your own extensions or from community supported extensions (either free or for a reasonable fee). Eventually we are going to have a store front where you can install these extensions. And eventually we expect this feature to roll down to the free version. \nThe biggest features here are more safety, trust and predictability.\nNEED MORE DETAILS?\nWhat is Chocolatey?\nChocolatey helps good developers and system administrators become outstanding developers/sysadmins. Chocolatey goes to eleven.\nChocolatey is something you need if you've ever installed, upgraded, or removed software on Windows. It is an existing, proven, almost 4 year old project. For those familiar with *nix package managers, it is a binary package manager, sort of like yum or apt-get, but for Windows. The words \"binary package manager\" can be confusing for those who don't know what that means, but bear with me for a few minutes. Chocolatey is a tool that automates all the mundane getting and installing software work for you. You just select what you want installed and within a few minutes, Chocolatey has downloaded and installed (or upgraded) that software without need for further input from you. So while Chocolatey does the hard work, you can go get some coffee. Or sleep. Or do other more important things.\nThis may not seem very powerful at first, but imagine when you want to upgrade all of the software on your system to the latest, most secure versions, how do you do that now? Right. Manually:\nSearch for most recent version\nPick (hopefully) the right download\nWait for it to download\nUnblock it\nInstall it manually (next, next, next anyone?)\nHope it didn't install any malware\nNow do it again for EVERY piece of software on your system.\nNow let's talk about doing that same thing with Chocolatey:\nType \"choco update all\"\nImagine that. That you could type \"choco update all\" and simply walk away while Chocolatey goes to work upgrading everything you have installed and keeping your system safe and secure. But don't just imagine it, you can do this today. Right now. And it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 1,000 computers to do this on.\nChocolatey allows you to be extraordinary. While your friends and coworkers are stuck in the past doing all of that work manually, you are getting other things done. At the end of the day, automation allows you to do more. This is the power of Chocolatey.\n This is a really exciting time for the future of Chocolatey, so let's talk about where we are, where we want to go, and how we get there.\nWhere We Are\nToday we have an active and growing community with 2300+ packages and over 5 million downloads on the community feed (https://chocolatey.org)! Microsoft recently announced they are bringing Chocolatey to Windows proper through OneGet, a package manager aggregator. This validates Chocolatey as a longer term framework for package management on Windows going forward!\nAlmost four years ago I started working on an experiment that is now known as Chocolatey. I started the project because it gave me something I'd never had, the ability to automate the installation of software with just an internet connection and a set of simple commands. It was the solution to something I needed with Windows that I didn't see other projects fulfill in the same way. It has since grown into a stronger solution to the package management problem for Windows. I never imagined that so many other folks would find it as useful as I have!\nAs we look around the community, Chocolatey has some folks really excited about working on Windows! If you meet the right folks, they will tell you Chocolatey is awesome! And Chocolatey is awesome! But Chocolatey does have some rough edges. Chocolatey has a lot of potential, but it needs some definite improvements to infrastructure, some things need to be redesigned, etc. Chocolatey has also grown in popularity at a rapid pace, something that necessitates the need to support a higher amount of users. Chocolatey is completely free for users, but that does not mean it is without cost. Many of these costs are related to just keeping the lights on and making sure when you try to install a package there is something on the other end that responds.\nWe are seeing tools like Boxstarter build on top of Chocolatey and provisioners like Puppet, Chef and Salt all have Chocolatey providers for package management on Windows.\nWhere We Want to Go\nWe'd like to see Chocolatey around long term, so it really means we need to take things to the next level. We have realized that we need a freemium business model to support the continued existence of Chocolatey. For the long term viability of Chocolatey we need to be able to support business needs and professional users who want more predictability, stability and a safer user experience. \nMany of the major improvements will flow back down to the community at large who uses and benefits from the free version of Chocolatey and the community feed. \nAs we have seen with Chocolatey, the experiment worked. We're ready to move forward from the Chocolatey experiment to the Chocolatey experience!\nHow We Get There\nNow it's your turn. I need you (yes you, the one reading this), you the community, to tell me you want Chocolatey to stick around, to get better, and become something bigger than any of us ever intended! To become the project that everyone wants it to be. If you don't know how much you value Chocolatey, I want you to try an experiment: What if you turned on your computer tomorrow and Chocolatey was no longer available?\nGet involved. Even if this is the first project you've backed. Get your company involved. Get your friends and family involved. Let's make this happen! Let's Get Chocolatey!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery software project has risks. \n\nThe biggest question folks want to know before they get involved with software is will this work? If you go out and look at https://chocolatey.org now, you can see that we've had over 5 million downloads of software and have 2,000+ unique packages. So we're pretty sure this will work.\n\nIs OneGet a risk? Some people may be looking at OneGet and wondering if that is a threat or a complementary tool for Chocolatey. It is indeed a complementary tool, it uses Chocolatey, and a few other package managers. It itself is a package manager aggregator. Microsoft has had how many years to really solve this problem? I'm qualified to overcome the issue of Windows package management as I design things based on the most pragmatic methods, not necessarily what the shiniest new tools are. The Chocolatey framework was designed in a way that made the most sense and has proven itself to be the proper path forward. We'll continue to make small adjustments along the way as we continually get better. We are qualified to overcome the issue because we already have.\n\nWe are likely moving forward with a professional version whether we are funded or not. Funding means we get there much, much faster. And you get to take advantage of special rewards that are lower than the pricing for the general public.\n\nThe risk with any business is that we won't become profitable. We think we provide a much needed service to the community and we would like to continue to do so. And evolve what we are doing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #70", "update_userinfo": "Renewal Link is Ready 2021", "update_content": "Howdy folks!

Ambitheater includes dynamic LED backlighting behind your television to compliment the in room lighting and extends the viewing area of the screen beyond the perimeter of the television.  These effects immerse the room and the viewer into the entertainment system and your favorite games, movies or TV shows. Ambitheater is already equipped with the software necessary to provide the lighting effects described, that means there is no need for a PC like some of the other devices out there!\nOur goal in designing the Ambitheater lighting system is to fulfill a need where all others did not go.  We have spent a significant amount of time searching for the right components and writing software to incorporate the desired licensing to allow for HDMI pass-through with HDCP support in an affordable commercial solution.  Along the way we were able to add some great features that are missing from the currently available systems on the market.  Have you ever asked one of the other ambient lighting system developers if their products worked with the PlayStation 4? Or any other HDMI input? What about HDCP? Well, their answer was always NO! Even if they claimed that they would, setup requires three or four devices to configure and many hours searching the internet for answers as to why it doesn\u2019t work.  With Ambitheater, the answer is YES.  No computer is needed for Ambitheater to function. Ambitheater will support any HDMI source even with HDCP.  With your help we will make this a reality!\nWhat is HDCP you ask.  HDCP stands for High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection.  It is designed to protect copyrighted media from being saved from an HDMI cable.  This is done by encrypting the signal on HDMI cables.  HDCP requires that manufacturers design their products to a certain set of rules and also pay a hefty fee to become an adopter.  We have created our software and designed our hardware to work within the guidelines set out by these HDCP rules.  \nAmbitheater provides support for WS2812 LED strips for TV backlighting.  These strips are the latest and greatest when it comes to LED light strips.  The strips have the controller IC built into the RGB LED to allow for each LED to individually be any color.  This allows the backlight to dynamically change with the action on the screen for the area that each LED is placed.\nWS2812\nThe Ambitheater controller has built-in support for Philips Hue lighting.  This extends the viewing experience beyond the two dimensional experience around the television.  The controller allows for up to six groups to be assigned and customized to set the color of each group of lights specified on the area of the screen.  Due to Philips\u2019 lack of reseller support for the Philips Hue, the Philips Hue lighting system must be purchased separately.\nPhilips Hue\nDue to backer requests there will be two lighting options for the in-room lighting effects.  Ambitheater will support both the Philips Hue and LimitlessLED bulb standards.  Due to limitations of the LimitlessLED system the in-room lighting will only be able to be setup into 4 groups when using LimitlessLED bulbs rather than the 6 that Philips Hue can support.\nLimitlessLED Lighting System\nThe future of television is changing.  With the latest 4K Ultra High Definition televisions gaining more support it would just be a matter of time before a mere 1080p will not suffice.  To prepare for this we have included 4K UHD up-scaling support.  In our search for the best way to implement HDMI pass-through with HDCP licensing we have found an affordable chip solution that will add 4K upscaling features.  Now you won\u2019t have to replace the Ambitheater controller when you upgrade to the 4K UHD standard.  As a side effect of this feature all 720p sources will be up-scaled to 1080p or 4K UHD if the TV can support it.  Imagine being able to stream Netflix, Hulu or Amazon at 4K UHD.  Can't beat that.\nWe have tried to incorporate every feature that we could think of while designing Ambitheater.  Here is a list of some of the features that we have incorporated into the controller:\nIn room lighting global dimming to adjust the brightness to your preference.\nRemotely configuration of the Ambitheater controller.\nAbility to enable or disable the in room lighting for those times when you would rather not be immersed in your entertainment.\nAdjustable update intervals for the in room lighting.  This enables the user to adjust how often the in room lighting will change to account for Phillips Hue limitations on advertisement rates.\nUp to 6 groups to set for the in room lighting to allow for multiple locations of lighting within the room.\nExpansion of LED TV backlighting for larger displays (may require an additional power adapter)\nSupports any HDMI input (PS3, PS4, XBOX360, XBOXOne, Wii, Wii-U, Computer, Blue Ray player, Cable Box, Streaming devices)\nThe video below showcases Ambitheater with in-room lighting disabled and auto detection of black bars on top and bottom and the sides.\nPLAY\n\nBacker Rewards\nWe have considered the fact that some of our potential backers have already invested in some of the other do-it-yourself and consumer options that are on the market and may already have the WS2812 LED strips but do not support HDMI with HDCP.  For this reason we are offering an early bird option for the controller only so you are not swimming in LED's.  Also Ambitheater can work with just the Philips Hue lights or LED's on their own if you so desire.\nBacker Rewards\nWhat\u2019s So Great About Ambitheater?\nWe can go on about how the lighting effect created by Ambitheater provides less strain on the eyes by allowing the pupils to relax rather than constantly adjusting to the variations in lighting caused by the television.  We can discuss how the human eye has a wide viewing angle beyond the focal point of your attention and Ambitheater will immerse your mind by adding a couple of feet of lighting around the perimeter of the screen and beyond into the room; but to get to the point, Ambitheater surrounds you with your entertainment by extending the viewing experience and incorporating the entire room into the viewing experience.  It just looks good.\nHow is the Project Going?\nWe currently have created a development prototype environment with the key components of Ambitheater.  With the weighty restrictions of HDCP and the cost of the licensing we are in need of some assistance to move forward.  Until we can become an HDCP Adopter we are not able to put the final piece into the design to complete the circuit board.  The manufacturer of the needed HDMI chip (that is just out of reach due to these restrictions) has worked closely with us to ensure that once we are considered an HDCP Adopter, all that is needed is to drop the chip in and make a couple of tweaks to the software to manage the chip.  Currently we are using a similar non-HDCP replacement for the HDMI chip that produced the effects in the video.  We have created and tested the software for the processor that will be used in the Ambitheater controller.  We have sourced all of the components that will be implemented in the final product and we have created a preliminary PCB design using all of the components including the much needed HDMI chip.\nDevelopment Board Prototype\nCase Conception\nWhat\u2019s In the Box?\nWith our current design, Ambitheater will come with the HDMI pass-through controller, 5 meters of 30 LED's/meter WS2812 LED strips, and a power supply for your country specification.  If you found us in time for the backing option for the controller without the 5 meter LED strip then the LED's will not be in the box as you would prefer.\nInstalling Ambitheater\nIf you choose to get the LED strips from us, the strips will have double sided tape for the whole length.  No cutting is required for installation.  Just stick the strip to the back of the television around the perimeter.  At each corner simply fold the strip at a 90 degree angle and continue sticking the tape around the television.  Lastly plug the three pin JSP connector into the Ambitheater controller.\nTo install the controller, simply plug an HDMI input into the Ambitheater controller from an HDMI source and an HDMI output from the Ambitheater controller to the television.  Plug the provided power supply into the controller and allow it to boot up.  The controller will allow for simple configuration settings from an Ethernet input.  For Philips Hue support the Ethernet connection will need to be connected to your home network.\nHardware Setup\nFollow directions for setting up the Philips Hue system to include the specific bulbs into up to six groups by following the Philips Hue instructions provided by Philips.  Enter the group names into the Ambitheater controller web configuration page for each of six areas of capture.\nThe Ambitheater controller can officially support up to 200 LED\u2019s with the included power adapter.  If more LED\u2019s are needed a separate power supply will be required and connected directly to the LED strip.The Ambitheater controller can support 450 LED\u2019s for data control only, but will require the additional power supply.\nSchedule\nCurrently we have done all of the research, component selection, software creation, PCB design and initial prototype testing.  We are now running the Kickstarter campaign immediately followed by HDCP licensing and then PCB prototyping, case creation and other certifications such as UL and HDMI. We will be shipping to Early Bird backers starting June 1st 2015.  Slow Bird shipments will follow shortly after on July 1st 2015.\nSchedule\nWhat We Will Do with the Money\nWe have priced out all of the components, manufacturing costs, certification and the other various items that typically come up with the design and manufacturing of a product.  The below chart shows the amounts that we have calculated in order to manufacture 1000 Ambitheater systems.  Why so many? Well, this is the minimum order quantity that best suits the need to keep the price of Ambitheater as reasonable as possible.  As you can imagine the components needed to bring the advanced features included in Ambitheater to life require certain commitments to keep them affordable.  The LED strips alone typically retail between $60-$75.  We intend to beat this price to ensure a better deal for our Kickstarter backers.\nCosts\nWho is Ambitheater Technologies?\nWe are hobbyists, we are tinkerers, we are movie lovers, we are gamers and we are people just like you who want a product like this and we want to share it with you.  We chose to build Ambitheater and not allow a simple license to stop innovation.  We waited for years for this device to be made and when it didn\u2019t come, we decided to do it ourselves.\nWho's Our Competition?\nAlmost all ambient lighting systems on the market right now do not support HDMI input. They require the video source to be generated from a computer. This works well for some people, but there are many other common sources of video which are not supported.\nOne of the closest competitors to Ambitheater is a do-it-yourself project which requires various components that may be difficult to find. The solution for HDCP that this program has created is to purchase an HDMI splitter which strips HDCP on one output port. These splitters are not readily available. Once the HDCP license issuer becomes aware of a manufacturer creating a device that does this, all HDCP licenses are pulled from the manufacturer so no further devices can make it to market.  The cost of creating this DIY setup could be up to $150 once the $70 LED strip and the other components are purchased.  This DIY setup has no video up-scaling included. Video up-scaling products on the market would be a $40 value in the cheapest scenario. This does not address the time that it takes to set everything up in Linux not to mention the troubleshooting that comes once it becomes apparent that it doesn't work correctly.  Ambitheater has a simplified configuration page for easy setup and the price is comparable to this do-it-yourself project.\nThe second similiar product on the market is the AmbX system.  It is not really a competitor because it is meant more for a concert hall. Although it is feasible to build an AmbX system in your home. The price makes it an unreachable option for most. These products cost upwards of $6000. Ambitheater will bring this experience into your home for far less. \n Thank You for your consideration! I hope you find Ambitheater as interesting as we do.  We have worked hard to get to this point. Please consider backing Ambitheater so we can all have our own immersive entertainment system. Please join us on this journey to create a great product.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe feel that the risk is low. We have set out to make this product and we have setup our network of suppliers and manufacturers. We have researched the HDCP/HDMI certifications and licensing and have planned accordingly to be within those guidelines. We have planned our schedule to mediate any delays that may come up. There may be some redesigns of the prototype to ensure signal quality but we are prepared for this and will get Ambitheater to a final product. We just need your help to get us over this restrictive hurdle and into production.\n\nWe have considered every aspect in getting Ambitheater to you at the lowest price possible and also ensure our success. The current price in this campaign is a discounted price compared to our market analysis and retail projective pricing. Please don't hesitate to back this project. When we get closer to our goal we will role out our stretch goals to make Ambitheater even better.

I got to Tokyo and despite years of study I could pick out maybe three spoken words a minute. It was a painful experience, so when I got back I started thinking of ways to solve that problem. Over seven years, I developed this game that simplifies Japanese by making its most confusing concepts (sentence structure and particles) into a simple card game!\nEarlier this year, Japanese: The Game had its public debut right here on Kickstarter. Now over 10,000 decks have been printed and thousands of people are learning Japanese by playing a card game. Japanese has a reputation for being difficult to learn because of its differences from English. But when you learn the language from its own perspective, it's relatively simple, logical, and consistent. Japanese: The Game lets that simplicity shine. And it's fun to play!\nI believe strongly in bringing the world together. With tools like Japanese: The Game, I think we can make a better effort. The Tokyo Edition Core Deck and the Expansion Decks on this page teach the basics of Japanese grammar and a lot of vocabulary in a way that helps students have fun learning. If you've ever wanted to learn Japanese, or you know someone who does, I invite you to join in the fun!\nMost cards in Japanese: The Game are actual Japanese words, like mizu meaning Water or nomu meaning Drink. You play the cards by following a color pattern explained in the instructions (and an Easy Reference Card) that makes your sentence automatically grammatically correct. Here's an example from the Japanese Food Expansion (of the first Kickstarter):\nWhen you put these cards together they form a grammatically correct sentence.\nIn this case we have a sentence meaning \"(I) drink water.\" But you could play a different red-topped card, like sell, to sell water instead.\nThe cards have English letters, Japanese phonetic letters (hiragana and katakana), and Japanese Kanji so you can improve your Japanese no matter your current level, even if it's your first encounter with the language. A mobile app is also available on Android (and soon iOS) that will scan the bar code at the bottom and pronounce the word for you in Japanese so you know you're getting it right!\nIf you want to see a demo of the game being played, here's a video of the competitive play mode. You can get a good feel for the gameplay even if you only watch the first two or three minutes.\nPLAY\n\nThere are also solo and collaborative modes, so you can learn on your own or in a non-competitive group setting.\nThis Kickstarter introduces the new Tokyo Edition Core Deck, themed after my favorite city in the world! It contains a selection of simple words from the various parts of speech (nouns, verbs, etc.) that will help you learn vocabulary at the same time as Japanese sentence structure. The backgrounds of the cards will be photographs of the city and many words in the deck will be of a Tokyo-specific flavor. The words in the Tokyo Edition will be different from the Original Core produced earlier this year so you can increase your vocabulary whether or not you have the Original.\nA Core Deck has 72 cards--enough for two players. Either Core is sufficient to play the game and get comfortable with Japanese sentence structure and grammar. You need at least one Core Deck to play the game. Either a Tokyo Edition Core or an Original Core will do, or you can use them both in the same game. Expansion Decks usually have 36 cards, which is enough to add another player. (More detailed explanations of how these decks work together are in the FAQ at the bottom of the page.)\nExpansion Decks follow a specific theme or concept. The first Kickstarter project included: a Business Expansion with office vocabulary and photography by Travis Feldman, an Anime Expansion with words common to anime and art by WickedAlucard, and a Monsters (Kaiju) Expansion with classic movie monsters and art by Micah Hornung. It also had Expansions for Travel, Japanese Food, and an Intermediate-level Expansion for Conjugations. These are still available as options if your Backer Level includes Expansions, or as add-ons, by increasing you pledge by $10 per Expansion.\nArt sample from first Kickstarter\nSo the last Kickstarter had these six Expansions:\nThis time around we're going to have a whole new set of expansions to help you learn new vocabulary and concepts!\nAbout a hundred people have asked me for a deck about animals, so we're totally doing an Animals Expansion. A lot of people don't know how awesome and complete the Japanese list of animal sounds is. Rabbits, dragonflies, and foxes actually say something in Japanese, and their sounds will be on the cards!\nFor those interested in the beauty of the language, we'll have the first Advanced Expansion: Calligraphy with brushwork by the amazing Japanese calligrapher Yamasaki Sho with cards that will look like this:\nThis deck will help players learn Japanese kanji and gain points by building words made up of several characters. The kanji's meaning and dictionary-style examples of each character will be in the rules document, as will many word-building options and the bar codes to scan for pronunciation. So the cards will have full functionality, and will definitely still be usable by less advanced learners with some effort, but the card faces will be minimalist, focused on the beautiful art of written Japanese.\nSpeaking to children requires a kind of Japanese that is both loving and authoritative. The Children Expansion will teach you words you don't use when talking to adults... unless they're acting like children (which happens). It will also help you tell them to sit still, play nice, take turns, and brush their teeth.\nPeople love learning vocabulary that's easy to remember, which is why one of the most requested decks is a Household Items Expansion. You'll learn the words for things you see every day so you can repeat them in your head. You could even place the Fridge card on the fridge with a magnet. But don't put the waste basket card in the waste basket.\nThe Martial Arts: White Belt Expansion is also rolling out with this Kickstarter. Words valuable in martial arts will be included for study and hilarity. Mixing and matching it with other expansions can result in glorious sentences like \"If Godzilla attacks, our honorable grandfather will roundhouse kick him into an office building.\"\nJapanese culture has a strong social structure that is reflected in their language. You use different pronouns and verbs when referring to people of a higher or lower social level. The Intermediate Expansion: Respect will include names, titles, and verbs with varying degrees of respect to help you speak appropriately in different situations. And you can even be in it! See pledge levels to the right.\nThe surprise SLANG EXPANSION is an amazing deck. In a survey during the original Kickstarter it was the second-most requested but the one wanted most emphatically. It is now available as an option for Backers at Gakusha Level and up, and is FREE for all backers at the Samurai Level ($80) and above!!\nBecause we hit $46,000 in funding, we also get the Fantasy Expansion! With artwork by Alice Bessoni, this expansion will help you learn how to make sentences like \"The young warrior defeats the evil wizard.\" Here's a sample of her art (or see this link for more information):\nThe Fantasy Expansion will feature Western-style fantasy art. You can look forward to a Japanese-style Fantasy deck called the \"Storytelling Supercore\" next year.\nThe Counting Expansion was unlocked when we reached our $80,000 stretch goal! Counting is a little different in Japanese and this Expansion Deck will help you learn your numbers and how to count people, cards, bikes, books, and other every-day objects!\nIf we reach the $90,000 Stretch Goal, we'll also get an Anatomy Expansion with nouns like Arm, Shoulder, Leg, Neck, and verbs like Turn, Reach, and Point. This is very useful vocabulary and the explanations and example sentences will help you make sure you're using them properly.\nHere's a helpful table of the reward levels available:\nJUST UNLOCKED: THE COUNTING EXPANSION! See \"Decks\" section above for details!\nAnd now a new Add-on is available--a wooden Double Box! This black-stained wooden box will hold up to four Core Decks plus 12-14 Expansion Decks. It has a divider running the length inside and is sized to accommodate sleeved cards. The red Japanese: The Game logo is screen-printed on top. It is available as an add-on for $28.\nIf you have any questions about these backer levels, please feel free to message me at any time!\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Now we can have the beautiful art for a much-requested Fantasy Expansion! It will be available to anyone as an add-on for backers under the Samurai Level, but from Samurai Level up, it will be included at no charge!! So when you share the project, let everyone know that certain tiers get all the new Expansions, because I've got a feeling it's not going to stop here!!!\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: There are a whole lot of backers who are going to want a box large enough for both the previous Kickstarter and the current one. When we reached 500 backers we unlocked a Double Box with enough room for 4 Core Decks and 12-14 Expansion Decks! This is now available as a $15 add-on.\nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: At $65,000 we bumped up the Martial Arts: White Belt Expansion to be an Expansion and a half!! Instead of the standard 36 cards, it will have 54 cards. That's 50% more punch, kick, and throw in Japanese!\nFOURTH STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: At $80,000 we earned the Counting Expansion, which will not only teach you how to count in Japanese, but also to count objects. Every time you count things in Japanese you use a \"counter.\" This expansion teaches a very important skill a lot of English speakers have a hard time picking up, so congratulation on unlocking this one!\nFIFTH STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: At 1,000 backers, the Tokyo Edition Core Deck got a Wild Card! If you're playing and your hand is one noun away from an amazing combo or one particle away from an amazing, game-changing sentence, this card will hit the spot automatically. I think you're going to love the little twist this gives the game.\nSIXTH STRETCH GOAL: If we reach $90,000 we'll get the Anatomy Expansion! It will contain nouns like Arm, Shoulder, Leg, Neck, and verbs like Turn, Reach, and Point. This is very useful vocabulary and the explanations and example sentences will help you make sure you're using them properly. I hope we can break this barrier because that would be AWESOME!\nJapanese: The Game is helping people learn Japanese in 45 countries already, but this is just the beginning. More target languages like Korean and Mandarin are in the works, and producing the game in more home languages like German and French will allow all millions of people to enjoy greater understanding.\nBut in the near future, I'd like to put some free study games on JapaneseTheGame.com. I also want to roll out a Lost Words Expansion with some words I really wish I could have included in the Original Core and the Original Expansions, as well as a handful of others.\nIf you like what's happening with this project, I invite you to back it and share it. If you're in a board gaming group or a Japanese class or an anime club or you know people who are, I'm sure they'll at least be interested to know this exists. There's a Share button right below the main video at the top!\nThanks for your support! Let's change the world!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first Kickstarter for Japanese: The Game had a much greater than anticipated response, funding at over 2200% of the campaign goal. That made every bump and hiccup in the process much more consequential, and the expected three- and four-month delivery dates ran all the way to 8 months. Almost 10% of the original backers are still waiting for their cards, which have been printed but are bound up in distribution complications. I've chosen a new distribution contractor for this project.\n\nSince then I've rearranged my life to dedicate full time to Japanese: The Game. I've also stretched the delivery dates to six months even though I have more time every month to work on it.

That means the files I loaded into the previous Chinese printer were also bad, but I didn't work with them long enough to find that out. And with the current, American printer I got so frustrated when I found this out that I had a sense of dread every time I'd think about the project. In the last couple of weeks I went back to find out where the files started being useless and was relieved to find that at least my source material is mostly intact. Our developer Jacob has created a tool to recompile the source material. He also made one to create the PnPs. So the fact that I don't have to do it all myself is a positive.

The project is literally about \"reading\" the earth for letterforms, or alphabet shapes, \"written\" into the topology of buildings, roads, rivers, trees, and lakes. To do this, we will traverse the entire planet's worth of satellite imagery and develop the tools and methods necessary to map these features hiding in plain sight. \nThe entire letterform database will be made available as a \u201cusable\u201d dataset for any of your art/design/science/textual projects and selected letterforms will be made into a truetype/opentype font format that can be imported to your favorite word processor.\nOnly with your support can we turn topography into typography and bring Aerial Bold to you!\nWhy Kickstarter? \nContrary to popular belief, much of the world has not been mapped. While satellites orbit around the earth taking thousands of images each day, we have limited idea about what unique features actually live on those photographs.\nAerial Bold is as much about developing new methods of mapping features on the earth\u2019s surface, as it is about generating the first map and typeface of the planet. It is our intention to offer non-domain experts (e.g. artists, designers, citizen scientists, etc.) a set of tools to source their own datasets and inspire people from all backgrounds to explore geographic data. The importance in kickstarting Aerial Bold is to showcase the creative and technical process of \u201cmaking your own data\u201d.\nAs a two-man army, we will be experimenting with \u201cnew\u201d ways to train image processing algorithms to find geometric patterns and use these scalable methods to find the shapes of the alphabet over the entire earth.\nOn a small scale, such as in a community or small city, image processing tasks don\u2019t pose a big challenge, however on a large scale (e.g. the entire earth, or the entire US), the computational requirements can be paralyzing. This is why we\u2019re asking for your help.\nWith your support we will be able to purchase dedicated computing/server space to run our satellite image based alphabet searching algorithm. The funding support will help keep the typeface, the maps, and the alphabet metadata (e.g. geo-coordinates, address, etc) alive in cyberspace for people to download, use, view, and explore.\nWho Are We?\nBenedikt Gro\u00df\n@bndktgrs\nBenedikt is a computational and speculative designer from Germany with over 12 years of experience in design, digital media, and computer programming.

While we are dedicated to deriving earth\u2019s letterforms by developing the best possible methods using computer vision, there will most certainly be some cases in which more manual labor will be employed. This will be especially true for regions of the world where imagery and data are of lower resolution and less available and when validating each letterform (e.g. is what the computer thinks is an alphabet shape indeed an alphabet shape?). \n\nThrough brute-force approach (manually finding letters), we\u2019ve already compiled a complete alphabet dataset, and in many cases have found multiples of each letter. We know there are more out there and we want you to have access to all of them. \n\nLegalise:\nDeriving data from satellite imagery is and can be a tricky thing from a legal point of view. All of the companies that provide aerial imagery online (e.g. Google, etc) have specific terms and conditions, which almost always forbid any data mining of the imagery. For some aerial imagery providers, however, there are provisions that allow you to derive data from their imagery (e.g. if the data is contributed to OSM, openstreetmap.org).\n\nThese are indeed important considerations, but we\u2019re optimistic and have already planned out ways forward. First, we approach one of the aerial imagery providers and they simply allow us to use the data for this project (we\u2019ll keep you updated!). If we have no luck in accessing pre-made global imagery tileset, no problem! We can start with the parts of the world where imagery is available at high resolutions under public domain (e.g. in the United States) and continue from there. Regardless of the imagery source, we will combine the imagery data with OSM data which includes quite a comprehensive global database of vector buildings, roads, trees, lakes, rivers, etc. Together, these will serve as the basis of our alphabet shapes. \n\nNone of these approaches are mutually exclusive. \n\nWe are confident that we can bring Aerial Bold to you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Reward Shipping", "update_content": "Aerial Bold is Finally Here!\nDear Backers and Friends of Aerial Bold,\nPLAY"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "3...2...1...

Earth has sent a team of explorers to investigate them, but after an accident, you are the sole survivor. Your mission remains the same: survey these worlds and write the only accounts of them that outsiders will ever know.\nThe game is now in development, and will launch in the first quarter of 2015 for Windows, Mac, and Linux on Steam. Beta keys will go out as soon as the Kickstarter ends.\nIf you are unable to pledge on Kickstarter, or missed the Kickstarter period, you can still pledge and get most rewards here.\nWe created Elegy so that everyone can write. As you explore, the game helps you create the narrative. You begin on Shelley's World, now devoid of life. A bloated, red sun scorches a landscape of towers, sculptures, and cryptic machinery.\nAs you encounter these elements, Elegy will cue you with a series of writing prompts. Here, for instance, the game asks you to describe the landscape:\nThere are many stories to write and many places to visit, from the crumbling museum, stone faces, and sweltering plains of Shelley's World to the central planning station on Keats' World to the desiccated shores and frigid tundra of Byron's World.\nEach world offers multiple sets of prompts, each intended to inspire you to write a different story about it. Elegy might ask you to write a short story about an individual's final days, a song about resignation, or a poem about war. In the more advanced levels, you'll sometimes get new information halfway through your story which casts a new light on things and forces you to take your story in a different direction. We like to think of those as puzzles -- writing yourself out of a corner, so to speak.\nWhen you've completed your narrative, you have the option to share it with other players through Steam Workshop or reproduce it in digital and print media.\nShare your stories and read other players' stories.\nYou can read other players' works, browsing through the most-recent, the best-loved, and recently-trending stories.

Here's some of the kudos we've received:\nSelected preview articles and other mentions:\nEurogamer: The write stuff: Elegy for a Dead World preview\nRock Paper Shotgun: Shelley They Can\u2019t Be Serious\nJoystiq: Elegy for a Dead World turns players into poets\nMashable: 8 Breathtaking Indie Games Stealing Hearts at E3\nBBC: E3: What video games to expect for the new-gen consoles\nPC Gamer: The Best PC Games of 2014\nNew Scientist: Storytelling beats action in new games\nEl Pa\u00eds: Jugar con versos en el planeta Byron\nAnd here's a Gamespot video interview from the E3 convention in LA, with project leads Ichiro and Ziba.\nDevelopment started in October 2013 on what was initially a week-long experiment. It has since grown into a passion project that we've been self-funding. We're committed to finishing this project, but we need your help to give it the final push.\nTo create a world, the game's designers, Ichiro and Ziba, sit down to consume British Romance-era poetry, and sketch them as stories. Illustrators Jonathan and Luigi interpret that to create flat-colored mockups, which Luigi spends months turning into the beautiful hand-drawn scenes and layers that you see in the game:\nArtwork, from concept to completion\nWe still have a lot left to do:\nPainting and animating additional artwork for each world\nCreating lush soundscapes\nComposing multiple writing prompts and puzzles\nYour pledge will help us take the time we need to achieve our vision.

Save stories locally, and create images you can share on your website, blog, or an image hosting site. If you've selected a Steam key as a reward, you'll receive a link to download the DRM-free version after version 1.0 of the game launches.\nGOAL REACHED: 1,000 Stories\nEducators have approached us about using Elegy to teach creative writing and language skills. Help us reach this goal, and we'll give a hand-picked group of schools 1,000 copies of the game for free.\nDejobaan Games has been making games since 1999, and is approaching its 20th commercial launch. The multi-award-winning studio is best known for its BASE jumping game AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! \u2014 A Reckless Disregard for Gravity, visual novel Monster Loves You!, and bullet-hell FPS Drunken Robot Pornography.\nPopcannibal's awards include an IndieCade E3 Selection, IGF Honorable Mention 2014, Official Selection Gamercamp Toronto 2013, Unity Awards Finalist 2013, Official Selection PAX East Indie Showcase 2011, and \"Most Meaningful Game\" at the International Academic Conference on Meaningful Play 2008.

During the summer, the ebook of the first year of stories appeared regularly in the list of Amazon's top 100 selling superhero novels. It's been positively reviewed as a serial on Web Fiction Guide, and as novel at Goodreads, and Amazon.\nThe Legion of Nothing: Vol. 1, Rebirth\nI'd like to make more of the Legion's adventures available on Amazon, but 1889 Labs, the small press I was working with, is not currently publishing new fiction.\nTo bring the books to readers at the same level of quality as before, I'll need your help. \nWhere the Legion of Nothing Came From:\nBack in 2007, I'd decided I wanted to publish a story on my blog. It couldn't be a story that publishing houses would want because then I would have lost out on a chance to become a published author.\nFortunately, superhero fiction (stories about superheroes without the comic) was completely impossible to publish. It didn't even have a section where you'd expect to find it in the local bookstore.\nIf it appeared at all, it would be the novelization of a movie in the science fiction section.\nThe Story I Wanted To See:\nOnce I knew that, I began to think about the superhero stories that I wanted to see. I wanted to write stories consistent with the years of time I'd spent learning Tae Kwon Do. I wanted to write stories where the fights felt realistic, but also fights where the violence wasn't glorified.\nIn my view at least, I'd read too many stories where one tough guy fought another tough guy, and both of them were completely used to the idea that they'd probably completely destroy a city's downtown when they fought.\nI wanted to write about people who wouldn't be used to it, people who would feel guilty if they destroyed somebody's small business during a fight, and people who would be bothered about how much they'd have to hurt somebody to stop them.\nIn the end I came up with Nick Klein and his friends, teenagers who'd inherited their powers and equipment from their nearly legendary grandparents. They're simultaneously kids of whom great things are expected, but also kids who are connected to cape culture, but not part of it.\nThis means that the life of a superhero is familiar to them, but it's not normal.\nWhere We Are Now:\nIn the past seven years, the Legion of Nothing has gone from a series of stories on my blog to a story that people outside my family and friends have actually heard of.\nI'd like to turn the next two years of Legion of Nothing stories into ebooks and print, and I'd like to do it with the same standards as before.\nWith $1,500, I'll be able to publish the second Legion of Nothing book (Powers) and the campaign will be fully funded.\nWhat I'm Asking For:\nI'm asking for $1500. This is how it breaks down.\n$500 for creating a cover and formatting it for print and ebook\n$250 for proofreading\n$250 for ISBN numbers\n$500 for rewards and taxes\nIf we make $3000, it will be pretty much the same for the second book except add $500 for editing the second book and skip the $250 for ISBN numbers.\nStretch Goals: \nWith $3000, I'll be able to publish the third book (Dueling Powers).\nTo help encourage people to donate and reach $3000, I've made a few changes.\nTo rewards:\nAs of now, anyone who donated $25 or more automatically gets all three ebooks in their preferred format--Kindle, epub, or pdf.\nAlso as of now, anyone who donated more than $150 gets signed print versions of the first three books. \nIt's worth noting, however, that book 3 ebooks and printed books will come in April rather than January.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge I see is shipping out all the physical rewards. While I've chosen reliable suppliers (Createspace for books and Vistaprint for everything else), there's still a chance that there will be problems.

I've been furloughed from my job during the month of May and have been using the time to work on the third book. It's been part of an overall pattern I've noticed.

The other part, though, was to ask if anyone had any questions that they'd like to see answered before the serial ends. To be clear, that won't happen soon, but it will happen.\n\nRelated to that, I began the process of plotting out the rest of the series today. The way it's looking right now, that'll be six additional novel length works plus assorted short stories and novellas. At my current writing speed, that'll be six years of work. We'll see what actually happens. My hope is to put out at least one novel per year, possibly more. I've got roughly eight novel length works on the site right now (one of which is a short story collection), so we could see 14 Legion of Nothing novels before all this is over.

We spent hours pretending to be wizards and casting epic imaginary spells.\nNow, we want to bring that kind of creative freedom to video games.  Instead of giving the player pre-packaged spells, CodeSpells allows you to craft your own magical spells.  It's the ultimate spellcrafting sandbox.\nWhat makes it all possible is code.  The game provides a coding interface where you can specify exactly what your spells will do. This interface is intuitive enough for individuals (young and old) who have never coded before.  But skilled coders will also enjoy using their coding skills in new and creative ways!  Even children can use this interface to make mountains out of the terrain, make an impenetrable force field around yourself, or even make a golem creature out of the surrounding rocks. The sky is the limit!\nSpell-crafting sandbox: Craft and test your spells on the surrounding landscape - lift rocks, whip a river up into a tornado, anything!  The spells are cooler spells than in any video game to date -- because you and the rest of the CodeSpells community have complete control over them.  If you'd rather use \"boxed\" spells (maybe for inspiration before designing your own spells) these will be available too!\nUnlimited creative expression: With 4 different elements (earth, fire, water, air) and the ability to combine those elements in complex ways, the number of spells you can create is literally infinite.\nLearn some coding: If you already know coding, great! If not, CodeSpells uses an intuitive drag-and-drop language that even children can use.  As they become more proficient, they can code in typed Javascript!  It's the coolest way to learn one of the world's most valuable skills. \nShare spells with friends: As soon as you create a new spell, send it over to your friends for them to try out! CodeSpells will have community forums where users can show off their favorite spells with other wizards or work collaboratively on spell projects.\nPlay Online: Create new game modes to play with and against your friends. We'll give you the tools to make anything from a survival game to a new magic-based sport!\nFor the CodeSpells world we will be creating procedurally generated levels that change over time as you affect the elements and their distributions throughout the map. We've come up with a system for simulating the effects of elements in the world that will dynamically change as the environment changes. An area in shadow will be less hot than an area in direct sunlight. Altitude will change the weather. Land close to a water source will be humid, so more vegetation will grow there. Hot and dry areas will be more prone to catching fire. We'll be able to simulate fire spreading, water flowing through new areas, and constantly changing biomes. The world will feel truly dynamic and alive.\nFor the sandbox version of CodeSpells you'll be able to freely use any spells you create to affect these environments and understand the way the systems work together. You'll be able to redirect rivers and play with the environment as a living system.\nYou will be able to level up from experience gained through gameplay. Each element will be bound to a different mana bar that can be increased so that your character can be customized.  Specialize in one element, or learn them all.\nWe are developing several game modes that make full use of the generated areas of CodeSpells, but we'll also be opening up the ability to make new game modes to you. If you want to make a game about surviving in the wilderness, you'll have all the tools to do that. If you want to create a game mode that's purely about balancing an eco-system, you'll also be able to do that. You can even create a new multiplayer magic-based sport to play with your friends. You'll be able to share these and discover game modes that other people have create around the world. At the core, CodeSpells is about creative expression. We want you to be able to customize the experience and give you the power to use your magic in the worlds you create.\nThe statistics about coding education are alarming: \nPart of the reason kids choose not to pursue coding is because it doesn't sound \"fun\": working in a basement, dealing with syntax errors... We hope to make an impact in the world by showing kids (and adults) that coding can be a tool for creative expression.\nStudents can learn to code, syntax-error free using a Blockly spell-crafting interface that has all the tools available in Javascript. When they've learned all the programming concepts from Blockly, students can move on to typing Javascript code.\nThe wizards of CodeSpells will be able to master each of the 5 elements. As you grow more powerful, elemental magic can be combined into even stronger spells.\nEarth\nEarth is aligned with geological forces and a deep understanding of the physical world. Earth magic users understand the geological timescale. These wizards are both powerful builders, building castles and deforming terrain, but also powerful foes, with the ability to hurl boulders and create secret pitfalls.\nEarth orbs use the physical forces of the world to attract and repel objects away from each. They can apply directional forces or torques to objects they touch. With Earth magic you could create a rock fortress that only you know the secret way into or you could create a Rock Golem to defend you as you explore the world.\nFire \nFire is the spark that started the universe. While fire users appreciate a fire's simple light and warmth, they can also unlock its more destructive potential -- burning forests and melting glaciers.\nA fire orb has the ability to burn things in its path, but it also has the ability to reconstruct things from ashes at a high mana cost. A player could teleport themselves by turning themselves into ash, having the orb fly through an un-walkable area, and reconstructing themselves on the other side.\nWater \nWater is an ever-changing substance, and water wizards are aware of water in all its forms: water, ice, and vapor.\nWater orbs are primarily about interacting with the flow of the environment. You can redirect rivers or put out fires. You can affect the world in a sustained way to flood an area or to create new forests.\nAir \nAir ties everything together and is combined with the other elements to amplify their precision. Because of its broad area, air is often used as a defensive art.\nAir orbs are about sensing the world. They have a wide radius and have a more defined understanding of what they touch. As a wizard you can capture sounds from one area and alter the way they manifest themselves. If you wanted to be stealthy, you could use an air orb to suppress your footstep sounds or emit them elsewhere to confuse creatures or other players.\nLife (The 5th Element) \nLife is the most powerful element, and therefore the most difficult to master (See stretch goals). Life magic can be used to grow forests and affect creatures.\nLife orbs represent a deeper understanding of programming and being able to deconstruct prebuilt code. Creatures will have code that through observation and Life orbs you'll be able to open up and explore. With that, you can alter their behavior and tame them. If you see a creature defending its home, you can cast a Life orb to study the creature and expose the concept of 'defending a target'. You then have access to the defend function for a creature and can redirect it to defend you.\nAdrian Lopez-Mobilia, Lead Video Game Developer - Adrian has been developing video games for several years. He was the Lead Programmer for the indie game God of Blades and has done robotics research.\nJason Rosenstock, Lead Video Game Artist - Jason has been an Illustrator & Environment Artist for 15 years with a specialty in Fantasy Art.

With Kickstarter, we feel like we can connect with you and get feedback immediately from people truly interested in seeing CodeSpells succeed.\nCurrent Status\nWe have a system for crafting spells in a drag-and-drop language. We have an early version of gameplay for earth magic completed, and we've started prototyping the other elements, but we still have plenty more to develop.\nPost-Kickstarter Timeline\nThis Kickstarter will fund the development of three more elements (Fire, Air, and Water) and the polishing of the final game over the course of 1 year. We want CodeSpells to be an experience with AAA game quality.\nDecember 2014: The Alpha of CodeSpells will be released to our \"$80 & up\" backers on Christmas Day of 2014.\nJune 2015: The Beta of CodeSpells will be released to our \"$30 & up\" backers. We look forward to using the feedback from our Alpha & Beta Kickstarter backers while we improve the gameplay. \nSeptember 2015: All Kickstarter backers will receive a copy of the Creative Mode of CodeSpells.\nIf we get funded beyond:\nEarly 2016: We'll polish and release the multiplayer game creation tools so you can create your own new multiplayer games within CodeSpells.\nSummer 2016: First release of Life as an element in the game. There will be creatures, plants, and NPCs to interact with in the world.\nHolidays 2016: We'll give you the tools for a new Artificial Intelligence system for the NPCs that populate the world along with a dialog system so you can create new story based adventures within CodeSpells.\nEarly 2017: Create your own new species and custom characters with new tools and an in-game character creator.\nWe want CodeSpells to be a game with AAA quality but that requires time and money. We need to purchase licenses and be able to pay developers. Each new feature in CodeSpells needs to work not only as a clearly defined system, but also one that's fun to play with. Making a world where you have infinite freedom to bend the rules requires attention to details that you could usually cheat or mask in the development of other games.\nWe also need to be able to pay people for new sounds, music, animations, and all of the things you'd expect from a fully realized game!\nAfter we release CodeSpells to Kickstarter backers in September 2015, we plan to sell copies of this version of CodeSpells. This revenue will be used to make further enhancements to the game. (See our stretch goals below.) We want to keep adding these new features to the game to enable you even more creativity. We would like for CodeSpells to continue to evolve and grow as we get more feedback and people playing it.\nAdditional Backer Rewards:\nStephen & Sarah, researchers at UC San Diego, knew they wanted to create a video game that taught young students how to code. They knew that coding should be completely immersed in the gameplay, but how? They decided to use a metaphor for coding in the game: magic. They decided students will play the role of a wizard, and they will craft magical spells in Java code.\nWhile developing this first iteration of CodeSpells for their research at UC San Diego, Sarah & Stephen published several academic papers about the educational aspects of CodeSpells:\n\"From competition to metacognition: designing diverse, sustainable educational games.\"\n\"On the nature of fires and how to spark them when you're not there.\" \n\"CodeSpells: embodying the metaphor of wizardry for programming.\"\n\"Codespells: how to design quests to teach java concepts.\"\nWord soon got out about this game that attempted to teach young students how to program. CodeSpells was featured in Wired, RockPaperShotgun, and UC San Diego news, after which it was picked up by bloggers across the internet. KPBS even filmed some local San Diego students trying out the game. \nAmidst all this, Sarah & Stephen teamed up with Lindsey to co-found a company (ThoughtSTEM) to educate local San Diego kids in coding through after-school programs, summer camps, and more. ThoughtSTEM soon expanded across San Diego into other cities in California and is now branching out into other states.\nThe ThoughtSTEM team always had bigger dreams for CodeSpells though. For this game to educate the most people possible, they knew CodeSpells needed a makeover. Everything from the look & feel, gameplay, and even the coding interface left something to be desired. They had a great concept, but they needed expert Game Designers & Coders to make the dream a reality.\nThat's where Adrian & Jason came in. Having worked in the game development industry for several years, they brought new vision & inspiration to the CodeSpells project. We're excited to turn this vision into a reality with your help!\n                                                                                                                      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks inherent in a video game development project are self evident, but ThoughtSTEM has a history of following through on successful projects (including LearnToMod, a software that teaches kids to code in Minecraft), and we plan to do the same with CodeSpells. With Backer funding, we have an excellent team with the skills necessary to create a fun & exciting video game. In addition, ThoughtSTEM has been previously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and we plan to apply for NSF grant funding again to further improve CodeSpells as a coding educational product. Therefore, CodeSpells development will not suddenly stop when development for the Kickstarter is completed.

But if you invite your friends, you won't just be bashing enemies, you'll be creating legends together. \nBuild your mythology: Your actions show if you are more of a Trickster or a Saviour or something else entirely. At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up. The soundtrack will be an all-original collaboration by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron, combining orchestral compositions with delicate vocals and a wide variety of percussion.\nThe trailer offers a sneak preview of the main theme song, \"G U I L T Y M O O N\": \n If the embedded track above doesn't work, or you want a more permanent bookmark for continuous repetition, here's a Soundcloud link!\nIn our latest update, we also included two more track previews. Listen to \"Blue\":\nAnd \"Solar Flare\":\nThe lovely voice you hear is actually important to the story and setting of the game, but we don't dare spoil anything...\nIf there's one thing that creators fight, it's obscurity.  \nMoon Hunters was one of the very first games on the Square Enix Collective. Both we and Square Enix were happy that it went on to earn over 1,000 Yes votes, with an 83% approval rating.\nFurther, following a thorough Team Assessment conducted by Square Enix, they concluded: \"Kitfox Games is a small and vibrant team with passion and drive, matched by a high level of ambition. They seem to be hard-working, diligent and professional and Moon Hunters looks engaging, unique and accessible. Square Enix Collective is very happy to support the team\u2019s crowdfunding campaign, and we believe that Kitfox have the skills and capabilities to make the game they\u2019re describing in this pitch.\u201d You can download and read the full Team Assessment at your leisure.\nWe're not getting money from Square Enix. Square Enix is just helping us find our players -- you! We're just four devs trying to scrape by and make a game. Without a big marketing budget, we need all the help we can get! \nYou can read a deeper discussion of why we think partnering with the S.E. Collective is worthwhile at CinemaBlend. Essentially, we want to make a game, and we want to make sure that the people who would love it get a chance to hear that it exists.\nIf you are into RPGs and/or mythology and/or old-fashioned co-op fun, Moon Hunters is the game for you. \nWe are four upstarts that, despite our modest successes in the game industry, don't have savings to fall back on in times of need. To put it bluntly, we're poor, and Moon Hunters is our dream game to make. We can't do it alone. \nPhoto credit: Belziir Photography\n We need your help to make Moon Hunters the best game it can be. We'll use your money to develop the game's programming, art, music, and design for longer and with more help than we could normally dream of affording. Besides, if nobody likes it and we don't get funded, we might be heartbroken, but at least it saves us from spending a year eating cans of beans making a game that people don't want! Win/win! \nThis is also a great opportunity to get feedback and input from players that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together. \nWe try not to let the Canadian winter keep us down...\nSo, if Moon Hunters seems like the kind of game you might want to play, please consider chipping in and spreading the word! \nWe're still in the prototyping phase of production, so there's a lot of game left to make. But we're covering most of it! We decided to take the sales money from Shattered Planet and our company savings to help cover licenses, software, traveling to conferences, and most of the core team salaries, if this Kickstarter succeeds. \nThe money will be spent as follows:  \nFirst, 5% goes to Kickstarter, 3% goes to Visa/Mastercard/Amazon, and 19% goes to Quebec/Canadian taxes.\nThen, 5% goes to Square Enix. \nWe estimate it will take between $5000 and $7000 to handle production and shipping of all of the backer rewards (depending on which tiers are more popular), or about 12%\nThat leaves us the remaining $22,000 or so to spend on audio, more art, a content designer, and additional programmer time.\nThe core team members of Kitfox are the same core team from developing Shattered Planet, which was developed from idea to release on four platforms in 13 months (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). It received praise from The New Yorker, CNET, and others, and remains highly praised on Steam. It was also chosen to be at the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2014!\n And who are we? We're Kitfox Games!\nThe limited edition T-shirt design is on charcoal grey cotton and features a Spellblade design.\nClick to view a higher-res version!\n We're offering 4 different 12x18\" poster designs, signed by the core team for a limited run, unique to this Kickstarter.\nClick to view a high-res version!\nIf you purchase a fabric print, you can choose from one of five different 10x13\" designs (one for each character class and a cloth map representing one possible world configuration), printed directly onto Belgian linen. They are safe to wash, though we don't recommend using them as a BBQ bib, okay?\nThe Digital Art Book will include the concept art of Moon Hunters. You will get a hand-picked collection of beautiful watercolour artworks in a neatly designed PDF file. It includes some exclusive early concepts that we haven't shown to anyone!\nHere's a visual guide to all the tiers and rewards in their pixel glory:\nIf you can't find the perfect tier, why not build your own?\nDuring checkout, add the following amounts manually to your total pledge. If you've already backed us, go to \"Manage Pledge\" and add the appropriate amount (or more) to your total. Keep your original pledge tier the same.

Just in case you\u2019re unable to trim you number of cards down, a couple millimeters were added to the width to make it more roomy at capacity. If you have just a few cards, you\u2019ll enjoy a wallet that doesn\u2019t weigh you down.\n*Based on backer feedback, I've come up with a new FLAT logo design that goes on the interior. See this update for details...\nMICRO SS Black/Orange (Now without an exterior label)\nMICRO SS Black/Gray (Now without an exterior label)\nMicro SS Kickstarter Edition\nNew interior flat logo\nOriginal SS\nThis format places the cards next to each other resulting in the thinnest wallet possible. The footprint is a bit larger, but fits in both front and back pockets easily. Based on customer suggestions, the interior slots are spread out 1 per panel so the thickness of the wallet is more evenly distributed. Slots stretch so multiple cards can be placed in each one unlike the Tyvek version.\nOriginal SS Black/Orange (Now without an exterior label)\nOriginal SS Black/Gray (Now without an exterior label)\nOriginal SS Kickstarter Edition\n(Note: will NOT have exterior logo as pictured)\n*Note: Unlike the Tyvek models, this one cannot be double-folded due to a thin reinforcement insert.\nMaterial \nDuring prototyping, I sent some test models to previous customers\u2026 here\u2019s an example from the feedback:\n\"I tested the prototype of the wallet you sent me in my summer holidays. I used it intensively, and the material does not show any trace of use. So I think that this is the perfect material.\" -Ant\u00f3nio (Portugal)\nDurable\nOriginally created for motorcycle wear, the material was subjected to 70mph crash tests using real pavement during development. Yet the thing I find most amazing is how soft it feels because its strength is derived by blending super-strong synthetics together at high weave densities. Like high thread count sheets, this stuff feels amazing. \nWaterproof\nStain resistant\nMachine washable (no fabric softener please!)\nThin\nAt less than .5mm thick, the material has enough body to be substantial, yet adds virtually nothing to your load. Like Tyvek, it can be cut without its edges fraying so the versatile card slot design can be carried over. This construction method contributes to the wallet being 2-3 times thinner than leather wallets. \nThe Original Soft Shell further reduces thickness by employing a side-by-side configuration. Instead of overlapping cards, two stacks are created which drastically reduces the overall thickness of a full wallet.\nEnvironmental\nBluesign\u00ae is a system of qualifying earth-friendly chemicals before use in manufacturing resulting in products that have a lower environmental footprint. Its used by some of the more progressive leaders in the apparel industry:\nPatagonia: Patagonia has worked with bluesign\u00ae technologies since 2000 to evaluate and reduce resource consumption in our materials supply chain, and to assist us with managing the chemicals, dyes and finishes used in the process.\nNorth Face: We are proud of the work we have done in partnership with bluesign technologies to achieve bluesign\u00ae approved fabric designation in a number of The North Face\u00ae products.\nBurton: In 2011, Burton engaged industry-leading bluesign\u00ae technologies to help us dive deeper into making our products and supply chain more friendly for people and the environment.\nMade in USA\nTo execute a design like this takes a variety of partners and I\u2019m happy to work with ones from the US, most of them local. Sewing is done in San Francisco by a shop that does prototyping for high-end bags, but I use them for production in order to achieve highest quality.\nFulfillment is executed by a family-owed San Jose warehouse, and other functions such as die creation are done by specialty shops around the country.\nRewards\nThis is my second Kickstarter project and I\u2019m incredibly thankful to all of the backers of the SlimFold MICRO Tyvek wallet. Despite the amazing response, I delivered all 5,000+ wallets on time (most of them early). Your feedback also enabled me to improve the product by adding reinforcement inserts, which dramatically improved durability. Based on that concept of a thin outer shell paired with built-in reinforcements, the Soft Shell line was born.\nI\u2019ve found the perfect material to use for the next SlimFold, but need your help to bring the project to life since it must be custom produced in large quantities.

(underdog) a competitor thought to have little chance of winning a fight or contest\n2. one born under the sign of the dog (Canis Major - Sirius) embodying loyalty, speed, the hunt, and watchfulness\nFrom Ishii-san:\n\u201cIf your parents, family, or classmates are taken hostage and if you die, your family will die too. If you fail, your family will die. If you run away, your family will die. In such a situation where you are driven into a corner [...] and must kill [your] fellow compatriots.\u201d What would you do? How would you live out your life? Your death? \u201c[...] if you have only the choice of dying, how will you die, how can that death help the world that you have left behind?\u201d This is what it is to be \u201cUnder the Dog.\u201d\nOur enemy is the light of Humanity\nThe year is 2025 in the city of Tokyo Bayside Special District, five years following the devastation wrought by a specially enhanced groups of terrorists at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Out of the ashes of that desolation, the UN formed a special covert branch headquartered in Tokyo Bay solely purposed with searching out and eliminating the forces responsible for the attack along with anyone even bearing a remote resemblance to them.\nAs a cover, the International School for Boys and Girls was established for the ongoing covert operation of discovering and recruiting gifted high school students, each with their own special abilities, and to coerce them in the service of an elite death squad. These troops are tasked with ferreting out and exterminating all individuals with powers like their own.\nThere is no choosing sides for these recruits and failure is not an option. Failure on the field assures not only their own, but also their loved ones' deaths. In order to assure compliance, each agent\u2019s dearest loved ones have been secretly outfitted with a micro cranial bomb and all agent's actions and speech are closely monitored and recorded through a battle chip embedded in their brain. In the event the UN commanding officer determines an agent falls out of protocol, their loved ones immediately suffer the consequences. \nAnthea Kallenberg - Number 03 - Special Operations\nAnthea, a Swedish girl, is the team's infiltrator and assassin who was personally raised by Colonel Amagata. She prides herself in her abilities in combat and for good reason. Because of her skill, Anthea is often given point on special operations, usually to get the other agents out of a jam.\nSayuri Hyuga - Number 08 - Espionage\nSayuri is a Japanese girl from Sapporo who was forced into service during middle school. As a young, intelligent girl, the art of espionage is her specialty. She is frequently paired together with Estella for missions to lure out otherwise hard to acquire targets.\nEstella - Number 02 - Sniper\nEstella is the veteran of the team having been recruited at age eight. She is a Spanish American girl skilled in long range combat, especially the sniper rifle. On missions, she is often paired with Sayuri. Although typically sarcastic, she can surprise with her warm hearted whims.\nHana Tougetsu - Number 06 - Op Support\nHana is the main character of Episode 1. Although not remarkably skilled in combat, her stereotypical Japanese high schooler exterior belies her unique gift to shift people's' moods and mental states. Using her talent, she often gives much needed stability and catharsis to the team, helping shield them from their tremendous burdens. An all around nice girl with strong family ties, she lives with her family and brother.\nColonel (Junichi) Amagata - UN Commander\nAmagata came to command the covert branch of the UN shortly after his discovery and subsequent rescue of Anthea from a human trafficking cell during a top secret mission in Scandinavia. A now former NATO soldier, Amagata poses as staff for the international school while he dictates and supervises the various missions and objectives for the team.\nTrike Design\nPLAY\n\nOne of the fun toys at Anthea's disposal is the trike which was designed by a motorcycle industry design specialist, EM, in coordination with Kozaki-san. Here are some notes from Kozaki-san regarding the different elements.\nElectric\nThe trike is all electric which allows users to approach stealthily. Plus, it\u2019s eco-friendly! It also integrates with Anthea\u2019s power suit for heads-up-display and to share charge back and forth.\nHUD\nThe on-board HUD integrates seamlessly with Anthea\u2019s power suit and helmet HUD to provide navigational data, weapons and targeting data for the trike, as well as providing a dashboard for the trike\u2019s vital stats. Modes\nThe trike has three modes which it can shift back and forth between on the fly.\nSpeed\nThis is the standard configuration for the trike and it is built for speed with a slim design.\nArmor\nFor when Anthea is taking fire from oncoming assailants, the armor plates spread out to provide cover for the pilot. During this mode the handles also shift down and hug the body of the trike. \nOffense\nThis last design offers stability and mobility to Anthea when she wants to avoid taking fire and needing to return some of her own.\nThe dual wheels in the front of the trike allow for the pilot to engage the foot controls for steering, acceleration, and deceleration.\nThe trike also integrates with Anthea\u2019s power suit in this mode to provide stabilization for firing hand weapons.\n(will update as we meet stretch goals)\n\u25cf A professionally executed 24 minute anime episode full of awesome\n\u25cf Top notch Japanese Voice-Over\n\u25cf English subtitles\n\u25cf Behind the scenes development diaries and interviews\n\u25cf An original soundtrack\nWe hope to have everything (rewards included) done and delivered by Late-2015.\nProducing a standout soundtrack and stellar sound design usually breaks the bank and makes the budgeters cry but we are getting a steal with our audio legends:\nWe chose Kickstarter for a number of reasons:\n1. The team and plan we have assembled together provide a unique vision and a quality of animation we, and you, can be proud of. We want to blow you away and it is increasingly difficult to attain that level of excellence with traditional partnerships, especially for a brand new IP.\n2. This will allow us to retain creative independence, creative rights, and thereby the confidence our vision is being represented as it should be and you will reap the benefits.\n3. If this project is successfully funded it will possibly pave the way for us to pursue other projects to further the \u201cUnder the Dog\u201d universe and even to work on additional series!\n4. We know you, as fans of great anime, have interest and would love to see something like this happen, and we love the idea that you guys will be involved and given the opportunity to help it along the way!\nBackers who pledge at the $60 reward tier and higher will have the option to add additional basic, unsigned items. \nFor Add-ons: Simply pledge at the $60 tier or higher and then add any additional amount for the desired items listed.

In such circumstances right now, a writer with remarkable talent, Jiro Ishii, who brought to the world numerous renowned adventure games during his \u201csalary man\u201d days, has now taken up the torch in order to challenge the traditions and establish this new future of \u201ccreating.\u201d This is \u201cUnder the Dog,\u201d the crowdfunding effort for an indie anime based on Jiro Ishii\u2019s original story.\nOne cannot help but pay close attention to this project. One cannot help but cheer on this project. In particular, how can this creator who garners cult-like popularity catalyze a new chemical reaction [in the industry] by putting an emphasis on \u201ccreating,\u201d which stands apart from the typical commercial oriented projects? One cannot help but look forward to this succeeding.\nJiro Ishii\u2019s indie challenge will not only change the path for \u201ccreating,\u201d but at the same time declare the answer for the question: Can game designers be accepted by the world as storytellers in [other mediums] as well?\u201d\nWe are working with top talent to create, produce, and fully realize this AAA project. We have the experience and the know-how and now we just need the support! =D\nThe next ranking challenge is producing the rewards and getting them shipped out to all y'all. We will be coordinating with our 3rd parties to ensure both quality of production and timely shipments.\nAll that said, unforeseen issues can occur and while we will provide updates on our various productions as they get underway, the hope is for the grace and patience of our backers that should accompany any artistic endeavor. Thank you!\n1.We are professionals with the resumes to back up our claims. We have each put out quality works that have been well reviewed by critics and fans alike.\n2.This cost will not go up! Because of our experience and knowledge of the industry, our goal is the honest amount of what this project will require. We have been doing this for a while and we know what we can do with a given amount of funding for an anime production!\n3. We will create a level of quality and something unique not often seen in the anime world which is simply not attainable through traditional funding and support.\n4.Costs include hiring Kinema Citrus for the animation, Japanese voice actors, English subtitles, fees, backer rewards(!), shipping, hosting, and our general operational expenses.\nNow, while percentages are good, perhaps what is not as apparent are the actual costs of things given the $580,000 budget we are going for with this KS. \n$580,000 - Total - Broken down as follows: \n-------------------------------------------------------------- \n$232,000 - 40% - Animation Production - This is the budget for the actual design, direction, and animation of said 24 mins. Note the project will actually cost closer to $350,000.\n$174,000 - 30% - Backer Rewards - Budget for reward production, warehousing, shipping, etc. \n$87,000 - 15% - Pre-Production - Money we would like to recoup from investing our own funds in the trailer (of which we have actually spent in excess of $100,000) \n$29,000 - 5% - Operational Costs - Budget for operational costs such as daily staff, web hosting, paying bills, etc. \n$29,000 - 5% - KS fees - KS levies fees for all KS campaigns. They need to make their money too \n$29,000 - 5% - Amazon Credit Card fees - The fees from Amazon Payments \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nIn closing, we will say it again and again...  We want to be able to work on something that sparks our passion and have the end result be something we and you can be proud of. We are coming to Kickstarter because we believe in the benefits it can offer over our traditional avenues of funding and it gives our fans the unique opportunity to be involved and take part of something special.\nIn Japan, it is very difficult to obtain independent funding since the anime industry heavily relies on what is known as \"seisaku iinkai\" or \"production committees.\" This committee requires buy-in from multiple major corporations that combine their efforts to help carry the load of the production costs and thereby minimize the financial risk for each individual company. One company could take on animation, another music, another advertising, another distribution, and so on. It can also drive down the costs of production due to companies willing to take an initial loss with the hopes of turning a profit over the course of several years as the anime and any licensing deals run their course (music, toys, manga, etc.).\nThese committees are usually composed of people with an investor's mindset who look to profit first and then to creative awesomeness, if at all. This can often lead to projects stalled or mired in bureaucracy, indecision, and conflicts of interest. Production committees also generally require intellectual property buyouts in which the creatives involved essentially sacrifice all rights to their work just so they can see their dreams come to fruition in any form at all.

As soon as we had something playable, we let people try it out.\nThe response to the game has been awesome and as a result, we've been cleared to bring it directly to the Steam store, which is why you can download our Demo on Steam right now and why we'll be hitting Early Access around October.\nBuild crazy vehicles out of modular blocks! Seek out enemies. Shoot blocks off them and destroy their cockpits. Scavenge their dropped blocks to make your vehicle bigger, stronger and faster.\nBuild, drive, fly, harvest, fight!\nBuild anything you can imagine! Heavy battle tanks? Yes. Fast scout vehicles? Yep. Flying carpet bombers? Why not?! Simply snap the dropped enemy blocks onto your creation by dragging and dropping, then get straight back into the fray!\nExplore on land and air\nTerraTech lets you design, construct and organise a fleet of unique vehicles to lead to victory as you battle your way across the lawless frontiers of new alien worlds in a quest for glory and profit. In the distant future, Earth's natural resources have finally been depleted, and as an off-world prospector it's your job to travel to alien planets, gather up all the good stuff and blast it back home to get paid. The rarest resources will build the best kit so expand your turf and take out enemy bases to secure your position on each planet.\nIf you can't wait to get stuck in then head over to IndieDB to play our latest demo here: www.indiedb.com/games/terratech/downloads.\nOr follow along with development here:\nIndieDB, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Twitch (daily week-day streams at 5pm UK time), Reddit, or our Official Website.\nConstruction\nBuilding your vehicles out of blocks is easy, just drag and drop them into position and away you go! No clunky menu screens or hidden-away 'build modes' to get in the way - simply grab any blocks that you want to use and chuck them on your tank.\nSimple drag and drop building\nThe whole thing happens in real-time inside the game world so you can steal enemy blocks as soon as they fall off or even rebuild yourself using fallen blocks in the middle of a heated battle.\nCombat\nExciting combat with multiple weapon choices\nAnd talking of heated battles... you're not alone on these alien worlds. The enemy is out there! They're using the same blocks as you and they're fighting just as hard to take the best resources. If you want to win, you\u2019ll have to fight. \nWeapons overload\nEquip your vehicles with all kinds of weapons to help you win; machine guns, lasers, cannons, mortars and more. There's a whole range of melee weapons too; power drills, mining bores, ram spikes, digger scoops and much more. We're adding new blocks and weapons to the game all the time, so you know there'll never be a dull moment.\nYour Base\nWhen you first land on the exo-planet, you\u2019ll do so with all of the equipment you need to refine, store and deliver the resources you collect. If your base is destroyed by rival prospectors, then you\u2019ll have no way to complete your mission, so protect it at all costs.\nA large harvesting vehicle passes by a base\nHarvesting & Crafting\nOnce you've established and stocked up your base, the next step is to seek out some of those rare resources.\nScattered throughout the world are pockets of ore (diamond, titanium, gold, and suchlike). If you can find them and bring some back to your base, you\u2019ll be able to craft new higher tier blocks or blocks which you simply won't be able to find through scavenging alone.\nHarvesting biofuel & using AI to control fleets of drones\nArtificial Intelligence Modules are the key to building a fleet. Attach these 'brains' to spare vehicles and you'll create drones to do your bidding. They'll follow your orders, watch your back in battle, help to harvest & transport resources, or even stand guard to protect your base and fleet.\nCorporations\nTerraTech's building blocks are grouped into several sets, each provided by a different Corporation, with its own style and distinctive strengths.  As you unlock new Corporations, you can experiment with many different ways to combine them - some combinations work better than others!\nThe first Early Access version of the game will include three of these Corporations - GSO, GeoCorp and Venture. Progress in TerraTech is about opening up more new corporations as you go, and licensing their technology, block by block. Of course, all this comes at a price, and you'll have to range far and wide to find the rare resources needed to manufacture the most advanced components.\nGeoCorp has heavy, powerful components\nMultiplayer & User-generated Content\nMultiplayer is a big part of the TerraTech vision. Imagine building a giant flying mothership base with your friends, tracking an enemy to their base and planning an ambush. Or taking on your buddies in the challenge modes to see who can build the best vehicles for specific scenarios.\nMultiplayer action will appear in the game at full release\nOur demo already allows you to share your tank designs with your friends via Twitter and we know that this sort of interaction is where TerraTech really comes alive. In a game about creativity and building, the experience is enhanced so much when you can share your creations with other players around the world and we've had some awesome creations shared by our community already.\nShare created content\nOf course, multiplayer and user generated content are big features for us to complete as a small team so these are the main reasons why we are asking for your help on Kickstarter.\nTerraTech is being brought to life by a core team of just four developers. \nLeft to right Kris, Sai Wun, Jolyon and founder Russ\nRuss Clarke (founder and programming lead), Kris Skellorn (design) and Sai Wun Poon (production) are full-time on the project, but not receiving a salary, and they've previously worked together at various large games studios. Between them they have nearly 40 years experience on some of gaming's biggest franchises, including; Call of Duty, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and Fable.\nThey're joined regularly by Jolyon Webb (art director) who has 16 years of industry experience at Codemasters and Blitz Games Studios. working on major franchises for Disney, DreamWorks and Nickelodeon. \nThey're supported by experienced PR and community management specialists Natalie Griffith and Joseph Barron, as well as a handful of ace freelance contributors too.\nSo far, we've managed to do a lot with not very much. We raised a small amount last year that went towards things like paying contract artists, building a website, show attendances and so on. We've made that go much further than we thought possible, but it's going to run out soon!\nOur core developers aren't getting paid at all at the moment, but we won't make it to October like that. Also we've moved into a small room in an office block, which has meant our productivity has sky-rocketed but obviously means we now have fixed repeating costs.\nThe community reaction to the game so far has been incredible and we're more committed than ever to giving you all the game that TerraTech deserves to be, but we've still got some big features on the to-do list: like multiplayer for instance. To tackle these properly and to make the core experience super-polished, we need to expand our team a little, so this is what your support will enable us to achieve.\nAnd of course, the more successful our campaign is, the higher we'll be able to push that quality bar and the more cool stuff we'll be able to implement, which brings us on to...\n We've thought long and hard about how to make sure this game becomes a reality. The safe approach is to cut down to the most achievable form we can, but we know there's a lot more you want to see in the game, so we're offering the most popular requests as stretch goals.\nPlease remember: we are a small team! Even if we hit these backing targets, it will still take us a while to deliver the extra features. If we reach these higher levels, you're giving us the security to get on with improving the game, adding new features, and possibly even bringing some of that cool content forward into earlier versions.\n\u00a345K - Creative Mode\nA relaxing 'fairground planet', the Creative World is where intergalactic prospectors go between missions to unwind and practice without danger. Not just an empty area with lots of dispensers, this is a hand crafted theme park environment, filled with all sorts of different attractions. Explore an adventure playground of challenge events and try your hand at building and driving all sorts of wacky contraptions, to compete for the top spot in each challenge's high-score table. Your best attempts will be saved for others to view and compete against.\nAlternatively use the block dispensers and wide open spaces to build and test anything you can imagine! Don't forget to share your creations with the world using the data snapshot function, and browse through the mad contraptions that everyone else has built. If something looks good, you're free to load it into your game and take it for a spin.\nThe Creative World fairground will grow in size too: unlock new challenges by finding them in the main game progression. Or try your hand at the ever changing weekly challenges, set by the Payload team. Challenge winners are rewarded with exclusive name tags, insignias and block skins to show off their skill.\nHappy building!\n\u00a360K - Online Multiplayer\nThis is the #1 most requested feature, but it's a biggy. We're committed to doing it sooner or later, but if we hit this goal then we'll aim to get it in for our Early Access launch later this year, instead of waiting til the full release in 2015.\nBuild, explore and battle with your friends on-line!\n\u00a380K - New Corporation: Reticule Research\nReticule Research is an applied sciences research company, whose main focus is experimental weaponry. The coy RR execs realised that they could cut their R&D costs if they simply offered up their dangerous prototype weapons to off-world mining prospectors.\n\nThe weapons they offer are real 'evil-genius-grade' levels of insanity. These bizarre contraptions give little indication of their actual function and they're just as likely to blow their operator to tiny pieces as they are to actually work. So choose wisely!\nWe've tried to come up with a selection of really cool rewards that will let as many people as possible get involved in the game's development, and even get the chance to be immortalised in the game itself.\nCheck out the grid below for an at-a-glance list of everything that's on offer and let us know if you have any other ideas of things you'd like to see as rewards. We'll do our best to include them later on if it's practical.\nHere's a little more detail of some of the specific reward elements...\nWe know that not everyone's got that much cash to spare but we're really grateful for every pledge we receive, which is why even at the \u00a33 Exclusive Wallpapers tier we'll still give you a backers' credit on our website, as a sign of our appreciation.\n\nOur \u00a310 Early Bird Game Backer tier is a reduced-price shot at getting hold of a copy of the final game, especially for those super-keen uber-fans who get in early to support our campaign. If you're that keen, we figure you deserve a bit of a bargain!\n\nThe \u00a315 Game Backer tier is deliberately priced LOWER than the planned RRP for the final game so this one is still a great deal. And don't forget that you won't have to wait til launch to play it, you'll also get a free Steam key to play the Early Access version later this year.\n\nAt the \u00a325 Beta Backer level you'll get exclusive access to our closed beta and backer forums. You'll get regular builds of the game (at least monthly) and be able to discuss your ideas and share your feedback with us as we go through development.\n\nIf you opt for the \u00a340 Digital Harvester tier then you'll get your hands on a lush PDF companion book that'll be chock-full of concept artwork, early sketches and images detailing the progression, along with articles about development, tips and tricks, item information tables and other gems written by the team. You also get an exclusive white skin for GSO.\nPledgers of the \u00a355 Boxed Game Backer tier and above will have a DRM-free version of the final game delivered to them on a full metal casing, high quality, TerraTech USB key packaged in a Galactic Survey Organisation branded collectors gift box. The PDF companion book, digital copy of the soundtrack and TerraTech wallpapers will also be stored on the USB key.\nMembership to the Mining Crew is for the biggest TerraTech fans so if you think that's you then you might want to check out the \u00a370 Mining Crew Member tier. The Crew is for guys and gals who like to help spread the word about TerraTech by sharing photos and making videos of their mad creations!\n\nIn return we like to pay The Crew back by including their names and scores as defaults on the leaderboards and by giving them priority when we select new tanks to put into the game. We also send new builds out to Mining Crew members a few days early so that they can start preparing their videos of the game and help with feedback and balancing.\n\nThe Mining Crew will also get one of our never-to-be-sold-separately tees like the one below, plus these ace Corporation propaganda art posters to hang on your wall with pride. (Make sure you let us know which size t-shirt you want before we send them out. If we don't hear from you then we'll send you an Adult medium size.)\n\nOur Mining Crew recruits will also get access to an exclusive matchmaking system when we launch multiplayer. You'll get to play alongside the most hardcore TerraTech players and use this filter to prioritise matches with other Mining Crew members, so that you can always roll with The Crew.\nThe \u00a3100 Mining Crew Foreman backers will get their name written into TerraTech lore, in the back-story of a block or challenge mode. Send us a story or anecdote about you and we'll try to include it in some form. Tell us some of your likes and dislikes and we will aim to use some of that too. Be warned that we may refuse a name or some story elements if they could be construed as offensive or profane (Shufflebottom is fine though!) Here's a good example of the kind of thing we mean:\n\n\"Fusion-based gyroscopic stabilisation was pioneered by the eccentric genius Dr. John Doe in the early 2100s, although the process was almost lost when he perished in a freak lettuce-spinning accident while testing his apparatus in the kitchen. Radio-magnetic salad utensils have been banned in the Northern European Republic ever since.\u201d\n\nYou also get an exclusive black skin for GSO.\nIf you reckon you can come up with an awesome new block design then go for the \u00a3300 Corporation Vice President tier. Join us for a design meeting over Skype. You'll discuss your ideas with the team over Skype and work with them to decide upon a new block that'll appear in the finished game.\n\nThis could be a new weapon, a new method of propulsion or something ridiculous just for the heck of it, you make the call. We'll also use your name in the name of the block itself, or mention you in the back-story of it, so you can be all \u201cSee that? I made that!\u201d.\n\nWe'll need to make sure that the new block doesn't break the game in any way and isn't offensive or anything, but as a backer you'll still have a good amount of freedom to create what you want. You'll also get to join us on one of our regular Twitch live-streams to unveil your block for the first time - although you don't have to if that's not your thing!\n\nYou also get an exclusive gold skin for GSO.\nShow everyone who's boss by going for the \u00a31,000 Corporation CEO tier and getting yourself immortalised in the game as one of our Corporation bosses. You'll join the team for a design meeting (in person, if you can get yourself to London, UK) and work with us to get your likes, dislikes, appearance and any anecdotes you share with us into the character. As with the above tiers, we can't have anything too rude or offensive, but beyond that you can go nuts with it!\n\nAs above, you'll have the option of unveiling your creation on one of our live-streams, and if you do manage to get yourself to London then we'll even take you for a drink after the design meeting!\n Take your pick - we really appreciate any and all support.\nThanks to everyone who has helped us out along our journey so far, including:\nOur amazing freelancers: Paul Jennings (graphic design), Tucho Fern\u00e1ndez Calo (3D art), Michal Kus and Vlad Ciuban (concept art), and Lorna Cooper (graphics programming)\nGreg Rice at Double Fine Productions for his wonderful Kickstarter advice.\nJames Wallis of Spaaace for his incredibly valuable Kickstarter advice\nKaya Yuzuki of Luna & Coco Films for helping us shoot our Kickstarter video\nAlex Bowden of Emotion Effect for editing it all together\nJames Dance from Loading Bar, London for allowing us to film at his awesome venue\nPhi Dinh, developer of Tiny Keep, for support and advice\nAll the guys and girls at IndieDB, Twitch, Boneloaf, Bossa Studios (especially Jack Good), Arch Creatives and Radiant Worlds.\nAll the teams behind EGX Rezzed: Leftfield Collection, The Gadget Show Live, MCM Comic Con, and Radius Festival\nThe original TerraTech Mining Crew Recruits!

We've seen everyone from experienced gamers down to children as young as 5 enjoy the game at conventions and other events.\n\nEnglish language only for now: The Closed Beta and the Early Access versions of the game will only have English text, but we'll localise the game into lots of other languages at a later date.\n\nBuilds delivered via Steam: Our Closed Beta and Early Access versions of the game will all be distributed via Steam.

As a player you'll have access to lots of user generated content!  \nYes, there will be other animals in the pet store. What kind? Let's hit this goal and you can find out!\nThe PlayStation 4 version of the game will come out about 6 months after the Steam and OUYA versions, likely in summer 2015. All backers will be able to choose between EITHER the PS4 version or the Steam + OUYA + DRM free download version. Alternatively backers can get all versions by adding an $3 extra to their pledge (the PS4 keys cost us $3 each).\nCatlateral Damage is a first-person destructive cat simulator where you play as a cat on a rampage, knocking as much of your owner's stuff onto the ground as possible. It's a highly original, experimental concept that was born out of a game jam last year. Oh, and it's based on a real-life mischievous cat!\nMy childhood buddy, Nippy, in real life and in-game.\nSee the world from the perspective of a cat! Like other first-person games, you can walk and look around, jump, and crouch. Unlike other first-person games, your primary weapons are your two cat paws, which you can use to swipe at and knock objects onto the floor.\nCatlateral Damage garnered a bit of attention back in January (see the What People Are Saying section below!), and lots of people have asked to play a full game with more feline destruction. In fact, the demo was so popular that it was Greenlit on Steam after only 8 days! So now I'm making the full game, which will come out on Steam (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), OUYA, and as a DRM free download. The anticipated release window is Q4 2014.   \nIntrigued? Go play the demo now, in case you missed the big flashing yellow button surrounded by cat paws up top.\n YouTube Features & Let's Plays\nLet's talk about all the new features and content that will be going into the game thanks to your support! In Catlateral Damage you will be able to:\nChase (or ignore) mice. You can play with or catch them! \nSit in a box, lie in a sunbeam, or both at once \nChase a laser pointer and completely freak out \nHack up a hairball. Why not? \nFind long lost cat toys under the couch and play with them \nExplore/hide underneath the bed \nTrip out on catnip \nStand at a doorway and be indecisive about going in or out \nMeow using state of the art, cutting edge meowing technology \nAct indignant because you are the higher species \nKnock over this TV:\nHere's a more thorough explanation of where the game will be going.\nYour goal is to reach the fancy mansion down the street and destroy the super secret, super valuable object hidden within its locked safe. You start in your home apartment, traversing and trashing various houses on the street until your reach the mansion. In each house, you start in a locked room and make messes in rooms to unlock adjacent ones. Once all rooms are sufficiently sloppy, you nap in a box (yes, really) before moving on to the next house. Each residence is larger and contains more valuable possessions than the last. You may even encounter special locations on your journey...\nProcedurally-generated gameplay: Every time you play the game will be different as all houses, rooms, and challenges are procedurally generated. As you play the game more you'll unlock different cats, with different special abilities.\nMore cats and special abilities: As you progress through the game you'll have to make choices about which cat to use for which level, because cats have different special abilities! Some cats jump higher than others, while other cats are stronger and can knock over heavier objects. Some cats prefer to destroy plants, while others hate electronics.\nCollectibles and power ups: What cat doesn't like to collect things? Hunt around for secret objects (or maybe just cat toys you have previously lost?) which can help unlock new abilities. And power-ups enhance your cat's abilities, like catnip which temporarily makes you a super-powered furball of terror!\nTons of polish: I'll focus on getting the controls as perfect as possible, so that moving around really feels like you\u2019re a cat. I'll also spend lots of time focusing on the user interface and experience so the game feels as great as possible. It sounds boring but you'll appreciate it! I'll also add in achievements, leaderboards, and Steam trading cards. \nLots more content: Tons of new objects to topple! A glorious soundtrack, fun sound effects, and more! This messy room is a merely a prelude to the destruction you'll cause as a cat.\nTL;DR \u2013 There's gonna be a TON of new stuff, and I'm going to make this feel like you're a cat as much as possible.\nA sincere thank you and access to backer updates and newsletter. I may occasionally send you a cute pictures of cats. Not too frequently though.\nTHIS IS NOT A TIER! It's an add-on - if you increase your pledge for any of the below tiers by $10 then you'll get an extra copy of the game! You can get as many extra copies as you'd like, just increase by the appropriate amount. If you back the HIPSTER CAT tier or higher then the extra copies will also be early access! ADD-ON COPY does not work with the KITTEN tier, nice try!\nA DRM-free digital copy of the game for PC, Mac, or Linux (and/or Steam key and/or OUYA key) when it releases later this year and full game soundtrack.\nA DRM free copy of the game PC, Mac, or Linux (and Steam key and/or OUYA key), full game soundtrack, and you get your name in the game credits! I'll also send you a special backer-only digital book (PDF) with special cat pictures and developer commentary. It will be awesome.\nYou get special early access to the game before it comes out! Play the game early, give feedback, and tell your friends how great it is before it goes mainstream. Note that early access will be for PC, Mac, and Linux and only available with Steam keys. Includes the BACKER CAT tier.\nThe HIPSTER CAT tier plus games from friends of ours! Includes Steam keys for Goat Simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, The Stanley Parable, Go Home Dinosaurs, and Slam Bolt Scrappers.\nTHIS IS NOT A TIER! It's an add-on - if you increase your pledge for any of the below tiers by $50 then you get to put another cat photo into the game! You can add as many cats as you'd like, just increase by the appropriate amount. All of your photos will be displayed together in-game as a set.\nMake your cat famous! Send us a photo of your cat and it will appear as a framed poster or picture in-game. Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier.\nMake your dog famous! This is just like the LOLCAT tier, except just for dogs. Because this is a game about cats you have to pay an extra dollar for this, and I expect you to submit an unflattering, silly picture of your dog. Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier. \nThe best of both worlds! Get your cat (or dog) in a framed poster or picture in-game, plus we'll send you Steam keys of our friends' games (Goat Simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, The Stanley Parable, Go Home Dinosaurs, and Slam Bolt Scrappers). Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier, and an extra second copy of Catlateral Damage for a friend!\nA game for you and one for your cat! Your cat can't play the video game, but he or she will LOVE this sweet Catlateral Damage laser pointer. You also get a snazzy Catlateral Damage t-shirt (we haven't figured out the design yet, but trust me, it'll be snazzy) plus the GAMER LOLCAT tier for you. Add $15 shipping for non-US addresses.\nPlay as YOUR cat in the game! Your cat will be famous, and appear as a playable character, complete with name and fur color. Includes LONG CAT tier. This was originally $400 but it sold out, so I've put up a second round of 10 slots. Once this is gone that's it, I can't add a third round!\nBUSINESS CAT tier, and you get listed as a \"Fat Cat Producer\" in the credits, which includes a picture of you and/or your cat as opposed to just your name. You also get to have lunch with me and the folks at Fire Hose Games to give feedback on the game, talk about cats, or discuss quantum mechanics - whatever floats your boat. You have to provide your own travel arrangements, or you can Skype in. You'll also get 5 extra copies of the game for your best friends.\nDo you love cats? Are you not messing around? Then this is the tier for you! Eitan (Fire Hose Founder, helping me with this game) will adopt a cat for each person that pledges this tier! There is no limit! Troll him and make him adopt 20 cats, he'll have to do it! Eitan will periodically send you pictures of the cat, and you are invited to come and hang out with him or her when you are in Boston. Includes FAT CAT tier, with a total of 10 copies of the game to share with your best friends.\nI started creating Catlateral Damage last year. I had a full-time job working as a video game tester, and would spend nights and weekends on this game, pursuing my dream to become an indie game developer. In March of 2014 I lost my job, which allowed me to start working full-time on the game but also came with the burden of not having an income. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, I'll be able to continue putting all my effort into creating the game and releasing a great, polished experience for you to play!\nI've been developing video games for about 8 years now and I've been a gamer for the majority of my life. I was also partially raised by cats, so I have extensive experience with feline behavior. Catlateral Damage is truly something I was meant to create.\nIf you want to learn more about me, check out this interview on Gamasutra. You can also check out my website for some other projects I've worked on. Feel free to follow me on Twitter, too!\nI\u2019m not working on the game alone, either! I've been given the opportunity to work alongside Fire Hose Games as part of their indie accelerator program. They will be providing marketing, additional development, and other resources on top of the work I'll be doing on the game. They\u2019re the guys who made Slam Bolt Scrappers and Go Home Dinosaurs. They\u2019re also big time cat lovers so it was a natural fit. Eitan (the founder) has spent way too much time at my place playing with my cats.\nWhen they aren't sleeping or wrestling with each other, Wil & Lyn help out with the research and marketing aspects of the game's development. Wil is a 1-year-old orange tabby and Lyn is a 4-1/2-month-old polydactyl manx.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is actually very low risk! The main challenge with creating this game so far has been working as a solo developer. However working with Fire Hose Games has given me the extra support that I need to make this happen so I\u2019m not alone in a bubble.\n\nAnother risk with this game is underestimating how long it may take to add certain features and content to the game. Features may be delayed due to bugs or unplanned content might need to be created. Luckily the game isn't especially complicated (no online multiplayer). We've planned for some amount of bug fixing and unexpected problems in the schedule so we\u2019re not too concerned.\n\nIf anything were to happen to me due to an Act of God or other such event, I believe the game is in the dependable hands of Wil & Lyn, the fully-capable feline game developers featured in the video. If for any reason they are unable to continue the project, I'm sure the team at Fire Hose Games can handle it!\n\nFinally, we're participating in the OUYA double our funds program, which will reduce our risk even further and help us to get the game on console. Here are the details.\n\nDouble Our Fun(ds)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA console exclusive for a period of time.

When the series got put on hold last year, the show ended abruptly before the final five episodes of the second season, leaving a lot of loose ends. If our goal is reached, we'll be able to devote all our work time again to finishing these final five episodes, including the super long final episode. Not only that, but we'll be able to pay for really great music and help! If funded, the episodes will begin airing in September!

Since then, we've been professionals in the animation industry for over 6 years now, working for both studios and freelance. Our clientele is peppered with many animation powerhouses, but by far our favorite thing we've ever worked on is our pet project, Baman Piderman. \n\nOne of the challenges in creating fully animated content for the web is time, finding funding, and manpower hours. When we left our job to work on the show full time with internet animation hub Mondomedia, somehow we were managing to churn out 5 minute episodes of the series every two weeks with only two people working. At 15 hand drawn frames per second, you can get an idea of how much sleep we were getting. We're fast, dedicated to quality, and we love our medium with all our hearts. Being able to work on the show with a modest budget to hire people for the things we're not the best at (like music, and merch!) is like a dream, and we're so excited to have much more time to make the send off episodes of the show the as awesome as they can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 205, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523165009/baman-piderman-make-da-show", "project_name": "BAMAN PIDERMAN: MAKE DA SHOW!"}}, {"backer": "Brian S.", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Click here to back SUPERHOT with PayPal!\nThe campaign is over - huge thanks to all our backers! For more updates remember to visit our website, follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook!\nIt all began in August 2013 during the 7 Day First Person Shooter game challenge, where we decided to make something that really stood out in the genre. Our concept was a title that felt dynamic and satisfying, while not requiring superhuman reflexes. Something like a game of real-time chess, except that all the pawns are out there to murder you. We released a public demo...\nYou can also check out the video reactions to our prototype: [Markiplier] [OfficialNerd\u00b3] [CupQuake] [JackSepticEye] [FavijTV] [JackFrags]\n... and then - the Internet went crazy. We have been featured on Kotaku, The Verge, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and WIRED among many others. SUPERHOT made it to the front page of Reddit (twice) and went through Steam Greenlight during a single weekend. Thanks to the amazingly positive responses we've decided that we want to develop SUPERHOT into a full blown game!\nSUPERHOT is a unique, stylized FPS game where the time moves only when you move. With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.\nYou're not hiding behind cover - you're dodging bullets flying past you like in The Matrix. You're not waiting to reload a gun - you're picking the next firearm from the hands of your fallen foes. You're not waiting until your wounds heal - in SUPERHOT a single bullet means death. However, there are no reload screens - you're instantly back in the middle of the action. \nSUPERHOT wouldn't have made it this far if not for the support of gamers, the press, and fellow developers. Since the original prototype we've basically rewritten the game from the ground-up to make it more expandable, dynamic and resulting in a much smoother experience. \nDuring these eight months we've fixed a lot of the problems with the original version of the game, heavily reiterated on the art style, and experimented with fun scenarios for the players to \"solve\" - shootout in a subway train, showdown on the top of a skyscraper in rain, jumping into a moving elevator, and more.\nWe've still got a lot of work (new mechanics, more levels, better animation, rigorous testing and optimization) ahead of us, but the core of SUPERHOT is in place and it's unlike anything you've seen before.\nTurning to Kickstarter ensures that we have access to a constant stream of feedback and ideas, while maintaining control over the development. We have the skills and experience needed to complete the game and we've been working on SUPERHOT non-stop for the past eight months, but we need your help to make it even better!\nThe initial goal of $100k will allow us to cover the costs of living for the team, purchase required hardware, software licences and assets that will allow us to finish the game faster, and to hire additional help - graphic artists, animators, level designers and sound technicians - that will assist us in making SUPERHOT a complete game. All funds over $100k will go directly into making the game better and covering the costs of promoting the game on various gaming events around the world.\nStory driven single-player campaign. SUPERHOT is more than just a shooter with a gimmick. We want to deliver a solid, interesting campaign built around a carefully constructed, not overly in-your-face story.\nImproved visuals. We are keeping the original game's minimalistic artstyle while making everything look a lot better. SUPERHOT is all about style.\nInfinite mode. A lot of people have asked us for an endless, arena-style mode that will allow them to play SUPERHOT for as long as they want. Master the game's mechanics and get ready for the ultimate time-bending challenges.\nMore weapons - shotguns, machineguns, grenades that change the way you play around with the time-bending mechanics.\nMore enemy types - thanks to improved AI the foes will use tactics and be able to work together to hunt you down.\nMore levels - imagine fighting in the middle of a motorway during rush hour, or close combat in an elevator - and other amazing, movie-like scenarios.\nSlow-motion explosions!\nOculus Rift support. Dodge bullets flying right in front of your face and lean behind corners for increased immersion!\nAnd a lot of other surprises!\n Piotr is a seasoned team leader with a portfolio that pushes the experimental boundaries of puzzle games in titles such as Rektagon and Tetravalanche.  \nJakub is an experienced programmer with a portfolio of games released for various platforms, including PC, PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS. \nLuke previously worked at Wastelands Interactive (Worlds of Magic, 1946). When has free time he tends to participate in (or organize) various game jams and visit gaming events.\nMarek is an electrical and software engineer with a track record of crazy projects like an iPad-integrated cat feeder, smoke emitting helmet or a baloon-controlled Flappy Bird game.  \nTomasz is a co-founder of our partner company Blue Brick who worked with and managed international teams developing big R&D projects - from mobile and automotive to telecom.\nMarcin is a visionary graphics artist with a flair for experimental video game design and theatrics. Illustrates comic books when no one's looking.\nPiotr has ten years of artistic experience in video games and animation, he creates awesome things in 3D and walks his dog in time left to spare.\nHuge thanks to Julie Heyde (Bandello) for a lot of different things; to Karl Flodin (Twitter / Soundcloud) and AdhesiveWombat (Twitter / Soundcloud) for making awesome music for our video; to everybody that assisted us while creating this campaign; and finally, to the awesome Unity Engine team for helping us out in many ways :)\nFor $14 you receive a key for downloading SUPERHOT once it's released on Steam, access to our secret, backer-only forum where you can keep in touch with the developers, and immediate download of our digital pack of goodies (includes the downloadable, standalone version of the original SUPERHOT prototype and a pack of wallpapers and ringtones).\nAccess to the forums will be sent out in a survey after the campaign is finished. Click here for the digital pack of goodies.\nBy pledging $25 and more you get a digital artbook and a digital download of the game's official soundtrack in FLAC quality. You will also receive all previous rewards.\nThis tier will get you exclusive, Kickstarter-only beta access to SUPERHOT at least two months before it gets released anywhere else. We're currently planning to release beta access in 6-12 months, depending on our progress. Also includes all previous rewards.\nBacking at least $55 will get you a set of awesome SUPERHOT stickers and badges, along with all previous rewards. Add $5 for international shipping.\nAt this level you'll receive one limited edition SUPERHOT T-Shirt (male and female tees available; pick one design from the two below), along with all previous rewards. Add $10 for international shipping.\nThese t-shirts were designed by the wonderful Emma Tolley (etall on Tumblr) and Marcin Surma (xulm on Tumblr)! Be sure to check out their other works, they're really good :D\nBy backing this tier you'll get a set of amazing, high quality SUPERHOT posters (we'll be talking more about these in one of the updates) along with all previous rewards. Add $15 for international shipping.\nPledging at least $200 will allow you to play the latest versions of SUPERHOT before anyone else - you'll have firsthand access to (potentially unstable) alpha versions of the game, and your feedback will shape the game. We're currently planning to release the first alpha version before the end of the year. Also includes all previous rewards. Add $15 for international shipping.\nThis limited tier will get you a signed, boxed and DRM-free copy of the game once it's finished; and your name will be prominently featured in the game. You also get all previous rewards. Add $20 for international shipping.\nBy backing this level you'll get a chance to work with us on designing an in-game achievement for the game itself. Think of an amazing challenge for the players and give it a fun name like \"Mike's Trickshot\" (your design will be subject to review). You also receive all previous rewards.\nThis tier allows you to help us design one stage for the endless arena mode that will be included in the final game. We will be open to your design, and you will get to name the stage (although both are subject to review, so it's fun to play). You also get all previous rewards.\nOnly for the biggest fans of the game. You'll receive a unique, hand-crafted by us, electronic device that (while not allowing you to stop time when standing still) might be a mystery tied into the game's plot. Additionally, you will get to co-design either a stage for the endless arena mode, or an in-game achievement. You also receive all previous rewards.\nIf you have any additional questions feel free to let us know - contact@superhotgame.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuality takes time and we want to deliver an exceptional game. We will have an iterative development process - make a small chunk of the game, test it extensively, make changes, test it again, etc. This process can require a longer development time, but the rise in quality is worth the effort.\n\nProject management is vital to teamwork, and we have considerable expertise in this field. We previously developed a range of software products - from complex statistics solutions for education to mobile applications. We are accustomed to working with a fixed budget and schedule, and this experience will be invaluable when working on SUPERHOT.\n\nThe costs of living in Poland are relatively low, so meeting our goal should give us enough money to complete the game without the need for additional financial support. Our primary goal is to deliver a great, unforgettable game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "SUPERHOT is 5 years old!", "update_content": " \n          "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "SUPERHOT the Card Game Kickstarting today!", "update_content": "Lose track of what\u2019s real.

Read on, dear music lover...\nspec. artwork for the album\nThis is something strange and (hopefully) beautiful.\nThe Process\nHi! I'm Bing. I'm a film maker and presenter by day, but I find myself making music late into the night. It's addictive, as such a big music lover, to be in control of my own soundscape.\nTypically, a track will start with some synthetic instruments- beats or bass- in my program of choice, Logic Pro. Sometimes I'll move into Ableton. From the skeleton, I start feeling my way until something fits, replacing with real instruments where it suits, and throwing stuff out, mostly by trial and error until a 'eureka' moment (see video). It takes a long time, but it is so utterly satisfying...\nWith this album I will begin in much the same way, but when I start looking for sounds to fill the void, I'll get in touch with one of my friends. Some tracks will be written together in person, others from a distance over the internet. All of them will be slightly different. Then the challenge is making it all feel like one, self-contained, finished album.\nWhy do a Kickstarter?\nIt's a wonderful feeling to get paid for your art. It's a more wonderful feeling to be able to pay other artists. All of the proceeds from this campaign, and all future sales, will be split properly between everyone involved.\nI chose Kickstarter because if I can hit my goal the album gets made faster.\nThese advance orders will allow me to take time off from other work. Furthermore, I'll be able to buy or rent important pieces of equipment and schedule time at practice rooms or recording studios.\nThe funds from this campaign will also guarantee that we press real physical CDs. Without pre-orders, I might only be able to release digitally.\nYou'll notice that there are no huge perks, or gimmicks. This is a pre-order. I'm not asking for large donations, just to buy a product I know is going to be amazing.\nGrab new soundtrack material for your YouTube videos!\nA Lifetime License for Young Film Makers\nFor the YouTubers and indie film makers in the room, I've included an option that comes with a written license for every track on the album. It will also include instrumental and stripped-down versions. Along with the digital download and CD you will receive a PDF document which serves as a lifetime license to use the material.\nYou will have written permission to use our music in any video uploaded online (even if it's monetized via ads).

We will be taking Hamlet to audiences not just in Europe and America but also Somaliland, Guinea Bissau, the Central African Republic, Ukraine, Kosovo, North Korea, Afghanistan, Liberia, Mauritania and South Sudan to name just a few of the world\u2019s poorest and most troubled places. \nSixteen extraordinary men and women from the Globe in London will perform a fresh and pared down version of Shakespeare\u2019s classic tragedy wherever we can pitch our stage; on beaches, in theatres, palaces, village squares, Mayan ruins, even on the Maidan in Kiev, site of the recent protests in Ukraine.\nOur company will be performing on the Maidan, Kiev. (c) Helena Miscioscia\nOUR CAMPAIGN IS IN ITS FINAL DAYS! PLEASE BACK US NOW\n\u201cIn 1608, only eight years after it was written, Hamlet was performed on a boat \u2013 the Red Dragon \u2013 off the coast of Yemen. Just ten years later it was being toured extensively all over Northern Europe. The spirit of touring, and of communicating stories to fresh ears, was always central to Shakespeare\u2019s work. We couldn\u2019t be happier to be extending that mission even further. By train, coach, plane and boat we aim to take this wonderful, iconic, multifarious play to as many fresh ears as we possibly can.\u201d Dominic Dromgoole, Artistic Director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe\nWhy on earth do we want to undertake this huge and complex project?\nAccess to the arts is part of Shakespeare's Globe's DNA - from the day we opened our doors in 1997, 700 audience members per performance have been able to pay just \u00a35. It is our belief that no matter what your financial circumstances art should be accessible. This is as true at the Globe itself, as it should be everywhere in the world..\nAlong the way we\u2019ll be honouring the many friendships built with the 37 international theatre companies who performed Shakespeare in their own languages at the Globe as part of the 2012 London Olympic Festival. For example, we\u2019ll be visiting our friends the South Sudan Theatre Company, whose country, the newest democracy in the world is now on the brink of a civil war. In 2012 SSTC travelled to London to present Cymbeline in Juba Arabic \u2013 South Sudan\u2019s first production of a Shakespeare play. Safety and security remains a major concern, the financial and political hurdles are many and high, but we remain hopeful of being able to perform in the courtyard of Juba University to the young and old of South Sudan in January 2016.\nPlease help to keep our promise to the South Sudan Theatre Company and others like them by backing us NOW\nWhy Kickstarter?\nYes, we\u2019re very well known and an established theatre company but the Shakespeare's Globe is a not-for-profit organisation. We are a charity which remains entirely dependent on donations, gifts, and sponsorship on top of ticket sales to provide not just high quality performances but a huge education programme to schools and a centre of academic research for scholars of Shakespeare. You may be surprised to learn that the Globe doesn't receive regular Government funding in the UK.\nWe are working hard to raise funds for Globe to Globe Hamlet from every kind of source in the UK and internationally - from the venues and festivals that we\u2019re visiting in wealthier countries; from local government agencies, charities and philanthropic donors, and we\u2019re very grateful for their pledges\u2026 but we still need to raise the final \u00a3200,000 and we\u2019re turning to you, the international community of Kickstarter.\nFunds raised from our Kickstarter pitch will support the costs of giving performances in the poorest and most unstable countries in the world where there is little basic infrastructure for the people let alone any provision for the arts.\nAre we really going to travel to every country in the world? Even where there are wars?\nYes, we are going to every country in the world. But we\u2019ll only get there with your help!

Thank you for helping me make this a reality!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt will soon be summer in Japan, and the timing is just right...\nWHAT I PROPOSE\nThis is a project to see the modern world differently, to catch sight of the age that makes our societies. I feel that the evolution of our cityscapes is often out of sync with the people and heritages that inhabit them, and that the resulting anachronisms can be beautiful. I hope to interpret these scenes and transport the viewer to places strangely displaced in time.\nIf funded, my project will send me to Japan this July to combine original photography with environmental audio recordings. I will concentrate on the emotive nature of each photo instead of clearly defined subjects, and therefore may incorporate elements of abstraction like dim lighting, soft focus, and loose context. The goal is to reproduce the dreamy atmosphere felt when you find yourself standing with one foot in two different times. \nSome of the photography will be done with an old film camera, a Minolta SR-7 I bought used from a back-room shop during my last trip to Japan. Combined with the right black and white film, this camera produces strong shadows and blown out highlights that speak perfectly for the subject matter I am seeking. I captured several of these example photographs with this camera only a few years ago.\nI want to bring this camera back to Japan and continue my exploration of the subtle time slips hiding around the edges of our lives. And importantly, I want to present what I find to my audience and have them make the same discoveries for themselves.\nWHAT I WANT TO MAKE\nThe project will culminate with two completed works: an on-line gallery of sorts and a photo book. The web gallery will be free of distraction, just a seamless collection of well-designed pages, each with a single large photograph and accompanying soundtrack. Armed with a high fidelity 24bit/96 kHz Linear PCM Recorder, I will preserve approximately 30 minutes of the aural environment surrounding the location of each photoshoot, and in some cases, several hours. This will then be played back in a loop on the webpage with the accompanying photo so that the viewer can imagine standing within the scene while hearing the ambient noises flow around them.\nThe book will be an arrangement of photographs seemingly made in different time periods, mostly old but some futuristic. Please understand that I am not looking to emulate old daguerreotypes of post-war Japan or snap shots of banks of neon advertisements. I want to illustrate the evanescent happenstances that occur when people and things find themselves in harmony with each other but out of sync with the whole.\n WHAT YOU MEAN TO ME\nYou are looking at this project's life spark. Whether or not we start a blaze is up to you! Truly, without your patronage, this project will always be a \"what if?\" Please help me to share these scenes that constantly leave me entranced. Funding will allow me to spend a month in Japan to build on this idea and produce the images I have described above. While on this journey, I will happily explain to you, my patrons, my detailed progress and findings through a purposely built blog.\n The $8,500 goal in place is what's needed to cover basic travel costs, lots of film and developing, minimal living expenses during the photoshoot, and reward fulfillment.

James, aka The Aphex Twin, under his \"Caustic Window\" moniker on his own label, Rephlex Records.\nThis album unfortunately never saw the light of day until around 1999, when Mike Paradinas (aka \u00b5-Ziq) granted a rare interview with the Aphex Twin fansite, joyrex.com (no longer active). In the interview, Mike described the tracks in detail, and went on to explain that only 4 people at the time were known to have a vinyl test pressing of the album - Richard James, Chris Jeffs (aka Cylob), Grant Wilson-Claridge (co-founder of Rephlex Records) and Mike himself. Each person was sworn to never make copies of the music, and for 20 years, not a single track had ever been commercially released (with the exception of two tracks that appeared on compilations).\nUntil now.\nFast forward to 2014, when a mysterious seller listed the album on the music website Discogs for sale at a high asking price. We Are The Music Makers, aka WATMM.com, which succeeded joyrex.com as the web's premiere source for electronic music, discussed the possibility of this \"holy grail\" of electronic music releases finally seeing the light of day, albeit from unfortunately leaking online once a buyer had obtained it.\nJokingly, the suggestion that the WATMM community band together and \"crowdfund\" purchasing the album was made, and I began to ponder the possibility - could we band together and purchase the legendary non-release?\nOf course, the main issue with doing such a thing is distribution - individuals (even lots of individuals) don't have the right to copy and distribute music they don't have the rights to - then, an idea came to me - why not raise the funds for the record, buy it, then strike a deal with the record label to purchase the rights for everyone who chipped in a digital copy of the tracks?\nA few emails later, and such a deal had been struck - the label and Richard James himself agreed to offer one-time distribution rights so the people contributing to this Kickstarter would have a once-in-a-lifetime to own tracks from arguably one of the rarest electronic music (non) releases of all time (and some damn fine music too).\nSo, with official blessings from Richard James and Rephlex Records, if you contribute 16.00 USD (little under 10.00 GBP or around 11.20 EUR) and become one of the only people legally allowed to own a digital copy of the famed Caustic Window LP ripped straight from the vinyl in a lossless audio format that we will as a community vote and decide on. It's a superb way to support the artist by legally purchasing something you will never get to purchase otherwise - Rephlex has no plans and will not press this record commercially.\nBe a part of this unique opportunity and show your hardcore fan support for Richard's music and own some awesome electronic music!\nFor complete details about the record and it's tracks, see the FAQ which will be updated in the next few days, or head on over to WATMM.com and join the community to learn more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe seller has agreed to delist the record from Discogs until the Kickstarter is either funded or fails to reach it's goal within the alloted time, so we're confident this aspect of the project will come off without any issues.\n\nThe record will be shipped within the UK directly to someone who will use high-quality equipment to rip the vinyl and produce the most pristine quality digital audio tracks in a lossless format.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Quantities Dwindling!

Just take a look at this chart:\nNotice something? Sure these games are popular and you might even call them \"fun\" but they harbor a horrible bias in today\u2019s gaming world. Most are blind to it but it's all right there, that's right, none of these games has you playing as a bear.\nIt's quite clear the fat cats in Washington with their stove top hats and contemporary jazz music don't want us playing as bears, it's about time to fight back against the tyranny.\nThe title gives you all you need to know as it's pretty much a bear simulator. You play in FPB (First Person Bear) and do bear things which include exploring, eating fish and plants, striking down anything that dare stand before your might, increasing your stats, sleeping and discovering mysteries of your forest home. Watch the alpha trailer above or right here on youtube to give you an idea.\nTL;DR - It's like a mini Skyrim but you're a bear\nThe estimated release date is November(ish) 2014.\nKeep up with Bear Simulator news and updates on the official Twitter and Facebook pages:\nTwitter.com/BearSimulator\nFacebook.com/BearSimulatorGame\nTrailers and other videos will be uploaded here:\nYoutube.com/FarjayStudios\nYou can discuss things on the subreddit:\nreddit.com/r/BearSimulator\nIf you want to contact me (the person making this bear game) here's my twitter. I'll be using this a lot during production:\ntwitter.com/JohnFarjay\nAll questions here:\nbritnie@farjay.com\n Stretch goals are tricky because I can't add a whole lot of things or else it would put things behind schedule. So a lot of the goals are stupid/fun/freelance and popular requests will be added after the games release.\nA few games in the past got it right and have been rewarded with universal praise, notably Banjo-Kazooie and EnviroBear, but there hasn't been many solid, somewhat realistic bear simulation games (if at all). That's where this comes in.\nSure it may seem like a \u201cdumb idea\u201d or a \u201creally dumb idea\u201d but you can't honestly tell me you've never secretly wanted to be a bear wandering around the forest. That's just an outright lie.\nScreenshots and Game Footage are from an early version of the game. Take extreme note of this.\n Larger screens here.\nSome of the key features you should expect in this finished bear game:\nFantastic first person camera, motor and control.\nThe first person view and bear control will play an extraordinary part in the game as it adds a huge amount of character. This is a number one priority and will be worked on until it's perfect. You'll be mostly crawling around in the fully featured game, standing to examine things and waddle about.\nMelee fighting system.\nAnother important feature which ties into the previous feature but deserves it's own bullet point.\nLarge multi-environment world with lots to see and discover.\nWhile it will be a realistic setting, the game won't be based on any specific real world place.\nA variety of different living things that will populate the land and beyond.\nOne of the main points of Bear Simulator is to be an exploration game (and being a bear) so it wouldn't make sense if there was nothing to search for.\nA catastrophic amount of secrets.\nThe game will be like 30% secret areas and stuff.\nEvents\nEvents will be explained later with a flashy trailer or something since summarizing them in a bullet point lacks that dramatic punch.\nMountain goats(!)\nAn extremely important feature.\nLots more!\n\"Lots more!\" includes: Unlockable bear abilities, animal friends, ways to customize your bear and possible Oculus Rift support.\nPOSSIBLE FEATURE:\nMultiplayer\nEven though I have a few awesome ideas for some multiplayer modes, most of the development time and funding will go towards crafting a glorious single player experience. So count multiplayer as being a possible feature that may or may not be added. Also this has nothing to do with me being unable to get multiplayer to friggen work correctly \u10da(\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0\u10da)\nBear Simulator is the first project meant to 'kickstart' a new game studio: Farjay Studios. Sure it's just one person so it's kind of odd to call it a studio but I don't know what else to call it. Anywho, this game was chosen since I already have a solid design for it and it's pretty simple at it's core. Plus it will be crazy fun to promote, you have no idea.\nHere's the production blog which will eventually be filled with updates on the game's progress.\nBearSimulator.com\nI'm being lazy with web stuff so the official site for Bear Simulator is a bit lackluster at the moment. I'm not really really a web designer which is a good excuse for the laziness. If the game does get funded some of the funds will go towards making it more fancy and forest-y.\nAlright, this sounds a little strange but I'm 80% sure it will turn out fantastic. Since I'm using Kickstarter and needed some interesting, lower tier pledge rewards, why not feature a region dedicated to these things? Boom, right here, Kickstarter Island.\nAvailable for all to explore and existing outside the realm of the somewhat realistic Bear Simulator world, the island will be similar to an amusement park allowing for the creative freedom to host plenty of nonsensical things. This means a bunch of backer submitted stuff can be incorporated in a way that won't break the immersion. Check the reward section for some info on what to expect.\nThis reward has been updated with an in-game credit.\nSome of the rewards might be a little confusing so you can ask a question in the comment section or through email.\nEmail: Britnie@Farjay.com\nAlso no advertisements for submissions, because that would be lame.\nFirst of all, Bear Simulator is mostly done on a base level meaning that much of the tedious and time consuming parts are complete but a lot of the game is fairly rough and using placeholder art, sound and models.\nWhat remains are the fun parts like buying the needed pieces to replace the placeholder stuff so it looks nice, hence this Kickstarter campaign.\nHere's a rundown of how the funding would be spent for a good bear game. Some of it involves commissions and freelance so there's a tiny bit of guesstimating going on here.\nModels/Textures: 7,000$\nBecause I can't model organic things AT ALL, a good fraction of the funding will go towards environmental and creature models/textures. See my spherical bee hive for reference of said modeling skills:\nMost of the models and textures needed are readily available on sites like TurboSquid and the Asset Store. Others will be commissioned and several of them can be modified and reused to save on cost and give a sense of variety.\nHardware: 2,500$\nAn updated Mac for OSX testing and some other hardware like additional storage, software and maybe an Oculus Rift.\nLicensing and Various Fees 4,500$\nEngine licensing, premium site templates, Amazon and Kickstarter fees.\nSound: 2,500$\nYou don't want cheap, artificial sound in your bear game, if you want quality sound effects you gotta lay down the cold hard cash.\nArt/Graphic Design: 3,500$\nIllustrations, better menu and hud design, premium stock photos, etc.\nAdditional Programming: 3,500$\nAdvanced scripts from freelancers, mainly camera control and movement and a more intuitive menu and loading system.\nRewards: ~5,000$\nProducing all the physical items and shipping.

In the fully featured game you'll spend most of your time crawling around and leaping about like an actual bear.\nThe constant \u201cbipedal/two-leg mode\u201d was used for a few reasons, for one it makes it easy to test things, second, it gives a good idea on how your bear would interact with stuff and lastly, I didn't want to animate and program everything with a placeholder bear model.\nYour environment is divided up into large \u201cRegions\u201d. Each region is a different theme and contain different \u201cAreas\u201d. The harder to reach places tend to be dangerous but contain the rarest food and creatures... Not the mention the occasional \u201cMysterious Being\u201d:\n\"Mysterious Beings\" are basically powerful, fictional creatures.\nThese are the planned regions, they don't have names yet:\nMain Forest\nThis is the \u201cHub\u201d region. There aren't many aggressive enemies here and only the basic foods. It's also where your den is located.\nMountains\nA snowy, rocky region. There are definitely going to be mountain goats here, EVEN IF IT COSTS ALL THE FUNDING.\nOcean Coast\nThe ocean coast. The huge body of water probably bewilders most bears. Err, forest bears, not polar.\nSpooky Woods\nThe way this region is planned easily earns the name Spooky Woods, in fact it's probably going to stay named Spooky Woods.\nUndergrounds\nA system of connected caves without much to eat. It also contains an ancient evil.\nFields\nA flat, wide open land.\nKickstarter Island\nRead about it above. ^\nWelp, that's all of them. Definitely not keeping any more regions secret.\nPlenty of animals other than bears will populate your world which come in all sorts of different flavors depending on where you are.\nSome animals will only appear under certain conditions.\nA scientist can correct me but I'm fairly sure real bears have a mental menu where they track their stats. Here's a few of them which might change so they aren't final:\nStrength\nHigh strength means more powerful swipes and the ability to get through any area blocking barricades.\nVitality\nPretentious word for Health Points.\nForaging\nIncreases your chance of successfully picking some berries, stealing honey, etc. Because as we all know, plucking grapes from a vine takes some serious skill in the bear world.\nIntelligence\nDisplays important info for what you're about to eat before diving right in.\nSwim\nHow long/fast you can swim before getting bear cramps and drowning.\nJump/Leap\nAllows you to dunk other bears that talk smack bout you on the court. (How high you can jump)\nLuck\nI have absolutely no idea what this stat will do. WHY DID I EVEN ADD IT.\nWhile fumbling about on your crazy bear adventure you may come upon curious things that stand out from the generic tree or frog.

This was due to the amount of feedback we got from supporters who were already passed the beginner stage. I've gone in to this in a little more detail on the update so go take a look!\nUpdate #2: We've reached our funding goal! Thank you to all our supporters and backers who will make this project possible, let's make an amazing language learning RPG! To learn more about the PS Vita/PS4/Wii U/Xbox One version, as well as the Akihabara zone and content we have plans for, go take a look at the update!\nKoe\uff08\u58f0\uff09pronounced \u201cko-eh\u201d is a role-playing game in the style of traditional JRPGs such as Dragon Quest, Pokemon and Final Fantasy and is influenced heavily by them. Koe will be released for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux with plans for it to be released on Playstation Vita. The special edition of Koe will only ever be available through this Kickstarter campaign!\nEssentially, what I want to do in the game is give you an introduction to the Japanese language within the game itself. I know people who are interested in this style of gaming, as well as Anime and Manga, and who have wanted to learn Japanese because of it, but have no idea where they should start. So why not a fully-fledged story-driven JRPG that gives you a nice start with the language itself?\nBefore I lose you with the education side of things, I want to tell you that the game itself is a game before anything else, not a flash-card application nor a voice recognition translator, but rather I have put the game, and therefore the gameplay, before anything else. This means it plays like a JRPG, there are random battles, bosses, a story, pets, wizards, cities, houses as well as cats and you will play through collecting items, experience points, weapons and everything else that comes with a traditional JRPG.\nWhat people are saying about Koe\n\"Those of us who enjoy RPGs but don't speak Japanese have missed out on some solid games due to the impenetrable language barrier, and this seems like a fun way to learn at least the basics of Glorious Nipponese.\" - Jason Schreier, Kotaku\n\"What is truly brilliant about this mechanic is that the player is constantly repeating exposure to the appearance and the meaning of the cards used in combat\" - Gaijin Goomba\n\"As someone who initially struggled learning Japanese with little more than a notebook and Hiragana Mnemonics, I am jealous of gamers who can begin their long quest with Koe.\" - Sam Worboys, The Otaku's Study\n\"Not only does Koe teach players a new language, but also enables them to enter into a whole world of JRPGs that have never been translated into English.\" - Springwise\nAlso featured in Wired (UK), Wired (Japan)[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], BitPulse, TheVitaLounge, BPA Japan[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Japanator, psfk, NewSphere[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Japan Daily Press, Hardcore Gamer, Technology Tell, Inside[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Gigazine[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e], Rocket News 24, \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u6e09\u731f\u8a18[\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e]\nWho is it for?  \nIt's for you! No, really, whether you have zero experience with the Japanese language or you are well versed and looking for a supplement for your studies, or just want to play a JRPG for old times' sake, then this is for you!\nThe story\nI'll give you a short synopsis of what happens in the first few minutes of Koe.\nFollowing JRPG tradition, you'll get to pick whether you are a boy or girl and name your character. You're then sent on your trip to Japan and begin your adventure at the airport. However, this place isn't what you expected it to be. Shortly after arriving, you'll be sent in to a world of castles, cities and dungeons, while making friends and companions along the way.\nI'll get straight to the point, I absolutely love the Japanese language. I've been studying it for a few years now and the biggest hurdle for me was when I was starting out. I didn't know where to begin, or what to use because there are so many tools and reference materials out there, and I had no idea which one would be the most approachable. Koe is everything I wanted help with starting out in the form of my favorite gaming genre and brings together not only the technology, but also the culture behind the Japanese language.\nWell then, how does the Japanese language exactly fit in to Koe? Well, it comes in the form of items. All items in the games are basically Japanese words that are initially taught to you using communicative language teaching techniques, which is easier said as \u201cyou don\u2019t really have to be taught anything, you\u2019ll learn the words from using the items\u201d but, obviously, most of the game and descriptions will be in English because this is an introduction to the language, so the game will help you every step of the way, though don\u2019t expect any help when you\u2019re out of cures and almost killed by a 2-headed dragon.\nKoe features a traditional turn-based battle system, where you are given Japanese words from various sources (NPCs, chests, monsters, shops etc) and you use these words as moves in battle, you can even combine them to make sentences for better moves! For example, you may get the Japanese word for the traditional Japanese sword, katana/\u304b\u305f\u306a as the item below.\n You can then select this word in battle to vanquish enemies.\nWhoa! See what happened there? You just summoned a sword from the word itself!\nIf you\u2019ve never dabbled across Japanese before, the big character, \u5200, is a Kanji, a character adapted from Chinese, and the characters on the side are in Hiragana, a syllabary in Japanese. In this case, the Hiragana is basically the way to read the Kanji.\nDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t understand this here, Koe will have a great introduction to this, and you\u2019ll be able to revisit it as much as you like! For now, let\u2019s look at the characters on the side \u304b, \u305f, and \u306a which are ka, ta, and na, respectively. See what that makes? Katana! In Koe, these characters are the very soul of battle, so the more you use your moves, the more you will power up those characters.\nAs you power up the characters, your moves will get stronger, become more useful or change completely! You will need to power up all of them though, there are dozens of moves, and 3 different charts! If you\u2019ve never seen Hiragana before, the charts look similar to this;\nObviously, all of this will be taught to you, and you will start off with only a few characters, and earn others along the way.\nOne other way the characters you level up are used are through something called avatars, which are monsters you can capture and fight alongside. For example, if you capture a cat (neko/\u306d\u3053) then you need to level up ne and ko to level up your avatar!\nAvatars can use their own moves and learn new moves from watching you use Japanese words in battle.\nWhat you will learn\nThe Japanese syllabaries, Hiragana (\u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a) and Katakana (\u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca) so you will be able to read basic Japanese.\nKanji (\u6f22\u5b57) and their readings, as well as their use in words and sentences.\nJapanese words. This will include nouns, verbs as well as some basic conjunctions. Most of these would be words you would find in everyday life, such as words for various food, animals, transport, locations, directions, etc.\nJapanese phrases. This will include introducing yourself, various ways to end a conversation, asking for items and will cover conversational language.\nWhile these are the current focus of Koe, I am currently researching the ability to acquire grammar in an engaging way. \nEducation in gaming is a very controversial issue. Video games in society have a varied range of opinions, what I want to do with this is prove that traditional games can be educational too, without squeezing the fun out of them.\nHowever, I've been spending roughly 6 - 8 hours every day working on Koe by myself, researching and implementing new ideas and mechanics, creating artwork, programming and marketing, while at the same time working on my assignments for University for the past 6 months. This has given me virtually no time for anything else, and I could use some help.\nWhat I need from you\nYour support means I can replace a lot of the placeholders, polish up and continue development on the game. RPGs take hundreds of people many years to make a polished and refined product, and my project is a notch of ambition above that. I've been working on Koe with every bit of free time I get, to show you how serious I am about this project, but I need some help from you guys. Your contribution to this project will be used for the following things:\nI can commission 3D character and environment artists to help me completely change the artwork for Koe, so it looks like a JRPG. [\u00a320,000]\nLicenses for software and tools I need. This includes Unity Pro, Autodesk Maya, and Adobe Photoshop, which would help with making the game look a lot better, and speed up a few tasks on my to-do list. [\u00a35,000]\nA composer will be needed to make the soundtrack for Koe, I've been currently using royalty-free music and I'm looking to recruit the talent of a professional video game composer who has worked on previous AAA titles to replace the placeholder music. [\u00a32,000]\nVoice acting from native Japanese speakers to sound out the characters so you can get a feeling for how a native speaker would pronounce them. [\u00a33,000]\nKickstarter fees and taxes [\u00a35,000]\nPS Vita support, which will require a lot of the assets to remade as well as recreating the game in PSM should the Unity version not get released. [Stretch goals]\nLanguages (UPDATED) Due to the level of interest by the community, we have since decided to crowdsource the translations. The languages available to translate in to on release will be German, Dutch, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Korean and Russian. If you are interested in translating to your native language then please contact us. Click here to sign up!\nWhat your support will bring to Koe\nCurrently, the game is at a prototyping phase. Funding this game would mean I get to create a project that would revolutionize language acquisition, as well as create a story-driven traditional JRPG set within Japan.\nThe current art assets will be completely changed to be much more interactive and detailed. All characters, NPCs, monsters, environments and menus will be replaced with detailed models and graphics.\nStretch goals\n\u00a335,000 - Initial funding goal. At this point, the game will get made. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a350,000 - Playstation Vita support, including touch screen support and Vita-exclusive UI. While we can't guarantee this (it's up to Sony in the end to accept our game) we've laid out the plan and how much extra work is going to be needed for this, and we've decided to go ahead with it! If we do reach this stretch goal, you'll be able to pick digital access on this platform or PC and we'll send a message out to ask which platform you want it on.\nWe have also applied for PS4/Wii U/Xbox One licences and will update on this page once we've heard back from them.\nPlease note that this stretch goal is not solely for Vita support. Instead, there are a few things we want to possibly add to the game (handwriting support, voice commands, UI art) which fit in to this goal, but will be available for all platforms. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a360,000 - Akihabara battle zone. An almost endless procedural battle zone set on the streets of Akiba to test your strength during the story and post-story of Koe! There's a lot of work that will be needed to be done to add this and make it look true to the source (except, you know, with monsters). We'll also add some specific vocab for this area. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a370,000 - An increase to the world map size which allows us to add a new dungeon and city which will also be useful post-game. We will also add two new restaurants to the game, an Izakaya (Japanese-style pub) and a Sushi Bar. A lot of socializing in Japan takes place in restaurants, so we hope these will allow us to add more vocab specific to these areas, as well as introduce you to new words for various food. - COMPLETED!\n\u00a380,000 - A new \"super-boss\" which is something we've been very interested in adding for people who are really looking to use as many words as possible in a battle. This will be similar to the \"secret\" bosses found in Final Fantasy and will be based on a Japanese god of your choice. This also allows us to create a place where we can really bring out the culture and religion of Japan, something Dan has been interested in for a long time. We'll also add one more thing with this stretch goal, which is an onsen (a hot spring) within the main story, which again will serve as a place where you can just relax and pick up some new vocab.\n\u00a3100,000 - At this goal, we'll focus on adding some more vocab-building areas for those who are interested in the city lifestyle of Japan. Particularly, we'll add a shopping district and train stop based in Harajuku! This area will have new vocab related to shopping and travel, as well as a maid cafe that happens to teach you a few formalities.\nWho are we?\nJitesh Rawal is a student at the University of Derby, studying Computer Games Programming and is researching the use of language within video games.

Its intricate plot and outstanding voxel based design offers opportunities for intense action and unlimited creativity. Planets\u00b3 has been designed to promote multi-player gameplay, to share the fun with friends.\nToday, in the early development stage, all the elements are in place to develop a first PC (windows) release. What we need now is your help to make it happen!\nUpdates\nEvolution and stats\nMaterials and combat system\nMaterial's recipes\nMultiplayer\nGravity\nRumors have it that aliens who look like humans, crashed onto the planet some years ago. What happened? Where are they from? Why did they crash? Are there survivors?\nTo discover the answers to these questions, Planets\u00b3 players will have to solve a number of mysteries and build up their own little world, before expanding into the universe. Many adventures await them and they\u2019ll find plenty of help -and enemies- along the way. As they progress, they\u2019ll be able to level up their character to achieve more and more freedom, till they can roam the universe in their own starship, which, by the way, they may have created themselves\u2026\nWho said the Earth was round?\nPlanets\u00b3 adventures take place in a universe entirely made of 25cm\u00b3 blocks (voxels). Each planet represents thousands of billions of blocks. The blocks can be combined in a variety of ways to build beautiful objects and landscape elements of all shapes and size.\nConcept Art\nFree to roam\nIn this completely open world, freedom is the key. With entire surroundings that can be completely modulated, destroyed and recreated as you wish, the only limit in Planets\u00b3 is your own imagination! But this freedom comes with its own set of challenges. For instance, to leave our planet and visit the universe, players must unlock their own personal spaceship, or build one themselves\u2026 And you\u2019ll need the natives to grant you their trust, so you can master the craft system and learn new skills.\nShare the journey\nYou will find lots of characters during your journey, natives who will ask you to complete tasks for them. Once you have gained their trust, some of them will allow you to use their crafting skills: they will then become Job Masters, Job Masters are essential for your progression since they can provide assistance in many ways: They can research new recipes for you, help build new structures, repair broken items, dismantle objects to learn how to reproduce them; they can also harvest crops for cooking, and of course, fight by your side against any enemy\u2026 Job masters can be blacksmith, goldsmith, engineer, fighter, cook, builder or farmer.\nThe first one you will encounter is Watts the blacksmith. He will be the one to teach you how to craft low level tools, armors and weapons.\nExperience an amazing evolution\nPlanets\u00b3 is split into zones, which represent different levels of difficulty and mark the progression of the player in the story line.\nYou\u2019ll be able to level up your avatar and improve your character\u2019s skills while playing. In fact every action will improve one of your statistics: For instance, running and jumping will improve your form, making you run faster and jump higher; Pushing your limit will increase your stamina and endurance; Using heavy tools or weapons will improve your strength, and make it easier for you to use them.\nIncrease your technical level\nYour technical level is defined by the level of the tools you can create. How do you progress in this area? When traveling from one zone to the next you\u2019ll find new resources that can be used by the Job Master to research new recipes and craft more powerful items. You can also improve your technical level by taking the enemy\u2019s gear after you win a fight, to use it directly or to bring it to a Job Master to dismantle it and discover new recipes.\nThe more advanced your technical level, the more powerful the crafted items will become, but also the more complicated the recipe to create them (requiring more resources and/or rare resources).\nChoose your combat mode\nWith Planets\u00b3 you decide how you wish to fight: You may want to be a heavily armed warrior, fearing nothing except the lack of enemies. But perhaps you will prefer to play an undetectable ninja, sniping enemies from a long distance or sneaking up from behind\u2026 Players teaming up can combine their favorite fighting styles, so that, together, they can take on the most challenging of enemies.\nFight the enemies in dungeons\nDungeons take up a big place in the Planets\u00b3 story and in the secondary quests. Inside each dungeon is at least one boss, who protects a long hidden treasure by sending out enemy apparitions. To put an end to the attacks and reach the treasure, you\u2019ll have to get past the enemies and kill the boss. The treasure itself is a chest full of useful objects, with some unique items in it, which you can bring to a job master to discover new recipes.\nMost dungeons are destructible, but you will need to have the adequate tools to do so. Some will prove to be indestructible for the moment, and you\u2019ll have to make it through their labyrinth to get past them.\nBeware: enemies in Planets\u00b3 are clever. They will work together in groups, aiding each other to fight intelligently against you. When an enemy apparition is killed, there is no random reward but you can take the armor or the objects they were wearing.\nAnd explore every corner!\nAn important part of the adventure will take place in the depth of the planets, where danger is ubiquitous. Of course the player will harvest valuable resources (minerals or crystals), but mainly he will be led there by the story in order to solve quests or mysteries.\nConcept Art\nMore than just an adventure game, Planets\u00b3 is also a construction game, entirely composed of blocks. The wide range of shapes and materials allows you to create everything you need: tools, vehicles, housing\u2026 A hundred different materials are represented, including woods, rocks, metals, dirt, sand, gravel, transformed materials, and of course\u2026alien technology and materials! You\u2019ll be able to use them as you see fit, to make whatever you have to throughout the game.\nCrafting is key\nCrafting is the essential feature of the game, and the only way to evolve. All objects (except gathered resources) are done by assembling subparts; each subpart makes the tool unique in terms of form and material.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you find an object, with a subpart you can\u2019t craft yet, you can choose to dismantle it to learn how to reproduce the object at will or construct new objects with this newly acquired subpart!\nEquip every weapon\nIn Planets\u00b3 players can equip every weapon, whatever their progression. There are no restrictions, but each weapon has an important statistic for its use, called the \u2018recommended strength\u2019; this makes it easier or harder to use depending on your character\u2019s strength.\nBecome a builder\nSome quests in the game will ask the player to build houses (Job Master\u2019s houses for example) or vehicles. To accelerate things you can call on the builder Job Masters to help you out. You will then be able to record the building patterns for key structures and reuse them in another spot, at another time in the story.\nTravel the universe\nDuring your journey you\u2019ll come across animals which you can tame and mount. But the best way to travel is to create the vehicle you wish: Just assemble the blocks to get the shape you want and add the necessary control blocks (motor, cockpit, wheel \u2026). Vehicles control blocks are crafted as any other object in the game, but the player will need to find the engineer job master to unlock the recipes.\nGround vehicles and animals are not the only means of transportation. Planets\u00b3 will have specific control blocks for spaceships!\nSome of the stretch goals can unlock other specific control blocks for boats, planes and helicopters.\nCustomization and Sharing\nThe entire Planets\u00b3 universe is customizable via xml file (or Planets\u00b3 editor if the stretch goal is reached). Crafts can be modified, but also textures, 3D models, quests, planets generation (landscapes), predefined constructions and so on \u2026\nUltimately, a tool is due to be integrated in the Planets\u00b3 editor and implemented on our website so that players can easily share their creations.\nIn the case of multiplayers, customization is stored on the server so that when you join a server you will automatically upgrade your client files.\nWe are three friends who graduated from the same engineering school in France. We share the same passion for video games. After gaining experience, during 9 years, developing a range of applications (professional applications and/or video games) for Windows, Mac, mobiles and even consoles, we decided to found our independent game studio, Cubical Drift, last year in october.\nWe surrounded ourselves with competent and truly motivated people from different horizons (creative artists, graphics and musician) to develop the game of our dreams\nEvery aspect of Planets\u00b3 reflects what we like in video games: old classic RPG, new open world RPG, adventure game and \u2018sandbox game\u2019.\nToday we aspire to dedicating all our energy to this game.\nWhy should you trust us? The fate of our company and its team depends on the success of this game.\nMeet the Team\nMore about the team in the update #5\nTechnology\nWe use Ogre as our 3D engine, because we have years of experience with it.\nWe have developed specific multithreading algorithms to be able to display a massive number of blocks with a large (almost infinite) viewing distance in real time. This allows you to see other planets from the surface (by night and without clouds!). This was our focus in the actual prototype.\nAmong our top interesting features:\nMarked progression, with clearly defined zone levels\nScalable UI: you craft what you need (a map, a watch, radar\u2026)\nAn \u2018In Game\u2019 vehicle construction system to build your transport solutions\nNatural elements taken into account, such as planets alignment, because all the planets are in motion!\nRealism, with features like pipelines to transport resources, different smelting furnaces for metal, electric circuits management, farming and animal husbandry\nTechnical challenges\nPlanets\u00b3 is full of technical challenges such as:\nLarge viewing distance: you will be able to see everything that is happening in the solar system you are in\nMassive amount of blocs to display: a planet is composed of 32 000 000 000 000 of blocks! One tranche of planet is composed of 1 billion of blocks!\nComplex physical engine for blocks made vehicles\nCommunity Sharing management (to enable players to share their creations)\nParts of these technical challenges have been addressed. In particular, before coming to Kickstarter, we had created the \u00absub resolution based view distance\u00bb engine, which is the major display feature of the game. We reached that goal in December. Sure it will take us a lot of time to optimize the engine, but the hardest part is done!\nHere is an actual game footage. The dev team has been focusing on technical challenges leaving aside the gameplay and the artistic aspect of the game.\nPLAY\n\nAs for now 10% of the game has been developed (game design, artwork, development bases), but we need you to make the other 90%!\nRoadmap\nAs you see some of our stretch goals are really ambitious, and developing them will take more than a year. This is why we decided to release the game in 2 parts:\nThe first release, named Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, is to be finalized, with all features complete, for the fall of 2015 and will include all the goals up to 500 000$ (with the Planets\u00b3 editor). It will take place in the first solar system, with the storyline suspended beyond that...\nWe are targeting 2017 for the release of the 'full game', named Planets\u00b3: Space Enemies, which will open onto the universe and lead to a climactic story ending. Some clues will be scattered in the first opus, though mostly in annex quests and dungeons.\nBudget Breakdown\nMost of the funds will go to development and artwork, the two bigger parts of the planning in terms of the number of persons involved (we will expand the team) and the time needed to complete them. The game also requires writing the story, the quests and working on the sound. These are key to success, even if less demanding in financial terms\nWe plan to sell the game at around $30. As a backer, it means you'll save some money when you support us ; two birds one stone !\nKickstarter Pledges\nAll Backers (whatever the amount) will receive a special thanks in the game credits and an access to the private discussion forum.\nContact and/or delivery for pledges will occur this summer.\nPledge add-ons\nYou just need to add the chosen amount to your current pledge and reward tier:\nFor each additional +$10, you will get an extra digital download (1 access to the alpha, beta and release). Available from the $35 tier and above. Limited to 5 per account.\n For each additional +$20, a set of 3 pets that will help you in the game. Available from tiers between $15 and $100, included in the $200 tiers and above. Limited to 1 per digital copy of the game.\nWe want backers to get something that will make them feel special when starting to play. Something that feels unique.\nHere are the 3 unique backer pets :\nMore about the add-ons in the update#8\nKickstarter Stretch Goals\nAll Kickstarter backers (>=$15) will get free access to the first PC (Windows) game, Planets\u00b3: Race to Space, AND the second, Planets\u00b3: space enemies, as soon as they are available.\nAs backers, you will also be kept up to date on the evolution of the game; we will update you frequently with weekly news, monthly development reports (newletter). What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll take part in the final design of the game.

I am absolutely thrilled about this product and believe you will be too. \nCapturing the world around us through photo and video is one of the most artistically free forms of expressions we have as humans. Equipped with this insight, I found it strange there has been a lack of reliable tools that help us visually represent these situation in an artistically free-form, non-conventional way. That's why I created the Fractal Filter.\nWhat are Fractal Filters? \nFractal Filters are supplementary tools designed to provide photographers (and videographers) with new techniques that can be used to shoot anytime, anywhere. They are the world's first reflective 'shoot-through' filters that, when viewed through the lens can do many things: from creating patterns, to isolating a subject. Or, maybe something completely different: how you use them is completely up to you. \nFractal Filters are designed to provide the user a unique way to look through the lens, both making difficult shooting situations easier and easy situations more spontaneous and creatively elastic. No other filter offers this much versatility and creative potential. \nFilter A; F/2.0 1/640 ISO800 Shot during an engagement shoot in Seattle.\nWhy choose Fractal Filters?  \nI believe media professionals and amateurs alike deserve a product that will add a beautiful and effortless touch to photo or video production. Fractal Filters endeavor to bring a high level of  innovation and creative flexibility to a relatively stagnant and boring range of competitor filters. \nOne filter, several effects: Each filter can be used in a variety of ways, depending on the way it\u2019s rotated, the distance it sits from the lens, focal length used, etc. The way an end user applies their filter is only limited by their creativity: these filters have been designed to be effectively versatile. \nMulti-situational: I am a wedding and portrait photographer, and typically apply the filters to these types of photography. Others have been amazed by their utility in product and glamour photography. The video above shows the filters' use even when used by amateur videographers such as myself. I've even taken some cell phone pictures of my dog with it. Perfect for practical ...as well as completely impractical shooting situations.\nQuick to use, quick to store away: The filters are designed to be supplementary tools. Find a situation you want to use them in? Great--pull a filter out of the case, shoot a bit, and then stow it away; all in a few seconds. Amazing effects without having to set up lights, equip specialized lenses, or manage other untimely tasks. Fractal Filters are quick, unobtrusive, easy to manage, and create a wholly different optical effect unlike one you've seen before. \nThese four designs were carefully crafted over a year so that each individual filter has a unique optical effect. Filter D is in final stages of production and may be offered as a stretch goal. Two more filters are in development, contingent on the success of these initial four.\n Here's some examples of images I've taken with the product. All images by Nikk Wong.  \nNo post-production on any of these, except occasional color tweaks.\nFilter B; F/3.5 1/200 ISO400\nFilter A; F/2.8 1/80 ISO640\nFilter A; F/4 1/60 ISO1000\nFilter B; F/2.0 1/320 ISO640\nFilter A; F/2.8 1/50 ISO400\nThe follow have no post-production applied whatsoever. Straight out of the camera. Filter use clockwise from top-left: A, B, C, A, A, C, C, B\nThese filters do not thread onto your lens, the FAQ below explains why this is ideal. The Fractal Filters articulating arm mount connects to any hot shoe and has a hot shoe mount atop so you won't lose any TTL ability. The arm has a reach far enough to mount your filter in front of a telephoto, and locks into place allowing one to position the filter in front of the lens freely. A similar mount with a standard 4mm screw-hole has been created for video users who do not have a hot shoe. \nTo handhold, or to mount, that is the question.\nHand holding our filters gives you a certain freedom that is often more desirable; this is especially true due to the major changes that can be observed in the frame even from slight angular shifts of the filter in front of the lens which are easy to do by hand. But, situationally being able to mount the filter is certainly a convenient addition and adds utility in certain situations, especially when shooting video. So realistically, it's up to you guys. I want to make these available; with your help we can make it happen. \nI've been taking photos since I was eight when my uncle gave me a Topcon Uni which I loved and used all the time. I grew as a photographer over time; when I started shooting weddings, I became interested in supplementing my photography with techniques that were more unique than focusing on composition and subject alone. I started shooting through beads and different prism shaped glasses; yet nothing had been actually designed for photographers; nothing gave me the optimal look and feel I wanted!\nI started shaping glass objects at a studio in downtown Seattle; I became obsessed with shaping a piece that could be used in multiple ways. But still, I had hardly any idea what I was doing! Eventually, I worked with a few professional glass blowers as well as mathematicians who could better assist me in creating an optically and compositionally perfect piece of glass for media purposes. I started to get excited when I realized my tools were far cooler than I had ever imagined. I began selling them to friend photographers; but eventually found making them one by one is incredibly time consuming! My ambitions then expanded outwards.\nHow do they work?\nFor specific questions, make sure to read the FAQ below! Fractals' custom shaped filters use the reflective qualities of glass in calculated ways to reflect your surroundings into your frame, complementing your unique shooting style while also presenting an efficient way to create incredibly cool special effects. \nEach Fractal Filter can be hand-held or mounted in front of the lens. From there, changing the angular position of the filter even slightly can create a wholly different effect in your frame. You'll find that your surroundings (even those behind you) can now be used to manipulate your image in ways that weren't possible before. Our custom shaped filters let you decide the exact compositional makeup you want in your image or video--many different filters for endless possibilities. \n             Hash-tag images captured with our product as #FractalFilters on Flickr, Pinterest, Twitter, Google+, or Facebook. More details will be released soon. \nReach out to me. I am friendly and interested in your ideas. Please contact me at nikkwong@live.com; or call my cell phone at (206) 854-0968. Building a relationship with you is my number one priority.\nPlease share the project everywhere you can! The project's success rides on the support of people like you. Together we can make Fractal Filters a cornerstone in creative media production!\nI cannot even begin to explain how much your engagement with my project means to me--just to be in a position with the ability to present this project to you is an honor. Expect a \"wow\" factor when you get it in your hands!\nTHANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFunding; my main challenge has always been getting the word out to enough people due to my small size and limited budget (I am a super awesome team of just 1!). This is why your sharing this project is of incredible importance to me.\n\nI have established excellent relationships with my suppliers over the past year and have verified both the availability of the necessary materials, as well as a high quality of their work as I've seen through samples. However, there is always a chance that they will encounter issues in production (modeling errors, increased workload) that could result in delays. We are working closely to ensure that this does not happen.\n\nAs I stated previously, the lenses are going to be assembled in Kent, WA after the housing and glass meet in the US for the first time. We then use ultraviolet technology to bind the two together. Any problem in the supply chain could disrupt production. As a team of 1, I won't have to face any bureaucracy challenges which will ensure problems are solved quickly. \n\nUpon successful funding of stretch goals, I will have to reach out to other suppliers to get the production finished. The logic used previously applies here as well.\n\nWorst case scenario: let's say, the building used to create the glass or our Kent warehouse is destroyed. Under such a situation, it is unlikely this would hold up the project longer than 6 weeks. This is based on my experience when shopping for previous suppliers. \n\nI value everyone who believes in me enough to back me. I guarantee to only ship products that meet my high standards.

Twenty-five years ago and more, when Greg Girard and I first visited Kowloon Walled City to take photographs (each for our own reasons as we hadn\u2019t met at this stage), little did we imagine that within five years or so we would end up publishing City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City. Even less did we imagine that the book would remain in print for nearly 20 years, becoming in the process the book of record for this remarkable community.\nBut here we are, working together again to produce City of Darkness Revisited, an all-new edition that will combine the best of the original book with several new sections that will fill in some of the gaps and bring the story up to date. We will explore the City\u2019s dramatic architectural evolution from a near bare site in 1945 to a 17-storey megalith housing over 33,000 people at the time of its clearance. And we will explain the City\u2019s unique legal and political status \u2013 under two jurisdictions but effectively managed by neither \u2013 and how this coloured every aspect of life there.\nA third theme will delve into the myths and realities of the Triads\u2019 activities within the City and how these might \u2013 or might not \u2013 have been effectively policed. And finally we will describe how the influence of the Walled City has spread into popular culture worldwide, and how this has allowed interest in the City \u2013 either as myth or physical reality \u2013 to flourish. And all will be illustrated by new documents, drawings and photographs that have come to light over the past 20 years, allowing us to explain these aspects of the City in unprecedented detail. Please visit our website at www.cityofdarkness.co.uk to find out much, much more. \nFor those who would like to know a little more about how the Walled City worked from an architectural perspective, and have 10 minutes to spare, you might be interested to check out the video below. This slipped past us when we were researching this new edition, and I am grateful to one of our backers, Lisa Atkinson, for pointing it out to us.

We take your favourite movies and sequence them. What comes out is MovieDNA:\nUsing every frame of a movie, we compress it down to give a stunning overview of the movie as a whole. Each movie has its own individual look and feel and the colour palettes blend to create a piece of art like no other. We aim to create an art series that can be appreciated by all movie lovers. Everyone has a movie they love and we decided to create a project to enable everyone to enjoy theirs everyday.\nThe Process\nUsing movies from our own personal 2000 strong DVD and Blu-ray collection, we first extract the individual frames. After this we use a process which takes those frames and compresses them into smaller chunks which gives an overall picture of the colours and shadows used within that frame. After we have that, we place them all together in chronological order and the results are what you see below.\nAlthough we believe that we will already own the majority of the movies requested, if your favourite is not there then we will purchase it exclusively for this project. So as long as it's available on DVD, there's a MovieDNA for you.\nPrint Layout\nThe art prints will have a black border surrounding the MovieDNA image along with a centralised, crisp font displaying the movie title and production year. \nThe canvas prints will be displayed with a slight alteration, the MovieDNA image will take up the whole front face of the canvas, and the sides of the canvas will be black. The movie title and production year will be positioned at the bottom-left of the print in either black or white. Please see the examples below.\nClick here for updated options\nArt Prints\n   Canvas Prints\nOur Targets\nWe have set out to produce the ultimate collection of high quality artwork, for as many films as possible! This Kickstarter campaign is vital to the project as it will allow us to produce our very first set of high quality, production prints.\nPrint Production\nWe will be printing using state of the art, digital high definition technology with a resolution of 1440x1440 dpi making the prints deep and vibrant. The material we will be printing on is premium quality, 220gsm thick, Satin coated photographic paper.\nWe have 3 print products available:\nStandard Print: 29cm x 21cm \nLarge Print: 100cm x 50cm\nCanvas : 32\" x 16\" (UK only for now, sorry guys)\nHow to Order\nSubmit your request to preview your movie artwork here.\n\nOrdering Multiple Prints\nIf you would like to order more than one print then you need to choose the size you want and then submit your pledge for that amount. Once that's done, you can come back to our project page and will now have a button that says \"Manage Your Pledge\". When you click on that you will be able to enter any amount that you want. You only need to pay postage once so if you were ordering two large prints then the total amount you need to pledge would be \u00a340 (2 x \u00a320) for UK buyers or \u00a350 (2 x \u00a320 + \u00a310 P&P) for international buyers.\nYou will have a choice of any movie that is currently available to buy on DVD. After the project is successfully funded we will send you a survey via email where you will be able to tell us exactly which film you would like.\nFuture Plans\nAfter we have raised enough funds for this initial run,  and the ball is rolling, we will continue to produce artwork prints for any* requested film.

Yeah we could do this on one format, but why stop there? We're doing 6 panel Digipaks, picture discs and stunning red vinyl all with original artwork. Founder members Roscoe T, Evangeline D'isco and Kandi Flauss are in the studio already, working on the brand new tracks.\nWith your hot cash injection we can make this album a reality, and you can get yourself a piece of animated musical history.

So yes, it's going to be tight. But it's got to be right. Obviously any extra fees will help us spend a little more on mastering.\nThe Process\nNew songs are already written and ready for recording. The old singles didn't feature the amazing vocal talents of Kandi Flauss, so all singles are being re-recorded with her backing vocal which sounds truly haunting and amazing. We're also in the process of selecting a couple of outstanding remixes to add to the pot. Literally thousands of people have made remixes of Savlonic, we need to make sure we get the cream of the crop, so it'll take a while but again, it has to be right.\nAn overspend of \u00a31000 will see us perform a rare online gig for your eyes only. Overspend fees will go towards studio hire costs for the gig. We might even invite some of you along. Why not?\nThis is something we've wanted to do for a long time and your help will make it a reality.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIf we can raise \u00a330,000 that means we will be able to make another animation for one of the new songs.

Our ambitious $50k goal has been utterly smashed by your generosity and enthusiasm! In addition to PC and Mac, Rain World will now be officially coming to LINUX... and beyond! Any additional funds raised will be used for polish and making Rain World the best game it can be. Massive thanks to all, you have been amazing and we look forward to getting down to work!\nUpdate #3 - ALPHA VIDEO \"THE ROOF\" & GREENLIGHT NEWS!\nUpdate #5 - ALPHA VIDEO \"SLUGCAT LIFE\" & MAP OF THE WORLD\nUpdate #6 - ALPHA VIDEO \"PUPS!\" & LINUX NEWS!\nRain World is set in an abandoned industrial environment scourged by a shattered eco-system. Bone-crushing intense rain pounds the surface regularly, making life as we know it almost impossible. The creatures in this world hibernate most of the time, but in the few brief dry periods they go out searching for food. \nYou are a lonely nomadic slugcat, both predator and prey in this land. You must hunt enough food to survive another cycle of hibernation. Other - bigger - creatures have the same plan.\nInspired by the aesthetics and simplicity of 16-bit classics, the gameplay consists of platforming and fast paced sneaking; both sneaking on your prey and sneaking in order to avoid larger creatures. A large focus of the development has been on enemy AI: they are cunning, vicious and they are always hunting you. \nRain World is currently in development for PC and Mac, and can be found on Steam Greenlight \nGameplay:\n* Sneak, climb, and pounce your way through an exotic alien landscape full of hidden secrets and undiscovered dangers. \n* Nimble controls and unique physics-and-code based animation gives characters a natural fluidity of movement and intuitive weight, for lighting quick high-wire action.  \n* Intense, primal predator encounters will challenge your reflexes. Limited resources and the constant impending threat of rain will test your nerve. This is not an easy game!\n* Co-operative and up to 4 player competitive gameplay: deathmatches, endurance, waves, custom challenges, etc.\n* Seriously Mega Cute Slugcat character. Hey, I know that's why we're all really here!\nProgress so far:  \nWe have been developing Rain World on our own for almost 3 years now, and have a pretty solid playable alpha in place: game engine, AI, art assets, levels, and music are functional and exist in some stage. All of the content on this page, the trailer, gifs, screenshots, etc., are taken from actual gameplay of the current alpha build of Rain World and could be considered representative of typical gameplay.\nBeyond that, we have detailed plans of where we want to go from here, fleshing out the narrative elements, allowing plenty of room for new inspiration and organic growth along the way. Rain World is a passion project and will remain to be so.   \nIf you are interested in even more technical details and concept discussion, feel free to browse through over 67 ACTION-PACKED PAGES of devlog on TIGsource: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.0\nThe Sound of Rain World:  \nTaking inspiration from both the unique alien landscape and the decayed future-industrial aesthetic, the music of Rain World is a blend of other-worldly ambient soundscapes, glitchy chiptune and urban-inspired breakbeat. Here is a selection of some of the work so far:\nWhy Kickstarter?:\nWe have reached the inevitable point where we realize that in order to make Rain World into the game we believe it deserves to be, additional resources and personnel will be required that we -hacking away in our basements- can't provide on our own. Your generous help in funding this project would allow for:\n* Complete Realization of our vision of Rain World. We want to present to you a rich, dynamic world brimming with secrets to uncover, engaging narrative choices to be shocked by, and a lush eco-system of interesting creatures to kill and eat (or be eaten by). The vast majority of funding will go towards further development of the nuts and bolts of the game: art assets like level design, new terrain and new characters; expanded AI for terrifyingly intelligent predators; a lengthy well-written single player campaign; more music, more hidden secrets, more Rain World for you to experience.\n* Hiring a skilled C++ contractor to help the game run faster and do all the important stuff that C++ wizards do best: display optimization and modernization, help porting to new platforms, etc etc. This is an essential part of \"doing it right\", and their skills don't come cheap!\n* Proper testing and Quality Control: Rain World is hard and we want it that way, but it should be hard for the right reasons, not impossible levels or tricky controls. Having time and resources for thorough testing and QC would make the game a smoother experience for all players.\nand slugcat pups! awwww\nKickstarter Budget Breakdown:\nWho are we?\n* Joar Jakobsson - Concept, Programming, Art, Design\nJoar is a Swedish illustrator and graphic designer who is obsessively interested in every art form there is.

This might include things like upgrading our development tools and porting Rain World to more modern programming languages.\n\nThe $25,000 funding goal for this Kickstarter is what we believe to be an honest assessment of the bare-bones cost that it would take to bring a publishable version of Rain World into the world, and we feel this should be taken into account when considering pulling the trigger on funding.\n\nThanks for reading this far and a sincere thank you for your interest in Rain World!\n--James & Joar\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Rain World: Expansion News!

It also won the jury prize for Best Animated Film at the Fantasia Film Festival in Montr\u00e9al along with the Excellence Prize for Feature Length Animation at the 2010 Japan Media Arts Festival. That's a lot of festival prizes and praise!\nDirected by Sunao Katabuchi, director and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, Mai Mai Miracle is particularly noted for its beautifully designed background art. The film itself garnered much of its success in Japan thanks to a slow but enthusiastic build up of word of mouth, quickly making it a niche favourite amongst anime fans ever since. \nSuch a film dripping with gorgeous art, sweetness and a story rich in the magic of childhood imagination, growing up and friendship should be enjoyed by a wider audience. This Kickstarter campaign will allow us to do just that, to finally bring about the release of Mai Mai Miracle for the first time in UK and US complete with English subtitles and, hopefully, an English dub! \nThis campaign will allow us to arrange and package Mai Mai Miracle in the way it deserves and otherwise would not receive. \nThat is where you step in.\nA Special Thank You From Sunao Katabuchi \n\"A film is never complete until it has been viewed by an audience. The movie can only become truly completed once it's in you. Because of your support this story about two young girls in a corner of Japan can now be seen worldwide. Thank you everyone! Thank you, Andrew!\"\n- Katabuchi Sunao\nShinko, is a third grade elementary school student with a magically active imagination. She spends a lot of her time listening to her grandfather's history lessons, imagining what her town was like 1,000 years earlier. One day, a sad and sombre girl called Kiiko transfers to Shinko's school from Tokyo. A strong friendship soon grows between the two girls as Shinko helps Kiiko come out of her shell and deal with her loss - all thanks to their adventures, both imagined and real. \nWith so many prizes and praises under its belt, Mai Mai Miracle is a gem of a film that has been sadly overlooked by the wider world in terms of international release. We're here to fix that - with your help.\nMai Mai Miracle is a niche film that hasn\u2019t had much exposure in the UK and US as it was viewed as not a standard commercially viable film at the time.  Our intention is to give everyone a shot  to prove that wrong and show support for an awesome film and director!\nWhat we want to do is simple and much in line with the spirit of other recent anime Kickstarter campaigns - bring you the quality release for the film that it deserves.  In the process we want to give you, the backers, a say in how any extra budget is spent.\nLovingly releasing a niche film in high definition would be reason enough to support this Kickstarter campaign. What we are also planning to do is create, arrange and organise English subtitles. The money raised by the campaign will help us fund this English language release for the first time and bring the film to a wider, much deserved audience.\nAnyone who knows of Anime Limited's founder, Andrew Partridge, knows he's all about transparency - down to publishing the monthly charts for anime in the UK to giving people a wealth of information on how things work! With that in mind, we feel it's vital that we explain just exactly what is getting spent where. \nHere's what the Kickstarter money is going to be used for :\n50% of all money in -  Basic out of pocket costs such as production of the collector's edition (authoring, translation, material access, replication, packaging, shipping and fulfilment), and a flat fee of $5,000 to cover man-power over production at likely 280+ hrs.\n40% - Split between creation of extras for the Kickstarter and any extras made as part of the Kickstarter (borrowing the term from the good folks at AnimEigo - the concept of Crowd Production).\n10% goes to Kickstarter - Between the 5% fee that keeps them going to enable more awesome payments, payment processing fees & tax.\nWe Kickstart projects a lot (check our profile if you're curious or follow us to see what we end up supporting usually). And to be honest, we're pretty sick of stretch goals dictated by the companies in question. We are big believers in Crowd Production. \nNone of the money from the Kickstarter will be used to acquire the rights - we've taken the gamble on that and shouldered that spend ourselves.  Now we need your help to prove us right that there's some love out there for this film! \nProduction for a Kickstarter project such as this should allow you, as backers, to have a say in how extra budget is used.  \nWhile some elements, such as a dub, are things we will do by default if we reach a certain funding amount, there may be an allocation of cash surplus that you the fans should get a say in how it's used!\nSo what we'll do is supply a list of some things that we know are viable to start and then ask you guys to expand on it. If you have other ideas, we can look at how viable they are cost-wise then list them up.  Then you get a chance to vote on where budget is spent!\nWant a new audio commentary track with creatives or film critics?  How about an exclusive piece of artwork for the slipcover or an even fancier package?  \nWhatever it is, you'll have a chance to request it and we'll go with where the votes are!\nBefore we even get to the crowd production stage, the focus of the funding will be on creating a High Definition Master that will allow an HD Blu-Ray and DVD version of the film with Japanese and English subtitles. \nIn addition, we'll focus on getting as many on-disc extras as possible - whether we need to create some extra features or liberate some from Japan.  If you look at the French release for example, it's very sparse as at the time many of the extras were locked away from international release.\nWe also have more than enough art assets to create some nice art cards to go in the package too!\nAdditional funding will also be prioritised for an English dub of the film. If more funds are raised, we will then move on to crowd production and get all the extra extras you'd like to see!\nA very good question! Often mentioned in the same sentence as the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, Sunao Katabuchi cut his teeth working under the great man himself. He also trained in Studio Telecom by veterans such as Isao Takahata, Yoshifumi Kond\u014d, Kazuhide Tomonaka et Yasuo \u014ctsuka\nThis history and experience can be clearly seen in Mai Mai Miracle, capturing the same love of background art and stories that highlight the joys of childhood.\nDuring his career, Sunao Katabuchi worked for Studio Telecom, Studio Ghibli, Studio 4\u00b0C, Madhouse and more lately Mappa. He has contributed such works as Sherlock Holmes, Trapp Family Story, Little Women II, Memories, Darkstalkers, Chobits, Monster, Tenjo Tenge.\nSunao Katabuchi is also known for directing the acclaimed anime TV series Black Lagoon as well as the movie Princess Arete.\nMADHOUSE Inc. is synonymous with quality and was founded by ex Mushi Pro members; Masao Maruyama, Osamu Dezaki, Rintaro, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri. \nThe studio became synonymous with great animated television and theatrical works including Ninja Scroll, Death Note, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Black Lagoon, Chobits, Redline and many more works beyond that!\nThe level of quality at the studio has always remained consistent and this is reflected in Mai Mai Miracle.\nThis is a film about growing up above anything else and while there's plenty of charm in the film for children - arguably the best audience for this is adults if the Japanese theatrical performance is anything to go by!\nDid you know that although targeted initially as a children's film, it was only when the animation team themselves started pushing the film to friends, family and passers by that it found a strong audience?  \nIn an amazing reversal of the normal this lead to a strong run of sold out screenings in cinemas across Japan, with a run of around seven months after it entered cinemas!\nSimply put, this film has something for everyone! In a similar fashion to the grand tradition of Studio Ghibli productions, this is a family friendly film that easily finds a fan base with adults - whether they're watching it with a younger audience or not. \nTL;DR - If you love beautiful animation and great story telling, you'll find something to like about Mai Mai Miracle!  \nThe rewards are primarily focused on bringing you the best product options possible for an older title as this is. With that in mind, we\u2019ve worked out rewards ranging from sub-only stream to a neat collector\u2019s set. Please check the reward level details to the right of this page as there\u2019s plenty more!\nWe've learned through hard experience though that it is best to promise based on the maximum deadlines than try to chance it.\nFor the Collectors Edition and Artbook - depending how much you make us work based on Crowd Production - we estimate a latest date of October  2014, but we hope to have it done much sooner of course!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've sharpened our teeth on the last year preparing home entertainment titles so the only risk is that we need the support of you, the backers to make a US and UK release the best one possible. This is not the kind of film that normally receives a dub for example and that is critical to reaching the wider market this film really deserves in both countries.\n\nThe funds raised by the campaign will ensure Mai Mai Miracle is made available to US fans especially and will allow us to release the film in high quality and visually alluring packaging - something that reflects how much we love this film.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 790, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alltheanime/mai-mai-miracle", "project_name": "Mai Mai Miracle"}}, {"backer": "Brian S.", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Kickstarter campaign might be over, but you can still support this game on our website.\nA first-person, open world, realistic RPG that will take you to Medieval Europe in a time of great upheaval and strife.

All crafting occurs in-game, using clever mini-games, rather than boring, soulless menus.\nYou will not find any dragons, half-naked Elven warriors, or wizards in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. At no point will you have to collect seven pieces of a legendary magic staff to defeat an ancient evil bent on destroying the world with an army of demons. We think there are enough such games out there.\nWe want to bring you a strong story rooted in the height of the Middle Ages, brought to life in all its glory. So what is Kingdom Come: Deliverance? Think of it as Braveheart: The Game. Majestic castles, armored knights, large, open field battles, and political intrigue set in a vast, emergent world. We want to make the experience as authentic as possible \u2013 real-world locations, real castles that don\u2019t look like something from Disneyland, period-accurate armors and costumes, combat and fencing systems designed in collaboration with the most knowledgeable, skillful swordsmen around, and a story based on actual, historic events.\nAll this, on a foundation built capably upon the solid game mechanics of a true, hardcore RPG \u2013 nonlinear quests with multiple solutions, branching dialogue choices with points of no return, several roles to play (warrior, bard, thief), a mountain of different stats, skills, perks, and ultimate character customization details (including 4 layers of clothing and armor in 16 equippable slots), as well as alchemy and crafting professions, the need to sleep and eat to stay healthy\u2026even food that goes bad if it sits in your inventory for too long!\nWe\u2019re mixing the freedom and mechanics of Skyrim, the setting of Mount and Blade, the storytelling styles of The Witcher and Red Dead Redemption, and the tough combat dynamics of Dark Souls into a single, gorgeous package. You could say we\u2019d like to give ArmA (a franchise many of us worked on) an RPG makeover, streamlining the systems and controls and polishing the overarching world while keeping the unique, genuine feeling of its action and environments. Interested?\nOur tale is based on historical events and takes place in 15th century Europe.\nThe year is 1403, and it is most certainly not the best of times. The old king is dead and his heir is weak. The new king\u2019s brother, hungry for power allies himself with a faction of the nobility that sees this moment as an opportunity for advancement, kidnaps the king, invading the country with an army of his own to plunder this defenseless land. The aristocracy is divided between which side to support. Civil war is coming...\nThe hero\nIn the midst of this plunder and chaos, a son of a blacksmith will emerge as a hero. His home destroyed and his family murdered by the invading army, he must redeem his failure to protect those he loved and set things right again. Avenging the dead, safeguarding the kingdom\u2019s rightful ruler, and restoring order will prove no small feat for our adventurer. But beware - this is not a fantasy fairytale, and you are not the chosen one! This will be a tough, dirty job that only a champion with enough wits and strength will survive.\nFreedom of choice\nYour character is defined by your choices. Your abilities and stats grow depending on what you do. You decide how you want to appear. Every quest can be solved in multiple ways. Branched dialogue trees grant you the freedom to express yourself. Your reputation is based on your choices, and every choice you make carries appropriate consequences. There are no class restrictions, you can do anything you want to.\nStand tall as a brave knight in powerful armor, going it alone or finding allies to lead into battle. Complete quests with brute force. Intimidate and threaten your enemies. Be confident, arrogant, or righteous.\nSneak behind enemy lines as an invisible thief and assassinate the enemy. Stab. Snipe. Strangle from behind. Resolve difficult situations as an invisible phantom, stealing important evidence and threatening people to get information.\nWin hearts as a popular bard, persuading nobles with your silver tongue and convincing them to fight one another. Use your wits rather than your muscles to get the job done. Share drinks with people, be the funny guy everyone likes\u2026 and then stab your rivals in the back when they least expect it.\nWe\u2019re not trying to create the biggest game ever; we want to concentrate on quality rather than quantity. Instead of 200 generic dungeons, we\u2019d like to focus on just a few, crafting each one as something unique, memorable, and special. Our world is large, but again, the focus is on creating a natural, organic space, not one so overpopulated (find out more about this in our blog, here). The same philosophy applies to quests. We don\u2019t want to inundate players with an insane amount of quests, but rather ensure that those we have are rich in detail, with multiple solutions (including non-violent approaches, where appropriate) suiting different play styles and making an impact on the world.\nDeath to the tired clich\u00e9s!\nSick of killing rats in the basement? Or being treated like a messenger, transporting stuff from point A to point B? So are we! That\u2019s why our quests are different. Play as a medieval investigator searching for a mass murderer, lay siege to a bandit fort with an army at your back, experience epic battles between armored knights, interrogate, bribe, threaten, love, help, fight\u2026 It\u2019s up to you to decide what to do. There are multiple ways to finish every quest - use your sword, quick fingers, or your wit.\nBranching dialogue\nConversation is an integral aspect of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, just as important as combat and just as difficult. It isn\u2019t possible to absent-mindedly click through every dialogue option. Your time to make decisions is limited, your choices affect your relationships with others, and you cannot take back what you say. Just like in real life, you have to think carefully about what you say to whom.\nSkill-based mini-games\nAlmost everything that can be turned into a game will be playable \u2013 and that extends to crafting, as well. Blacksmithing doesn\u2019t happen in menus but rather with a hammer at a forge. These mini-games are skill-based and affected by the player\u2019s stats. You\u2019ll be able to forge, sharpen, and repair weapons, create potions and ointments through alchemy, pick locks and pockets, distill alcohol, and prepare food.\nFreedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want\nThe exploration of the world is free. If you don\u2019t want to play the main quest line, it will \u201cwait\u201d for you, and you can go about exploring the world and doing other stuff \u2013 side quests, random events, hunting, crafting, small side stories, and much more. A giant world based on beautiful, real-world locations\nCryengine allows us to quickly create huge areas of landscape. The world covers approx. 9 sq km2 (3.5 sq. miles), with a sprawling city, vast forests, majestic castles, and dozens of villages and hamlets devastated by war. Of course, there will also be underground locations to discover, like mines, secret passages, and catacombs.\nEmergent Gameplay\nOur world is a living, breathing, and COMPLEX ecosystem, ready to be toyed with. Everything happens for a reason, every character has his/her daily routine, and every routine can be affected by the player. Characters are able to react properly to all player actions and adjust their routines to them.\nAdvanced reputation and law system\nThe world will organically react to your deeds. NPCs will report your crimes to authorities, who will punish you for your crimes accordingly, either with a fine, time in jail, or by subjecting you to the stocks or torture. Crime will affect economics and NPC behavior; people will get suspicious or aggressive after unresolved crimes. Your reputation will spread by word of mouth.\nCreating intriguing, enjoyable, first-person melee combat systems has been a real challenge for developers. It's hard to mix easy, intuitive controls with a first-person view and sufficient variety of moves. Many have tried and failed.\nOur combat mechanics are the most challenging feature of our game. They\u2019re based on actual 15th century techniques and designed in cooperation with medieval martial arts experts to be as authentic as possible. The controls are as intuitive as in first-person shooters and, thanks to a few tricks, we have a large amount of different moves and combos. On top of that, the whole thing is based on real-time physics and inverse kinematics, so when you hit something, your hands and weapon, not just your target, react accordingly, which is something that was not possible on last-gen hardware.\nWeapons\nYou can specialize in different fighting styles and weapon classes and will constantly learn new moves and techniques, as well as unlock new weapons and armors. Every weapon has its own uses, pros, and cons. The sword is universal, but weak against plate armor; hammers are ideal against plate armor, but weak against sword; the longsword is strong, but slow, and cannot be used from horseback, etc.\nWe will have several weapon classes: swords, longswords, daggers, sabers, axes, hammers, shields, bows, and crossbows.\nBattles and castle sieges\nYou are no superhero - fighting multiple enemies at the same time is very difficult. It is often a good idea to have allies at your side (and, at times, a lot of them). Our goal is to have as many characters in fights as possible and to offer players big battles and castle sieges to take part in. Not many battles, mind you - more like one or two in the first act. For us, a battle is a climax, not a \u2018wow\u2019 moment that needs to happen every two minutes. The precise scope of these battles and the amount of characters on screen are still things we are evaluating \u2013 they are complicated feats to pull off even on next-gen hardware.\nHorses\nHorses are your primary means of transportation in our sprawling world, but you can fight from horseback, as well. War horses can be used as living weapons with special moves and attacks (strafing, running backwards, several different kicks, etc.). Horses also serve as a secondary inventory for the player. We\u2019ll have three types of horses in-game (courser, destrier, rouncey), and each offers different abilities, stats, skills, and perks. Your steed levels up on its own throughout the journey, and even comes with five slots for armor and attachments.\nWhat would a role-playing game be without character development and customization? Your character in Kingdom Come: Deliverance will have STATS (Strength, Speed, Agility, Vitality, and Speech), CONDITIONS (Stamina, Health, Hunger, and Sleep), SKILLS (Swordsmanship, Archery, Alchemy, and many others), and PERKS (special combat moves, crafting abilities, or varying advantages). Conditions change as you become injured, exhausted, etc. Stats and skills will increase when you use them. Perks can be unlocked or learned. Stats and conditions can be temporarily or permanently modified by alchemy. You must also eat and sleep - you need to keep your character alive, after all!\nCharacter customization\nThanks to our clothing system, you can create the ultimate armored knight. We have 20 slots for weapons, clothes, and attachments, as well as 4 layers of clothing or armor on every character. That\u2019s a lot of customization options! Different types of armor are effective against different weapons. Your clothes and their state affect your charisma and reputation, which, in turn, influence NPC reactions toward you. They also affect your visibility and the noise you produce, which affect your stealth skills.\nSince we are going to self-publish the game and are asking for the help of the community, we are also willing to give something back and develop the game with the community.\nWhat does it mean? In about 6 months, we will release an early build of the game, with one smaller location (village and a part of the countryside) where you will be able to test core mechanics of the game. We will start with the basic mechanics (interaction with the world, inventory, map, NPC cycles) and we will constantly update this build with new features as we progress with the development (dialogues, bows, hunting, crafting, combat, horses). This is the access to Alpha version of the game and it will be available to all tiers from the Baron onwards.\nWhen the game is in Beta stage, we will release the full game beta as Early Access on PC (or any other platform where it\u2019s going to be possible) for all backers up from the Knight Tier.\nOur backers can influence the development, help us improve the game, and give us feedback about our game mechanics.\nWe are using Cryengine to power our game. It\u2019s a powerful, out-of-the-box toolset that runs on all major platforms and allows us to concentrate on the game instead of technology. It's been used to create cutting-edge games like the Crysis trilogy and Ryse, as well as the crowd-funded project Star Citizen. Cryengine affords us with unparalleled macro and micro details, including unlimited viewing distance, HD textures on all objects, and a functional day/night cycle with varying weather patterns, all set in a vast, beautifully lit, seamless world, free of load times.\nOn top of that, we are developing our own proprietary RPG-MAKING TOOLS for easy development of this and any future content, including custom support for game design, animations, branching dialogue, clothing definitions, etc. We plan to release these tools to the modding community.\nWe plan to release the game on all major platforms: PC, Mac, Linux and next-gen consoles. You will be free to choose any platform the game will be released on as your reward. Regarding Early Access to the game, at the moment we can guarantee it only on PC, however we will do our best to make it available on as many other platforms as possible.\nAs a studio, Warhorse may be new to this industry, but the people behind it are not. Our team has worked on games like Mafia, Mafia 2, ArmA,  Operation Flashpoint, Crysis 3, and Forza Horizon, to name a few. Most of us have worked together in the past, so we know each other well. As of now, we have about thirty people on staff, which is, of course, not enough to make the kind of large RPG we have in mind in any timely fashion. Ideally, we\u2019d like to grow our studio to about 75 people for a project of this nature.\nMost of us have experience working on open world games (Mafia, Flashpoint), so we\u2019re already quite familiar with the typical challenges, roadblocks, and potential pitfalls that come with their development. We want to avoid the common mistakes that can bog down a project of this nature, and that starts with having a clear vision, detailed design, mature technology, efficient internal processes, and an experienced team.\n\nSpecifically, our plan asks for another 1,000 months of manpower, which means we need another 20 months to finish the game (this includes a six-month period for tuning and testing). We also believe that direct input from the community will help us a lot, allowing us to create an experience that people actually want to play, and we\u2019re currently devising ways to make transparent our development process to Kickstarter backers, as well as non-investors still interested in the final product.\nIf you\u2019d like to learn a little more about our attitude as a company and as game makers, we invite you to take a look at our blog. In addition, below you\u2019ll find a little information about some of our key team leaders:\nDan V\u00e1vra\nDirector and Design Lead for Mafia, Designer and Screen Writer for Mafia II. Over a decade of industry experience, starting as a 2D artist on 16-bit computers. Nominated for a Game Developers Choice Award for Excellence in Writing for Mafia. Mafia won Game of the Year and Best Screenplay awards in a number of countries and has an 89.5% score on GameRankings. Dan\u2019s games have sold more than 5 million copies combined. He also contributed to Hidden & Dangerous, among other projects.\nMartin Kl\u00edma\nThe author of fantasy pen-and-paper RPG Dragon's Lair. In 1997, Martin founded ALTAR Interactive as an Executive Producer. After releasing Fish Fillets in 1997, the studio created the real-time strategy game Original War three years later. Martin later moved to Codemasters in the UK to work on Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising.\nViktor Bocan\nDesigner and screenwriter of computer games for 17+ years. Started with self-published text games for Atari 800 and then he worked as a lead designer in Bohemia Interactive (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, OFP: Resistance). Later Viktor helped to produce ArmA, a spiritual successor of Operation Flashpoint, and then worked in 2K Czech on new, not yet announced title. In his spare time, Viktor creates games for 'smaller' platforms, including Nintendo DS, XBL, iOS, etc.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Blaho\nTomas was a Senior Graphics Programmer at Illusion Softworks (later 2K Czech), where he worked on multiple games, including Mafia 1 & Mafia 2 and Hidden & Dangerous 2. After finishing Top Spin 4 for 2K Czech, he moved on to Playground Games in the UK, working as Senior Graphics Programmer on Forza Horizon. He has a great deal of experience with development on non-PC platforms, having worked on Dreamcast, PS2, Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, and iOS.\nRoman Zawada\nOne of the most accomplished 3D artists in our country. Roman started at Bohemia Interactive working on Operation Flashpoint and later ArmA. He then moved to 2K Czech to work on Mafia 2, and later to Crytek to work on Crysis 3. His intimate knowledge of CryEngine is especially valuable to our current project.\nTo find out more about our team, you can visit us on Facebook or visit our web. You can also follow our YouTube channel.\n After seeing our trailer, you might ask: \u201cwhy are we here? This is a big, expensive game that\u2019s sure to cost a lot of money, right? Does no major publisher want it? This sounds suspicious.\u201d The answer to those questions might surprise you.\nWarhorse is a comparatively small studio. We now have about thirty people, and it took us more than eighteen months to develop what you've just seen. All this time, we\u2019ve been funded by a private investor, to the tune of almost 1.5 million dollars in total. We hope the product you\u2019ve seen reflects that.\nOur plan was to develop a prototype, pitch it to publishers, and finish development with the subsequent money. We tried to do it that way (and you can read about our experiences on our blog), but in essence, even though everybody we met commended our work, praised our game\u2019s visuals, and believed in our ability to deliver, negotiations would inevitably hit a dead end at the point where the publishers' marketing departments got involved. Why?\n\"Your game is too niche. There\u2019s no magic. People want wizards and dragons.\"\nWe beg to differ. The response from players has always been great. We think gamers like history \u2013 look at the success of Total War, Assassin's Creed, Mount and Blade, and Red Dead Redemption. There is no medieval first-person RPG out there, but it does not necessarily follow that nobody wants one - only that there is no easy box for marketing to pigeonhole it in.\nOur investor is strong and capable of funding the complete development of our project. But he does not follow the game industry very closely, and needs proof that publishers and marketers are wrong about our game - that you are indeed interested in a mature, medieval RPG that emphasizes freedom and authenticity. And so we stand, as a studio, at a crossroads. Either those naysayers are right, and there truly is no desire for the game we are making, or we are right. Either way, we think Kickstarter is a great way to find out.\nThe sum we are asking for is about ten percent of our total budget; for our investor, however, it is proof that there is real demand for the game, and that there is a point to keeping it funded. Every extra dollar will allow us to make the final product that much better because it means more money for development and more support from our investor.\nShould our Kickstarter campaign fail, it will mean that we were wrong, that there is no interest to play a game with the atmosphere of Braveheart, and that we will have to start considering working on some mobile MMO, because that's where the money is these days (or so everybody tells us). We are, however, positive that our instincts are right.\nSo help us to make our vision a reality. Help us to make not the 176th free-to-play mobile RPG MMO Elven village-builder with DIAMONDS\u2122, but to make the kind of unique, engaging experience we think you\u2019d like to play.\nForum access & badge: You will be able to post on our forums with your unique Kickstarter backer's badge.\nDigital copy of the game: You will be able to download and play a copy of Act I of our game.\nDigital manual, Soundtrack, Making-of video: You will get PDF copy of the game manual, complete game soundtrack in mp3, and permanent link for streaming video of our making-of documentary.\nBoxed copy of the game: You will receive your own copy of Act I in standard DVD box.\nDigipak copy of the game (w/soundtrack, making-of video and manual): You will receive your own copy of Act I in a nice digipak box. This box will also contain soundtrack CD and DVD with the making-of video, as well as a printed manual.\nCollector's edition box: This will be an exquisite collector's box edition that will take a place of pride in your collection.\nT-Shirt: CE will contain a T-shirt with Kingdom Come: Deliverance motifs.\nArt book: CE will contain a 100+ pages art book printed on quality stock paper, with artworks for the game.\nPoster/Signed poster: CE will contain a 24\" x 36\" full color poster of the game. In higher tiers this poster will be signed by members of the development team.\nDice: CE will contain a set for playing authentic medieval precursor to computer games.\nCommemorative coin: CE will contain unique coin with original design, stamped in limited quantity for our backers. In lower tiers, the coin will be made of brass; for higher levels, it will be made of sterling silver.\nAction figure: Your CE will include a quality die-cast 6\" action figure of Henry, Kingdom Come: Deliverance lead character.\nActs II & III: You will be able to download Act II or II & III of Kingdom Come: Deliverance if and when they are released. We assume that it will take us nine months to develop Act II and further nine months for Act III. Please note that we cannot guarantee developing these Acts; while it is our best intention to do so at this moment, circumstances beyond our control may force us to alter our plans.\nIn-game Calvary memorial (crucifix): The world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is dotted with small memorial crosses \u2013 small stone or wooden crucifixes on a stone plinth. The plinth carries an inscription that can include your name.\nIn-game Conciliatory cross: Similar to the Calvary memorial above, but smaller and less conspicuous. These crosses were usually put up on places where a crime has occurred, as a gesture of reconciliation. The cross will carry your name.\nIn-game Church painting: Every town or village in Kingdom Come: Deliverance will have a church, sometimes two. You face can appear in one of them as the face of a saint, or some other figure, on paintings inside.\nIn-game Statue: We shall create a statue of a saint of your choice and endow him or her with your likeness. The statue will be a prominent feature of one of the in-game churches.\nCopper engraving: This will be an original, numbered, 6\" x 8\" print made from copper plate in limited quantity. It will feature a motif from the game.\nAlpha access: You will in-effect become part of our development team, getting access to the earliest barely playable version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Your comments and observations will help to shape the game.\nBeta access: This is similar to Early access on Steam. We are hoping we will be able to use the Steam platform itself.\nSword: You will receive hand made, forged, one-handed sword. It will be sharpened and ready for battle. This is not a toy!\nShield: This will be hand-decorated shield adorned with coat-of-arms of a noble family related to the events within the game.\nGuided tour: We will treat you to a two day trip through the real-world locations that served as models for the places within the game. We shall have a professional archaeologist/historian to guide you and explain everything and you will be able to get to places that are normally off limits.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRPGs are big games with complex, layered mechanisms and components, perhaps more so than any other genre out there. They are definitely complicated to create, and there are many risks involved in their development. We\u2019ve tried to minimize those risks by selecting proven technology and assembling a strong team with proven experience shipping open world and AAA games.\n\nThe biggest risk for us would be falling behind schedule and releasing the game later than we planned. We\u2019ve constructed a carefully laid-out strategy to prevent such an outcome, complete with detailed game documentation, clearly defined milestones to achieve, etc. But video games require a great deal of R&D - especially ones that want to innovate - and no one can predict for all potential possibilities or problems during such a process. Production delays unfortunately happen all too often in our industry.\n\nOur most resource-intensive features are our combat and large-scale battle systems. These are mechanics we\u2019re implementing in ways in which few people on our staff have much direct, prior experience, and there are risks associated with that. We may run into implementation issues in executing those systems, requiring us to work around them.\n\nThe good thing for us is that we have strong financial backing, which greatly mitigates any chance that we will run out of money before completing our project, even if unexpected obstacles arise during development. Moreover, in the potential event we\u2019re forced by such time constraints to remove some features from the game in order to meet our release date and stay on-budget, we would most likely be able to include those features through a later patch or further acts of the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #77", "update_userinfo": "Modding Tools Released", "update_content": "Modding Tools Released\nYes, these are the tools, we used to create Henry's world!

For some, time is a crucial part of life - a motivator, a judge, a measuring stick. For others, time serves a more fluid purpose, more of a suggestion than anything else.\nWe developed the Perspective Series to explore the way time is experienced by different people in different ways.\nAfter the success of our first two clocks, we wanted to push things further, creating a series of clocks reflecting the different ways that people deal with the issues they encounter in their everyday lives.\nSome people are systematic, approaching challenges step by step. Other view things from different angles, while some people focus directly on the target. We wanted to create a clock for just about everyone.\nWhy the Clocks Are Unique\nThe design of the Perspective Series focuses on the hands instead of the clock face, creating shapes that give meaning to the movement itself. \nThe hands are structures of straight white lines that rotate over a plain black face, resembling a drawing study on a canvas. Each face has a slightly different ending, emphasizing its own character.\nUsing only the simplest form of straight lines and exploring the way they interact, the appearance of the clocks varies from minimal to complex configuration.\nD Clock - Different Angles:\nTimelapse (one minute)\nThis clock is a constant reminder that objects look different, depending on a point of view. The point of view has a tremendous impact on how it\u2019s read. Someone standing directly in front of the clock will see straight lines. But from the side, another dimension of complex shapes is revealed. Not only that the hands have another physical dimension, but they also interact with each other, with one passing through the other.\nHands: Hour, Minute, Seconds (3)\nDiameter: 220mm / 8.6 Inch\nK Clock - Systematic Movement:\nTimelapse (one hour)\nThe hour and minute hands of the K clock are two complex assemblies of straight lines. The lines converge to a point that represents the location of the hand. In the course of one hour, each endpoint of one hand connects to each endpoint of the other. These encounters recur 143 times in a full cycle of the clock.\nHands: Hour, Minute (2)\nDiameter: 200mm / 7.9 Inch\nP Clock - Burst from Inside:\nTimelapse (one minute)\nUnlike ordinary clocks, this clock displays time as a complex three dimensional composition, bursting from the center. The hands are outline of 3D prisms that go beyond the regular face plane. The base of the P clock is cone-shaped in order to house the hands.\nHands: Hour, Minute, Seconds (3)\nDiameter: 245mm / 9.6 Inc\nV Clock - Focus on Target:\nTimelapse (one hour)\nArtists in the renaissance period developed the vanishing points as a tool to represent the world with perspective. Using vanishing points, this clock gives the viewer two focal points \u2013 the hour and the minute.\nHands: Hour, Minute (2)\nDiameter: 250mm / 9.8 Inch\nZ Clock - Wander Around:\nTimelapse (one hour)\nThe hands of the Z clock are lines that wander around the face of the clock. This arrow shape of the hands creates many overlaps of lines, displaying various intriguing compositions.\nHands: Hour, Minute (2)\nDiameter: 220mm / 8.6 Inch\nWe\u2019ve been preoccupied and fascinated with time for several years, constantly exploring different, interesting ways to express the minutes, hours, seconds that pass us by and dictate the flow of our lives.\nOur two previous Kickstarter projects were really successful, and helped us create the Manifold and Lithe clocks. Now we\u2019re looking for backers to help us fund our newest, most exciting project yet.\nThis series was conceived 8 months ago, while we were playing with metal rods (we have plenty in our studio). We arranged them in various compositions and saw how they interact with each other. The goal was to create a \"usual hand\" representation without being usual.\nIn this process we discovered that every model had its own character, and after countless tries, variations and proportions, the best 5 designs emerged. Each has a strong aesthetic and playful presence, as well as representing a different approach to life.\nIn pursuit of the right material for the clocks hands, we started with welded steel, but the welding was not very accurate, and the hands were too heavy in some of the models. We tried carbon rods, that were light, but could not joint well. We realized that injected plastic would give the best results. Many models made out of ABS were 3D printed, until the right balance between structure and weight was achieved.\nWe teamed up with a very large clock hands manufacturer that will produce the hands. We've already worked with him in the past, when he injected other plastic hands.\nThe clocks movement is a sweep movements - it creates a continuous gentle motion, and known for its reliability.\nThe main reason we turn to Kickstarter to help fund this project is that there are 5 different molds for the hands, and 3 more for the bases. We believe these clocks function as a series and didn't want to pass on any one of them. That's why we need your help - the costs of tooling, and moreover, the MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) of each clock are high.\nThe tooling phase can begin once the funding goal is reached - making molds and testing various samples until the quality we're looking for is met. Simultaneously, we'll send the survey to backers in order to get exact quantities of each clock and shipping information. After all preparations are finalized, production is supposed to begin in March.\nRewards will ship in May. We took a safety margin because problems and delays are inevitable when dealing with so many variables.\nYour support is highly appreciated. We thank you for giving us the opportunity to present these products that we've been working on for a long time.\nWe'd also like to thank all the wonderful people for helping with this project:\nElinor Portnoy - countless models and hours of concept and design.\nYochai Dabush - After Effects master.\nDan Moukatel - Wicked graphic and package design.\nTamar Tal - wonderful photography.\nKedem Shinar - providing a great location.\nWe hope you like our Kickstarter project.

HOWEVER...\n www.JapaneseTheGame.com\nI lived in Japan a decade ago and, through hard experience and hard work, I learned how the Japanese Language works.  I had taken college classes, tried to study on my own, and even moved there, but I was still struggling to say everyday things like \"That soup was delicious,\" and \"Actually, I'm too short to play football.\" Eventually I got a good grasp of the language and got rather fluent, but I felt terrible for the other English speakers who were new or never seemed to catch on.\nWhen I got back to the States, I saw that a lot of good programs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur were available for a whole lot of money and people were still buying them up, spending hundreds of dollars at a time. But what if you don't always have a computer or CD player with you, or what if you want to learn with friends? And learning certainly shouldn't be so expensive. So to make it easier for the rest of the world I cracked the code for you, breaking almost the whole language down into manageable concepts. It took a lot of time and failed attempts, but after six years of rethinking, simplifying, and revising, I've created this card game that makes learning Japanese fun, fast, and easy!\n The cards in this game have Japanese words on them, along with markings that help you put them together in complete, grammatically correct sentences every time. Here's an example sentence:\n These cards come together to make a sentence that means...\n...\"The cat sniffs.\"  Swap out nouns, verbs, etc., to make your own sentences.  Be smart or silly and have fun with it.\nAs you can see, the cards have English letters on them, so you don't have to know Japanese at all to play a fun, fast game and learn some Japanese vocabulary and grammar almost by accident. Here's a close-up sample of the card for Dog:\nThe First Edition will have fresh background images. A dog, for instance.\nThis game puts the language right in your hands, helping you learn at your own pace.  Even my 11-year-old cousin is pretty good at it. I want everyone who is interested in learning Japanese to be able to take a deck anywhere they go and share the Japanese language with their friends.\nFor students who happen to be learning the Japanese writing systems of Hiragana and Katakana or Kanji, this game is an excellent help. In fact, if you're studying Japanese, there's even a pledge level at which I will turn your vocabulary list into a deck! And you can get enough for your whole class, or have them join you in a pledge to pool your resources and benefit the whole class.  Each deck has 52 cards, which is enough for two players (because you need at least 25 cards per player).  The 36-cards expansions enable one more player to join the game while bringing you more vocabulary, grammar, and even strategic dimensions!\nThe game is played like a live-action version of Mad Libs.  The cards in your hand are words, and you use them to make sentences.  You can play with a shared deck or players can bring their own.\nSolo Mode - Build sentences to get to 20 points in as few turns as you can, or go until you've used every card in the deck!\nCollaborative Mode - Get together with a friend or two or three and take turns building, expanding, splitting, and re-building each other's sentences!\nCompetitive Mode - Every card you play can increase the number of points you have on your side of the table.  You can use the points you place on your side within a given turn to eliminate opponents' cards--end even complete sentences--to set them back while at the same time you make progress toward your own goal!  \nI've made a rather silly, roughly 10 minute-long video of this mode, which you can watch below. (You can get the feel of the game in about three minutes, though.) It may be a little loud depending on your computer.\nPLAY\n\nI believe breaking down the language barrier will increase love and understanding between Japanese and English-speaking cultures.  There is so much to be gained by bringing our world-leading cultures together in friendship.  So if you love games, love Japan, or love languages, it's time to learn, grow, and increase peace!\nI'm doing this Kickstarter to pay for printing the first complete edition of the game and six expansions: Japanese Food, Anime, Travel, Business, Monsters (Kaij\u016b), and an intermediate-level Conjugations Expansion!\nIf you want, the limited Sh\u014dgun backer level allows you to pick what words you want to be in a deck or expansion!  Do you want words to form a certain phrase?  \"You are my sunshine.\" \"What does the fox say?\" \"I am the one who knocks.\" \"Objection overruled.\"  You can have it!  The more funds we raise, the more cards we can put in the core deck and the more expansions we can afford to print.\nI will also use some funds to make a truly excellent series of free Japanese Instruction videos.  These lessons and question-and-answer sessions will allow learners to get more familiar with the language, regardless of whether they've even heard of the game.  Naturally I'll make videos for the game as well, but I feel like I've been given this amazing gift and I really want to share it.  For this, I'll need better video and sound equipment.\nThis is the updated break-down for the backer levels available in this Kickstarter:\nNote: The $1 Donation pledge level now gets a Print-and-Play First Edition Core Deck instead of the Beta because of a stretch goal we met.\nI hope this chart makes sense.

That will make the Japanese teachers happy, along with everyone you meet if you should venture to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nUNLOCKED!! $20,000: Everyone who backs at $10 or more will get a Permanent Subscription to a Print-and-Play PDF of every Core Deck and expansions we ever make!  This will never happen outside of this Kickstarter campaign, so take advantage!\nUNLOCKED!! $25,000: I will add a blank sheet of cards to the Print-and-Play so you can make cards to suit your own vocabulary goals!\nUNLOCKED!! $42,000: I will make a Business Expansion with words like Office, Commute, Co-worker, etc.  More details here.\nUNLOCKED!! Reaching 1,000 Facebook Likes has unlocked a Free Android and iPhone app that reads your cards and speaks the native Japanese pronunciation!\nUNLOCKED!!: $64,000: We will get a MONSTERS (Kaijuu) EXPANSION with art by professional Japanese monster artist Micah Hornung. More details here.\nUNLOCKED!!: $85,000: I will create a Conjugations Expansion Deck so you can learn how to put verbs and adjectives into other tenses and forms like past, command, negative, likely, apparent, and others. This will train your brain to use more sophisticated Japanese. You might consider this an intermediate pack.\nUNLOCKED!!: $96,000: Unlocked the Daimy\u014d backer level with one Core Deck, all six Expansions, and a free Japanese: The Game Two-piece Card Box. It's 9'' long (28cm) so it will hold all the cards in the backer level along with a few more expansions as you continue to build your vocabulary.  The card box is also  available as an add-on; you just increase your pledge amount by $12 to get one.\nUNLOCKED!!: 2500 Backers: Everyone will get four more cards in the Core Deck AND all the $1 Backers get the First Edition Print-and-play instead of just the Beta. (They don't get a Print-and-Play of all the Expansions, but every level $10 and up does.)\nFINAL ROLLING STRETCH GOAL!!: I increased the deck by one card at $110,000 and will continue to add one card for every $2,000 we raise thereafter.\nI thank you all for your tremendous support! This has been a runaway success and I can't wait to deliver your cards and make more Japanese: The Game throughout 2014 and hopefully forever!\nThis game has a lot of expansion potential to help you learn the language and culture of Japan, so I'm going to keep going on this. Now that we've funded successfully, I'm going to fulfill this project and go on to make expansions for People, Numbers, Grade-level Kanji sets, The JPLT and BJT regulation langauage tests, and more!\nI'd love to hear from you, even if you don't back my project, about why you did or didn't, and I'll be contacting every one of you who backs me to thank you personally because this is something we're doing together.  It's a big undertaking, but I've already done most of the work and with your backing, we'll be able to make this a great game for anyone to study Japanese in groups in a way that's fun and engaging... so we can share the excitement of learning a new language and culture with everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenge: Creation logistics\nIt takes a lot of work hours to get new vocabulary turned into cards. With the Teacher and Professor contributor levels, fulfillment times are extended beyond the normal project for this reason.

Maybe you have bought a PC from EBay but the seller forgot to tell you the password. Or maybe you are helping to fix a friends PC and they cannot remember the administrator password they set when they first bought it. Enter the Password reset Key.\nUsing the key you can boot the PC into a special admin mode that allows you to view all of the user accounts and reset any password. Quickly regain control of the PC and get back to work.\nWhile other utilities exist to help with this activity they are often complex to setup, require technical knowledge to use and need a working computer with an internet connection before you can get started.\nThe Password Reset Key can be attached to your key ring so you never need to worry about losing access again. The Password Reset Key has been tested with a wide range of PCs that support booting from USB. The following operating systems are supported for password reset:\n\u00b7Windows NT 4\n\u00b7Windows XP\n\u00b7Windows Vista\n\u00b7Windows 7\n\u00b7Windows 8\n\u00b7Windows 8.1\nSome viruses make changes to your system to prevent access. Use the Password Reset Key and you anti-virus scanner to regain access and clean up after an infection.\nFrom the video above you can see that the Password Reset Key can reset a password in less than 60 seconds. It\u2019s simple to use, easy to carry and works with all current versions of Windows.\nHow It Works\nThe Password Reset Tool is a USB Skeleton Key for any Windows computer. Simply turn off the computer, plug in the key and turn it back on again. On some machines you may need to press a button such as Del, F10 or F12 to access a start-up menu. From here you will be able to select to \"Boot from USB\". Once the Password reset Tool appears simply follow the instructions below:\nOnce the USB Stick has booted this splash screen will be presented. Click \"I Agree\" to accept the terms of use.\nThe tool automatically scans all local disks for a copy of Windows. This will often NOT be the C: disk. Select the Windows installation (on a normal system there will usually only be one.)\nA list of users will appear in the box. Click on the name of the user whose password you would like to reset.\nClick the Reset Password button to remove the password for that user. A dialog will appear to confirm that both the LanMan and NTLM password hashes have been blanked.\nOn some systems there are additional security features that will reset the password back to a value during boot up. In this case a user account can be cloned. A cloned user is identical to the original user except for the username and password. Therefore the same profile is used on the file system and the same group memberships apply.\nAfter clicking the Clone User button enter a new name for the cloned user.\nThe cloned user will now appear in the list of users.\nYou will need to reset the password of the cloned user as it will have copied the password of the original user.\nFor any user on the system you can view additional information by clicking the User Info button.\nWhat Is Left To Do?\nWhile an image has been created that allows duplication of the key onto blanks there is still the challenge of creating a universal installer that will allow people to create a Password Reset Key on their own USB thumb drives. In order to support multiple hardware types and disk sizes an imaging approach is not sufficient. With your funding additional development will be undertaken to create a universal installer that will transfer the software to your own key and write the necessary bootloader code to the disk to allow it to boot. This will be non-destructive so you will be able to write this to a key that already contains data (although we still strongly recommend that you make a backup before attempting something like this.)\nOther Projects you May Like\nHaving started this Kickstarter I have come across some other interesting projects that you may also be interested in.

We're going to offer custom sets of business cards and wedding invitation postcards at bulk prices, with the ability to upload your own unique design on the back!\nImage by pixelfucks.com\nCool, but tell me more about Gifpop!\nHi! We're Rachel Binx and Sha Hwang, and we love animated gifs. We love them on reddit, we love them in the news, and we love all the beautiful gif art that's being made. We love how they capture small, wonderful, funny, or amazing moments and make them something we can share. And we love gifs so much, we're building Gifpop to take gifs out of the screen and into the real world.\nWell, but, how?\nWe've been working over the past several months on a way to print animated gifs onto lenticular cards. Each sheet of lenticular film has many tiny lenses, which allow us to print around ten frames of animation onto small cards. It's been around since the 1940s, but has mostly been used for children's toys. But we think that gifs and lenticular printing are two simple, lo-fi technologies that were made for each other.\nWe've been doing tons of test prints with different materials and different types of film, and have started working with a lenticular manufacturer that will allow us to do custom prints. We've also been building out a website where you can upload a gif, select a portion to print, and order a gif card in a variety of sizes. We've been sharing and showing these gif cards among friends \u2014 it's been really fun, and addictive to play with. And now we're finally got everything in place to do our first big production run, and we need your help.\nAwesome. What do you need?\nWe're hoping to raise enough money to put in a big production run order, pay for the costs of packaging, and finish the website. We'd love to be able to make Gifpop real so we can start making custom, physical gif cards for everyone, and in the process, bring a little bit of the magic and wonder of the internet into the real world.\nOver the past few years, lots of talented artists and designers have been exploring animated gifs as a medium. So in addition to offering the ability to print your own favorite gifs, we're also excited about the opportunity to support the growing community of gif artists. As designers ourselves, we understand the constant struggle between creating work you're passionate about and paying the bills. So for our Kickstarter, we're working with three of our favorite artists on doing small runs of their work.\nWe're working with the incredible Mr. Div, the amazing 89-A, and the awesome Davidope. These artists are paving the way for incredible, haunting, and whimsical new forms and explorations, and we couldn't be prouder to be collaborating with them on Gifpop.\nWe see these artists as pioneers, and we are not interested in treating digital art as a second class citizen the way it often is in the art world. We're also not interested in the standard gallery model of revenue splitting. That's why most of our revenue from the art prints we will be selling will go directly back to the artists \u2014 we'd much, much rather artists profit from us than the other way around.\nWe'll say it again: Gifpop is a product, but it is also a provocation. We want to explore and build new avenues for digital artists to make a living, and we want to do this in public.\nWhat do I get?\nSo. In backing this Kickstarter you'll not only support our dream of Gifpop, but you'll also be supporting the exciting community of artists exploring an emerging medium. And in return, we've got some pretty exciting rewards lined up.\nEarly Access\nAs a backer you will receive our deepest thanks, and we'll owe you a seriously hand-stinging high five. But you'll also receive early access to the Gifpop site. We'll listen to your feedback, you'll receive gif-ridden updates from us as we finish the site, and you'll be the first in line for ordering cards. But it gets even better from there!\nYour Own Custom GIF Cards\nIf you back $12 or more, you'll not only receive early access, but you'll also be a part of our initial production run of Gifpop. You'll be able to send us your gif, edit the frames you want printed, and choose either a 3\"x3\", business card, or postcard sized gif card. For simplicity international backers will pay shipping later, and don't have to add any extra to their pledges now!\nAn early test with just two frames of travel photos\nArtist Prints\nA test print in action by Davidope\nSome small, low resolution test prints of artist gifs.\nAt our highest reward tiers, you'll be a part of a special group of backers to receive prints from the three gif artists we are working with: Mr. Div, 89-A, and Davidope. Their work is amazing and we will be doing several test runs of different pieces of theirs to get the best quality prints. All artist prints will be offered on high quality 40 LPI lenticular sheets \u2014 they'll be gorgeous. \nGifs for Days\nAt the Gifs for Days reward tier, you'll be a part of the lucky club that gets 3\"x3\" artist gifs in the mail, once a month, for six whole months! We're working with 89-A, Mr. Div, Patakk, pixelfucks, hateplow, and lulinternet on bringing their gifs to life for this reward:\nDonor Wall\nAnd finally, in addition custom gif cards and artist prints, if you pledge $30 or more we'll include you on a big thank you wall on Gifpop! For $30 and up you'll get a 50px by 50px square on our wall of thanks to put any (appropriate) gif that you'd like, and have it link back to your own site. For $100 and up, you'll have a 100px by 100px space to flaunt your favorite gif!\nSweet. Wait, who are you?\nOh right! We're Rachel Binx and Sha Hwang, two designer/programmers who have recently moved out of San Francisco to New York. We love making tools on the internet that turn into physical things you can hold. Previously, we built the custom jewelry company Meshu, that allows people to make unique jewelry based on places they've been.\nMore about us:\nRachel (@rachelbinx) studied math and art history before discovering the world of data visualization. Before jumping into Meshu/Gifpop, Rachel worked at Stamen as a design technologist. There she worked on creating realtime data visualizations for clients such as MTV, Facebook, and Oprah. When not sitting in front of her computer, she likes to be out traveling the world, or at home hanging out with her cockatiel.\nSha (@shashashasha) studied and worked in architecture before falling into data visualization and the world of designing for the web. Sha also worked at Stamen, where he worked on projects for CNN, MTV, Adobe, and Flickr. After Stamen Sha cofounded a startup called Movity, which focused on data visualization and cities. Movity was acquired by Trulia, where Sha worked for the past two years building maps and visualizations. Now independent, Sha continues to explore the intersection of interaction, information, and fabrication.\nCredits\nWe wouldn't have been able to get this far without the help of our friend Tess Aquarium, who has helped us level up our fulfillment skills. We also owe a lot to the talented Paul Trillo, whose inventive work and ideas inspired a lot of how we ended up shooting our own Kickstarter video. Our music in the video was from the lovely Podington Bear. And let's have another shout out to the amazing Mr. Div, 89-A, Davidope, Pixelfucks, lulinternet, Patakk, and Hateplow! They've all been so kind, and we deeply appreciate working with them on Gifpop. Finally, we'd also like to thank Golan Levin, who gave the world the phrase \"not just a product, but a provocation\" and whose work has been deeply influential to both of us.\nThank you so much for checking us out! For more updates, follow us on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, or sign up for our mailing list.\nThanks for tuning in!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing is hard, and luckily we have found a local manufacturer that is flexible enough for us to do the custom printing that Gifpop relies on. If the scale of orders or quality of results becomes an issue we would need to switch manufacturers. Lucky for us, our manufacturer has years of experience working at much larger scales than we are aiming for with Gifpop, so we don't expect to encounter any problems. \n\nSoftware engineering is also hard, and though we are skilled frontend developers (we live and breathe Javascript), we are not seasoned backend developers. Should the tools we build not scale or be poorly structured we would face delays in either hiring programmers to help or fixing things ourselves. On the other hand, we have many friends who are talented backend engineers who have been very supportive of us, and have been keeping us on track as we have built out the site. \n\nFulfillment, too, is often an invisible challenge many Kickstarters (and any company!) face. We do however have over a year of experience with fulfillment with our project Meshu, and have been working with the excellent Tess Aquarium to ship orders domestically and internationally. Shipping cards will be far easier than shipping boxes of jewelry, and so we are confident that we are up to the task.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Discount Codes and New Artists on Gifpop!", "update_content": "Hey, Kickstarter!

After the unexpected success of our first fundraiser, we have spent the past few years brainstorming what we could do next. We wanted to do something more challenging and with greater lasting impact.\nOur first Kickstarter was really a proof-of-concept: would it be possible to to hire an orchestra, record a bunch of famous music, and release it all for free? Would anyone care? \nThe response was amazing, positive, and far beyond what we expected with our original $11,000 goal. Since it has been a few years, here is a sample of what we heard the first time around.\nNow we are asking for your help to move beyond proof of concept and tackle something much more ambitious. We believe this project goes beyond just classical music, and encapsulates what the open culture movement is all about. \nWe are asking for your help to free the life's work of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. \nWhy now?\nIt is 164 years after Chopin's death. His music is well into the public domain, yet most people consume it as if it were still copyrighted: from CDs, iTunes, or Youtube videos (many of which are copyrighted). \nWe think Chopin deserves better. \n\nWhy Chopin?\nMost public domain music is limited to the classical genre (1920's and before), but the goals of Musopen are not limited to one genre, so we want an artist that has broad appeal. Among the most enduringly popular composers, Chopin stands out. He also composed an amount of music which is manageable for us to record. If we had chosen Mozart, our funding goal would have to have another zero at the end. \nWe also wanted an artist that would be versatile, enabling many projects to make use of his music.\nIt doesn't hurt that he just celebrated his 200th birthday three years ago. This is a belated gift but one we think he would appreciate.\nOur goals\n1.To preserve indefinitely and without question everything Chopin created. To release his music for free, both in 1080p video and 24 bit 192kHz audio. This is roughly 245 pieces.\n2. To ask (and try to answer): how should one preserve and experience the life's work of a person? A static list of links  does not do justice to the immense gravity of Chopin's artistic output. We have a few ideas which we address below.\nOur Performers\nWe have some incredible musicians lined up. One or two have even placed in one of the most prestigious piano competitions in the world. Our musicians are students at some of the best conservatories in the world, professors, professional pianists, and recording artists. \nChopin Musicians\nStretch Goals\n$85,000 - We will hire composers to create and release new music into the public domain. This will not be limited to any genre, and all composers will be asked to donate their submissions so that we will benefit from much more public domain music.\n$90,000 - Music request system - A system to match artists with requests for music recordings. Collaborative bidding so costs are distributed to all interested.\n$95,000 - Desktop streaming radio app (like Pandora but lossless, and includes commercial content).\n$100,000 - Videos of all performances in 1080p HD + behind the scenes + interviews from the musicians.\n$135,000 - We will live-stream the performances.\n$200,000 - We will pair all recordings with free public performances. Let's turn free recordings into free civic art.\n\n\nBut wait, there's more...\nGiven the response of our first Kickstarter, we want to aim higher than a single set of recordings. Kickstarter is an amazing platform for creative projects, but we want to leverage the energy and support everyone showed last time as an opportunity to indefinitely sustain Musopen, so that it independently contributes music on an ongoing basis. \nAll backers for this project at the $50 level and above will get a \"Supporting Membership\" free for one year. Our goal is that you consider continuing your support after this first year, so that we can reach 1,000 supporting members. This is the minimum required for Musopen to be able to do a recording project every year. This goal removes our dependence on one-off projects and allows us the best of all possible worlds: ambitious and innovative projects via Kickstarter, regular contributions to our library, and music educational materials from our base of supporting members.\n\nNow on to the good stuff...Rewards\nWe want to use this project as an opportunity to see how we could explore Chopin's life. So we've designed our prizes to be the manifestation of our quest to represent and explore Chopin's life and his work. \nPrint. Chopin - The Listener's Companion. \nThe only thing better than listening to a Chopin Nocturne is following along to the music with images of his first edition prints, notes about the piece from the performer, and things to listen for. This listener's guide will contain a mix of all the above and more.\nThe guide will be printed on high quality paper using letter-press printing.\nDigital. Chopin: A Life In Music\nWe believe that a digital experience, optimized for a tablet, will be the best way to explore Chopin's music. We are thinking of this app as an extended version of the booklet, including all Chopin's music, original first edition scores, sheet music, videos, and notes about each piece.\nIn addition to shuffling through his music and recordings, we will create an interactive timeline so you can explore what he wrote, when, what was happening to him (and the world) at the time, and listen to his music while doing so. We'll also include information about his contemporaries, so you'll learn who was around at the time and what they thought of each other.\nThe app will be developed by Musopen's in-house dev team including our lead developers Ivan Anishchuk and Eugene Naydenov. They've built Musopen.org and a beta version of this iPad app.\n\nE-book. Classical Music - An Introduction\nGiven that we are asking for you to back a project about classical music, and many of you may not be very familiar with this genre, we'd like to create a primer to ease you into what makes this music so special, what to listen for, and how to listen to classical music.\nMusic\nAll of Chopin's music will be recorded in lossless FLAC, MP3, M4a in 24 bit 192kHz. As with the previous Kickstarter, this music will be hosted for free on Musopen.org, Box.com, Archive.org, and seeded via a BitTorrent link.\nVideos\n1080p videos of every performance + behind the scenes footage + interviews of the performers.\nPlease consider supporting us and spreading the word. We would love to tackle this with your help, and have it be just the beginning of what we can create together.\n- Aaron + The Musopen Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven our previous experience doing this, we're confident that this project will go smoothly, much more so than the previous. We will vet each individual musician and will hire 2 musicians for every single recording.\n\nThe biggest risk I see is the ability to include the two piano concerti. Given the level of quality we want this music to be at, we will be attempting the concerti last, which means either not including it or going with a cheaper orchestra. This all depends on how much we ultimately raise. It's not an easy choice for us, but otherwise it's almost necessary to have two 75k projects, one for the solo piano work and one for the concerti.

Sadly, Erwin\u2019s convictions had more legs to stand on than his research did, and evidence for his theories remains incomplete in the wake of his tragic death. This 120-page, full-color book unifies the fragments of research to which he dedicated his life: a life cut short by a freak cliff-related accident.\nFrom Erwin Hobbes' Manuscript:\n\"I believe that for as long as there have been cats, there have been half-cats. In the ballet of feline DNA hides the potential for an astonishing mutation, revered by some, toured as spectacle by others. There is no reckoning for the countless specimens drowned at birth for their unexpected, perhaps unsettling, appearance. But what of the few that survived?  This book will attempt a retelling of their story\u2014their origins in the shadows of biology and history. \nThe groundwork for this volume was laid by the great, but doubtlessly troubled, mind of James Alexander, and collected over time by his estate. His work was wrought with speculation and bias, and I will try to separate the good science from the bad. For this reason I call it a partial history.\"\nStretch Goals: Cloth-Bound Hardcover, Gilt Edges and Ribbon.\nA stretch goal is a funding target set beyond the original Kickstarter goal.

Where we in the US grew up with tales of witches, werewolves, zombies, bogeymen and the like, kids in Japan grew up with an entirely different taxonomy of beasts and monsters. Unfortunately, there is a serious lack of good information on them in English, and my goal is to help fix that. Because yokai are just too darn cool to go unnoticed!\nIn this book, I will cover a broad range of yokai, from ghosts, to demons, to transformed humans. Some of them are so silly you will laugh out load, while others are so scary you will have nightmares. I have been gathering and translating them for years, and this represents a large chunk of the work I have been doing recently. The stories have been gathered from Japanese friends and family, libraries, and other Japanese sources, many of which have never been translated into English before (as far as I know, anyway).\nWith Night Parade, one of the most frequent requests was to include more stories with the yokai. For that reason, in addition to the yokai bestiary, the later part of this book will also include a number of famous yokai legends, featuring some very well-known ghosts and monsters from Japanese folklore.\nWhat is the plan for making this book?\nAs with Night Parade, I am using traditional Japanese myths as my source material for this book. As I go through the process of translating, sketching, inking, and painting each picture, I will send out frequent Kickstarter updates so you can follow the entire process as the book gets made.\nThis will be a fairly long process, and I expect to be finished in a year's time. However, during that time you'll get to see my sketches, the drawing process, and read all about the yokai as the book unfolds; so you'll never feel too far from the project.\nHow will the money be used?\nAs with Night Parade, I plan to use Amazon's CreateSpace program to self-publish this book. The cost to set up a book with CreateSpace is not terribly high, but costs do add up. In addition, I will be hiring a professional editor to ensure that this book is free of typos and mistakes. The majority of the money will go into printing and shipping costs for the rewards, and the remainder will be used to offset the cost of writing, illustrating, and doing the layout of the book. As I don't have a a large publishing company to back me up financially, I need your patronage for support to make this book possible.\nThank you so much for visiting my project. I hope you'll support me and help make this dream come true!\nBest wishes,\nMatthew Meyer\nAbout the Rewards\nStretch Goals\nStretch goals have been added! See the graphics below for details!\nThe Ebook\nThe ebook will be as faithful a representation of the paperback as possible, with a linked table of contents for easy navigation. As with Night Parade, I plan on making the book in Kindle format, but for those who don't have Kindles it can easily be converted into any format you want with free software (such as calibre). The book will be DRM-free, and I will set up a private download link on my website when the book is finished.\nThe Postcard Set\nThe postcards will be 4x6, full color images of the most popular yokai from the book. Due to the cost of printing different images, I can only offer 10 at the moment. However, I hope to increase the number of postcards depending on how many people order them. Update: backers at this level, and anyone who chooses the Yokai Mailer as an add-on to their pledge will now receive two copies of each postcard, for a total of 20!\nPaperbacks\nPaperbacks will be 7x10 inches, and roughly 1 inch thick, and are printed in the USA by CreateSpace. Night Parade was 226 pages in the end, and I expect this to be roughly the same size. The book quality they produce is top-notch -- these are trade paperbacks, a quality grade above the typical mass market paperback, and have the feel of a nicely made comic anthology or graphic novel. Signed by the author.\nHardcovers\nThe hardcovers will be done as a special by-request opion with CreateSpace. They are library-cloth covers with a dust jacket that looks identical to the paperback. The hardcovers won't be available on Amazon or anywhere else for purchase after the Kickstarter, so they are a valuable collector's edition. Signed by the author.\nLike it's predecessor, The Hour of Meeting Evil Spirits is first and foremost an art book. It is printed in high quality trade paperback format, full color, and made to be as beautiful as it is interesting. Everything from the fonts, to the cover, to the look of the paper inside is designed to be part of the experience. To get an idea of what the physical book will look like, these are some photos of my previous book, The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons:\nFine Art Prints\nThe fine art prints will be printing using a gicl\u00e9e printer on presentation-quality textured watercolor paper. They are printed using special inks that are guaranteed to last over 200 years (I haven't tested that myself). They are signed by the artist and come in a black, acid-free mat, sealed in a protective clear polybag. The mat's dimensions are 11x14 inches, and the image window is roughly 8x10. To get a feeling for the size of the prints, check out the picture of the strange man below. \u2193\nsigned, matted, fine art prints\nOriginal Paintings\nOnly a limited number of original paintings will be available due to the time involved in making them. These are hand-drawn and painted recreations of the illustrations in the book. These are oban size, a popular ukiyo-e format that is roughly 10x15 inches.\nThe Bookmark\nThe bookmark is an option stretch-goal add-on. For an additional $10 to your pledge, you will get a beautiful, high quality 2.5 x 8 inch bookmark, custom-designed specifically for this book. It will feature a tassel, and additional illustrations on both sides to complement the artwork in the book. The perfect collectible for your collector's edition!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge in making this book is the amount of time it will take. Those of you who have been following my blog, or who back my previous project will probably remember that there were long stretches where I was finishing a painting every single day and averaging less than 4 hours of sleep per night. I'm confident that I have more than enough time to finish the project on schedule, but there is always the risk than unforeseen circumstances might delay the project by a few weeks.

Welcome to our Third Kickstarter Project!\nThis project was inspired by our previous Kickstarter Project, called \"Origin Series\". For those of you who don't know, that project was about a series of art prints inspired by your favorite comic book characters, and how they came to be. Thankfully, the project was a bigger success than we had hoped for, which inspired lots of new print designs! We started the project with 6 prints, and after 30 days we ended up with 13 different designs because of the stretch goals we had reached! Here is a link if you would like to see the previous project!\nDuring, and after our last project, we received a lot of feedback about it. What most of the messages had in common was that everyone wanted a way to get all these prints in one place, because 13 prints requires a lot of wall space! People really wanted a way to be able to get all of them in one place, and that is why we came up with the idea of a book, and we added some new prints for your viewing pleasure!!\nThis project will help fund the printing of a \"Origin Series\" art book, and the new prints!

Please read below because there are a few things you need to know about shipping for you!\nFor this project, because these packages are to be delivered during the holiday season (when traffic more than triples), it is really important to use a method where shipping is guaranteed faster than a regular season! Which is why, the fees added for International Shipment are for us to be able to pay for Priority International Mail, which it's delivery expectancy is within 8-12 days to make sure all packages will arrive on time for the holidays, that is for all tiers EXCEPT \"The Side-Kick Tier\", that tier has First Class Mail postage while using United States Postal Service.\n\nFirst Class Mail is the most economical form of shipment (that can take up to 3-5 weeks depending on where you are). The reason why that tier is the only one different is because it's the smallest order. Otherwise shipping in Priority International Mail starts at $30, no matter how light it is! So, to keep costs down for you, at least that tier, we decided to keep it at FCM. If you wish to upgrade any shipping order to arrive even faster, please make sure to contact us through this Kickstarter to see what your options are.\nWe apologize for this inconvenience. Please, be aware that we have absolutely NO influence in shipping prices, and arrival times. We do our best to send your package as soon as possible to you, while using the safest, fastest way for you to get your order in time for your holiday celebrations! If you have any other questions, please let us know by sending us a message through Kickstarter. Thank you so much!\n\nThank you for checking out our project!\nHelp us meet our goals by either pledging or sharing our project through your social media!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk of this project is the book printing part of it.\n\nWe tried to pick a book printing company that is dependalbe, affordable, high in quality, with a fast turn around time.The criteria we set for ourselves seemed impossibly high! However, we think we have found one with all of those attributes! Unfortunately, there is always a chance where something can go wrong with our vendor, and they delay the printing process. In which case, it would delay the shipping time to us, therefore delaying the shipping time for you. If something were to happen we would let you know right away, and we would work our hardest to get all the package out the door as soon as possible.\n\nWe plan to ship everything as soon as we have it, so everyone can get their package in time for the holiday season.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Newest The Ninjabot Kickstarter Project is NOW LIVE!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone!\n\nWe wanted to share our latest art print project with you!

In the two years since we completed that film, we have pondered the question many audiences asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s next!? \nWe aim to answer that question with our follow-up effort. \"Maker\" is a feature-length documentary that looks into the current maker movement in America \u2013 a new wave of Do-It-Yourself and Do-It-Together fueled by passion and powered by the advent of new technologies. \nThe \u201cMaker Movement\u201d, sometimes called the \"Third Industrial Revolution,\" subverts traditional manufacturing by building on innovative concepts such as open source, local manufacturing, crowd funding, and digital fabrication. Breaking the hobbyist movement stereotype, \"Maker\" delves deep into this ecosystem of design and manufacturing in the Internet era. The film explores the ideas, tools, and personalities that are driving the Maker Movement \u2013 and returns with a timely snapshot of one of the transforming influences of the current age. \nWe have conducted extensive interviews of key figures behind headline-making projects, daily practitioners, and observers of the movement, in our effort to piece together what this ecosystem looks like, and present insights on how it can impact society, culture and the economy in the U.S., and the world.\nAbout the team\nProducers: Yu-Hsiu Yang / Iris Lai \nDirected & shot by Mu-Ming Tsai \nAdditional Photography: Bianca Yeh \nEditor: Mu-Ming Tsai / Iris Lai\nMarketing: Sin Wang \nAdvisor: Navi Radjou / Melissa Huang \nKickstarter trailer music by Jacob Montague\nInterviewees (in alphabetical order)\nAlec Foege: Author of \"The Tinkerers\" \nA.

Through our own savings we have finished shooting in San Francisco, Arizona and New York; gathering a wealth of informative interviews and interesting footage. Currently we have finished the initial production phase and are moving on to post-production. \nOur initial funds been able to get us a little over halfway to the final product, but at this point we still have to do editing, scoring, sound mixing, color correction, and graphics in order to finish the film. Then we will need to move into the distribution phase where promotion and marketing expenses will also require a significant amount of funds. \nYour support will help cover these expenses and increase the production value of the final product; ultimately assisting in spreading the exciting and inspiring ideas of the maker movement to as many as possible.\nOur Backer Map\nWe will be marking the countries/areas of our supportive backers, to show the world which countries are involved in supporting our project.\nFor our Backers with no countries listed, do not fret!

But in the context of all this weirdness we strove to write the catchiest songs possible. \n\n\"Reality vs. The Optimist\" was our first full length album for Eyeball Records ( My Chemical Romance, Thursday, and Murder By Death).

While I am there, I will be traveling extensively and documenting the places that I visit and people that I meet using the antiquated wet plate collodion process. In addition to traveling around Nagoya and its surrounding areas, I will also be traveling to Kyoto and possibly Nara, where I intend to build upon the project. In addition to these trips, I plan on starting the 88 temple pilgrimage around Shikoku (no more than three or four days this time around), although I haven't yet decided if I will attempt to do wet plate on this part of the trip as it seems logistically difficult since travel is traditionally all on foot. Further trips will be dependent upon whether or not I meet my funding goal. However, these initial three places are so rich in culture that I could easily spend all my time investigating them alone.\nA loose itinerary is as follows:\n11/19 Arrive in Nagoya\n11/25~11/28 Kyoto\n11/29 Nara\n12/1~12/3 88 temple pilgrimage\n12/5 Hiroshima\n12/07~12/08 Tokyo to possibly meet up with other wet plate practitioners in Japan\n12/09 Miyakejima\n12/10~12/23 Nagoya and surrounding areas\n12/24 Depart Nagoya\nWet Plate Collodion in Japan\nThe wet plate collodion process was one of the first widespread photographic processes and was introduced by Frederic Scott Archer in 1851. What makes wet plate photography so complicated is that the whole process must happen in a period of about 15 minutes or so before the plate dries, hence the \"wet plate\". This means the darkroom and chemicals must travel with the photographer at all times. \nAfter Commodore Perry opened up Japan from isolation with his black ships in the 1850s, an influx of wet plate photographic images started rolling out from both foreign and Japanese photographers (many can be seen in Terry Bennett's excellent book Photography in Japan) detailing daily life in Japan and the people of the era. Using the wet plate collodion process will allow me to take on the role of adventurer and to rekindle the spirit of exploration and the sense of wonder that the first photographers allowed into Japan must have felt. Using a vintage large format field camera and period lens will allow me to capture Japan in the same way it was first captured nearly 160 years ago.\nBudget\nAfter the fees that both Kickstarter and Amazon take (9% in total), and after the costs of the rewards themselves, most of the costs will be related to procuring the chemicals needed for the process and sending them to Japan. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the chemicals they must be shipped via hazardous mail which adds another level of cost. Then there is also the cost of the plates themselves. The aluminum material I will buy precut with a protective, peel-off layer, but I also need glass plates for ambrotypes. To make the most of the funds I will buy sheets of glass and cut them all down to size myself. I will also need to buy grain alcohol and distilled water continuously, the latter of which is used for mixing the chemicals, stopping the developer, and washing the plates. The distilled water is not that expensive in individual units, but the cost adds up quickly because the process requires so much of it.\nOn the Japan side, most of my costs outside of travel are covered. I will be staying with my wife's family, for the most part food will be taken care of, and I will have access to the family car when it is not needed by others in the family (excluding gas costs). \nOutside of the chemical costs, any extra money will be used for traveling and accommodations outside of Nagoya. I will be partly traveling at a time when Seishun 18 tickets are available, and I intend to travel in this way for at least part of the trip. In some cases, it might go toward renting a compact car for ease of moving the chemicals around to hard to reach locations. Additionally, I will be bringing a tent, so whenever possible I plan on camping to stretch funds as far as they will go which will allow me to travel more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe chemicals themselves are the biggest challenge. They are sensitive to heat, cold, humidity, and whether or not you had your morning coffee two days before. Luckily for me, the temperature in the central region in Japan in November/December isn't so extreme. However, I will attempt to mitigate these risks by heating the chemicals indoors when possible or using heating pads (called \"kairo\" in Japanese), etc. as necessary and also bringing along extra backup chemicals just in case.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "A quick reminder", "update_content": "TABIBITO very nearly tripled its goal thanks to your generous contributions and support.

We're not done yet!\nCreating an Archive of Video Game History\nToday most people's hunt for information begins and ends with a Google search.  I want to create a video game museum that caters to this new information reality by making an online collection that can be freely visited by anyone, at any time, through a simple internet search.\nThe Vanamo Online Game Museum is an effort to create an archive of video game history with high-quality, high-resolution pictures with detailed descriptions.  The museum's photos will be in the public domain, making them free for anyone to use in other media, like articles and videos.  They will also be placed on Wikipedia, making them highly visible and readily available, along with vastly improving the quality of their associated articles.\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to improve the quality of images and information about video game systems one finds on the internet.  The funds will go toward building a physical archive and collection of hardware that, in turn, becomes an online gallery of high quality pictures - a virtual museum.  After the pictures have been taken, I'll be working with the NYU Game Center and The International Center for the History of Electronic Games to help house and display the physical collection.\nThis Kickstarter greatly expands and completes work that I have already begun, which can be seen on my Video Game Wikimedia page.  I'm turning to your for help in expanding the reach and depth of my work, because I believe others can benefit from this work, and share my appreciation for a virtual video game collection of this quality and care.\nClick to see an example of the resolution and quality of my images. This image is also a Featured Image on Wikipedia and was Picture of the Day on July 7th, 2013\nMuseum Concept Gallery\nThese concepts show what can be accomplished with funding: a clean and simple site with in-depth information and free, hi-res media.\nAn easy-to-navigate, top-down design.\nEach console page contains categories like: history, controllers, supplied components, accessories, technical info, media type and console variants.\nThe final level: individual pages for console controllers, components and accessories\nWhy Help?\nBy participating in this Kickstarter, you are helping the Vanamo Online Game Museum accomplish four significant things:\nConsolidating images of video game consoles and accessories into one comprehensive collection\nMaking new images easy to find through the reach of Wikipedia\nProviding images for free, in a quality that enables reproduction in other media\nIf funding succeeds, Camera RAW files will be available for the first time through the Internet Archive.\nWikipedia is now an essential resource for many, but often its articles have low quality pictures or none at all.  This is because Wikipedia requires that photos uploaded to the site have a free license, basically meaning that the photographer gives up ownership rights to the photo.  This requirement deters almost all good photographers from contributing to WIkipedia, and keeps the overall quality of the photos on the site poor.  The photos from the museum will be in a free license.  I give up the rights to my photos so that they can be shared with the world, and improve the overall quality of the photos that are available to users.\nThe Internet Archive is very excited to be a partner in this project and help make it more expansive.\nThe Challenge\nProperly photographing all existing video game consoles and their accessories is a vast undertaking.  Video game hardware goes back to the '70s and there are over a hundred different consoles and handhelds to capture, some very rare and expensive.  Gathering and cataloging all of these items is both very costly and time consuming.\nProduct photography is a timely process due to cleaning and setting up the shot.  When I take pictures with collectors, I only have a small amount of time to photograph, meaning I have to focus on quick, basic shots.  Owning lets me spend time to create the comprehensive galleries I've been yearning to make.\nThis is the increase in output that funding will achieve.\nA deconstruction photo made capable through owning\nThe Solution - Create My Own Free Archive\nThe simplest and most obvious solution to this problem is to buy the objects I need to photograph.  I would become a curator to a collection of consoles and hardware that would, in turn, become a digital archive available freely on Wikimedia.  However, the cost of such a collection rapidly places it outside of my means, hence the need for Kickstarter.  Creating my own archive has many benefits.  Owning objects lets me take them apart, clean them and, most importantly, take the time to get the best possible picture.\nThe gallery I'd be able to make through this funding would be much more thorough and extensive than the existing one.  Funding would be a worthwhile investment: I already have the largest and most visible collection of console pictures on the internet; an improvement to my gallery will reach more people than any other gallery.  People come to my gallery when they need photos and need them with a license that they can easily use.  Also, many times the only good photos on the internet of older or rarer consoles are ones I've taken. \nExample of reward designs, designs not final\nSince my photos are free and high quality, they have been frequently used in magazines (Game Informer, Retro Gamer), newspapers, television shows (G4TV, The Colbert Report), YouTube (The Angry Video Game Nerd, Zero Punctuation, RetrowareTV), major blogs (Kotaku, Joystiq, IGN, GameTrailers, The Gameological Society, Wired, Slate, Gamasutra), textbooks and even by official sources like Mark Cerny (hardware designer of the PS4) when addressing Gamelab 2013 about the history of PS4 development.\nA small collection of the many examples showing people/sites who rely on my images\nThere is no doubt about the reach, importance and visibility of these photos.  There is immense educational and historical value in having these consoles and hardware preserved in a digital state, in pictures that are clean and consistent.  This gallery will also continue to enrich the video game community by providing quality, free media to anyone to use in their own projects.\nHow Is The Money Used?\nAll funds from this Kickstarter will go toward one thing: video game hardware.  It will not be going toward photo equipment or software, only game consoles, controllers, hardware and accessories.\nMoney collected only goes to building an archive of hardware\n\nWhat Am I Looking To Buy?\nA true 100% collection of game hardware is both extremely expensive and probably unattainable, mostly due to things like prototypes or very rare items.  In order to keep my Kickstarter grounded and attainable, I have placed priorities on certain areas of gaming.\nThe original $8,500 funding goal would go toward creating an almost-complete collection of Atari, Sega, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo consoles.  I picked these as the highest priority due to their popularity in my current galleries and on Wikipedia search results.  Since a true collection could reach into the tens of thousands of dollars, I have committed other areas to stretch goals.\nStretch Goals\nThe stretch goals of this Kickstarter are extremely important as they increase the size of the museum and the gallery.  Stretch goals are based on different brand collections, as outlined below.  The most exciting stretch goal is when it goes past $25,000, which means that I can start to get debug and developer consoles.  These are very limited release and generally not well documented, so putting these into a public information museum would be a great benefit to gaming history.\nStretch goals are the only way to make a more complete collection\nThere is no real ceiling to the amount of money that can be used for this project.  The amount of items that could go into such a museum is vast, from color variants to prototypes, that even $100,000 or more could be all directly used for acquisition purposes.\n$9,500 - Vintage consoles (including Magnavox Odyssey)\n$10,500 - PC Engine/TurboGrafx consoles\n$11,500 - Neo Geo consoles\n$12,500 - 3DO & CDi consoles\n$15,000 - Non-American releases (Playdia, FM Towns, etc.)\n$20,000 - Misc. consoles and hardware\n$25,000+ - Debug/developer consoles, prototypes and variants\nWhat Becomes Of The Physical Archive?\nCreating the physical archive is a necessity to create the media galleries, but what happens to it after that?  The last thing I want is such an archive to sit in storage, so I'm working with the NYU Game Centerand The International Center for the History of Electronic Games to help house and display parts of the collection.  These items collected for the museum will be available to students and the community.\n             Direct Hardware Donation\nAll of the funds of this Kickstarter are going to hardware, so any direct donation of hardware allows funds to go even farther.  I would accept anything hardware-based: consoles, add-ons, accessories or controllers.  This can be old or new items, as I'm building the collection from the ground up.  All I ask is that the item be in either good or decent cosmetic condition for photographing; items can be non-working.\nEvery hardware donation helps", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is generally low risk. Successful funding means the ability to buy hardware, and any hardware in my hands will turn into photos. This is work that I've already accomplished in the past, so I'm aware of the time and effort that goes into it.\n\nThere will be some challenge to acquire the items at the price point I have budgeted, but I have experience in being thrifty or getting good deals. There are a few rare items that might take longer to acquire than others, but I'm positive I'll be able to complete the console archive lists I have outlined.\n\nOnce the archive is created, picture taking will begin and will take a few weeks or months for all of the photos to be uploaded. Pictures will be uploaded as they're taken, so the turn around is much faster than most other projects. I'm confident in my ability to deliver on this as it's something that I have accomplished before, so my timetable is based on actual experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Book PDF download link", "update_content": "Hello everyone!

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking.

I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now.

This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this.

He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear. This is no fools errand; you'll be creating (digital) life itself, and thus comes the responsibility to nurture the sad heap until it's of age to brutalize Drifters every moment it can.\nDesign a mid-boss creature\nHave you always wanted an angry spider to lob shells at you? Well we can help bring your vision to life! Together we will build an entire mid-boss encounter, with behavior patterns, chamber layout, the look of the creature and it's rewards. As above, choose attributes wisely.\nT-Shirt Special\nThe $60 tier will net you a snazzy design from Casey Hunt in small, medium, large or XL. This will be available to purchase sometime after the Kickstarter as well, so those who have already donated won't be left without something to wear.\nParty in the city\nYou'll join us (a bunch of goofy independent developers) for a wrap party evening of hangabouts, Smash Brothers (plus other multi-player games) and general raging at Glitch City, the Culver City Indie game space. You'll also receive a hand-signed print, a few high fives, and some great big smiles. Your name will be listed in the credits under the Major Thank-You section. \nReference Sheet\n  Add-Ons\nYou can add extra rewards to your current tier if you so desire (remember, no need to change your tier, just add the amount and we'll see the amount and a note from you during the survey):\nAdd $5 - Digital OST for the game\nAdd $10 - Unlock the Alternate playable Drifter\nAdd $15 - Additional Copy of the Game for any platform\nAdd $30 - Limited run t-shirt (no international yet)\nAdd $35 - SNES style physical box and manual (no international yet)\nAdd $42 - Limited Compact Print (11x14) (no international yet)\nAdd $60 - Printed Softcover Companion Art Book (no international yet)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter months of planning and writing and drawing and programming the vision for the project became vivid and succinct. That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered. Issues will come, as they always do in any long-term project, but I feel thoroughly prepared; I have the proper tools and skills and a large support network through our shared community space Glitch City which is bursting at the seams with excellent developers with vast wells of knowledge and years of experience prototyping, building, and releasing games. I feel incredibly lucky to be tapped into this community and to have such reliable friends willing to lend a hand with resources I may need in the future to complete this game.\n \nI've done what I can to get this far through some rather extreme health struggles, and I don't plan to stop.

I would always take the credit card sleeve out of my wallet, remove my credit card to use it, then return the card to the sleeve and the sleeve to the wallet. The sleeve itself was made of a material that was so thin and so strong that it outlasted several wallets. So I wondered\u2026why not just make a wallet out of the stuff the sleeve is made of?\nTyvek\u00ae is a product of USA and is technically a sheet plastic (HDPE):\nUsed in mailing envelopes and house wrap for its strength to weight ratio\n100% Waterproof\n25% Post-consumer recycled content\n100% Recyclable\nYears later when trying to create my own thin wallet, I returned to Tyvek. I refined the Original wallet by creating over 100 prototypes, learning to sew in the process. Now the MICRO is redesigned from the ground up to still be a fully functional wallet, but with a smaller footprint.\nFeatures\nHybrid ID Window/Slot (As introduced with V2 of Original SlimFold)\nHolds 8-12 Cards (Including interior card pockets)\nMoney pocket holds US, Canadian, Euro (up to 20\u20ac w/o folding) and Pounds (up to 10\u00a3 w/o folding)*\nMeasures 3 15/16in x 2 7/8in (10cm x 7.3cm) when closed and 7 7/8in x 2 7/8in (20cm x 7.3cm) when open\n*Hey!

Here's some of the feedback from customers:\n\"Thanks for such a great wallet. It is amazing how much I can fit in it and it still be so slim. Like carrying everything in a moneyclip or a rubber band, but so much more secure and protected.\" -Bryan (California)\n\"I bought your Gray/Orange slimfold wallet around a year ago and absolutely love it! I have never gone back to a normal since (and don't intend too!).\" -Steve (Australia)\n\"Okay, I've never received a product and then dropped everything to email the company to thank them for their product... so this is a first: W.O.W.

Although I'm an interaction designer now, my original training is in Industrial Design and I've gone through the phases of making a similar product with the creation of the Original and V2 versions of the SlimFold. I've still done tons of prototyping to arrive at the finalized design and be confident enough in it to be eager to get it into your hands.\n\nProduction\nWhile I'll be using the same vendors to produce the MICRO as I've used for the Original SlimFold, there are always risks with relying on any outside suppliers. In the past they have all proven extremely reliable. Having worked with them, I have a good idea of quantities and schedules and will promptly communicate any issues should they arise.\n\nShipping\nI have a fulfillment house in place that I've been using for over a year to ship both domestically and internationally. I know first-hand how overwhelming it can be getting a huge backlog of orders and having to prepare and send all the packages myself. I quickly found a local fulfillment house who is extremely reliable and I'll be using them for this campaign.\n\nLogistics and Communication\nHonestly, this is my first Kickstarter campaign and I don't think there's any way to know about all of the logistics of one without doing one. I'm sure I'll learn a lot along the way. I'll do my best to answer your questions as they come up. Should Kickstarter not provide sufficient tools to manage the project, I may also use something such as backer kit, which would provide me with something of a back-end dashboard to manage things.

We have been severely disappointed about how these concepts have been misunderstood by those residing in the United States. We have been looking for a new means of distributing real authenticity in Akiba culture, sharing it around the entire world. Thus bringing us to three main reasons this project has began. \nReason One: Sharing. We would like overseas otaku, mainly those of North America, to join this project and give us direct opinions. Reason Two: Finances. To create a top quality product, we need fellow comrades to back us up. And finally Reason Three: PR. We, in Akihabara, do not have have strong connections with overseas media. Therefore, we think it'd be meaningful to let you in on this project through this platform known as Kickstarter.\nIcons for use on Twitter and

Its 4x magnification gives your phone's camera close-up powers that you never thought possible and its unique, patented design means that it will fit on any smartphone available today (and tomorrow!) with or without a case.  It is also the only smartphone lens that stores in your wallet so you never leave it behind.  If you take photos with your phone, you need an Easy-Macro!\nTake photos like this with your phone!\n\nProduct History\nSince we launched the original product in 2011, Easy-Macro has been a hit!  Easy-Macro was started by my wife and I after I couldn't find a close-up lens for my smartphone that was convenient to keep with me.  I enjoy taking close-up photos, but I rarely know when I'm going to see something that I want to photograph.  If I don't want to miss a shot, I have to carry the lens with me all of the time.  I also hate carrying extra stuff in my pockets.  I hate it!  No way am I going to carry a bulky lens around with me all of the time and, if I'm not going to carry it all of the time, it will have one predictable fate: getting lost in a drawer of miscellaneous items.\nAfter a bit of thinking, I had it:  a simple objective lens mounted in an elastic band.  This design would fit around any smartphone (no need for a new accessory every time I upgrade my phone!) and be thin enough to fit in the slimmest of wallets without adding noticeable bulk!  All I had to do was make a working prototype.\nA trip to the drug store provided me with all I needed to prove the concept.  There were pieces of material everywhere: hair bands, bracelets, sew-in elastic strips, and the winner: the under-appreciated but trusty office supply rubber band.  The result was amazing!  Not only would this one-of-a-kind macro lens fit any smartphone, it fit every device from an iPod Touch to a 10\" iPad!  The photographic results were equally dramatic.  We had something!  \nSuccess! The First Easy-Macro Prototype.\nReception\nSince 2011, Easy-Macro has received many glowing reviews from the likes of Gizmodo, Wired, DPReview, AndroidPolice, 9to5Mac, MacLife, GottaBeMobile, iPhoneAlley, and the list goes on!  We have several online retailers selling our current version of the product around the world including Photojojo.com and ThinkGeek.com.  When Photojojo debuted Easy-Macro in their online store in 2011, they sold-out of their first 2000 units in just a couple of days and were backordered for 4 months due to the incredible demand! \nMore recently, Lanc\u00f4me Paris has purchased a large quantity of Easy-Macros which they will be using to demonstrate their skincare products' effectiveness at makeup counters worldwide!  Easy-Macro was chosen over all other available macro lenses for smartphones due to its ability to quickly attach to any smartphone (even over a bulky case) in addition to its good looks and ease of use.\nThe original. Over 35,000 produced in 2 years. That's a lot of happy customers!\nWhere Kickstarter Comes In\nFast forward 2 years and over 35,000 Easy-Macros have been produced!  There's only one problem: we can't keep up with demand.\nYou see, every single Easy-Macro is hand-made to exacting standards.  In fact, we throw out about 25% of the units that we make because they do not meet our high expectations for the product.  Production is a difficult and time-consuming task that takes patience and skill.  This is where Kickstarter comes in: through countless hours (and weeks and months) of hand making Easy-Macro, we have developed an updated design that not only retains all of the function and convenience of the original product, it makes it stronger, better looking, and easier to produce!  The new design will also reduce the material wasted on units that do not meet our quality standard.  This is what some might call a win-win-win-win.\nA comparison of our new lens design and the current lens. Edges are highlighted to illustrate the difference. 3x the contact area = 3x the strength!\nThe Next Generation: A custom groove will make assembly a snap!\nA 3D printed test fixture to test different groove designs.\nFinally, our hope is that production will become easy and efficient enough to bring it back to the US where it all started.  My wife and I made the first 10,000 pieces ourselves at our kitchen table, sometimes staying up until 3am to complete orders on time while also working full time.  When no US suppliers would make the product to our standards for a reasonable price, production was moved to China.  After successful funding of the campaign, the assembly work will be offered to US companies once again, including Goodwill Industries.  Beyond their chain of thrift stores, Goodwill hires those that might otherwise not be able to find work, including those with mental and physical impairments.  \nWe need the help of you, our backers, to secure the necessary tooling and minimum order quantity to create a custom lens design that will streamline production and allow us to provide our customers with an even higher quality product at the same affordable retail price of $15.  By backing us on this project, you have a chance to snag the latest and greatest Easy-Macro for only $10; a 33% discount off of the retail price!  Or, pledge $55 and up to get the new-and-improved Easy-Macro, a Limited Edition storage card, and this awesome backers-only t-shirt:\nTotals on the back will be updated to match the actual results of the campaign!\nWhere the Funds Will Go\nWith 2 years of production of the original product under our belts, we know exactly what goes into producing a high quality product for our customers.  While many Kickstarter projects offer amazing new products for much lower funding goals, we understand that quality manufacturers capable of delivering the kind of product our backers expect on time also demand higher prices.  We do not want to begin this project without knowing that we can deliver a quality product on time.  Much of the required expense is based on actual quotes from vendors or costs we have incurred on previous manufacturing such as materials and shipping.\n$4,000 Fees paid to Kickstarter and payment processing\n$6,000 for custom tooling and production equipment\n$8,000 to secure materials for production\n$4,000 for travel to China, if necessary, to oversee initial production\n$10,000 for assembly of the units\n$4,000 for shipping and importing completed units\n$4,000 for shipping individual orders to our backers!\n\nBackers at the $25 level and up get this Limited Edition storage card!\nThe Timeline:\nWith production of 35,000 Easy-Macros under our belts, we are familiar with the timelines realistically required to complete and order of this volume from start to end.  With successful funding of the Kickstarter campaign by September 15th, our backers can expect us to deliver on the following deadline.  \nSeptember 28: The Kickstarter Campaign ends\nSeptember 28: Early Bird Rewards Ship!\nSeptember 28 - November 8: Production of tooling and materials\nNovember 8 - November 29: Assembly of Product\nNovember 30 - December 5: Shipment of goods and sorting for distribution\nDecember 5: Backer Orders Begin Shipping!\nWe plan to use our current overseas vendor for our first order of the new product. This will allow us to begin production as soon as we reach our funding goal.  Even if we are a few weeks away from receipt of funds from the campaign, we will be able to begin the manufacturing on a purchase order as opposed to pre-payment as we have already established a good relationship with the vendor.\nWhy You Should Back Us Today\nEasy-Macro is already the best macro lens you can buy for your smartphone.  Backing our project not only gets you at least 33% off of the retail price, but you will be helping a small business take its flagship product to the next level. This will also be your only chance to snag some exclusive Kickstarter Edition gear!\nThank you for your support and we look forward to producing and even better version of the best macro lens a smartphone could wish for with the help of backers like you! \nQuestions or suggestions?  Send us a message so we can offer our backers the best possible experience!\nBonus Levels!\nAs the project proceeds, we hope to hit a few milestones beyond our funding goal.  If we hit these milestones, we will offer upgrades!\nMilestone 1: If funding reaches $65k, we will produce a run of Easy-Macros with a custom-colored band just for our Kickstarter backers!\nMilestone 2: If funding reaches $75k, we will produce an additional magnification! The original Easy-Macro is 4x, which strikes a great balance between getting close and field of view. We'd love to add a 10-15x lens as well for those situations where you want to get reeeeeeally close!\nMilestone 3: If funding reaches $85k, we will be able to have microfiber pouches made to accompany every new Easy-Macro produced! These pouches will be great for those of you who prefer to keep Easy-Macro in your pocket or loose in your purse among other items rather than in the safety of a card pocket of your wallet.\nFeel free to send us any suggestions you might have on additional bonuses or reward levels and we will consider them!\nA Few Clarifications\nThe $25 reward level includes a special Kickstarter Edition storage card in addition to a new and improved Easy-Macro.  Don't worry, we're not holding out on our bigger backers!\nWhen we hit the $75k stretch goal of creating an additional magnification, that will be in addition to and included with all next generation Easy-Macros.  Help us reach the goal and you get more without any additional pledge!\nMore Examples!\nTake a Photo of Your Dog's Cute Little Nose!\nSee Snowflakes Up-Close!\nSee What Everyday Objects Look Like Up-Close, Like Guitar Strings!\nExplore Nature!\n...and Explore More Nature!\nUS Patent #8,385,004", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of you have been burned before. That great-sounding project that you helped fund fell through after it turned out that the creators didn't fully understand the process of bringing an idea to market. Or maybe you backed a smartphone accessory that requires an app and you're still waiting for the Android version to ship while iPhone users have had theirs for months.\n\nBecause we have been making the original Easy-Macro for over 2 years already, there is actually very little risk for this project. In fact, we have already consulted with several optical experts on the quality of the updated lens design as well as injection molding companies on the ability to produce the new design. Both have been verified and tooling costs are already known. Lens body profiles have been 3D printed over a range of shapes to guarantee the best bond strength between the lens and band. \n\nWith 25,000 pieces made with our current overseas vendor, we know what actual production schedules are and the new design will actually speed up assembly considerably compared to the original product.

Please note:\nThis is the First part of what turned out to be a two-part project. It has to do with the Venetian elegance and Joy of life. It will be followed by a second campaign, with a Dark Venexiana deck, dealing with the obscure side of the city.\n\"Venexiana\"\nThis is how the word \"Veneziana\" is written in the area of Veneto, in northern Italy. It's familiar but at the same time strange, exactly as Venice itself. The most visited and loved city in the world, still keeps her secrets hidden behind the closed doors of the sinking palazzi. Venice is not just a beautiful city. It's an impossible invention of time.\nHere is a wonderful post published by Collector in his blog, referring to the deck but also giving some very interesting information on Venice.\nhttp://playingcardcollector.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/bicycle-venexiana-deck-half-moon-playing-cards/\n\nMy view\nVenice throughout the centuries has been a source of inspiration for numerous artists. From Canaletto\u2019s paintings , to Hugo Pratt\u2019s \u201cCorto Maltese\u201d, and from the Byzantine refugees after the fall of Constantinople in 1452 to the stunned tourists of today, this seducing city has generated and hosted endless dreams.\nEvery person has found something here. Mystery, beauty, elegance, forbidden love, game, crime. All these are elements of the city, incorporated in its\u2019 traditions. Commedia dell\u2019 Arte, the old Italian form of improvised theater, holding hands with the Carnival.\nEndless wealth and power, bearing death and destruction, but also giving birth to immortal monuments of Art and Music.\nIn this deck I tried to depict my vision of the city. It\u2019s inspired by the 18th century period, which had been highly controversial. It was the time when Venice reached a peak in artistic power and elegance but at the same time it was the last century of the \u201cSerenissima\u201d. The Republic of Venice, had already lost the leading role in the sea trade and Napoleon finally conquered the city in 1797, three years before the end of the century.\nHaving all these elements in mind, along with memories of my winter walks in the empty narrow streets, between the sparkling sinking palaces, I have designed this deck.\nI didn\u2019t want to focus only on the Carnival, though it\u2019s a very characteristic aspect of the city. So, for the courts I\u2019m using people in carnival costumes, along with prominent citizens of Venice such as Ludovico Manin, the last Doge, Carlo Goldoni, the great playwriter, Casanova, the notorious womanizer and Antonio Vivaldi, the composer of the \u201cestro armonico\u201d , the \u201cHarmonic Inspiration\u201d .\n\u201cVenexiana\u201d is a dedication, an expression of love and a perpetual promise of return.\nThe deck (UPDATED)\n\"Venexiana\" is a completely custom playing cards deck and every element, from pips to courts, is entirely  designed by me. It will be available in two different tuck cases:The white and the black editions\nVenexiana White Edition\nVenexiana Black edition\n\nStock and finish\nI'm using Bicycle standard stock with magic finish.\n\"Venexiana\" will be a limited edition. It will be printed only once. The number of the decks printed will be determined by the  backers' demands. Of course there may be some decks left which can be sold later but there is not going to be another print.\nThe back\nAce of Spades\nAce of Clubs\nAce of Diamonds\nAce of Hearts\nQueen of Diamonds\nKing of Spades\nJack of Hearts\nQueen of Clubs - Casanova\nJack of Diamonds - Antonio Vivaldi\nJack of Clubs\nKing of Hearts. Lodovico Manin, the last Doge of Venice.\nQueen of Hearts\nCarlo Goldoni - King of Clubs\nJack of Spades - the \"Bauta\"\nKing of Diamonds - a Cardinal\nQueen of Spades - L' assassina\nSpecial rewards\n1 Prints of any court card you prefer. They're printed on fine quality watercolor paper with light resistant inks. Approx. 30cmX20cm.\n2. Uncut sheets, both signed and unsigned.\n3.A wooden box handcrafted by me, containing two decks, signed and unsigned. Made of cherry wood, hand polished with shellac, using the French polish technique.\n4. A very elegant leather bound folder also handcrafted by me, containing high quality prints of all court cards plus the ace of spades, numbered and signed.\nThe folder\n5. The \"Libro d' Oro\"\nThe backers who will choose the \"doge\" pledge, will see their names printed on the special \"libro d' oro\" card which will be inside each deck!\nPlease note:  All rewards which are just decks and unsigned uncut sheets, will ship from the States. All other rewards that involve work from me (including signed decks and uncuts) will ship from Greece. Therefore, the shipping costs are included in the pledge amount, no matter the destination.\n\nStretch goal\nIf the project reaches $17000, Venexiana will get its custom seal. I think this deck deserves it, so let's seal it properly!\n\n                         Add-ons\nFrom the list below, you can choose any item(s) you wish, just by adding the corresponding amount to your pledge.

The backers who will choose to add 4 or more coins will receive them in a beautiful old-times leather pouch, handcrafted by me, free of charge!\nThe pouch\nT-Shirts\nMixing elements from the \"Venexiana\" artwork, t-shirts come in three colors: White, Grey, Black. \nThe designs:\nTD#1\nTD#2\nTD#3\nSilk printing technique, available in S, M, L, XL.\nThe goal\nBeyond the obvious goal of funding the production of this deck, your support will be a great start in making \"Half Moon Playing Cards\" brand a reality.\nI can only do that with your help.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe end of the world will definitely put this project at risk. \n\nBut seriously, I've done exhausting research regarding production and shipment, before I launch it, \nI also had the help of people who are in the playing cards world and their experience and advice is invaluable.

Our game is based on 90's Tokusatsu TV series, like \"Power Rangers\", \"Changeman\" or... \"Captain Planet And The Planeteers\". Yep, any group of 3 or 5, each with different powers, whose union makes a special weapon appear to defeat their enemies. In this case, Captain Planet himself. =)\nIn Chroma Squad you'll see tons of references, including riders Tokusatsu, metal heroes, solo heroes, and every bit of our geeks 80 and 90's culture. So, get ready for a experience full of color!\nThe main story of our game is about a group of stuntmen that decide to make their own sentai TV studio. You become their manager, hiring actors, purchasing awesome cameras, and making everything explode with your special effects. But their adventure becomes so exciting, that they start thinking that everything is actually real.\nHere's a quick list of what you can do in the game:\nHire and customize your actors. \nChoose their jumpsuit color and their roles on battle.\nSelect skills and make your own build of abilities. Each color has its own skill tree of possibilities.\nBuy equipment for your studio, such as cameras, microphones, chromakey carpets and lights to improve your gameplay experience.\nRecord episodes and complete seasons.\nEach episode is a mix between tactical turn-based battles, with tons of dialogues, and explosive cinematics.\nYou have the lights, the cameras, and of course, you make the action! You control the movement, attack and skills of each of your chromatic party while recording.\nPurchase consumable items and improve your abilities. Example: buy fireworks and gain +1 damage to your attack.\nCreate channels and improve your marketing campaigns, sending letters to your fans' mailboxes, chatting on IRC, going to conventions, and releasing comic books.\nTake care of your fans, in a very cute mini-game, listening to their distinct stories and deciding if they deserve what they're asking for. Like a little boy who asks to visit the studio, but once you let him, you can't tell if he might break anything valuable. ;D\nRecord episodes with other studios online.

We've created some games in the last 4 years and we won a lot of awesome prizes. Our latest success was a meta-fun game called Knights of Pen & Paper. With it we won the Student Showcase at the Independent Games Festival - IGF 2013.\nKnights P&P is all about fun, meta-game, and references to a lot of 90's geek culture. In the game you manage a group of players playing a table-top RPG, like \"D&D\", with books, dice, soda and pizzzzza! And this meta-language is what inspired us to make this Chroma Squad game.\nWe are a team of 7 very excited game developers. We've released games on the App Store, Google Play, Indievania, Steam, and we have experience with games for PC, Mac, Linux, Consoles, Tablets, Smartphones and Web. We have showcased our games in Brasil Game Show, Tokyo Game Show, Game Connection, Game Developers Conference, E3 (Indies Crash E3), and in a bunch of others.\nWe've started the project three months ago (Apr/2013), and we already have a playable alpha. In late October we'll launch the game for the early access users (beta backers), and at the end of the year we should launch it for everyone, on PC/Mac/Linux. On April 2014, we will ship every physical items, such as boxes, printed art books, t-shirts, posters, etc.\nAs full indie developers, we do this for a living. We have to pay rent, expenses in pizza and soda, and our board game play sessions ;D. So, we're not asking for much. We have the licenses, we have the computers, and we have some money from Knights of Pen & Paper. We only need funding to pay for our daily expenses to make this project possible.\nThe purpose of this kickstarter project is also to build a community behind the game. We wanna know if YOU want us to create this game. We're doing this for you, of course! So the social spread and the feedback of this project will help us build a better game for you.\nIf you help us backing this project, besides getting perks, accessing the game earlier than everyone, or accessing exclusive items, you will help us get excited and motivated to continue building this amazing game. Every like, share and back will help us improve our project to ultimately make it perfect!\nStretching our jumpsuits! Based on user feedbacks, we designed some great stretch goals to you root for!\nSolo rider extra episodes in campaign mode. You'll be able to play through some episodes of the campaign as a lonely hero inspired by riders.\nAn Episode Editor! It will let you create and share episodes online, write your own dialogues, make your own cinematics, so other players could download and play them. (Estimated Launch: mid 2014. This will not jeopardize our game release date.)\nChoose the best perk that suits your needs!\nFound the perk that you want? If you need more customisation, see Add-ons below.\nWe have two types of T-Shirt: The Squad Member T-Shirt and the Monster T-Shirt. You'll get to choose the one you like after the campaign is over.\nPhysical Collector's Edition\nExclusive Box + Printed Autographed Comic Book + Paperback Art Book + Exclusive Backer T-shirt + Signed Poster of the Game + 4GB Custom Pendrive with the Game + Digital Collector's Edition\n Everything physical is made by Over Island.\nDo you want some extra content?

We will send you the perk and the soundtrack =D\n**Extra digital copy of the game is only available for perks that already includes a copy of the game.\n*** Extra digital copy of the game comes with Backer's Only In-game Features.\nAdd any of these items to your perk, and customise your backing experience!\nLast month, we released a web comic about the story that is told in the game. We have already 6 episodes released, and we're planning on creating at least 20 more.\nIn the story, a group of Stuntmen, tired of working in an old-fashioned money driven sentai studio, decide to open their own indie TV studio. And that's when the adventure starts. The group of stuntmen have to decide who's going to wear the red jumpsuit, learn how to build monsters with paper-mach\u00e8, understand the basics about filming and editing, hire extras to be their mud men, and a lot more.\nWe plan on printing a paperback version of the webcomic, with at least 25 pages of content. We want to deliver more pages, but it will depend on our kickstarter campaign success.

But we've been working with game-development since 2009, and our passion has led us very far. \n\nWe've created some successful games, but we only have experience on creating virtual goods. One of the biggest challenges for us will be to deliver the comic book, art book, game box, t-shirts, etc, with the same quality that we deliver our digital games. That's why we've partner-up with a printing company to delivery everything in extreme quality, called Over Island - http://www.overisland.com.br.\n\nWe also think that putting the game on Steam is not that easy, but this would not be our first game on this platform.

Lioness is a project that we'd like to see expand in terms of quality, rather than size. By having more than the bare minimum funding, we can better invest ourselves into pursuing our vision unencumbered. All additional funds will be put into giving ourselves more space to deliver on this project as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The player controls Eggert Kirby, a freelance journalist, as he conducts research for an article about a series of seven mysteriously missing people. Of course, nothing is as it seems and he soon befriends a nicotine addicted cat and unravels a plot involving time-travel, yakuza, and interdimensional coffee.\n\uff33\uff39\uff33\uff34\uff25\uff2d: Gameplay in Lioness focuses on social interactions, life, and narrative. We are experimenting with unique new ways to approach games as a storytelling medium which haven't been explored in past adventure games.\nLioness offers a non-linear plot that can be navigated by meeting new people, solving problems, and exploring unique urban environments, all rendered in colorful, fluid rotoscope graphics.\nRather than navigating a static tree of binary decisions, we are strongly focusing on providing an organic narrative experience that feels personal and unique to everyone who plays it.\nThe game will be released episodically in the form of 7 'sessions'. Each session will reveal more about the plot, the world, and the people in it.\n\uff34\uff25\uff21\uff2d\nZak Ayles (aka \"mooosh\") is an independent game developer and visual artist interested in exploring the potential of games as a storytelling medium.

A story of isolation.\nThe Death Styx: A punk rock fever dream through hell.

However, there is always the chance that positive or negative events may demand that we spend a longer time working on this than intended. We've planned for this, and have ensured ourselves enough elbow room that we can guarantee that the game will be completed, even if a part-time job or secondary source of funding is necessary.\n\nAs stated above, this game is indeed experimental in nature. And as experiments go, they usually fail. We feel as though we may be charting entirely new territory in interactive narrative, so we will continue to experiment, reiterate, and prototype until we have made something we're proud of. We'll be keeping you up to speed with what's been going on in our heads, and what experiments we're trying out in the game. Expect what you see above to shift and evolve over time.\n\nI also ask you to understand that, although we intend to be as transparent as possible with our progress on the game, a certain lack of transparency is necessary for the final product to still be enjoyable.
