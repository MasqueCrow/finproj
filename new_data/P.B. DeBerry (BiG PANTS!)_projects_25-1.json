[{"backer": "P.B. DeBerry (BiG PANTS!)", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " WE'RE BAAAAACK!\nThis issue is almost ready to roll! Completely drawn and just needs some inking, coloring, and lettering to finish it off. The flashback sequence is completely finished. We're looking for some funding to help us get it over the finish line and into your hands. We're offering 2 editions this time; the standard comic with an all-new FOJ adventure you're going to love. We're also creating an extremely LIMITED EDITION comic with a HOLOFOIL cover -- only 100 will be printed and available here on Kickstarter exclusively!\nWhat happens in this issue: Interesting  developments are going down at the Kane Institute (which houses a couple villains that FoJ recently defeated), and it could prove to be a challenge for our hero. There's a flashback sequence which is connected, but how? You'll have to read it to find out!\nAre you a first time Fist of Justice reader? No sweat! This is a great jumping on point. But if you want the whole experience, we're also offering both trade paperbacks (Volumes 1 and 2) and single issues (#7) to bring you up to speed as add-on options!\n\nWHO IS FIST OF JUSTICE?\nFist of Justice was the super-heroic defender of Charm City until he made a fatal mistake that ended his career. Beaten and locked away by his arch-nemesis, he was eventually all but a faded memory.  But his power -- though dormant and forgotten -- did not fully leave him. Now that the power has fully returned and resurrected Fist of Justice, he has to adjust to a new era AND deal with the villains of the 21st century. Villains who are tougher, stronger, and meaner than ever.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nCreating comics is expensive! Not only do we have talent fees, there's printing, packaging and shipping. It all adds up to some incredible costs. Costs we couldn't afford to keep doing on our own, so we're looking for your help.\nKickstarter allows us to reach a wider audience beyond our limited convention appearances and local comic shop distribution. Add in the changes that seem to be happening to the industry\u2019s distribution recently and you can see how tricky getting a book into people\u2019s hands can be. That\u2019s why we're coming direct to you -- our fans -- via Kickstarter. Not only does it make publishing a bit easier, it gives us a direct line to you. We\u2019re like one, big, happy family here!\nOur funding goal for this issue helps us with our talent fees, printing and shipping. If we go way above what we need, we'll be able to share it with our great creative team since we're not a big corporate publisher that needs to pay for office space.\n--\nCheck out some of Mark Robinson's penciled pages. Incredible! Mark is committed to the next 3 issues of Fist of Justice so we're really excited to have him onboard! We loved his work on Hulk and Ms. Marvel. The main story will be inked by the very talented Stacie Ponder who has worked on Star Trek: The Next Generation and BloodRayne. She's the perfect inker for Mark's pencils!\nPenciled Art by Mark Robinson\nPenciled Art by Mark Robinson\nLettered page before inks and colors!\n --\nThe colored pages below are from a flashback sequence in this issue drawn by the talented Dario Carrasco Jr who also drew a Fist of Justice classic for us when we first started out on this journey. We were able to convince our friend and previous collaborator Matt Webb into coloring these awesome pages. Matt was the first guy to ever color Hellboy when the character first appeared in John Byrne's Next Men. \nArt by Dario Carrasco Jr, Colors by Matt Webb\nArt by Dario Carrasco Jr, Colors by Matt Webb\nTHE TEAM\nCreators: Mike Imboden (Fubar, Living Corpse) and Ed Dukeshire (Power Rangers, Hulk, Once & Future) - Mike writes, Ed letters, and together they hold the tag-team championship.

I like to think of it as \u201cSeinfeld\u201d with superpowers or Disney Deadpool (lots of jokes and puns, but no gore or cussing). If you\u2019re a fan of The Tick, Batman 66', or Darkwing Duck, this might just be for you.\nGuano Guy #2 marks the 6th published issue of The Guano Guy. It took a year to produce due to four moves and two career changes, but the new 40-page issue of Guano Guy is finally ready to go. Please join the slowly growing legion of fans and follow The Guano Guy in his never-ending quest for fame and fortune, endorsement dollars and social media likes!\nJoining me on this anecdote filled issue is returning artist Alexander Enlund, of the Flydog Man comic, and colorist Maja Opacic, as well as new artist Stephen Webster, Paulo Hernandez, and Flavio Giron. We also have covers by Jose Manuel Real Lopez and Ryan English, of the classy and clashy \u201cVigis,\u201d plus pinups by Dan Price, Jean Sena, and original Guano Guy artist Ashby Utting (this one's a stretch goal).\nSo with hours of labor and lots of love, Guano Guy #2 is ready for a road trip to the printers, all it needs is bus fare to get there and a home to arrive at. Please jump in and let us entertain you for a few bucks! And remember, this is the cool thing only you and two friends know about, so whatever you do, don't tell more than one really cool friend about this book (you totally get a bonus print for telling a friend about this book).   \nRebel Variant Cover (Art: Ryan English, Colors: Stephen Webster)\n Now let's do a run down of what\u2019s inside this fun filled issue: \nGUANO GUY RIDES AGAIN by Me, Alexander Enlund and Maja Opacic (bios at the bottom)\nGuano Guy's mirror reflection helps him face facts and accept that he needs help in his war for popularity; enter reporter Rita Reteaka and new villain the Crime Mime (okay he's not to great at criming).  Meanwhile, Mr. Marvelous Man keeps doing honest good stuff like spending time with orphans, what a jerk. (see sample art page below pledge rewards)\nDEATH BY NUMBERS by Me and Stephen Webster (bio at the bottom)\nRita Reteaka reports on the death of a hero and learns from Death itself that the afterlife is completely random.\nTE-VIL also by Me and Stephen Webster\nMr. Marvelous Man tries to stop a giant TV robot, only to get sucked in by its mind numbing powers of entertainment. (see sample art page below pledge rewards)\nSUBLET SANDWICHES by Me and Paulo Hernandez (bio at the bottom)\nGuano Guy questions Mr. Marvelous Man's competing product endorsements deals and causes his manager to have a melt down.\nINVISIBLE CAR also by Me and Paulo Hernandez\nMr. Marvelous Man tries to fit in with normal people by doing normal stuff, but he just looks like a big jerk when he can\u2019t stop using his super powers. (see sample art page below pledge rewards)\nZOMBIE LIFE by Me and Flavio Giron\nRita Reteaka interviews the leader of a zombie mob that is seeking asylum inside Auda City and finds that living as a brain eating zombie, in a world full of superheroes, isn\u2019t so easy. Read this story to find out what zombies do when they aren\u2019t chasing you.  (see sample art page below pledge rewards) \n And now let's take a look at the rewards!! You want \u2018em, we got \u2018em, so come get \u2018em. We\u2019ve got new stuff for the returning folks plus all the back issues (169 pages of material in all) for the new folks. Whether you can help a little or a lot\u2026 We\u2019ve got something for you. Thanks in advance for your support, it means the world. \nOh and if you tell a friend about the project and they back a physical reward, have them mention your name so you get your free Bonus Print. Now if they tell a friend, they'll also get a freeBonus Print and the cycle will continue. \nAlso, if you're a returning backer, we have a bonus Guano Guy Bookmark just coming back. An extra special little thanks just for you. \nArt by Alexander Enlund and Maja Opacic from Guano Guy Rides Again!\nArt by Stephen Webster from Death By Numbers.\nArt by Paulo Hernandez & Maja Opacic from Intangible Auto.\n\n\n\nArt by Flavio Giron from Zombie Life (color coming).\nSTRETCH GOALS?\nStretch goals will be added as they become pertinent.

He now lives in a city farther south with his wife and two kids. He delivers mail by day and makes comics by night (he\u2019s currently working on Guano Guy #3). He also enjoys skateboarding and snowboarding from time to time, and collects way too many Legos. He read comics and drew his own stories all the time as a child, but lost interest in comics in his teenage years. In his early twenties, he randomly walked in to a comicbook shop in Australia and rediscovered his love for comics and started drawing again. \nIn 2012 he made a webcomic called Pipeline Lizards, an unscripted, improvised experiment that was later collected into ten issues and sold digitally. In 2017 he came up with Flying-Dog Man, later renamed Flydog Man, as a way of dealing with depression and anxiety, while cleverly disguising it as a funny superhero parody. Alexander\u2019s main influences are American comics like TMNT, Donald Duck, Calvins & Hobbes, Spider-man, and other superhero books, plus some European and Japanese stuff, but he was never a fan of Swedish comics, which is probably why he wrote his own comic in English. You can find him on Instagram @alexanderenlund or flydogman.\nMaja Opacic is a contemporary artist born in the former Yugoslavia. She received formal training at the Academy of Arts and Conservation in Belgrade. In 2012, she moved to the United States where she currently works as a freelance artist and comic book colorist. After years of experience in traditional art Maja ventured into the field of digital art and comic book coloring. Her love for comics started in early childhood and grew with European comics like Dylan Dog, Alan Ford, and Modesty Blaise. Comics were the initial reason for her interest in art, thus her art has come full circle by returning to her first love. Maja current comic projects include Daughter of Titan, Abducted, and of course The Guano Guy.\n                  Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/comicbookcoloring/\nStephen Webster hails from Oklahoma, but grew up most of his life in Murmansk Russia. He got his bachelor's degree in art at Murmansk State Humanitarian University, met his wife Margarita, had four kids, and worked as a teacher, as well as concept artist for mobile game company, GameInsight. Four years ago he moved his family to the United States and settled in Reno Nevada. He's creating concept and slot game art  for Aristocrat Gaming.\nStephen enjoys drawing comic strips, reading, and  playing video games. His literary influences are C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. His artist influences are Goscinny and Uderzzo, the creators of his favorite comic series Asterix and Obelix. He's a huge Tolkien fan and lover of everything related to Arthurian legend. He's also a  Christian. Many of his art pieces are inspired by the Bible or King Arthur. He's also influenced by Charles Schultz, Gary Larson and the great Bill Watterson.\nHis current comic project, The Saga of Brann Bjornson, draws from his real life and tells the tale of a Viking dad, his wife, and their 4 kids. You can see more his work on his website stepneal.art or his Instagram @stepneal.\nPaulo Hernandez works two jobs but somehow still finds the time to pursue his passion as an illustrator. His influences are manga, anime, and indie  comics and is currently working on a sci-fi, post apocalyptic comic project. Follow Paulo at www.paulojhdz.com or on InstaGram @psy55cho or Facebook at m.facebook.com/paulojhdz", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'd say the risks are zero, but that\u2019s impossible to promise. However, unless the world ends or the extra-dimensional squids appear, I\u2019m confident the risk is nigh zero, which means really close to zero.\n\nThe printer takes a couple of months, but at least they\u2019re not going anywhere. As an added bonus, I\u2019m ex-military and an ex-game producer, so deadlines and projects are second nature. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns that I haven\u2019t addressed, please feel free to message me. I love this book and I hope it entertains everyone who reads it.

Go ahead and try the demo right now:\nThe Wind and Wilting Blossom Alpha Demo\nThis Alpha Demo contains the first three Regions of the planned seven, roughly 75 unique Events, two leaders from a planned eight, six different Allies, roughly a dozen weapons, and seven different enemy types. It does not include many planned features - like weather and environmental effects. Overall, it is a solid vertical slice of the game we are making.\nAs excited as we are to put this in your hands, please keep in mind that this is, after all, an Alpha Demo. There will almost certainly be some bugs and UI weirdness, and everything is subject to change in the full version.  You can help us improve by reporting issues through the in-game interface.\nAlso, please Wishlist us on Steam!\nPlease Wishlist us on Steam! Wishlisting is very important for independent developers to gauge interest and spread awareness. We appreciate your support!\nTakiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre, c.\u20091844, Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797\u20131861)\nIn 940 Taira no Masakado, the leader of insurgent forces against the central Japanese government, was killed in battle. His killer, Fujiwara no Hidesato, removed his head and took it to the capital in Heian-ky\u014d, present day Kyoto, to serve as a warning to other potential rebels.\n\nUpon hearing the news of her father\u2019s death, Takiyasha, was sent into a deep rage. Determined to exact her revenge on the imperial government, she contacted a local onmyouji, or sorcerer, to teach her how to summon an army to rekindle her father\u2019s rebellion. From her father\u2019s now ruined palace of Soma, she summoned an army of yokai. Demons, ghosts, spirits, and other horrible creatures spread forth from Soma, terrorizing Japan. The central government, weakened by the Fujiwara clan through years of decentralization efforts, is quickly disintegrating. Infighting among the other rich lords has left them unable to mount a combined defense against the yokai forces. Japan is flooded with refugees from the ongoing war. Pockets of resistance attempt to keep the yokai at bay, but their forces are wearing thin.\n\nAssuming the role of a famous persona from the Heian era, you must lead a small band of warriors from the small island of Yakushima, south of the main island of Kyushu, north through Japan, acquiring powerful weapons and allies and carving a path to defeat Takiyasha and her yokai army. \nOriginal Soundtrack\n  Below are three sample tracks from composer Daniel Lopatka's (@MusicontheDLo) original soundtrack. The full soundtrack will contain at least eight full-length tracks, all with period instruments, to heighten the immersion and authenticity. The Kickstarter is the only place that you'll get the soundtrack with the purchase of a copy of the game. Upon release to Steam, the soundtrack will be sold separately.\nSample Track 1\nSample Track 2\nSample Track 3\nChoosing a Leader \n\nWhen you launch a new game, your first stop is the \"Leader Select\" menu. Here you'll pick from one of eight possible Leaders from the Heian period of Japan. Each Leader starts with one Party Layout - which includes different attribute allocations, Weapons, Charms, and Allies. Each Leader also possesses additional Party Layouts that change your starting parameters - but those must be unlocked by completing in-game Achievements.  \nAchievements\nAdditional Leaders are unlocked through Achievements - either discovering them in-game through an event, or completing the game with a previous leader. Additional Party Layouts are unlocked through various Achievements related to that Leader. Some planned Achievements include:\nComplete the game with only Farmers in the Party.\nWin a battle without receiving any Damage.\nRecruit three Soldiers in one playthrough.\nKill two enemies with one attack.\nMany, many more!\n\nMoving Around the Map\n\nOnce you've selected your Leader and Layout, you're taken to a map of the island of Kyushu, Japan. Your Party is represented by a bust of your selected Leader in the southwest corner. Your mission: head north through the regions of Japan, ultimately hunting down the evil Sorceress Takiyasha. However, you can\u2019t tarry too long, as Takiyasha\u2019s yokai army is just as eager to find you.  Movement is experienced through Nodes - and as you travel between Nodes, you will trigger Events.  \n \nTriggering Events\n\nThe Nodes in each Region are randomly populated by more than 200 Events each playthrough. When you trigger an Event, you'll be forced to make a decision - events may result in a battle, advancement of the plot, the discovery of an intriguing item, a bizarre encounter with the local populace, or something worse. The majority of the Events in The Wind and Wilting Blossom have multiple outcomes, so each playthrough feels entirely unique.  \nPoints of Interest\nDotting the various regions of Japan, you will encounter famous locations from the Heian period. These locations may have specific events tied to them, with their own unique outcomes and Event paths.\n \nResources \n\nYour Party requires a variety of resources to keep them moving through Japan and in top fighting shape. Resources are gained by shopping, trading, battling, or through Event selections. \nWad\u014dkaichin\nWad\u014dkaichin is the primary currency of the game. You will use this to purchase Weapons, heal your Party, and recruit Allies. \nMasu\nMasu refers to a day\u2019s ration of rice - your Party\u2019s food supply. Each time you move to a Node you will consume a Masu. When you run out of Masu, your Party begins to starve and may not move to a new Node. You'll be forced to bide your time and hope to locate some more Masu in order to continue your journey. \nExperience Scrolls\nExperience Scrolls are used to level up your Leader and your individual Party members, making them more powerful. \nAmmo\nAmmo is used specifically to power ranged Leader Weapons.\nKi\nKi is the body\u2019s lifeforce and is used by the most powerful Leader Weapons. \n  Combat \n\nCombat in The Wind and Wilting Blossom takes place on a wide variety of 9x9 hex grids. Play alternates between Player and Enemy Turns. Each unit in combat receives one Attack action and one Move action per Turn, and these actions may be used in any order. During their respective Turns, combat units may take their individual turns in any order.  \nAttributes\nAll units in Combat have four Attributes that impact their ability to fight. \nHit Points\nHit Points represent the amount of damage a combat unit may receive before dying. When an Ally reaches zero HP, they are dead and removed from the Party. If the Leader's HP reaches zero, the game ends. HP does not regenerate after Battles, so keeping your Party healed is vital to success. \nArmor\nArmor provides a barrier to preventing damage to a combat unit's Hit Points. For the player, Armor automatically regenerates after every battle.  \nMove\nMove is the number of hexes a combat unit may move in one Turn. \nThreat\nThreat is the value that Enemies use to evaluate target selection when two or more targets are viable. Enemies will always attack the closest Party member first - but in the case of a tie, they will attack the Party Member with the highest Threat.\nCombat Objectives\nEach triggered combat may have a different Objectives. Not every combat will be as simple as eliminating all enemies. These variations are typically tied to Events, and some of them may even be timed! Below are a few examples of different combat Objectives you may find.\nEliminate all enemies \nEliminate one or specific enemies \nRescue a character or characters \nCollect an item or items\nEnvironmental Effects\nEnvironmental Effects, while not included in the demo, are a one of the various features that will be available in the full version of The Wind and Wilting Blossom. These effects will alter specific battles by introducing a changing environment. Some planned environmental effects include:\nWind: All combat units are knocked one hex to the left or right depending on the wind direction.\nEarthquake: All combat units take damage and are knocked one hex in a random direction.\nFog: All ranged attacks have reduced Range.\nMud: All combat units have reduced movement.\nCharms\nCharms are powerful items that augment the entire Party or specific Party members. They may be found in Events, looted as battle rewards, or purchased in shops. In the Demo, Charms are represented with text - but in the full version they'll of course be represented with icons more fitting of the style.  Among other powers, Charms provide effects like:\nThe Party's first move in a newly discovered Region costs 0 Masu.\nAll Party members receive +1 Armor.\nAll Party members receive +1 Move.\nAll Party members take 1 less damage from Traps.\nThe Party may not be ambushed.\nAll Party members gain 1 HP when landing the killing blow on an enemy.\nWeapons \nOnly the Leader uses Weapons in The Wind and Wilting Blossom. There will be more than two dozen different Weapons for the Leader to equip. Any Leader may equip any Weapon, but some Leaders may excel with one type of Weapon over another based on their Attributes and Charms. Leader Weapons convey abilities like applying status effects, hitting multiple enemies with a single attack, or buffing other members of the Party. It\u2019s up to you to decide what Weapons you will take into battle. Below is a list of a few weapons already included in the Demo.\nKatana\nThe Katana is the most basic weapon for Leaders in The Wind and Wilting Blossom. It deals decent damage to a single enemy in melee range. \nBo\nThe Bo damages two adjacent enemies in melee range. \nNaginata\nThe Naginata damages two enemies in melee range provided they are in a straight line. \nJingama\n The Jingama damages a single enemy in melee range and applies the Bleed status effect which causes an enemy to take 1 Hit Point Damage every turn which bypasses Armor! \nKanabo\nThe Kanabo is a powerful Ki weapon that damages a single enemy in melee range and applies the Stun status effect which causes that enemy to miss its next Turn. \nGunsen\nThe Gunsen is a Ki weapon that grants all Allies bonus Damage for their next Turns. \nKiseru\nThe Kiseru, or battle pipe, is a Ki weapon that grants any one Ally on the battlefield an extra Turn. \nYumi\nThe Yumi is an Ammo weapon that deals light damage but at a very long range. \nBombs\nBombs are an Ammo weapon that deal a solid amount of damage to up to 3 enemies at a short range. \nAllies\nEach Ally in The Wind and Wilting Blossom has at least one unique ability that they may use in Battle. Unlike Leaders, Allies may not equip Weapons, and do not consume Resources like Ammo and Ki. There are over a dozen different Allies to recruit, and allies vary from the lowly Farmer, who does his part to damage the enemy, to the esteemed Noble who hangs back, supporting his fellow Party members. Below is a list of Allies included in the Demo.\nFarmer\nFarmers are the most basic Ally in The Wind and Wilting Blossom. Farmers are relatively weak in combat but are cheap and numerous. \nSoldier\nSoldiers are a step-up from Farmers. They have a good balance of attributes and a basic melee attack with good damage. \nArcher\nArchers are powerful Allies that use bows to hit enemies from a distance. They are weak in melee combat. \nBandit\nBandits, although generally nefarious, can be persuaded to fight for any cause provided the pay is good. Bandits are experts at laying traps for enemies. \nShinto Priest\nThe Shinto Priest has a weak melee attack, but he possesses the ability to Cure any Status Effect that afflicts a Party member. \nNoble\nThe Noble is relatively weak, but can provide an extra Turn to any other Party member. \nEnemies \nEach enemy in The Wind and Wilting Blossom has a unique mechanic to overcome. Oni will knock you back to disrupt your plans, Kijo will inflict you with deadly Bleed, Funayurei will heal their allies from the rear, and some enemies are best tackled with ranged weapons. It's up to you to create a Party of Allies and bring the proper weapons to bear for each encounter. There are many different enemy types and bosses, and below are a few enemies found in the Demo.\nBandit\nDue to Takiyasha's ongoing rebellion, Bandits roam freely harassing any they come across. Bandits are relatively weak in small numbers but can be deadly if many focus their attacks. \nSkeleton\nSkeletons are the most basic yokai you will encounter in The Wind and Wilting Blossom. They are quite weak but are immune to Bleed. \nArmored Skeleton\nMore powerful Skeletons may equip Armor, making them difficult to bring down. \nOni\nOni are powerful demons that carry large clubs. Onis will knock back any unit they hit, making it difficult to attack them straight head-on in melee combat. \nFunayurei\nFunayurei are ghosts of those killed at sea. They do not attack but will heal other Enemies in combat. \nKijo\nKijo are quick and powerful demons who move quickly and cause the Bleed status effect. \nWe are planning to have at least one POI event for each interesting location in each Region. This Stretch Goal would add 10 more POI events scattered around Japan. POI events are more involved than normal events, with more story and more possible outcomes.\nKickstarter Goal\n  The game is currently in Alpha, with a solid vertical slice of our intended full feature capability. Our goal is a Beta release, with all features and tons more content, to Steam Early Access in mid-2020. With funding through Kickstarter, we will be able to expand and put polish on our animations, UI, SFX, and visual FX.  Among other rewards, our Kickstarter backers have the opportunity to get the game even before Early Access consumers through Beta Access, and at a reduced price. With this access, you'll be able to communicate directly with us (the developers!) to help shape the future of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur (very small) team includes folks who have worked on indie PC releases, free-to-play mobile games, and even the AAA title Middle-earth: Shadow of War. While none of us are currently employed in the games industry, we like to think we've seen enough to know how to design, build, and launch a great game. \n\nWe\u2019re passionate about finishing this project and sharing it with other gamers like ourselves, and have always seen this as the proverbial \u201clabor of love\u201d since we first began very slowly working on it several years ago. \n\nWould it be great if we achieve some measure of financial success here? Absolutely! But our primary goal in starting this company, and project, was to build a game we\u2019d enjoy playing ourselves. All that said, here\u2019s why we\u2019re running a Kickstarter campaign:\n\n- We'd love to include many more animations for combat abilities, the world map, and battle scenes to make the game world feel more alive. A successful campaign would allow us to bring on additional animation help.\n\n- We need some SFX expertise.

In 2014, he switched gears and created the all-ages romp Monty the Dinosaur with artist and friend Jean Franco. Bob has stayed busy with the 2016 release of The Elvis Adventures with artist Rachel Ordway and letterer Micah Myers as well as 2017's Full Moon Fredo with artist/co-creator Angela Sprecher and letterer Shawn Greenleaf. \nKevin is a Williamsburg, Virginia based comic writer. Kevin has worked in comics since 2014, releasing the self-published, fantasy/western Oathbound with artist/co-creator Paul Gori. Kevin has also co-written/co-created The Elvis Adventures with artist Rachel Ordway and letterer Micah Myers and Full Moon Fredo with artist Angela Sprecher and letterer Shawn Greenleaf. Kevin's work was also featured in the If Anthology from Alterna Comics and the public domain anthology Not Forgotten. \nCreator, writer, and artist. He's created the properties Haxor, Shiver Bureau, and Cubicles.  Not only did he self published Shiver Bureauand Cubicles, but Haxor is being published by Webtoon and Shiver is being re-published by Scout Comics. Walter has also worked as an art-slinger for hire on Is'nana, Small Favor, Alter-Life, and Descension. When he's not all up in the comics, he is spending time with his wife, son, dog, and cat or attempting not to break his wrists while skateboarding in the hot Florida sun. \nAfter spending the majority of his twenties working in video production, he discovered that writing was his true love. Chas dropped everything, went back to school, and in October of 2013, he graduated from Full Sail University. There, Chas received a Creative Writing Masters MFA with a focus on comic scripting. He was dubbed Valedictorian and received the Advanced Achievement Award (the highest accolade the school offers\u2014only one student per graduating class receives it).

Because that\u2019s the name of  this book! Clearly it\u2019s fate. You Suck at Guitar is designed to be a  brutally honest, completely ridiculous, and hopefully helpful way to  kickstart (see what I did there?) your terrible guitar skills into  slightly-less-terrible guitar skills. You can do it! Probably?\n\n\n If  the mysteries of music have largely remained a mystery for you - then  you need this book. If even picking up a guitar makes you look  completely and utterly awkward - then you need this book. If you enjoy  strangers (me) making fun of you from across the world - then you need  this book.\n \n\n The  key is honesty. Music books lie to you. They tell you that you are  doing great, when, in fact, you are not. We here at Sadsap Music (that\u2019s  the name of the company I started to make these books) are more honest.  Your friends know you are bad at guitar. Your lovers know you are bad  at guitar. Even I know you are bad at guitar. So let\u2019s fix it. Together.  But not TOO together, because there\u2019s no way I can stomach listening to  you practice.\n\n \nI\u2019m  Dr. Joel Pierson, and I\u2019ve made a career out of music and mockery. I\u2019ve  worked with some artists of great repute (New York Philharmonic, Kronos  Quartet), and am well steeped in pop culture from working with artists  like Wayne Newton and Ke$ha and touring with My Chemical Romance and  Linkin Park.\n\n\n I\u2019ve  performed on all seven continents (yes, including Antarctica), written  music for films (including additional music for The Internship with Owen  Wilson), and had a recording contract with Warner Brothers Records. I  have a Ph.D in music composition, and my music has been performed by  over 20 major symphony orchestras. I once sat in with the Saturday Night  Live band (I didn\u2019t actually PLAY with the SNL band, I literally just  sat with them while they played, in case there was a piano-related  emergency.) Once I performed Let It Be for an audience of one: Paul  McCartney. \n \n\n But  enough about me. This book is about YOU and how bad YOU are at all  things musical. Joining us on our craptacular journey is illustrator Jamie Chen, who I\u2019m relatively certain is a real human being, like us. I  have no reason to question that she was born on Earth, just like you  and I. And it would certainly be inappropriate to assume that as a baby she was dropped off in the Bay Area by aliens in a wicker basket. So  everything is completely normal with Jamie.\n\n \nBelieve  it or not, most music publishers think that mocking their customers is a  BAD idea. Huh! So I\u2019ve turned to Kickstarter for funding. 2 years ago  my first book, You Suck at Piano, raised over $80,000. I followed that  campaign up with 2 additional books: You Suck at Piano 2: You Still  Suck, and 20 Piano Pieces for People with Emotional Problems. And now we  tackle guitar!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nObviously I can\u2019t do this alone and need your help! I need you and your terrible guitar playing. Just as we did with \"You Suck at Piano\", \"You Suck at Piano 2: You Still Suck\", and \"20 Piano Pieces with Emotional Problems\", we need to get this initial funding with help from our illustrator, book designer, marketing, etc. \n\nMy goal is to get You Suck at Guitar finished, printed, and shipped by summer.

DeBerry (BiG PANTS!)", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  THE STORY  \nThe Thunderchickens is the story of Ray, Scratch, and Grampa Thunderchicken. Together they form a superhero legacy that spans generations. Grampa reminisces about it, Ray tries his best to shun it, and Scratch desperately wants to live it to its fullest. Their daily life is shaken up after a burglary at Lumiere Industries, a powerful corporation that was also once a client of Ray's. Without warning, villains Ray thought he had taken care of over the years begin to reappear, displaying startling changes both physically and mentally that threaten both Ray's livelihood and family. Forced to put aside his mounting distaste for the life of a superhero, it's up to Ray and the Thunderchickens to figure out what's going on before it's too late.\nFather/Son relationships are challenging, combative, caring, and complicated. I explore this and other topics like mental illness and the media in this all ages book by myself and Mike Exner III... The Thunderchickens!\n Father/Son relationships are challenging, combative, caring, and complicated. I explore this and other topics like mental illness and the media in this all ages book by myself and Mike Exner III... The Thunderchickens!\n   THE PLAN\nThe Thunderchickens is planned as a 5-issue miniseries, with the possibility of continuing stories. It's chock full of superhero action, comedy and family drama wrapped in every issue. We desperately want to tell this story, and believe the themes contained within the pages of action and adventure are important to our society. We also feel as if this is a story that isn't being told anywhere else, with characters both children and adults can relate to. The Thunderchickens is a story a long time in the making, but given it's the Year of the Chicken we figured it was about time to share it with the rest of the world. But we need your help to make it happen! Up above you'll find the first 5 colored pages of Issue #1. Throughout this campaign, we'll be releasing the first 15 pages of story to give you an idea of what's in store.\nTHE TEAM\nBill Blankenship - artist/creator (Double Jumpers, Vamplets, NFL Rush Zone)\nMike Exner III - writer/editor (Adamant, Out of the Blue, Once Upon a Time Machine, Kayfabe)\nTHE KICKSTARTER\nWe're raising this money to pay for the production and printing/shipping costs for the first issue of Thunderchickens. Stretch goals are targeted at producing the full 5-issue miniseries and any additional issues we can produce after that. 15 pages are currently in production, and we will be releasing them over the course of the kickstarter to showcase the project for our backers. If we are able to fund the first issue, we will launch stretch goals to fund the other 5 issues to provide to our backers digitally at no additional cost.\nSO MANY REWARDS\nHere's where it gets good...\nDigital Copies - You'll receive a PDF/CBR file of each issue as we complete it.\nPrint Copies - Print copies of each issue as we knock them out.\nOther Comics - We'll toss in digital copies of Double Jumpers (Action Lab), Adamant (Loophole Comics) and as many others as we can get our hands on.\n   Prints - An 11x17 print of the cover to Issue #1 of Thunderchickens!\nSketches - Bill Blankenship will draw a sketch of anything you want in your issue of Thunderchickens!\nSketchbooks - Our most personal reward yet! You'll get the Madcap Sketchbook: The Psych Ward Sketches, which were drawn by Bill Blankenship exactly where it sounds like.\nArt Commissions - Bill Blankenship will draw pretty much whatever you want.\nFursona Commissions - Bill Blankenship will create an original piece of art based on your fursona!\nComic Cover Commissions - Bill Blankenship will produce finished cover art for your comic! Like this cover for the indie comic Stray!\nPortfolio Consultations - Thunderchickens artist/creator Bill Blankenship will work with you to hone your comics portfolio with copious suggestions, and a trio of phone and/or skype discussions.\nScript/Pitch Consultations - Thunderchickens editor extraordinaire Mike Exner III will work with you to hone your comics script or pitch into a winner. No script on hand? No worries, this reward doesn't expire.\nPet Portraits - Bill Blankenship will draw your pet however you want your pet to be drawn. This reward is the best.\nComic Pages - Inked pages from Issue #1 of Thunderchickens on Bristol board. First come, first serve.\nWith rewards like those, how can you say no? We hope you dig what we're trying to do, and thank you for your support!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge to completing this project is simply allotting the time to do it and proper project management. I've recruited the assistance of a longtime collaborator and writer Mike Exner III (Writer/ Story Editor) and will be recruiting a project manager if we're funded. If we fund the first issue fully, we'll be doing extended rewards to fund more issues (up to 5 max) at a lower cost and add those issues to our backers rewards digitally so that no extra reward production costs are incurred. \n\nWe have an art team that includes myself, Ludwig Olimba doing color separations, and Marco Della Verde on letter art. In order to produce the art in an effective timeframe, I've designed the art style around being able to be produced quickly with less work involved in the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Bill Blankenship\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nWilliam Dean Blankenship Jr. is a self-taught flashing animated GIF from northern West Virginia.

But you have to accept it, because your other option? Kill yourself...or stop looking in mirrors.\nSleep Inertia Pilot Slicing Through the Foam of the Days Like a Radial Saw on a Stone Heart is a very personal story for Valentin, and is unlike anything he has created before. It is a unique and sublime reading experience, one we want to share with readers. We will use the funds raised to create this 100-page masterpiece, print copies and ship them to backers, so everyone can experience this once-in-a-lifetime graphic novel.\na Graphic Novel by Valentin Ramon\n  In a future that is just around the corner, people have given up on living their own lives and have allowed governments and corporations to dictate their fate. \nWhy people leave their lives in the hands of fate and the day-to-day inertia of living is still a mystery for everyone.\nSIP is the story of a 100-year-old woman who refuses to die at a time where the average lifespan ends at 70. She has been waiting for a long time to die, but demands to control the moment and manner that she dies in. If you knew you were going to die, wouldn\u2019t you want to choose the time and place and reason it happens, and make your death worth something?\nSIP is about how everything that is around us makes us who we are and how the reality that surround us can sometimes not be what it seems to be. This book has a pacemaker made of sad drama at its heart, and a brain tumor of black comedy plaguing it.\n  Page 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 3\n  Page 4\n  Page 5\n  Page 6\n  SIP is a 100-page original graphic novel with a fixed 8 panel grid per page. It's a story about love, loss and melancholia written and illustrated by Valentin Ramon, best known for his work as the illustrator of D4VE and Hot Damn (IDW), with co-writer Mark Bertolini, creator of Scum of the Earth (Action Lab Danger Zone), and Micah Myers (Action Lab, Zenescope, Scout) on letters.\n  We choose Kickstarter for the freedom that it gives us as creators. To have total freedom on the creative side with a project like this is always the most important thing a creator can ask for. While we love to work with publishers, sometimes having someone overseeing the project and asking you to take this out and put that in will change the sense of the book, especially when it is such a personal story. We want to create something unique for readers. After the cost to print and ship the book, plus Kickstarter's fees, the remaining funds will be used to buy time for the authors to create the book.\n  We have all been working in the comic book industry for a long time, and we have never missed a deadline, and we don\u2019t plan on missing this one either.

All Hell breaks loose at the 2016 GOP Convention as nominee of the Republican Party for President of the United States Donald Trump unleashes a necromantic nightmare of unspeakable horrors. Four unfortunate liberal-minded individuals trapped within the Quicken Loans Arena in downtown Cleveland must ban together in order to survive Donald of the Dead and his zombie hoard.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is intended to fund a modest print-run of physical copies of the DONALD OF THE DEAD comic book. But of course, we hope that demand warrants a much larger print run. We have a few stretch goals in mind and they will be announced once initial funding is achieved.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 -- ZOMBIE REPUBLICAN TRADING CARDS\nOur first stretch goal is a set of six (6) Zombie Republican Trading Cards. When (not if) we reach $3000 in funding, all backers with a minimum pledge of $20 or more (or, if you add $3 to your initial pledge if you chose one of the lower rewards) will receive a set of six Zombie Republican Trading Cards. Examples of the Zombie Trump and Zombie Pence cards are illustrated above.\nDid we just say \"initial set?\" Yes we did. Once we reach our first stretch goal we'll announce another stretch goal for a second set of Zombie Republican Trading Cards.\n#TRUMPOCALYPSE STICKER\nSince Donald Trump is offering a Golden #TRUMPTRAIN sticker to backers for every $50 they pledge to his campaign, we decided that we'll offer a Blood Red #TRUMPOCALYPSE sticker to all of our backers for every $10 they pledge. The #TRUMPOCALYPSE stickers are 8.5\" x 2.75\" in size and perfect for your bumper, or anywhere else that you wish to post a warning of probable doom.\nWHY SHOULD SAN DIEGO HAVE ALL THE FUN?\nJust because we're not attending the big comic convention happening in San Diego this year, that's no reason why we shouldn't be able to offer a \"Comic Con\" Exclusive.\n\"Comic Con\" Exclusive Cover offer has been extended until July 29th!\nIn order to give those of you that may have actually been at the Big Show down in San Diego, we have decided to extend the \"Comic Con\" Exclusive Cover offer five more days.\nFor a limited time\u2014until  50 are claimed or approximately 5:00PM Pacific on Friday, July 29th (whichever comes first)\u2014we are offering the opportunity for backers to pledge for the DONALD OF THE DEAD \"Comic Con\" Exclusive Cover edition. Inspired by the iconic \"Hope\" poster designed by artist Shepard Fairey, this edition of DONALD OF THE DEAD comic book will only be offered in a limited amount. After the stated cutoff time this \"Comic Con\" Exclusive Cover edition will no longer be available as a pledge incentive, so act fast.\nEVERYBODY LIKES STICKERS, RIGHT?\nFor everyone who backs the project at a level which receives the printed comic book or above (that would be $7 and up) we will include not one, but TWO stickers. These bitchin' vinyl stickers are 4.25\" x 4.25\" in size and are printed in B&W with BLOOD RED.\nEARLY BACKER REWARD!\nThe first 100 backers will receive a personal Thank You DONALD OF THE DEAD postcard from creators Dan Taylor and Chris Fason. The front of the postcard features the full image of the Trump Zombie. The back of the postcard features artwork from the comic as well as a personal message of thanks and signed by Dan and Chris.\nBesides the rewards of digital and print editions of DONALD OF THE DEAD, we are offering a few other limited rewards as well.\nOriginal postcard zombie sketch by artist Chris Fason. (20 available)\nOriginal 8.5\" x 11\" sketch by artist Chris Fason. (10 available)\nBe featured as a zombie in DONALD OF THE DEAD!

That's what comic books are to me, and it's these very qualities I strive to bring to each and every story I write.\nWhoa! I almost got philosophical there! Gross! Sorry!\nHi there! My name is Shane Lewis, and I'm the writer and creator of IRREGULAR SHOP, a hopefully ongoing comic series drawn by my friend, collaborator, and talented comic book artist, Gabe Ostley.\nIRREGULAR SHOP is why we're all here today, though, so let's talk more about that, okay? SHOP is an ongoing, highly episodic comedy/adventure book that follows the exploits(both incredible and mundane) of the people working in the titular Irregular Shop. That's the plan, anyway, should this first issue prove successful and popular enough to allow further adventures to be written and drawn!\nThe Irregular Shop itself is a place of magic and wonder; a sort of supernatural supermarket specializing in the sale of occult items, ancient artifacts, eldritch horrors, or even more basic adventuring supplies like healing potions or rusty skeleton keys. The Irregular Shop has it all, for a price!\nThe place is run by a curious trio, and in this first issue you'll discover first hand how they all wound up living and working together in the Shop. The crew is made up of...\nD'AO (full name unavailable)\nThe owner of the Irregular Shop. A 1,000+ year old entrepreneur/sorcerer, he has mysterious and bizarre connections all over the world that he uses to help him run this odd business. Laid back yet easily excited, D\u2019ao lives life from moment to moment, often to the irritation of his friends and employees. He can shoot lightning bolts and stuff, too! So hey, that\u2019s cool!\nSIGURD \"SIG\" LOVECRAFT\nRaised by an eccentric adventurer father to be a great hero, Sig is just trying to survive and take things easy with a dead-end job, but weirdness seems to keep tracking him down, and he gets roped into the Irregular Shop\u2019s world. Even though he\u2019s hesitant to get into adventures, he sure is awfully good at them when he wants to be. Has a doctorate in \"Smashing and Smiting\", apparently.\nVALERIE \"VAL\" VALENTINE\n A recent college graduate who wants to find a job with a good company and work her way up the corporate ladder and into a nice, leisurely retirement. Obviously, this will not work out for her, and she\u2019s stuck with these two goons in their weird store. Probably the only member of the trio with any real sense\u2026 business or otherwise. Despite what seems to be an ordinary background, she's readily capable in the fantastic world of the Irregular Shop!\nThat's the idea for the series in general, anyway, but here in the nearly 60 page Issue #1...\nD'ao, in an effort to drum up big sales during Irregular Shop's grand opening, has purchased a pack of savage BATTLE WEASELS...\n...bio-engineered killing machines D'ao thinks will be a big hit with exotic collectors... from an acquaintance of his, a black market dealer and smuggler named ELTON THE SKELETON.\nDue to D'ao's lazy incompetence, the BATTLE WEASELS manage to escape and begin to wreak havoc throughout the city and acting upon their personal theme song, the lyrics of which are merely \"BATTLE WEASEL! KILLIN' PEOPLE FOR FUN!\"\nNow, D'ao must clean up the mess he made, or he might never be able to open his highly questionable business. And once Sig and Val get roped into the action, the three of them just might save the day.\nAs mentioned, the concept for Irregular Shop came from a desire to do something looser and more free-form in terms of storytelling. The world and characters are designed and set up in such a way that almost anything could be on the table for the next issue, and the next, and the next.\nWith that groundwork of \"anything goes\" in place,  I wanted to temper it with one of the more mundane aspects of life (working, particularly behind the counter of a shop) and from there build a unique world that combines familiar parts of everyday life with fantastic monsters, otherworldly magic, and exciting battles. Gabe and I have so much planned for this little shop of weirdos beyond just this first issue, but everything begins here.\nSo what's the plan? Well, the script for issue one is completely finished, and nearly half of the sixty (SIXTY!?) pages are drawn, inked, and lettered. In order to get the second half drawn and print an initial run of books, we're turning to Kickstarter and all you lovely people to help us make this story a reality and share it with the world. 100% of the money raised by this campaign will be going right back into production on the book and rewards so that we can produce the best comic experience that we're able.\nOf course we'll be providing backer rewards for everyone generous to donate their hard-earned money, and while ours may not be the most extravagant around we've done everything in our power to ensure that they're worth the money contributed and then some! TAKE A LOOK, YEAH!?\n====BREAK DOWN THOSE REWARDS!=======================\n Every contribution counts, no matter the size, and if you donate even $1 please know that we greatly appreciate it! Those 100 cents will bring us one small step closer to completing this project, so thank you!\n Starting at the $3 reward level, we'll send you two high-quality background images that you can use on your computer or smart phone to display your support of Irregular Shop with pride! Be the envy of your office! Be the coolest in your group of friends! All it takes is $3!! Thanks!\n Here it is! The whole of issue #1 in glorious PDF form! All yours if you donate just $6! That's 60 PAGES of fun and adventure you can read anywhere, anytime on your favorite electronic device! The two exclusive backgrounds will also be yours! Not a half bad deal!\n Stepping up to a $12 pledge will land you one PHYSICAL COPY of the book in glorious black and white. That's a full 60-page book that you can hold in your arms and love with all your heart, or shove in a shoebox and forget about! PLUS: get a PDF copy and the background images too!\n All the previous rewards will be yours, along with your name included on a special \"Thank You\" page at the end of the book. Cement your place in Irregular Shop history!\n The backgrounds, the PDF, the book, and your name in the credits were just the start! Pledge $25 and you'll receive all of that plus the obnoxiously named (by us!) SHOP SWAG BAG, which includes:\n- A stylish, double-sided IRREGULAR SHOP BOOKMARK designed by one Mr. Gabe Ostley himself!

Stick them on your favorite bag or jacket and start collecting confused looks today!!\n- An entire BONUS IRREGULAR SHOP STORY printed like a super-trendy zine! Have more adventures and more fun with D'ao, Sig, and Val while you wait for future issues and updates!\nSo to recap: the backgrounds, the PDF book, a physical book, a versatile bookmark, some kickass buttons, and A WHOLE OTHER COMIC for only $25!\n Hey, you like wearing clothes? Have we got the reward for you! Check out the OFFICIALLY OFFICIAL IRREGULAR SHOP T-SHIRT! Featuring a wild, savage Battle Weasel and its stance on everyone's favorite action hero, this shirt is guaranteed to be comfortable, stylish, and eye-catching! Consider this the cherry on top of your reward package, as you'll be getting ALL PREVIOUS REWARDS as well!

Get one of sixty original pages straight from Gabe's magical workshop of artistic wonder! These are rare, one-of-a-kind items just perfect for collectors everywhere.\nSince this is tier two in the \"Art Rewards\" tree, you'll also be getting the book, PDF, and backgrounds. PLUS the B&W sketch of your choice from the previous tier!\nTHE ULTIMATE SHOP FAN TIER! You get one of everything, EVERYTHING, in the previous tiers! That's two background images, a digital PDF copy of Shop, the complete book with your name right at the top of the \"Thank You\" section, the swag bag, a t-shirt, an original page, a B&W character sketch... and... A FULL-COLOR COMMISSION FROM GABE. SUBJECT CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT! After all, it's the least we could do, right?\n=======================================YEAH!====\nThis campaign is the end result of nearly a year's hard work of brainstorming, writing, drawing, researching, and development, and we couldn't be more excited to finally share it with everyone.\nWriting fun, original stories and drawing riveting, bizarre comics to share with the world is our team's life dream. More than anything, we want this project to succeed because we want to share this world and these characters with YOU GUYS AND GALS.

Galaxy Girl is an unpredictable narcissist from outer space who is completely abusing and taking advantage of her young and enamored captive, Norman. Together they go on fantastic adventures in the colorful far-reaches of outer space. In the four short stories featured in Issue 1, Galaxy Girl, Norman, and Steve the Robot refuel on a deserted asteroid, play laser tag on a vibrant jungle world, and are pursued by the evil Cephaloids and the Department of Homeland Security alike.

He leads an extremely mundane life: single, office job, lives by himself, etc\u2026\nOne day, Wendell wakes up with a third eye smack in the middle of his forehead. This third eye gives him insight into people's lives, the future and other psychic abilities. Wendell, at first, feels like a hero that is able to help people but then quickly spirals downward as more eyes begin to grow all over his body and he starts losing control of his new found abilities.\nTHE MAN WITH THEN THOUSAND EYES is a tale of identity and soul searching as to what one's purpose is in life through the lens of surrealist fiction.\nDrawing from influences such as Eraserhead, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kafka's Metamorphosis and The Dark Barkward I hope to pay homage to such strange works of fiction while tackling some tough life questions.\nI hope that you dig the idea and will support the book!\nFunding will go to pay for the printing and shipping of the books as well as affording me the time to complete the artwork and the lettering.\nNOTE:\nI will be writing and drawing the book.\nP.B.

Monty the dinosaur is a creation of me and my lovely daughter, Sophie.\nDaddy and Sophie\nWe live in Cincinnati, Ohio. Our fair city is home to a wonderful museum that used to be a train station. That station, the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, was the inspiration for the Hanna-Barbera Hall of Justice in the SuperFriends cartoon.\nAnyway, last year the museum had an tremendous dinosaur exhibit. We went through the exhibit and Sophie LOVED it. She went Dino-CRAZY! On the way home, she asked me to tell her a story about a dinosaur. On that ride home, Monty was born! Sophie loved the story so much that anytime we were in the car for longer than five minutes she would ask me to tell her another story about Monty. Some were good, others not so much. The best ones I would write down with the idea of one day turning them into comics.\nIn May of \u201914, I got the idea to make a Monty the Dinosaur comic book for my daughter\u2019s fourth birthday present. I was lucky enough to find the amazing artist Jean Franco on Digital Webbing and the project became a reality. Basically, MONTY the DINOSAUR is a love letter to my little Sophie Lu.\nAfter a small, but successful, test run I am looking to print a full run of the book and add a coloring book to the mix.\n\nThe Comic!\nFed up with his solitary existence, Monty decides to venture out into the world in search of a true friend. Being the world's last dinosaur, he knew his chances were slim. Then came Sophie, an 8 year old girl who just wants to play soccer and eat pizza. She welcomes the bumbling giant into her life, and things have never been more exciting for either of them. \nWIP pages of Monty\n  WIP pages of Monty\nWIP Monty page\nComics are for everyone.

The comic industry's main distributor is Diamond Comics and we tried that route with Fist of Justice for several issues, but it ultimately became financially impossible for us to keep the comic series going in that direction. So we're going direct to our fans via Kickstarter. It's where we get to interact with FOJ supporters just like you!\nOur funding goal for this issue is extremely low since we already paid the talent fees. We just need help on printing and reward costs. All extra funding will go towards talent fees on the next issue, plus new rewards, and some cool stretch goals we have planned. \nSTRETCH GOALS?\nIf you were able to participate in our first Kickstarter, you experienced first-hand all the extra goodies we tossed at you for supporting us. That will continue here as we surpass our funding goal.\nOne of the stretch goals we discussed was including FOJ #8 with all pledges for FOJ #7. Let's see if we can make that happen!\nTHE TEAM\nCreators: Mike Imboden and Ed Dukeshire - Mike writes, Ed letters (but has plans to take over the art chores starting with issue #8)! Yeah, you read that right. So let's do this! We. Are. Digital Webbing!\nArtist: Pow Rodrix - Pow has drawn for Marvel and DC on titles such as Justice League America, Wolverine, Lady Death. He most recently finished Joe Martino's Red Anvil comic Cyberine, hey, that's a hint that all Joe's supporters should jump on this book too! Pow is also offering a commission of any character you want as one of our rewards this time. Don't miss it!\nColorist: Edemilson Alexandre - Edemilson has colored our last issue and this issue (the panels you see above are from this issue). He's a great find! He gives FOJ a great new school look you can't miss!\nCopy Editor: Mike Exner III - Mike helps keep us on our toes, to be as clear as possible with our stories. Without him, we'd be like those indy comics that have spelling errors or missing words!\nCover Colorist: Matt Webb - Matt has been working on FOJ with us since day one. He colored the very first story and several flashback sequences  for us, as well as our Kickstarter prints. He is now officially part of Team Justice with our covers!\nArt Print Artist: Morgan Welborn - Morg drew the print being offered as part of the FOJ #7 package in this Kickstarter. He actually drew this for us last time and we wanted to make a poster out of it, but weren't able to. Now we have the next best thing; a print! \nDIGITAL REWARDS\nOur digital rewards come in your choice of either a PDF or through the awesome ComiXology app. We've got you covered!\nTo get YOU to hop on board QUICK, we're giving away FREE goodies for every 50 pledges. So pledge early to get EVERY THING! The second pledge bonus unlocks once we hit 51 backers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is NO risk. you WILL get your comics.

HYDE is a \"buddy story\" similar to the likes of Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello, told in the tradition of the great \"road pictures\" of Bing & Hope.\nReinfield and Igor are two down-on-their-luck, not so bright, unemployed common workers in Victoria London who both have a crush on \"working girl\" Ivy Pearson. They are in danger of losing their flat when Reinfield is approached by Dr. Jekyll to run an errand to acquire ingredients for a new formula. Elsewhere, Igor is approached by Mr. Hyde to run the same errand. Reinfield and Igor  realize that they have both been hired for the same job, but they are not bright enough to figure out that both Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. They plot to go ahead and do the job for both men in order to be paid twice\u2014and their adventures begin...\nRENFIELD AND IGOR MEET DR. JEKYLL & MR.
