[{"backer": "Alexander Shen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Come manage a town in the West, they said. It\u2019ll be thrills, spills, and chills, they said. Well, friends, they weren\u2019t wrong. It has been that and more. But boy howdy, the disasters keep popping up! Almost as though someone is out to see your town fail and their town succeed!\nThe Roll and Write Revolution continues with Wild, Wild West! In this month\u2019s print-and-play game, we are taking you back to a more traditional roll and write experience for 1-6 players. Wild, Wild West uses just 4 six-sided dice, 1 sheet per player, and features simultaneous play - meaning everyone works from the same dice roll. It\u2019s excellent for remote play and playing on tablets! Watch out, though, Wild, Wild West has a few tricks (and traps) up its sleeve.\nWild, Wild West asks you to manage an old Western town with 6 areas of influence. Each turn players will be given dice to distribute around their town but not all of those dice will help you. From bringing in Varmints to luring bandits, it\u2019s a right cow poke in the eye! You can see some big successes, too, though! Just look at all that cash you can grab from selling watered down liquor at twice the price, or filling up a train for a sight-seeing ride! You\u2019ll even have the chance to round up some notorious wanted outlaws and put them behind bars where they belong! Get your head of cattle together, tell those varmints to scram, and let\u2019s have us a good ol' fashioned ho-down!\nClassic euro-style game play will force you stay sharp at keeping the disasters from building up too quickly. The trouble you'll find is that, with only so many turns and something going wrong every single turn, you can't do everything well. *Spoiler alert* The only way to succeed is to strategically fail (like falling with style). Pick and choose your battles well and you just may create a thriving boom town, after all. And afterwards, players are encouraged to look back over their town and share stories of their skillful mismanagement of certain areas. Does your town have a lot of high priced hooch and an ineffectual legal system? Do your future residents from the train feel safe knowing the Varmints have been rehomed? What about those outlaws, did you shut them down quickly with swift legal justice?\nDownload rules here\nBelow, Benny shows us how to play:\n This month we'd like to draw your attention to Rick and Courtnei Dendy's shop DetashEmporium. They run an interesting craft supply shop out of Gulf Shores, Alabama - lots of horn, bone, wood & resin blanks and even these really cool Old Western style dice and dominoes.\n Benny and I have a passion for gaming and would love to publish these games in a format that is both fulfilling and inexpensive. Offering the files for players to Print and Play (PNP) at home looks to be the perfect way to go! You don't even need a home printer. Since you'll have the PDFs, you can print at work, at a local print shop, or (like I often do) play straight on your iPad, Surface, or other tablet device.\n\n        PNP allows us:\nTo offer a low entry point into fun games produced on a frequent basis with no extra shipping costs or delays.\nThe freedom to design wild, wacky, and wonderful ideas regardless of typical commercial viability.\nThe opportunity to connect creative makers with a passionate community united by similar interests.\nHonest and responsive communication.\nDelivery immediately following the close of the campaign.\nA referral to at least one indie-maker in our community.\nMore projects just like this every month.\nAnd we\u2019d love to work with you designers out there!

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Your patrons are rowdy  and rude, but they are the only ones around. Your goal is to fill your inn with enough patrons to keep the debt collectors at bay, but to do so  you must manage some painfully particular, peculiar patrons.\nIn The Ugly Gryphon Inn, you\u2019ll be tasked with managing your patrons\u2019 various needs to ensure they all get a good night\u2019s rest. Each turn, you\u2019ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something\u2019s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you\u2019ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there\u2019s no trouble. There\u2019s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!\nA quick note on our Simply Solo line\nWe kicked off our Simply Solo line in May of 2020 with Food Chain Island. Ugly Gryphon Inn is the second in the series. Each game is designed by Scott Almes and focuses on games that are one player only, light on rules and big on replayability. \nAnd now, a look at Ugly Gryphon Inn\nThe Ugly Gryphon Inn offers the kinds of brain-stretching puzzle that Scott Almes brought to our first Simply Solo title, Food Chain Island. While they\u2019re both easy to dive into and endlessly replayable, here the focus is on managing each patron\u2019s needs while preparing for the next round of requests. \nCarefully booking your guests in the right order is key to success, as each patron\u2019s frustrations can have consequences for the sleepers below them. All the while, though, you\u2019ll have to expect the unexpected to make sure each new guest is comfortable. With a horde of disgruntled customers on their way, you\u2019ll have to be clever to run The Ugly Gryphon Inn.\n\nSimply shuffle the deck of patron cards and place them in a face-down stack in front of you. Draw 4 cards and arrange them in a face-up row in front of you. These patrons are considered to be at the bar.\nThe game takes place in a series of turns until you\u2019ve played all the cards from the deck and your hand. Each turn has the following flow:\nPhase I: Patron goes to sleep\nOne of the patrons at the bar are ready for bed. Select a card from the bar area and place it at the top of the inn. The inn is a single vertical line of cards, with each card being a floor.\nI choose to move the Sleepy Summoner into the Inn.\nCheck Rooms for Phase I irks. \nStarting with the Patron you just placed, you check each patron card from top to bottom. You check the statement on their card to see what will irk them and cause them to leave. If the conditions are met, then apply the effects on their card. \n\nPhase II: New Patron(s) Arrives\nAdds one more patron to the bar until you have 4. If there are no cards left in the draw deck, then this is the final round.\nI draw the Charitable Giant and add it to the Bar.\nCheck for Quirks\nEvaluate the quirk icons in the bar. If there are 3 or more of the same type of quirk, then you irk all the Inn patrons that are sensitive to that bad effect! \nIn the Bar there are 3 Fighting icons, which means anyone in the Inn that is irked by Fighting will trigger their effect.\nSince the Sleepy Summoner is not irked by fighting, her effect does not trigger. She'll stay in the Inn!\nGame End\nAfter you\u2019ve run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. If you have 7 or more patrons in the inn - you\u2019ve won! If you have less than 7 or if at any point 8 patrons are in the discard pile, then you have lost the game.\n\nTry the game yourself!

So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Ugly Gryphon Inn: More Patrons.\n\nYou\u2019ve finally cleared out the bar and sent everyone off to bed...but what\u2019s that sound? A knock at the door, at this hour? Why, it\u2019s just what you need: MORE patrons jostling for a spot at your inn! It\u2019s gonna be a long night...\nThese expansion cards are shuffled into the starting deck, adding to the available Patrons found in the base game. You\u2019ll need to manage these new needy customers more carefully, as your inn will require one more contented patron to be considered successful.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign. \n\n\nAs you may have noticed, we have a second expansion available! Here's a little more info on Ugly Gryphon Inn: Local Dragons:\n\nYou\u2019ve handled plenty of rowdy customers in your time, from monks and mages to giants and goblins, but there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve never faced: the mighty Dragon. Now your humble inn has drawn the attention of an ancient wyrm. Pay close attention to who leaves and who stays: if your departing Patrons irritate the lurking Dragon, all your hard work is sure to go up in flames!\n\n\nEach game using the Local Dragons expansion adds 1 of 3 possible Dragons to your Inn. As Patrons leave, check their symbols to see whether they provoke the Dragon. If the Dragon is sufficiently provoked -- two matching symbols accumulated -- you\u2019ll lose the game.\nYou may have also noticed a new Food Chain Island expansion, Lost Beasts. This is the next in our line of expansions and is due to release in the next month or so here. It'll be initially available on our site for sale in small numbers, but if you are a Food Chain Island fan and want to combine it with your Kickstarter rewards to save a few dollars, we made a reward level here.  \nWe are waiting to see if Kickstarter approves any on-site add-ons for this campaign (it's still in a beta / invite only process), for the time being if you want to add more wallet games from our library (and we have a whole bunch!), we will do that in a different way.\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"1220impatient\" to get 15% off of your order.

As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every  month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level  above.)\n\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations  of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge until Feb 2021.\n\nThen, we are starting up a new year long game in March. It's called Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection, you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your adventures.\n\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\n\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).  The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Dragons expansion here).\n\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Ugly Gryphon Inn!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule. Our Game Haul Bag project is shipping now.

It provides an easy entry point for those who are just beginning to code and sparks their interest in STEAM!\nXtron Pro is versatile with it's modular design. The core of Xtron Pro has a 4 pins connector which can be used to connect extension sensors and electronic modules with I2C buses, and a multifunctional magnetic pogo pin connector to connect game controller, robots, and lots more.\nLearn How to Program by Playing Games with Ovobot\u2019s Xtron Pro\n The Xtron Pro is a handheld console that utilizes MakeCode Arcade, allowing users to design games and other DIY projects.\n\nNot Just a Game Console\nXtron Pro is born out of the Xtron project. During the initial development phases, we received a lot of feedback from Xtron backers. Xtron is a bare circuit board, great for building up electronic hardware knowledge, however, it was not portable and the bare board can be easily damaged.  Since then, a Xtron upgrade came into being. We hoped it would be more compact, exquisite, and portable, and it could truly empower children's growth and learning, not just a programmable game console.\nEventually, this leads us to a clear goal, to make a multifunctional programmable mobile console for children - the Xtron Pro. With Xtron Pro, the user can define its functions through programming, run self-programmed games, customize smartwatches, and even build IoT and robot projects. We believe this approach will help to unleash the potential for children to let their imagination run wild. The Xtron Pro programmable game console is divided into two parts: the core and the game pad. We have also determined one core and multiple extensions R & D direction.\nRun MakeCode Arcade Games\nMakeCode Arcade is a code editor to build Retro Arcade games for the browser and handheld consoles.\narcade.makecode.com\nYou can build games by visual program language, Javascript or Python in MakeCode Arcade. During development, run and test your games within the simulator, then download them to Xtron Pro to play anywhere at anytime.\nXtron Pro is built in lots of hardware modules to enhance function to game programming.\n Design Games Directly on Xtron Pro \nWith the TileCode newly designed by Microsoft, you can even design, code, and play games directly on Xtron Pro.\nMagnetic Modular Design\nThe magnetic modular design makes programming more creative and playable. Rotating the core can switch between portrait and landscape mode, so you can build games in either orientation.\nThe pogo pin magnetic adsorption connection is convenient for assembly and disassembly, and it is more convenient and safer than any other plug-in connections.\nStore Multiple Games\nXtron Pro has a built-in 16 megabytes flash memory. On the basis of the origin bootloader, we added a file system to it, which makes it convienent to store, browse and load multiple game firmware.\nBrowse and load the new firmware\nTo upgrade your Xtron Pro, it's as simple as connecting your Xtron Pro to your computer with the USB-C cable to copy the new firmwares to the disk.\nAt present, most MakeCode Arcade compatible handheld consoles on the market can only store one firmware at a time and require a computer to upgrade the firmware. You will have a better experience with the built-in 16M flash memory and file system.\nBuilt-in High Accuracy IMU Sensor\nThe built-in IMU sensor with high accuracy leads to the fun of the game to go beyond the buttons. You can create motion sensing games with it, bringing a whole new level of interaction to the games you create.\nIn addition to be used for game control, IMU sensors can also be used to measure vibration, calculate angles, and count steps.\nMultiple Players\nHaving multiple Xtron Pros connected through data wires makes it possible to experience the joy of multiplayer games and online collaboration.\nOn top of your own games, Xtron pro also supports to run thousands of classic NES games. Such as Super Mario, Contra, Pac-Man, etc.\nIt's easy to transfer the Xtron Pro to a NES simulator, simply download NES games from internet and copy XTRON_NES.uf2 (developed by our team in Microsoft uf2 format which is the same as MakeCode Arcade Games) to Xtron Pro drive disk.\nXmaker Programming Platform\nWe have also developed a dedicated software platform for Xtron Pro, Xmaker. It has rich program blocks and image resources to make it easier for beginners with limited knowledge of programming. \nXmaker code editor for Xtron Pro, URL: xmaker.ovobot.cc(Beta)\nbased on MakeCode, we have added Xtron Pro-specific functions on the basis of Arcade, such as watch-related program blocks, IoT and speech recognition, etc.\nTurn Xtron Pro into a Smartwatch\nWe designed a trendy wristband for Xtron Pro, an arc-shaped silicone case, and adjustable watchband. With it, Xtron Pro instantly transforms a smartwatch.\nXtron Pro has a built-in high-precision clock chip and backup battery. Through programming, the clock interface of the watch can be customized to whatever design that you like.\nCreate a Pedometer\nWith built-in acceleration sensor, Xtron Pro can be used to create a step counter, you can customize your own motion detection device through programming.\nDIY a Countdown Timer\nCombining the accelerometer sensor and clock function, you can make a countdown timer to simulate an hourglass.\nWith the advent of 5G, the era of the IoT is getting closer, from smart homes to smart cities, from industrial IoT to smart agriculture, and the IoT has penetrated into every corner of our lives. The IoT as a system is a multi-disciplinary integration involving networking technology, sensor technology, automatic control technology and big data processing. It coincides with the STEM promoted in education. STEM education encourages the cultivation of multi-disciplinary comprehensive quality. Programming is a main axis of these comprehensive qualities, and a complex system can be realized through programming. XtronPro is a multifunctional mobile programming console specially designed for children. In addition to make games and wearable devices, it can also be used to develop IoT applications.\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi Module\nAfter connecting to the Wi-Fi network through your custom program, you can explore the rich networking functions of Xtron Pro.\nIoT MQTT Server\nThrough the MQTT server, Xtron Pro can establish connection with the mobile APP, so you can monitor the sensor data, or control the hardwares remotely.\nIoT APP\nThe Xtron Pro IoT APP supports data visualization of existing sensors and remote control of output modules.\nThe data endpoint in the APP is convenient to link up with visual program blocks, and the Xmaker provides a wealth of program blocks related to IoT applications.\nSensor Kit\nXtron Pro has a 4PIN connector, which can be connected to extension modules. We now have three sensor modules and three output modules, these include: ultrasonic, potentiometer and soil moisture sensor, servo controller, touch & led and 7-Segment display modules.\nThe existing sensors and modules are not very rich, we need your help to develop more modules to enrich the functions of Xtron Pro.\nSpeech Recognition\nWhen the Xtron Pro is connected to the Internet, it can recognize speech. The speech command can be customized through programming with provided APIs.\nYou can make IoT projects with Xtron Pro's sensors & modules and use Wi-Fi to connect to a cloud for speech control applications.\nText to Speech\nIn addition to recognizing speech, Xtron Pro can also convert text to speech. Why not DIY a dialogue robot?\nXtron Pro is a systematic project, it includes hardware, software, platform, server, App, as and courses. We have done our best to advance the development of the project with limited resources. Reaching the origin goal will help us continue completing the development. So far we have achieved phased success, the hardware is ready for mass production, and we have paid part of mold costs. After the funding is raised, we will use it to pay for the remaining mold costs, as well making mass production possible.\nXtron Pro has strong scalability. We have conceived a wealth of extension modules, such as lego extensions and robots. Our philosophy is one core multiple extensions. We have set a stretch goal at $100,000, if we reach this goal, we will gift one extension module in the Xtron Pro kit to encourage you to explore Xtron Pro's extensive features, and more colors will be unlocked.\nColor options\nBluetooth function\nWith Bluetooth, you can interact with Xtron Pro using your smartphone, or you can use your smartphone to program Xtron Pro in real time.

One player designs a hole by selecting and arranging a handful of board pieces.\n3. Taking turns, starting from the tee, choose a die and roll to see how far you go. You move forward whenever you beat your last number. You must move forward a space or follow any special symbols on the die!\n4. First to the hole wins, and all others score based on distance from the hole. Use Caddie Cards and Golfer abilities to get an edge on the way.\n Solo play\nJust like real golf, you can go out on the links on your own. Design your own holes and see how close to or below par you can reach, and even post your favorite course designs online! #rollinone\n\nWhy pledge?\n Get 10% off the MSRP | And shipped to you first, as backers.\n Exclusives | Get Golfer and Caddie cards available only through this campaign.\n Improvements | The more the Kickstarter raises, the more we can improve the quality and quantity of components in the game.\n This will only come to life with your assistance | Producing a board game is an expensive process, from the design to the manufacturing to the shipping, every step requires time, testing, and money.

Your objective as a deep-sea researcher is to guide your sub through fathoms of water, descending to the Trench floor, to find mysterious and amazing sea creatures.\nWill you become a renowned research scientist, or will you fall victim to the creatures that lurk beneath the surface?\nINTRODUCTION\nThe goal of The Mariana Trench is to score the most research points by researching deep-sea creatures and the floor of the trench. The game is played in alternating turns until your submarines run out of oxygen. \nMOVEMENT\nMovement from one card to the next represents a distance of 1000 Fathoms. At launch your sub can move up to 2000 fathoms (2 cards) on your turn. \nCOLLECTING RESEARCH AND UPGRADES\nWhen researching the water column, reveal the (research) card next to your sub. Each card displays a deep-sea creature and a submarine upgrade. \nYou may:\n\u2022 Collect the deep-sea creature, or\n\u2022 Upgrade your Submarine\nIf you do not collect the creature or upgrade your sub then leave the card face-up, where either player may collect it on a future turn.\nIf you have hold capacity you may tuck the research card under your sub (to the right), so that the class and size of the creature shows.\nIf you do not collect the sea creature then you can upgrade your sub. Tuck the card under your sub (to the left) so that the upgrade is showing. You cannot take the same upgrade twice.\nYour sub starts with a small hold, which can carry one small creature. To collect large creatures you must upgrade your hold first.  \n\nTHE TRENCH FLOOR\nEach time your sub reaches the trench floor you can conduct valuable scientific research. Take 1 research token from the supply and place it on your submarine. Your sub can only carry one research token at a time. The token is offloaded as soon as you surface beside the research vessel.  Research tokens are worth 2RP at the end of the game.\nRETURNING TO THE RESEARCH SHIP\nWhen your sub surfaces, all the creatures and tokens are offloaded to the research vessel. At the end of the game points are scored for different sets of creatures\nAnd there is more\u2026.\nOK, so we have the game, the expansion, and the play mat, we have a few awesome stretch goals to come too\u2026.

Now, out in the wild, you can find them butting heads to show off their wrestling skills and impress their insect friends  (We\u2019re not joking, it\u2019s a real thing).\nThis is the origin of the phenomenal World Insect Wrestling Championship. In Kabuto Sumo, you are one of the contending beetles, battling for supremacy in the ring and your place in the pantheon of legendary wrestlers.\nKabuto Sumo utilizes a slide/push mechanic not commonly seen in many board games.\nKabuto Sumo takes inspiration from those physical interaction games you know and love, but ups the ante with up to 16 playable wrestlers that add variable rules and uniquely shaped \"signature move\" pieces that are guaranteed to disrupt your expectations.\nIt\u2019s an exciting combination of physicality, strategy, and luck. \nYou\u2019re going to enjoy the components as much as the great gameplay.\nReal wood game pieces for every base game and expansion pack provide a satisfying bounce after falling off and hitting the table.\nLarge tarot cards (nearly 2x standard size) for the wrestlers show off the incredible artwork.\nEverything has been thoughtfully designed and crafted.\nThe box is a small size that will easily fit on your shelves or in your game bag.\n6.75 inches wide x 10.75 inches tall x 2.25 inches deep.\nAll of the expansion components will fit inside the base box too!\n\nPlaytested through hundreds of matches, every bit of Kabuto Sumo is guaranteed to provide exciting gameplay.\nKabuto Sumo isn't \"just a kids game\".\nYes, it is a game kids can play, but it is also 100% a game adults can play with each other. You can play with your kids, with your significant other, with friends, and your friend's kids. Each experience will be different and fun in its own way.\nA ton of effort has been put into the design to create special moves and unique physical interactions that can dramatically affect how you play the game.\nDuring setup, each player will pick their favorite color wrestler to represent them in the ring.\nYour opponent's wrestler piece is the ultimate one you want to knock out.\nWhen it's set up, get ready to rumble!\nConsider each wrestler's special abilities and signature moves!\nDepending on you've chosen to play as, you may perform their signature move before or after you slide a piece on the board. Each move may only be performed once per turn, at most.\nPlayers will have an idea of how the pieces will shift around when they push a traditional round disc against another disc piece, but be ready for anything to happen!\nThe signature move pieces with their special varying shapes, sizes, and weights will cause unique interactions that challenge your understanding of physics and create unusual outcomes.\nBy offering two ways to win Kabuto Sumo, players can adapt to changing conditions and play to their wrestler's strengths.\nKabuto Sumo brings together some of the toughest insects from around the world to compete in the ring.\nEach insect has a signature move with special advantages that connect to their real-life physiological features.\nRight now there are 6 base game beetle wrestlers and 6 expansion wrestlers that add non-beetle insects.\nIt\u2019s up to YOU to help reach the stretch goals that add 4 new characters to the game - 2 beetles for the base game and 2 insects for the expansion.\nUpdate: AllStretch Goal wrestlers unlocked! That's 8 wrestlers each for both the base game and expansion for a total of 16!\nThe base game includes a wide variety of beetles (that actually exist!) from across the world.\n\u201cMushi\u201d is Japanese for insect and \u201ckabuto\u201d is Japanese for helmet. This refers to the fact that this beetle\u2019s horns look like a samurai helmet. When he fights for dominance he will use his forked horn to lift the other beetle up and throw them into the air.\nStag Beetles are characterized by their huge antler-like mandibles. The head and jaws of this beetle alone can be as large as the rest of its body combined.\nTo ward off predators, Blister Beetles secrete cantharidin, a poisonous chemical that causes blistering to the skin. This chemical has many medicinal uses from removing warts to being the main ingredient in the folk remedy \u201cSpanish Fly\u201d.\nMale Hercules Beetles have a large thoracic horn that can extend up to 4 inches. They are named for their incredible strength and can carry at least 100 times their body mass in weight.\nBombardier Beetles shoot a hot noxious spray from their abdomen as a defense mechanism. An exothermic reaction created from the mixing of chemicals within the beetle heats the spray to nearly boiling.\n Desert Ironclad Beetles utilize a tried and true defense mechanism where they will feign being dead until they can safely escape from the predator.\nThe Titan Beetle is the largest known beetle, with a body that can reach up to 6.6 inches in length. Its strong jaws can snap a pencil in half or tear into human flesh. \nDung Beetles consume animal dung as a food source. To transport the dung back to their burrow, they usually roll the dung into a ball then push along the ground with its hind legs.\n\n\nTo keep the gameplay and character development fresh, the expansion pack introduces a wide variety of non-beetle insects.\nDenkimushi, meaning \u201celectric bug\u201d in Japanese, is the larval form of a moth common to Eastern Asia. The tiny hairs on the caterpillar cause a poisonous sting that feels similar to getting an electric shock.\nAn ambush predator that uses its long forelegs to grab hold of prey. They not only eat other insects but also small vertebrates like lizards, fish, and small birds. \n This centipede has 22 pairs of legs and on its head two sharp venomous claws known as forcipules. It will attempt to eat any animal smaller than itself.\nThese giant crickets are found only in New Zealand and can be some of the heaviest insects in the world, weighing up to 70 grams. They have enlarged spiny hind legs that they use for fighting.\n As the longest insect in the world, the stick insect's primary defense mechanism is its excellent camouflage, where it mimics leaves or branches to be almost unidentifiable.\nThe real Giant Forest Scorpion is the world\u2019s largest scorpion species, growing up to 9 inches in length. As its venom is not immediately deadly, this insect prefers to kill prey with its powerful claws.\nAs the world\u2019s largest hornet, it uses its enormous 1/4 inch stinger to inject potent venom. Multiple stings can even be deadly to humans, and has a history of terrorizing bee hives, which is how it earned the nickname \u201cMurder Hornet\u201d.\n\nThe female Jewel Wasp literally takes control of cockroaches. She stings the roach to make it docile, then she leads the roach back to her burrow. Once inside she lays her eggs on the roach, which will become food for the newly hatched larva.\nPlease note:\nThe game in the video is an unfinished prototype. The final product will have some improvements and changes.\nThis is a \u201cPreview\u201d, not a \u201cReview\u201d. That means this video is only meant to show what the gameplay is like. Any commentary is their own.\n\nPLAY\n\nChad saw Tony's early prototype for Kabuto Sumo on Twitter and immediately connected with both the theme and gameplay. It perfectly fit in with our love of quick but highly engaging tabletop games.\nThe self-proclaimed Purple People Meeter of the Warm Fuzzies Tribe (His words! We couldn't write anything that catchy.), Tony Miller is the designer of Kabuto Sumo. His son's love of coin-dozer arcade machines was the first inspiration for this game.\nHe's one half of the board game design team of Fire in the Library, and one third of the Breaking into Board Games podcast. He lives in the Portland, Oregon area with his family who inspires him to design games in between his Operations Engineer day job and the occasional nap.\nWe admit, although beetles and other insects can be pretty rad, they typically aren't the most glamorous. It was necessary for Kabuto Sumo to have an artist who could bring the unique personality of each insect wrestler to life.\n\n Kwanchai Moriya is an illustrator and painter with a degree in Illustration from the Art Center College of Design.\nA friend of Tony's, Kwanchai had a chance to play an early prototype of Kabuto Sumo at a convention. He felt a personal connection to its theme and was immediately delighted by the game. Once as a child, having spent a summer visiting his grandparents in rural Japan, he was given a wrestling beetle in a little plastic cage as a parting gift. Nothing could've been more exotic and fun, for a midwestern kid from the suburbs.\nTo make sure the game design maximized every bit of excitement and tension, we brought on John Brieger and Michael Dunsmore to playtest hundreds of matches, solidify the mechanics, and help us create the \"signature move\" pieces that cause truly unique and interesting interactions. \nBased in Sunnyvale, California, Brieger Development is an independent studio of boardgame developers specializing in helping publishers, licenseholders, and designers turn prototypes into marketable products.  Founded by former Apple Inc. designer John Brieger, they leverage deep knowledge on product development processes & design research to get games rigorously tested with a broad set of players.\n\n The base price is ONLY $29 right now!\nAfter the campaign, it will go up to $34 and the expansion will remain at $15. The game will not be in traditional distribution, but we will sell wholesale cases to brick-and-mortar stores who contact us directly.\n QE - Save the economy and buy out companies in this interactive auction game.\n On Tour - USA and Europe - Be the best tour manager and get your band to as many states or countries as possible in this roll-n-write game.\n Loot of Lima - Get the buried treasure before the other pirates in this deduction game.\n Bites - Snack your way to the top of the anthill in a commodity speculation game based on the Spiel des Jahres Recommended \"Big Points\".\n Three Small Games Set (GPS, Mountain Goats, Sequoia) - Designed to be crazy easy to teach and fast playing, these 10 minute games cram in a bunch of tension and thrills.\nPS: You can keep all these games closed tight with our four-way \"Game-Shut\" rubber bands that secure all four sides! The medium fits the standard box and the small is great for the small games.\nOur Premium Board Game Bag is a fan favorite. Designed specifically for board games, it can fit 7 \"Ticket to Ride\" sized boxes, is padded and water-resistant for protection, available in three colors, and offers 4 different carrying methods (horizontal + vertical handles, shoulder strap, and backpack straps).\nIt will carry your games to the finish line every time!\nIncrease your wrestler options 30% by unlocking 4 exciting wrestlers!\nThese are not just cosmetic upgrades either. Each stretch goal wrestler will further increase the enjoyment of Kabuto Sumo with a special signature move and corresponding signature move piece that add extra strategic elements to each game.\nAll stretch goals achieved!!\nHow it works: Simply share or retweet the EXACT posts we've linked. If there are over 400 combined shares, you'll get the following items in EVERY game!\nClick the link and share/retweet these posts:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nUpdate: Kabuto Sumo fans did it! Both the Junior Wrestling League and the reference tokens will be included in every game!\nKabuto Sumo has a surprising amount of strategy and for younger children, it can be tricky to figure out how to best use wrestler powers.\nThis stretch goal will add 5 Junior League cards to the base game AND another 5 to the expansion.\nThese cards feature existing wrestlers, but their signature moves are replaced by a simpler unique starting inventory that includes an awesome special signature piece.\nPS: It's also great for adults who may want something easy-to-play as the perfect end to an intense game night!\nAt the beginning of the campaign backer Ori Avtalion made this suggestion, and we thought it was a great idea.\nThe wrestler cardboard punch tokens will look identical to your wooden beetle piece and should help you remember who you are if you get knocked in the head a few too many times!\nAlthough wrestling beetles may seem like something we made up (we honestly had to check that this was real too) you can take it from Nat Geo that it is in fact, very real.\nLook at this champion beetle wrestling his opponent and throwing his spindly insect arms up into the air with joy after a hard-fought match! \n\nNote #1: Shipping will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign. Do not add shipping to your pledge amount.\n\nNote #2: The Kabuto Sumo expansion ships free with your pledge for Kabuto Sumo.\nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\n\n\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by Chad DeShon, a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011 and it planted a seed of things to come.\nNow, 9 years later, we\u2019ve published 5 quick but deceptively strategic board games and 3 small \"super easy to play\" games.\nYou can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 5th major board game and we are confident we can deliver on time.

The countryside is blossoming and you are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the farmers turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community, it\u2019s you!\nAgropolis is a standalone Sprawlopolis game. What does that mean? Well it's more of what we built with Sprawlopolis, but instead of more cities, it's farms. It adds a few new twists (livestock and feed fees), and can be played on its own or combined with Sprawlopolis in a fun new way. \nAgropolis will be the 66th game to join our growing line of Wallet Games\nA quick note on Sprawlopolis\nWe've made over 60 Wallet Games by now and it's safe to say that there's something really special about Sprawlopolis. It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge. It will ask you when checking out if you would like to add any items.

Note: The limit on this offer is 3  wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you  order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with  your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Its always been a dream of mine to bring a world like Masters of the Universe, Transformers, or TMNT to life. Mighty Maniax is being created in that same spirit.\nMighty Maniax Artwork by Ian Ameling\nThis is a new 3\" line of action figures inspired by vintage collectibles like, Battle Beasts, Army Ants, and Hasbro era WWF figures. Heavily influenced by video games and cartoons of the '80s and '90s, these characters represent a wild world of action, horror, and sci-fi fantasy. Johnny Tombstone is the main character and hero of the Mighty Maniax world. His supernatural abilities to sense evil and destroy it are unparalleled. Equipped with an Evo-cannon and containment pack, he sets out to balance the forces of good and evil with the most unlikely of companions.\nMighty Maniax Artwork by Megan Hutchison-Cates\nAmong his band of misfit monsters are Fishstik, a hyper-intelligent water creature, and Viper, a fast-talking Ninja by day; deadly Werewolf by night. Enter a world of frightening monsters and mighty heroes with the all new Mighty Maniax action figures.\nMighty Maniax Wave One\nToy molds are expensive! From a 12\" figure to these smaller 3\" figures, it takes a large amount of funding to get them made. We are looking to KickStarter backers to raise the funds to cover the molds and production for this creator-owned line of toys.\n1988 Lamborghini Countach Not Included.\nEach Mighty Maniax figure comes with 1 body, 3 character heads, and has 10 points of articulation. Swap the heads out to change up the look of each figure, or interchange any part to create new characters.\nMonster figures feature Maniac Morphing to change visual form from scales to fur, or even fire with different colors and heads. Get the Slasher Weapons Pack to add even more attitude to your figures. \nAll figures will feature the Glyos joint system. If you're new to Glyos, you may be wondering what that means. \nGlyos Size Chart (Left to Right: Toy Pizza, Battle Tribes, Mighty Maniax, Onell Design, Onell Design, and Spaced Out Design)\nThe Glyos System features a simple peg & socket joint system known as the \"Fit Function\" that makes them completely interchangeable with one another, allowing for limitless build options. Created by Onell Design, this unique joint system is only made available to Glyos approved toy makers. Rocom Toys has been working closely with Onell Design to ensure that Mighty Maniax figures fit right into the Glyos world while also maintaining their original voice and attitude.\nMixed parts Glyos build including Mighty Maniax, Toyfinity, and Onell Design pieces.\nWith Glyos joints, any of the toys shown above can share parts for new character creations. Its almost like LEGO for action figures!\nFor more insight into the world of Glyos, check out the detailed video above made by The Crafsman.\nPLAY\n\nGrowing up in the '90s wouldn't be the same without 16-Bit video games played on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis systems. When cinematographer, Joel Benner, and video-game coder, Matt Cooper, approached Rocom Toys with the opportunity to make a classic 16-Bit side-scroller, there was no question that it had to be for Mighty Maniax.\nMighty Maniax: The Video Game features 16-Bit Graphics With Modern Gameplay.\nWhat Rocom Toys created is an action-packed, spooky, shoot 'em up with a Contra meets Ghosts 'N Goblins vibe, all to the retro synthwave sounds of All The Damn Vampires. The music created for the game throws you right back into the '80s with the single \"Johnny's Revenge.\"\n\"Johnny's Revenge\" Album Artwork\nIn the single-level, downloadable-demo, you play as Johnny Tombstone. Travel through creepy graveyards, and haunted forests as you blast away waves of bats, monsters, and possessed tombstones! The ultimate dream is to eventually make an 8-level, full-length video game for the Nintendo Switch, or other consoles. The video game demo comes FREE with every reward including a Mighty Maniax figure.\nDeath Jaguar Add-On Accessories Stretch Goal\nRocom Toys started in 2018 after the success of the Death Jaguar Vinyl Toy Kickstarter. With hundreds of units sold, we began working with illustrators and artists to develop new toys that are unlike any other. Tom Neely's \"Henry & Glenn Forever\" Anime Robots, and last year's \"Future Me\" by Alex Pardee, both got vinyl toy treatments from their own successful Kickstarter campaigns. You can always check in on what we are up to on the Rocom Toys Instagram account @rocomtoys, or the new Mighty Maniax page @mightymaniax. This is our 4th toy campaign and we are hoping that, with your help, it will be another successful one! \nMutant Soldiers (Photo by Quang Le)\nThere are a few ways to back this project. Rewards range from a digital download of the Mighty Maniax theme song by All The Damn Vampires to a fully playable single-level demo of Mighty Maniax: The Video Game.\nExclusive Enamel Pin Designed by Tom Whalen\nEarly bird reward tiers will ship with an exclusive enamel pin designed by Tom Whalen! These are limited items and are only available while supplies last.\nTrading Card Artwork(From Left to Right) by Ben Templesmith, Johnny Ryan, Tyler Jacobs, and Patrick Gleason.\nSome incredible illustrators have lended their talents to create exclusive Mighty Maniax Artist Edition Trading Cards. Every figure purchased will come with a limited edition mystery card from one of the following artists: Tom Neely, Johnny Ryan, Ben Templesmith, Megan Hutchison Cates, Chloe Rice, Witchhaus, Christopher Ulrich, Bagger43, Tyler Jacobs, Kyle Wlodgya, Ian Ameling, Abraham Lopez, Megan Risk, Kelly Turnbull, or Patrick Gleason. \nPhoto by Quang Le\nMultiple figure purchases will come with multiple cards. Wave One rewards will ship with the full set of Artist Edition trading cards, and some backers will also have the option to add their name to the video game credits!

These include free add-ons that will come with Wave 1 rewards, new character mold reveals, all the way up to a full-length 8-level version of Mighty Maniax: The Video Game.

But, if we can share this project and raise enough money to cover the molds, then we can all enjoy some new figures in the Glyos universe! The risks are minimal once we have the funding to get the toys made. Onell design will be helping every step of the way to get these produced and ready for your collection.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time. Of course international shipping and COVID bring a certain amount of uncertainty to any project, but we have done our best to prepare and add extra padding to the schedule to account for this.\n\nAll the product designs are final (except we are still choosing some calendar photos, so send suggestions). The bags and calendars are made by factories we have used before.

It loves to explore the digital world around: radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more. The main idea behind the Flipper Zero is to combine all the research & penetration hardware tools that you could need on the go in a single case. Out of the box, Flipper is filled with features and skills, but also It's open-source and customizable, so you can extend its functionality in whatever way you like, along with the community.\nFlipper is made by makers who got tired of all these rough PCBs and bulky external modules. We want to make a versatile and beautiful platform for prototyping, hardware research, and pentest of any kind.    \nHardware with personality\nFlipper Zero is an electronic tool that has a curious character of a cyber dolphin who really loves to hack. The dolphin grows while you interact with digital systems in real life and he does it in his very own manner. Your actions will build his personality and he will always have fun and comment on them in his unique style.\nFlipper was inspired by the pwnagotchi project. However, unlike all the other DIY boards for hackers, it's designed with the convenience of everyday usage in mind. Flipper has a robust case, handy buttons and shape, and none of these dirty PCBs and scratchy pins. Flipper turns pentesting into a game, reminding you that researching always should be fun.\nBut don\u2019t relax \u2014 If you become flabby and lazy, Flipper will let you know. And oh boy, you better do not piss him off, as this cyber dolphinius will not stop until you please all of his hacking needs so keeping Flipper happy is a great challenge. However, despite his rough character, Flipper knows that the main goal in life is having fun and he will be your loyal partner in everyday hacking on the go.  \nFlipper becomes mad if you're lazy or ignore him\nTechnical Specification \nFlipper Zero is completely autonomous \u2014 it has a beefy battery, a handy 5-position directional pad, and a display. All the main functions and scripts are available from Flipper's menu, no computer or smartphone required. \nFor more control, Flipper is equipped with the USB Type-C port for upgrading the firmware, deploying virtual serial port, and emulating HID input device. We have also decided to build in a cool old-school LCD screen, and not fancy TFT / IPS / OLED because it's perfectly visible in sunlight and has an ultra-low 400nA power consumption with the backlight turned off. This allows Flipper Zero to be always on and ready with more than 7 days of battery life.\nTo communicate with the real world systems, Flipper Zero has a built-in radio module based on TI CC1101 chip. It supports both transmitting and receiving digital signals within the 300-928 MHz frequency range. This is the operating range for a wide class of devices and access control systems such as garage doors remotes, boom barriers, IoT sensors, and remote keyless systems.  \nBuilt-in radio module supports the most common IoT frequencies. Flipper also uses 433 MHz to communicate with other Flippers out there so you can make some cyber dolphin friends :)\nOut of the box, Flipper Zero can emulate remotes for popular garage doors and barriers. You can keep hundreds of remotes in Flipper's memory as well as create a blank remote for the new wireless gate. Just select the right brand of the system in the Flipper menu, register a new key in your garage/barrier receiver, and give it a unique name for easy navigation between your remotes. \nAs all the wireless protocols are software-defined in Flipper's open-source firmware, new ones will be added by developers in future updates. Out of the box, Flipper Zero will support PT-2240 and \u0420\u0422-2262 protocols (brands DoorHan, Came, Nice, GSN, AN-Motors and more)\nCustomizable radio platform\nCC1101 is well known universal transceiver designed for low-power wireless applications. And with a ready-to-use open-source library, developers can interact with the radio subsystem without limitations. You can write any wireless application, like custom protocol or decoder, as well as use it for connecting with IoT devices and access systems.\nSignal Analyzer\nFlipper Zero has an integrated decoder for popular remote control algorithms such as Keeloq and others, so you can analyze an unknown radio system to figure out the protocol under the hood.\nFurthermore, Flipper can record the samples of radio signals to analyze it later with more sophisticated tools on the computer, as well as replay the saved samples. Many remotes and IoT devices such as doorbells, sensors, and radio sockets don't use any encryption at all \u2014 in this case, Flipper can replay the signal, even if the protocol wasn't recognized.\nLow-frequency proximity cards are widely used in access control systems around the world. It's pretty dumb, keeps only a short few-byte ID, and has no authentication mechanism, allowing it to be easily read, cloned, and emulated by anyone. A 125 kHz antenna is located on the bottom of Flipper's body \u2014 it can read the EM-4100 and HID Prox cards, save them to the memory and emulate any of the saved cards by choosing one from the menu. \nRead, write and emulate 125kHz RFID cards\nYou can also emulate the card by entering its ID manually, so you can easily send it to your friend in a text format. Thus, Flipper owners can exchange card dumps with each other remotely without ever touching a physical card.    \nStore hundreds of card IDs in memory and emulate them when you need to\niButton contact keys\nFlipper Zero has a built-in 1-Wire pad to read iButton (DS1990A) keys, also known as TouchMemory or Dallas keys. This technology is quite old but still widely used around the world. It's based on 1-Wire protocol and doesn't have any authentication, so Flipper can easily read these keys, save IDs into the memory, write IDs to blank keys, and emulate the key itself.\nRead, write and emulate 1-Wire keys (Dallas Touch Memory)\nFlipper Zero has a unique contact pad design on the case edge \u2014 its shape works as a reader and simulator at the same time. The central pad of the iButton key is a data contact and the outer ring is a ground contact, so you need to lay the key in the correct position. The same contact pad can be used to simulate keys from the memory \u2014 just place Flipper to the system reader. This mode is also handy for silent interception of the 1-Wire data line.\nFlipper Zero can act as a fully functional U2F key, that works with any U2F-enabled services such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, LastPass, Amazon AWS, and many others.\nUniversal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol is an open standard for hardware security tokens used for secure authentication. Developed by Google, Yubico, and NXP, U2F acts as a universal key that is designed to add another layer to the traditional login+password authentication method. \nEven if your password gets compromised, an attacker will not be able to log in to your account. This method is much stronger than the usual SMS 2nd-factor method, as it doesn\u2019t involve any third-parties like a cell phone operator. \nThe infrared transmitter can send any signal to control electronics such as TV, air conditioners, stereo systems, and others.\nBuilt-in infrared eye emulates any infrared remote\n Flipper contains a built-in library of common remote commands like switching on/off, changing volume or adjusting temperature, and so on. This library is constantly updated by Flipper community users that upload new signals to Flipper's IR remote database.\nInfrared learning feature\nAt the same time, the IR receiver can catch signals and save them to the memory, so you can store any of your personal remotes and transmit it later, as well as upload it to the public database to share with other Flipper users. \nCatch and save new infrared signals in memory\nFlipper's infrared eye can automatically detect baud rate, frequency, and modulation of the IR signals it captures without any configuration. That allows you to easily capture and store signals from all your remotes and other IR appliances.\nFlippers firmware is completely open-source. You will be able to find it on Github once the first units are shipped. This means anyone can extend Flipper Zero functionality by modifying the code and writing your own plugins.\nOne-click environment deployment for VSCode and Arduino IDE\nAll built-in hardware can be used in your programs, such as a built-in display to print text and draw images, buttons to navigate, radio module for Sub-1Ghz communication, RFID for proximity cards, IR for infrared applications, and GPIO for extending the functionality with your own modules. And thanks to handy and fully documented libraries, accessing all of those is fast and easy.\nSDK packages for all platforms\nReady-to-use development environment for all platforms\nDeploying a development environment for STM32 can be challenging. Therefore, to simplify this process, we will supply ready-to-use packages for Arduino and PlatformIO+VSCode IDEs, available for all platforms, no drivers required. Just install the package and you are ready to go. Uploading sketches is as easy as on the regular Arduino board.\nExtend with your own plugins\nFlipper Zero can run your code as a separate plugin without losing its own firmware, unlike other basic Arduino boards. Thus, you can run any specific code from the plugins menu without uploading it every time you need it. And don't be afraid to break something \u2014 you can always reboot to original firmware if your code freezes.\nRun your own programs from the plugins menu\nFlipper Zero can be used as a versatile tool for hardware hacking. Its 12 built-in GPIO pins are 5V tolerant and allow you to connect it to any piece of hardware while running your own code, controlling it with buttons and printing debug messages to the LCD display. \nYou can use it as a handy firmware flashing, debugging, and fuzzing device, as well as USB to UART/SPI/I2C/etc adapter connected to the PC. \nExtend with hardware modules\nWith the familiar header pins, Flipper allows third-party developers and makers to create their own compatible modules. Modules can be used to add new hardware features, interfaces, sensors, interface converters, wireless modules, and even a cellular modem.  We will share the mockup 3D model, so anyone can easily develop a mechanical design for their modules.\nExtend Flipper with hardware modules\nAs we all know, computers completely trust connected input devices like mouse and keyboard. Flipper Zero can emulate a USB slave device, allowing it to be recognized by the computer as a regular input device, such as HID keyboard or Ethernet adapter, just as USB Rubber Ducky. You can write your own keyboard payloads to type any key sequence, as well as fuzzing USB stack on a target device.\nVirtual HID keyboard injects keystrokes on a target PC\nWe realized long ago that 1 MB of STM32 flash is great to fit a firmware and all your plugins but might run out when it comes to additional data. There are lots of heavy data Flipper has to store: remotes codes, signal databases, dictionaries, image assets, logs and more. MicroSD slot always has been an obvious solution but we were not completely sure about the mechanics, so we didn't announce this before.\nToday we can finally confirm: every Flipper Zero will have a MicroSD slot.\nThe slot will be push-push, so the card will be reliably secured inside and will not protrude. Flipper Zero can work without a MicroSD card so it's not included. You can put any FAT32 formatted card in and store all the needed assets with no worrying that the memory will run out.\nSince Flipper Zero is a very resource-intensive project, not only from the hardware side, but also from the firmware side, we have identified some milestone features that we really want to implement, but can do it only if we have enough funding. These features get unlocked once the total pledged amount exceeds its respective goal.\nMore colors \nFlipper in a different case and display colors. Cool, huh?\nCase and display color options\n\nBluetooth module \nBluetooth module will allow you to interact with Flipper using your smartphone, as well as transfer interfaces like UART and SPI to your computer wirelessly. $300k and we are on the job.\nFlipper will be able to exchange data with smartphone and computer wirelessly\nNFC module \nWell, this is a big one. In the current version, Flipper is only capable of RFID at 125khz. The NFC standard (ISO-14443) operates at 13.56MHz. Adding this feature will require significant hardware changes and matching the two antennas on the same plane. If this gets unlocked, we are going to use the TI TRF7970A chip, the same chip as used in the HydraNFC project.\n\n3D-printed prototypes\n\"Flipper Zero is a very personal project for me. This is the tool I've always lacked. As a maker, I constantly have to build my own DIY tools. Usually, it's a bunch of rough PCBs with mess of wires on a breadboard. Here is my first attempt to build a beautiful DIY tool: Epoxy NFC Reader.\nThen, I tried to modify the original Tamagotchi with the RFID tag. I was inspired by Natalie Silvanovich's work on Tamagotchi modifications, Samy Kamkar's project  OpenSesame, HydraNFC, Proxamrk3 community, and personally thanks to Iceman. The last push for me was when I discovered the pwnagotchi project. At that moment I understood how my dream tool should look like. Feel free to contact me on Twitter.\"\n \"This is the first project where I was in the role of the Art Director. My goal was to create a character with a cute personality and cool, cybernetic appearance, that would have a little perky look. If you like how Flipper looks (and behaves), feel free to check out my portfolio and follow me on Twitter.\"\n\"At Design Heroes we designed, engineered, and manufactured more than 50 hardware products, but Flipper Zero was an especially challenging one. This time I worked tightly with Pavel from the very beginning of the project, covering all the stages from legal issues to marketing. \nThis is a new experience for me, and I\u2019m very excited and proud of what we have achieved so far. Feel free to drop me a line on business inquiries.\"\n\"I believe in open-source and I like that Flipper's firmware is open so the community can contribute to it. Flipper Zero is a very unique combination of a hardcore professional tool for hackers and a fun gadget for newbies who just started learning electronics. Check out my homepage and subscribe on Twitter\"\n \"My approach was to make Flipper feel like a professional hacking tool, a functional device with a modern industrial look that catches one\u2019s attention. Pavel wanted it to look futuristic and retro at the same time. I was inspired by cyberpunk medical equipment. Here is my portfolio.\"\n\"As a head of Mechanical Engineering, I am well experienced in designing products for mass production. I am responsible for ensuring that Flipper Zero is durable, long-lasting, easy to assemble & manufacture, as well as easy to maintain.\"\n\nShipping \nFlipper will be shipped worldwide.\nShipping will be charged via our pledge manager after the campaign, where you will also be able to confirm your rewards, address, and choose any add-ons. Please note, that our prices do not include local taxes, duties, and VAT, that will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.\nPress Kit\nPress release, pictures, videos, and GIFs for press and blog articles. Link to Google Drive.\nFAQ\nThank you for all your questions and comments! We'll try to answer the most important ones here:\nWhat is the shipping price?\nShipping is worldwide. We will ask you to pay it separately closer to the date of the shipping on our website. Due to the coronavirus, the shipping prices are highly volatile right now, so we cannot accurately predict the exact delivery price. Even a few dollars of change can generate a massive risk for the project.\nFor now, we expect the prices to be 10-35$ depending on the shipping area. We are not making any money on it, and we will do our best to optimize the shipping process, so you get the lowest prices and fastest delivery times possible.\nHow about local taxes, duties, and VAT?\nOur prices do not include local taxes, duties, and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country, but we will do our best to minimize the additional costs.\nWhen will you ship?\nWe will receive the funds 14 days after the campaign ends, and then immediately kick off the tooling production. After that, we will run a few trial runs to be totally sure that the product is ready and reliable. If everything goes well, we\u2019ll start shipping in February 2021.\nIs this legal?\nOfficial firmware will not have any kind of potentially illegal features, such as jamming, brute force, etc. So Flipper Zero should be completely legal in all countries. Since its open-source, you can always implement any feature you want or use 3rd party firmware made by the community. In this case, all responsibility is on you.\nWill my Flipper have NFC and Bluetooth?\nYes, all the Flippers will have an NFC and Bluetooth. This does not depend on when you made your pledge.\nHow to choose the color? Can I add more Flippers to my pledge?\nAfter the campaign ends, we will share a link to our Pledge Manager website. There you will be able to choose the color, confirm your address, choose add-ons, as well as change your pledge quantity. So keep an eye on your inbox.\nI\u2019m a noob, how can I learn to use Flipper?\nWe will make a wiki, the knowledge base, and how-to tutorials. This will help beginners to get familiar with Flipper features, coding, and electronics development. But it will be also very useful for experienced users and help them to dig deep inside Flipper\u2019s brain \u2014 firmware architecture and electronics schematics.\nCan I join the development?\nTotally! We hope for your contribution from the very early stages.

At the same time, the game could still provide a LOT of replayability!\nPLAY\n\nThe game comes with 5 chapters. In each chapter, you will first read the prologue comic booklet, which presents the background story and gives instructions on how to set up the game. Each chapter has its own card pool, special setting/rules, and game goal.\nTo progress, you will reveal event cards one by one from the card stand and make choices. You will gain, lose, or exchange resources from your choices. The decisions you make may also trigger new events that will occur immediately or at a later time.\nWhen all the cards in the card stand are revealed, the \"Night Phase\" begins. You have to pay one energy token(or health point) to the time track as a time-counter. Shuffle the cards stored in the future zone and put them into the card stand. After that, another day begins.\n How to win? Game goals vary across chapters. In some chapters, you will need to gather a number of resources to win, while in other chapters, you will need to find the exit. Moreover, you will explore plenty of hidden goals that will also trigger a chapter\u2019s ending!\nWhenever you end a chapter with victory, you will read the corresponding ending comics to know more about how Eila goes through each stage. Reacting to your decisions, the story progress differently and will eventually lead to a different ending in chapter 5! \n What will make me lose the game? Two ways: Either you lose all your health points, or there are 7 time-counters on the time track. There are plenty of negative events and enemies in this adventure that can harm you. Think twice before you make any decision as you will always bear the consequences of your own actions.\n You can save the game between chapters by simply putting aside the habit cards, item cards, and support cards acquired throughout your journey. When you start another chapter, those cards will assist you, or even alter the future.\n Some elements such as combats, riddles, and movements on the map will be introduced one by one starting from Chapter 2. You will read the additional rules before exploring a new chapter!\nDownload\nRulebook v3.1 (English) PDF\nTry it free on Tabletopia! \nNote: The above rulebook is not the printed version.\nlink to BGG:\n https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293207/eila-and-something-shiny  \nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

Portuguese, Greek, Italian, and more), after the campaign.\nPlaying with more than 2 players is also possible with Catapult Kingdoms, but you will need the core game and at least the Siege Expansion (included with the Deluxe Edition). There are two ways to do this:\na) Team Play\nIf you are 4 players, you can divide into 2 teams of 2 players each. Each time a team takes a turn, you can have one player choose and play the Action Card and one player choose and fire the weapon.The next turn you switch roles. This makes the game even more fun because you can collaborate and come up with more elaborate castle designs and game strategies!\nb) 3 or 4 players full support\nTo play a full game with 3 or 4 players you will need a second copy of the Core Game (if you also want to use the expansion you will need two copies of the Siege Expansion as well).\nTo play with 3 or 4 players, you set up like you see in the image below and apply the following rule: Every time a player is attacked (from any other player), they put the Distance Marker in front of their castle to mark the fact that they have already been attacked this round. NO other player can attack them as long as the marker is in front of their castle. At the beginning of the round, all Distance Markers are removed from in front of castles and returned back to their owners. If for any reason, when it is your time to use the weapon and you can not hit any other player (because everyone has a marker in front them), then you can draw two new Action Cards, keep one of them, and if you want you may immediately play a card (this means that you get to play two cards during your turn). \nAlternate Game Modes\nIn this game mode instead of each player building their own castle, you place the player boards in the middle of the floor and you build one big castle, placing all the troops in it (following all the Troop Placement rules).\nAfter the castle is ready, each player gets their weapons and sits about 1 meter away from the castle. Starting with the youngest player, you take turns throwing everything you got at the castle trying to gain points (every brick you knock out is worth 1 point, every troop 3 points). \nGame  ends the moment last troop has fallen. You then calculate your points to find the winner!\nAt the beginning of the game, each player receives one Royal Base. Place the base on any one of your troops. From now on, this troop is part of the Royal family and has the following special ability: During your Tactics Phase, you may move your Royal to a new valid location (per the Troop Placement rules) on your player board. This is a free action, no action card required.\nTo make the game even more interesting, you can play the Defend the Royal variation. This adds an extra ability to your Royal: During the Tactics Phase, if you Royal is not in play (because it was removed in the previous round and placed in the box), you may retrieve it from the box and place them in a valid location (per the Troop Placement rules) on your player board. This effectively means that the Royal will be the last troop removed.\n Kickstarter Preview by Tantrum House\nPlaythrough by Tanrtum House\nStella's Short and Sweet by Meeple University\n KS Preview by Game Vine\nCatapult Kingdom has many different expansions and add ons.

Payment will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable.\nWe will pay to ship your rewards to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address, we will ship to you from one of the hubs below (subject to change):\nUK: GamesQuest\nAsia: VFI\nAustralia: Aetherworks\nCanada: Snakes & Lattes\nUSA: QuarterMaster\nGermany, Rest of Europe & Rest of the World: Happyshops\nBrexit:\nThe delivery time of the game is scheduled for January 2021. The shipping situation in the UK, due to its relationship with the EU, could change. Our goal is to bring the games into the EU and then find the best way to transfer them to the UK. We are monitoring the situation and will let you know as soon as we do, if UK shipping is affected.\nBrazilian Backers:\nWe are going to use VFI so we can give you a customs-friendly shipping solution. We understand that this might mean it will take longer to be fulfilled, but it ensures that there will be NO custom fees or surprise extra charges on your pledge.\nShipping Cost Estimates:\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nPlease note, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the USA category. They are included in the Rest of the World category.\nWe expect the shipping box for the Standard Edition to be 29 cm x 29 cm x 12 cm and weigh around 2.5 kilograms. The estimated shipping rates, which are based on these assumptions, can be seen in the table below.\nPICKUP LOCATIONS\nIf you are close to any of the following locations, you can choose to pick up your reward and not pay shipping costs!\nHalifax, Canada\n Vesuvius Media HQ: 38 Pioneer Ave, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n Cape & Cowl Collectibles: 622 Sackville Dr, Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia\nAthens, Greece\n \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac: \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 11, 18535, \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb. 210 4296845)\n No Label X: \u039c\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 4, 106 82, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\nThessaloniki, Greece\n Efantasy : \u039b\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u0399\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 13, 546 35, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\nWe will ask you to specify the exact pick up location in the pledge manager after campaign.\nWe want to thank all of the backers who have been supporting us and helping us create and deliver great games. That is why we created a special Loyalty program.\nWhenever you select a pledge that has the Vesuvius Media Loyalty Credit item in it, you will receive a $5 Loyalty Credit for our next Kickstarter campaign. Loyalty Credit can be used to purchase add-ons.\nThis extra credit will be visible during the checkout process of the Hive Pledge Manager and you will be able to use it to buy add-ons (it can not be used for a main pledge nor for shipping costs).\nKeep in mind that the Loyalty Credit is per campaign and not per game. This means that if you backed us in only one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive a $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty Credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty Credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback.

In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing, please contact us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\n\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nOur current estimation for delivery is November 2020. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nBACKER RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIt is your responsibility to check the Kickstarter campaign's updates and the private messages we send you. If a backer does not complete the Pledge Manager in time, then the shipping rates to send you the game at a later time will be a lot higher (because they will not be part of the mass shipping process). If the game can not be delivered because you did not fill out your shipping information and more than 6 months have passed after the deadline, there is a chance we will not be able to deliver you the game. At that point, you will not be entitled to a refund.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nAfter this campaign, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated delivery date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around May, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nSHIPPING\n\nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\n\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nUPDATES\n\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates about Vesuvius Media's other upcoming projects. Such updates will be rare.\n\nYou will also receive notifications about future projects. These notification will also be very rare and it will be very easy for you to opt-out with on click.\n\nBY PLACING A PLEDGE ON THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RISKS & CHALLENGES STATED IN THIS SECTION.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nVesuvius Media Ltd.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Standard Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Catapult Kingdoms and all applicable Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nCatapult Kingdoms\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nApplicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["208 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Deluxe Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Catapult Kingdoms, a copy of the Siege Expansion, and all Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nCatapult Kingdoms\nSiege Expansion\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nApplicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,135 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "2 Players ALL-IN", "descp": "Get a copy of Catapult Kingdoms, a copy of the Siege Expansion, a copy of the Artificer's Expansion, a copy of the Volcano Expansion, a copy of the Vikings Expansion and all Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge level is available only during the Kickstarter campaign.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nCatapult Kingdoms\nSiege Expansion\nArtificer's Tower Expansion\nVolcano Expansion\nVikings Expansion\n2\u00d7 Game Mats\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,614 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Retailer's Pledge", "descp": "A deposit of 4+ bundles of Catapult Kingdoms Deluxe Edition, exclusive to brick & mortar Retailers.\nThis is a deposit, not necessarily the full amount for this pledge level.

And I love dice!\u201d \u2014Ben M., Playtester\nIn the Dice Miner Kickstarter, everyone\u2019s working together to earn Gems that unlock stretch goals. Backers vote on which goals to work toward next. \nDue to the overwhelming response to the Dice Miner campaign, every stretch goal we planned to offer \u2014 and some that we didn't plan \u2014 has been unlocked. There is always the temptation, when a campaign is exceeding expectations, to pile on more and more stretch goals. We've reached the limit of what we think we can responsibly deliver, so we're drawing a happy line under what's been unlocked and get to work delivering on our promises.\nThank you, backers!\nThe Dice Miner backer pack is a collection of components and extras delivered only to Kickstarter backers. The exact contents of the backer pack depend on which stretch goals are unlocked, as decided by you, the backers. \nWhen bonus tunnel dice are unlocked, the ones you get in your backer pack will depend on which version of the game you're getting. Standard backers will get Standard Edition bonus dice, Deluxe backers will get Deluxe Edition bonus dice. \nBonus Goals\n\"Adventuring Party\" Play Mode: If six new heroes are unlocked, the \"Adventuring Party\" play mode will also be automatically unlocked, and provided to all backers as a digital download. In this mode, each player gets three heroes per game, and uses a different one in each round. This bonus goal has been unlocked!\nLiquid Courage Dice Game: If five tunnel dice are unlocked, a brand new dice game called Liquid Courage will also be automatically unlocked, and provided to all backers as a digital download. Created by our friends Sam Mitschke and Randy Scheunemann at Steve Jackson Games, we'll let Sam tell you more below. This bonus goal has been unlocked! \nMy co-designer, Randy Scheunemann, and I set out to create a variety of dice games that offer interesting choices and give players some control over how the game plays out. Yes, even the randomness of dice games can include meaningful choices!\nWe spent months working with this goal in mind, we designed a ton of different games, and then we ultimately narrowed it all down to 26 that we feel are the best of the bunch. Those games are all featured in our book, Random Fun Generator \u2014 A Collection of Dice Games, which will be offered in an upcoming Kickstarter campaign from Steve Jackson Games.\nOne of those games, Liquid Courage, was designed specifically for Atlas Games, with the awesome custom dice from Dice Miner in mind, and we hope you enjoy it! \n\u2014 Sam Mitschke / Chief Creative Officer / Steve Jackson Games \nWe'll alert Dice Miner backers about the Random Fun Generator Kickstarter when it goes  live, but you can also monitor dice.sjgames.com, where the book will feature prominently when it launches. We're extremely happy to feature Liquid Courage as a stretch goal for Dice Miner backers.\nLiquid Courage is best played with six tunnel dice per player, but we're unlocking it with the fifth backer pack tunnel die because backers can still play it easily by using the 27 tunnel dice form their copies of Dice Miner. If more tunnel die are added to the backer pack after the fifth one, so much the better.\nThe campaign mines Gems in four ways: basic, first day, social media, and challenges.\nBasic\nOne Dollar of Funding = 1 Gem\nOne Backer = 2 Gems\nFirst-Day\nOne First-Day Dollar = 3 Extra Gems*\nOne First-Day Backer = 5 Extra Gems*\n* First-day Gem rewards are over and above the \u201cbasic gems\u201d amount for dollars and backers.\nSocial Media\nOne New @AtlasGamesInsta Instagram Follower = 5 Gems\nOne New Atlas Games Facebook Page Like = 3 Gems\nOne New Atlas Games YouTube Subscriber = 3 Gems\nOne New @AtlasGames Twitter Follower = 2 Gem\n  Challenges\n Stream a Dwarfbook Live Video (Go live on Facebook, tell us why you\u2019re excited about dwarves, dice, or Dice Miner, and tag Atlas Games) = 50 Gems\n Mine for Dice on Instagram (Post an image on Instagram of dice you have discovered within or placed inside a hole of some kind, and tag #tabletop and @AtlasGamesInsta) = 35 Gems\n Subscribe to the Atlas Games mailing list for fans or retailers = 20 Gems\n Tweet Dwarves Love Dice (Tweet a photo including both a dwarf and a die, including a link to this Kickstarter and tagging @AtlasGames) = 25 Gems\n Cover Facebook in Glitter (Post a photo on Facebook showing off all your glittery dice, linking to this Kickstarter and tagging Atlas Games) = 20 Gems\n\nYou\u2019ll pay later for shipping. You keep more of your money longer, and shipping rates will be as close as possible to actual cost. Trust us, we won\u2019t make any money on shipping.\nRewards will ship from the Atlas Games warehouse in Duluth, Minnesota, USA. Based on our experience, this is more reliable and ultimately less expensive than a collection of global partners. In part due to our direct control of this facility, our shipping operations have remained both open and safe during the global pandemic.\nYou\u2019ll prepay taxes later. (Group pledges are an exception\u2014 see below.) This allows rewards traveling outside the US to be sent \u201cDelivery Duty Paid\u201d (DDP) where available, so international packages shouldn\u2019t be delayed at customs or flagged for extra fees. Backing Dice Miner on Kickstarter is not a useful way to avoid paying your local government\u2019s taxes.\nHere are the shipping, handling, and pre-paid taxes we anticipate by destination country. They are our best estimates, not guarantees.\nFor group pledge tiers, we will collect shipping and handling after the campaign. We will not charge for duties or taxes, nor pre-pay them, nor be involved in their administration or payment whatsoever. For group pledges, duties and taxes are the backer\u2019s responsibility.\nThis campaign will not ship rewards to Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Ukraine.\nFrom the day we begin shipping, you\u2019ll have a year to complete your order and pay for shipping and taxes. Pledges unclaimed after a year will be assumed abandoned.\nRetail tier backers use Atlas Games\u2019 standard direct-to-retail sales terms for shipping. See \u201cStones & Mortar,\u201d below.\nAdd-ons will be available in the pledge management phase of the campaign. In addition to a variety of other Atlas Games titles, you\u2019ll be able to add the following.\nPunchboard Mountain \u2014 $8. Available to everyone, but intended mostly for Deluxe backers who would also like to have a punchboard mountain, in addition to a plastic mountain.\nDeluxe Dice Set \u2014 $18. Available to everyone, but intended mostly for Standard backers who prefer the look of the punchboard mountain to the look of the plastic mountain, but who dig fancy dice. (We understand that a Standard Edition pledge plus a deluxe dice set costs about the same as a Deluxe Edition pledge. It reflects what the dice cost, and the fact that you wind up with 120 dice instead of only 60.) Includes a Deluxe Edition dice bag.\nStandard Dice Set \u2014 $14. Available to everyone, added by popular demand. This is a full set of the sixty dice that come in the Standard Edition. Includes a Standard Edition dice bag.\nStandard-to-Deluxe Upgrade \u2014 $18. Available to backers at the \"Standard Group\" pledge level only. Each of these add-ons upgrades one of the five Standard Edition games that are part of that pledge level to a Deluxe Edition game. This allows the two editions to be be mixed among a group of gamers who are backing together.\nJosh DeBonis is the president of BumbleBear Games, where he designs arcade games.

Your pledge gives you dollar-for-dollar credit to buy whatever mix of Standard and Deluxe Editions are right for your store, at our standard discount (50%) and regular shipping terms.\n The price is the price. Our campaign offers the standard edition at $29 (MSRP: $29.95) and the Deluxe Edition at $49 (MSRP: $49.95). Our Kickstarter does not undercut long-term sales.\n Exclusive Deluxe Edition access. The Deluxe Edition of Dice Miner will not be made available through distribution.\n You\u2019ll get it before your competitors. Dice Miner\u2019s channel street date is January 15, 2021, but if all goes according to plan (not guaranteed, but likely), you\u2019ll receive your copies in early December and can sell them right away.\n Retail-only stretch goal. If 100 retail stores back Dice Miner, every one will receive a free demo copy of the Standard Edition.

We\u2019d call your attention especially to the backer updates for Magical Kitties Save the Day, to give you a sense of how we handle things and what we do when the unexpected arises. Past our previous Kickstarters, Atlas Games has been publishing tabletop games and making good on our promises for 30 years.\n\nAs a game, Dice Miner is complete. Its rules have been extensively tested, its components have been modeled, the art is all finished (with the exception of any new art required by unlocked stretch goals), and the graphic design is nearly done. We expect that Dice Miner will go to press before this campaign is over.\n\nAt the same time: Yes, indeed, many things seem very uncertain these days.

I grew up in the back woods, and muddy creeks here in Texas, within walking distance of where I lived. Though my love for nature never diminished when I grew up, the areas I loved so much changed greatly. Trash would dam up the creeks I loved to fish, particularly, plastic bottles, they were everywhere. It was horrible seeing the land I loved turned into a dump by inconsiderate people.\nI started cleaning up the area, but quickly realized this was not a sustainable method for me, I couldn't easily transport hundreds of trash bags through the bush, without them ripping open and all the contents going right back onto the ground. Then I remembered a trick I learned from my grandpa when I was a kid, was how you can take an old stump, and cut it in a way that it will hold a knife, and cut bottles and milk jugs into strips that he would use for different gardening tasks and jobs around the homestead. This allowed me to cut down the bottles and add them onto spools that i kept in the shed,  so not only was I able to clean the area up, but was able to turn it into a material we could use around the homestead ourselves, the only problem was they were so thick, and limited in their use because of that. This got me thinking as to how we could make the material the bottles created thinner, and more functional, as well as make a tool that can do it to fit into your pocket. This lead us, Grim Workshop  to create our cordage making tools, which processed bottles the same way, but are extremely compact, and portable. By doing this we realized not only did it make a functional material, while cleaning up one some of the most abundant waste product out there, but it would also give people incentive to pick up that waste, and turn it into something more than it was before.\nFrom Conception, prototyping, manufacturing, and materials all components used in this campaign,  are all made and sourced in the U.S.A. Grim Workshop prides itself on the fact that we produce, and source all of our materials here in the U.S.A. helping support other small businesses along the way.\nOur hope is that this campaign will help keep our creeks, and wilds more clean in places where people cant easily access to clean up, by providing such a functional material from the trash found in these locations. We hope this tool can help reduce plastic waste deposited into nature, and our landfills.\n                    Plastic Rope Making Card\nOur Plastic Rope Making card, also referred to simply as the \"Cordage Card\" is a credit card sized tool designed to turn wasted plastic bottles into a functional string that can be used for hundreds of tasks. This format is the easiest to use, as it is the largest version, it also fits inside a standard sized \"Mint tin\" as all of the Grim Workshop tools do, which is perfect for back packers and camping kits with extra tools, or to store some extra cordage you've made with it. The Cordage card also has a large hole for a carabiner attachment so you can hang it on the outside of a bag or attach it to other objects for easy use. The cordage card also comes with four holes, one in each corner so it can be secured to a flat surface and held still for additional ease of use.\nCordage Card\n\n              Plastic Rope Making Dog Tag\nThe Plastic Rope Making Dog Tag, AKA the Cordage Tag was designed to be an even more compact version of our cordage card. This tool was designed to be dog tag sized, so it could be worn on a necklace, for easy access and use, or it could be attached to a key-ring, as a mid-sized design, it combines both functionality, and portability. Each Cordage Tag comes with a ball-chain connector, and a silencer to go around the outside of it.  \nCordage Dog Tag\n\n            Plastic Rope Making Micro Tool\nThe Cordage Micro Tool was created to be the most compact tool of this sort that could be created. it gives you the ability to process bottles into cordage, and is smaller than a AAA battery. Combined with the convenient key-ring hole, and the metal clip included with it, and you've got an incredible tool, designed to go anywhere, and always be available.  Clip it to a backpack, or key-ring, and you've always got one at your fingertips. As this is the smallest possible design, it's also the most difficult to use.\nCordage Micro Tool\n                       Cordage Tool Bundle\nThe cordage tool bundle, comes with all three of our cordage tools, that way you've always got one available, stash one at home in a camping pack, or survival kit, one on a key-chain, and one on a backpack zipper so you've always got one on hand. The Cordage tool bundle comes at special reduced pricing even lower than the already low kickstarter pricing per tool. \nCordage Tool Bundle\n                             Replaceable blades\nThe blades on these tools are all replaceable, if they ever wear out, one awesome feature of these, is the fact that many common pencil sharpeners actually use the same blade as we do! This means in a pinch, its really easy to find a new blade, or you can always purchase replacement blades from us at www.grimworkshop.com \n                 Incredible Strength and Versitility\nAfter just a short period using this material, we found hundreds of different uses, but one of the things that impressed us the most, was how strong it was! How strong? One piece of the string from it could lift a cinderblock, one bottle could tow a ATV, and two bottles allowed us to tow an entire 3,000 lb Tractor! \nTowing a Tractor using two liter bottles\n                          Reduce Plastic Waste\nThis new tool from Grim Workshop not only creates an amazing material useful for hundreds of tasks, but it also helps keep the earth a little cleaner, and gives people incentive to go pick up trash bottles, and do something more with them! you can reduce hundreds of bottles to a single spool, where otherwise it would take dozens of full trash bags. The perfect tool in our opinion gives you something, and gives back as well. \n                      Want Additional Rewards? \nYou can easily add additional reward tiers, or items from our website www.grimworkshop.com to your pledge by adjusting your pledge amount to reflect these additional items you want.

Your goal is to influence the wildlife - and arrange their meals - so there is only one animal left!\nFood Chain Island is the next Button Shy Wallet Game, and the first in what we are calling our simply solo series. These are games that are one player only, light on rules, and big on replayability.  \nLet's get into what makes Food Chain Island so awesome!\nStart by shuffling the cards and making a 4X4 grid island of animals with the sea animals off to the side.  \nOn a turn, you must move one land animal one space in one of the four cardinal directions so it\u2019s placed over another animal that is 1-3 numbers lower in value. In this way, you can move the \u20188\u2019 animal over a 7, 6 or 5. \nWhen you do this, place the card on top of the lower card. This how an animal eats another animal.\nWhen cards are stacked on one another, they are considered to be the number on the top. The stack of cards now moves as one.\nWhen you move a card to eat another, you activate the ability on the card that just ate another. This special effect is mandatory and must be applied. In some cases, the ability will benefit you, and in others it will make the game harder.\nThe sea animals are there to help you out. At any time you may discard a sea animal and perform its special ability. Once a sea animal is used, it is discarded. \nThe game ends when only one animal remains or if you are unable to eat an adjacent animal. \nIf you only have one animal left, congratulations! You are an Ecological Expert.\nIf you have two animals left, nice job! You are an Accidental Matchmaker.\nIf you have three animals left, you just made it through! You are still an Island Intern. \nOtherwise, if you have 4+ animals, you have lost the game and need to keep trying.\nFurther Challenges\nTo make the game more difficult, randomly remove one or both of the sea animals. In addition, you can explore these alternate card layouts.\nYou can print and play the game today! The black and white version, along with unedited prototype rules is available at PNP Arcade.\nLINK: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/food-chain-island-kickstarter-preview\nFor a complete playthrough, check out Matt Upton's video below: \nMore to come as we update this image. :)\nAlso available here is Food Chain Island: Tough Skies, a three card expansion that will make your games just a little more challenging. At the beginning of the game, shuffle and place one card face-up into the play area. Do not use the others. During the game, you must activate, resolve and discard the air animal. The air animal must be resolved before the end of the game. For an additional challenge, use 2 or all 3 air animals.\n\n...\n-What's Eric Playing\nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2020/05/25/food-chain-island/\n-Hey Meepling\nFULL REVIEW: http://meepling.com/2020/05/22/food-chain-island-review-eat-your-way-to-the-top/\n-The Cardboard Hoard\nFULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2020/5/25/the-cardboard-hoard-initial-thoughts-on-food-chain-island\n-Boards and Bees\nFULL REVIEW: https://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/0961/\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals.

Together as a team you must collect a certain number of gems, reach the exit and Escape, all before the temple collapses, and the game ends.\nEach player explores their temple by entering chambers and gaining bonus actions and gems for the whole team. The special colored chambers require players to work together. They must occupy both chambers of the same color, in the same round to unlock two gems at once. A daunting task but worth it!\nPlayers can select from different difficulty levels and variants to tailor the game to their group. Cooperation, communication, and a bit of luck rolling the dice is needed to gain the required number of gems and reach the exit before the time runs out.\nThe setup of the game is very easy. One adventure sheet is placed in the middle, and depending on the difficulty level, the goal on the gem track is marked. Each player takes a temple sheet, an adventurer, and a pen. A start player is determined and takes 8 dice. Then each player chooses a different direction from which they want to enter the temple. Done!\nGame round\nA round is played in clockwise direction beginning with the start player. The active player takes all uncursed dice, rolling them two at a time until all are rolled. After each roll they must decide if they want to keep the rolled symbols or place them in the common pool. But if a black mask is rolled, it is placed on the adventure sheet. These dice are cursed and locked from being rolled for three turns.\nThe active player's goal is to enter chambers on their temple sheet, collecting gems, and bonus actions. They can move their adventurer to adjacent chambers if they have the required symbols. In each chamber they gain the bonus depicted, which is then crossed out and transferred to the adventure sheet. \nOnce the active player has used all their dice, or cannot use any more, the other players divide the dice in the common pool among them. With these dice they try to fulfill the treasure maps on their temple sheet. A treasure map is complete if they cross out all the required symbols, gaining a gem, and a bonus action for the whole team that is recorded on the adventure sheet.\nThe adventure sheet keeps track of the collected gems, game rounds, bonus actions (available and used), as well as locked dice (black masks). Available bonus actions (a box with a circle) can be used by the active player to move around their temple. If an action is used it is then crossed out. \n Overview of the bonus actions: \nWhen players have collected the required number of gems, it is time to run for the exit in the center room of the temple. Everybody has to be in that chamber before the end of the final round in order to Escape!\nEscape Roll & Write offers lots of replay-ability with various difficulty levels to tackle, and two different temple/adventure layouts to explore! \nThe dice shrine chambers can be used with the Escape base game, offering additional challenges.  These chambers are exclusive to Queen Games.  They are available from this Kickstarter, and if there are any left in the production run, we will sell them at Fairs/Conventions, or via our webstore.  \nTo play with the new shrine chambers, 8 dice from the Roll & Write are required. Once a chamber is discovered two dice are rolled and placed on the shrines. Adventurers who enter the chamber can roll the needed icons to get either a gem, or one of 4 different special effects. The die is then removed to indicate it has been used. These chambers can also be played with any combination of expansions or Queenies.\nEscape Queenie Box: 11 - 16\nAll Queenies that were released after the Escape Big Box 2nd Edition in one convenient box!\n11 \u2013 The Cursed Gems\n12 \u2013 The Slide\n13 \u2013 The Map\n14 \u2013 The Wishing Well\n15 \u2013 New Quests\n16 \u2013 New Traps\nWith this and the Big Box, players will have everything that is available for Escape. \nThe Escape Queenie Box is also a great addition for players who only own the base game and want new modules to add to their adventures.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems is already included in the Big Box, but is such a popular Queenie that we wanted to include it for all players to enjoy.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems\nAdventurers beware! You are in possession of a cursed gem and must find the matching gem inside the temple, or you cannot escape. You and your fellow adventurers must search the temple for matching gems and get rid of them. This Queenie adds another challenging layer and is, therefore, for experienced players.\nQueenie 12: Slide\nThis Queenie comes with two chambers and a curse. The slide chamber is a tricky one, because you can enter it for free from the staircase side. But if you want to enter the chamber from the other side, you have to roll 3 torches. So you better be sure before using the slide too often.\nThe debris chamber is interesting since in order to discover this chamber a player not only has to roll two adventurer icons but also a key and a torch.\nAnd finally, the Cyclops curse makes you cover one of your eyes with your hand and leave it there until the curse is lifted. Sounds easy, but rolling with one hand and moving your adventurer with limited vision is very tricky!\nQueenie 13: Map\nThe map chamber is a great destination for players since it is one of the few chambers that actually help the players and make the escape a little bit easier. Inside the chamber a player can roll 2 torch icons and then place their adventurer in any chamber they want, allowing the player to quickly navigate the temple and help other players.\nQueenie 14: Wishing Well\nThis chamber also helps the players succeed. If you roll 2 key icons, you may either draw a treasure, get rid of a curse, or regain one of your lost dice! And you can use the wishing well multiple times... But only one wish at a time, so you have to leave the chamber and reenter if you want to use it more than once\nQueenie 15: New Quests\nNow players must fulfill quests, which are special chambers, where they have to work together to overcome a challenge, otherwise they cannot escape. Each game players can decide if they want to tackle one, two or even three quest chambers.\nQueenie 16: New Traps\nTrap chambers are especially nasty since the adventurer must be placed inside the chamber upon discovery. Now they are trapped until they figure a way out or another adventurer helps them. There are 3 trap chambers in this Queenie. How many are you prepared to handle in your next game?\nAdd-Ons \nFor backers who may have missed our recent campaigns or planned on getting the games at the Gen Con 2020 or Spiel 2020 (unfortunately neither of which will take place this year). We would like offer another opportunity to get Winter Kingdom here in this campaign, and Merlin Big Box, among others, in the pledge manager.\nPledging for this Campaign\nProduction for this campaign is planned for Q4  2020.  To ensure that shipping goes as smoothly as possible we are using Crowd Ox Pledge Manager.   \nEscape Base Game\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time cooperative game in which all players must escape from a temple after awakening an ancient curse. The game plays in precisely 10 minutes, with an included soundtrack (also available digitally) counting down the game. Players must navigate through the temple by rolling dice and matching symbols to rooms, thereby gaining entry and visibility into adjacent rooms. The map of the temple will unfold as the players explore, making every game play different.  At certain points a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they will become \"lost\" and lose one of their dice. \nBig Box 2nd Edition\nMore content means more challenges to overcome. The Big Box includes the Base Game, 8 Expansion modules (originally released as three expansion boxes) and 10 Queenies (single expansion modules):\nModule 1: Curses\nModule 2: Treasures\nModule 3: Illusion chambers\nModule 4: Special chambers\nModule 5: Quest chambers\nModule 6: Characters\nModule 7: Trap chambers\nModule 8: Time chambers\nTen (10) Queenies. See the graphic for the names of each\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Escape Roll & Write as well as Escape Base Game and Escape Big Box 2nd Edition is planned for the end of October 2020. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse.

Easy and affordable, it ensures your plant journey is a success from the get-go. \n\nKnow Your Pico  \n\nAs seen on \nGrowing plants indoors around the year can be tough because they require lots of direct sunlight to thrive. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t carry sunlight around to make sure your plants get the energy they deserve.\nThanks to Pico's multi-spectrum LED grow lights, giving your plant enough light isn\u2019t a problem anymore; with it, you too can #GrowLikeaPro.\nPowered by high-performance power-efficient LEDs from OSRAM, Pico provides all the necessary wavelengths of light to replace the sun completely, and allow you to grow plants all year round.\nThese powerful LEDs are chosen to support a wide range of plants and each color wavelength stimulates a specific biological function in plants.\n The LEDs are mounted on an easily-adjustable telescopic arm\u2014because plants grow like crazy under our LEDs!      Reminiscent of a vintage radio antenna, it grows alongside your plants. As they extend upwards towards the light, extend Pico by up to a foot in height.\nPower Pico through any USB Type-C cable. Included with your Pico are 2 cables to get you started, a short double-ended USB-C and a 3 meter (10\u2019) super-long cable, along with magnetic organizer loops to help route the cable around fridges, windows or anything else magnetic. You may use any phone charger to power the Pico and the optional Pico-timer helps you automate it. \nThe Aluminum heatsink makes the LED module rigid and lightweight; it also helps the LED chips last longer through its excellent heat dissipation.   \nWith its USB Type-C ports on both sides, you can chain up to 3 Picos together with a regular phone charger. Or build yourself an indoor jungle with 6 Picos powered through a 5V 3A charger! Just connect cables to either side, and each Pico will accept and pass-through power to the next one.\n\nRegardless of how busy you are, Pico\u2019s watering system makes sure your plants have as much water as they need\u2014no more, no less\u2014to sustain their health and beauty. All you need to do is top-up once a week. \nWatering too little can kill your plants, but so can too much. Getting it right takes time and experience. Not many of us have it. With Pico, that\u2019s all taken care of for you!\nThe transparent window lets you know when it\u2019s time to top up, typically once a week. Employing just capillary action and gravity, this design does not require any power supply or involve a motor or pumps. Your plants will also grow quicker and healthier due to root oxygenation from below, provided by the ventilation holes.\nPlant pots take up space. They often can only be placed on flat surfaces by windows, which limits your options.\n With Pico, any place is a good place to grow some plants.\nWork desk? Check. Fridge? Check. Wall? Check. Glass window, bathroom or even in a vehicle? Check, Check, Check. \nAll 3 interchangeable mounts are included with your Pico.\nWhy several mounts?  Because when it comes to plants, you can't have too many and you might want them everywhere.\n\nAnywhere is a good place to grow!\nGrow anything you like \nNo seed pods or subscription is involved and hence no recurring costs! Choose any seeds or growing medium of your choice.\n\nPlants Make You Happy\nResearch has long suggested that indoor plants have a positive effect on the human mind and body. Studies show up to 60% reduction in depression, over 40% in anger, and just under 40% in anxiety. And at work, plants have increased the productivity of the office by up to 15%!\nPlants have been proven to improve motivation and concentration, increase energy levels and decrease fatigue. And thanks to the transpiration and evaporation of water from plants, they increase the air quality and improve eye strain and skin health, and reduce the spread of airborne diseases.\n\n\nFresh Herbs Right In Your Kitchen \nAlways wanted to have fresh edibles at hand? Imagine being able to throw your own homegrown, organic basil onto that bowl of pasta, or some fresh mint on your chicken. \nNo more runs to the store for that missing ingredient, having to wash the pesticides and chemicals off of your leafy greens.\nGrowing edible plants can be a challenge. And while the end result is often worth it, it is a commitment most people find difficult to make. With Pico, we made sure to get all variables just right, so you can grow your favorite herbs at home without a hassle.\n\nYes, it's tough choosing a color.\n\n\n Stretch Goals unlocked!!\n Pico tool design credits to Daksh Savla\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nPico comes assembled and ready to grow. Just take it out of the box, add some soil and water, and a few of your favorite seeds. Plug it in and watch your plants thrive!   \n What\u2019s in the box\n 1X Pico (preassembled and ready to use)\n 1X Power cable (with magnetic cable organizer) (1 meter - 3' 3'')\n 1X Daisy Chain Cable (3 meters - 9' 10'')\n 3X Interchangeable mounts (magnetic, velcro, wall mount)\n\nWho we are?\n We're Altifarm Enverde, a startup based across the USA and India. We strive to offer a healthier and wholesome way of life to all. We believe in Your Right to Grow, Anywhere, Anytime.\nOur design team behind Pico\n Our first campaign was for Altifarm, which led us to switch from a Product Design studio into building home farming products. Altifarm is our flagship home farm with grow lights, greenhouse and mobility packs.\n Last year we launched Herbstation, a more sophisticated compact indoor farm. We've just completed fulfilment to our Kickstarter backers around the world.\nCompared to the other two, Pico is a tiny\u2014but only in size and not in ambition. Our goal with Pico is certainly big\u2014to bring as many people as possible into the fold of Urban Farming. Now anyone can connect with nature and #GrowlikeaPro!\nThis year, we took Pico to CES 2020. We were excited by all the attention\u2014no one could get enough of it!  \n\n Why Grow at home?  \nIs it possible for a Pico to grow enough to replace grocery shopping? Certainly not! \nWith our products Altifarm and Herbstation, we help people grow a substantial amount of fresh produce at home, with soil-based and soil-less methods. If anything, most items that are consumed fresh\u2014the ingredients for salads, smoothies, soup, garnish\u2014Altifarmers grow enough to meet a family's requirements when planned and rotated well\nWith Pico, our aim is to bring up the conversation around sustainable practices in food, and by participation, to have a greater appreciation for fresh produce among family members, including children. \nYou don't need fertilizers or pesticides when you grow your food at home\u2014no transportation, refrigeration, or even washing is required. And certainly, no single-use plastic packaging is involved.\n\n Timeline \nProduct Development \nFor business Inquiries: info@enverdeworld.com\nSay Hi to us: hello@enverdeworld.com \nPICO is fully managed by The Crowdfunding Formula (TCF), the biggest digital marketing team responsible for the top crowdfunding campaigns.

Click the button below to visit our website.\nYou can also sign up for our newsletter to get that latest on new gear and upcoming projects.\nDisclaimer:  We want to make it abundantly clear to everyone that Tortoise Gear is not affiliated with or endorsed in any way by Victorinox AG or their trademarked name Swiss Army.  The FireAnt is a patent pending aftermarket accessory designed by us for use with the Swiss Army knife.\nWhat is the FireAnt and why are we making it?\nEveryone loves a good Swiss Army knife - they are an icon of quality and utility wrapped up in a small and easy to carry package!  But let's face it, unless you're an alcoholic who only opens wine bottles with your Swiss Army knife, the corkscrew really is a tool with limited to no use.  Until now...\n The FireAnt is a custom sparking-steel fire starting tool designed to integrate with the corkscrew tool on Swiss Army knives. Every FireAnt will come with one Helix tinder. The FireAnt and Helix tinder transform the corkscrew into one of the most useful tools you can possibly have on a Swiss Army knife!   Oh, and you can keep your toothpick...\n The FireAnt adds firepower, a splash of color and glow to your Swiss Army knife instantly without any required modifications!\n A perfect micro fire starter for EDC! \nThe FireAnt is a complete fire starter integrated within the corkscrew so ZERO extra pocket bulk is added AND at less than one gram it weighs almost nothing, yet it's waterproof and can start hundreds of fires!\n Just say NO to bulky pockets!\nUnlike other fire starters FireAnt adds ZERO extra pocket bulk\nDesign Features.\nEvery feature of the FireAnt is carefully engineered to increase utility.\n Fluted design: the fluted design and adds surface area and angles to make the color and glow really stand out for a more visually striking appearance.\n Not your ordinary firesteel:  The FireAnt will use the same proprietary formula that we developed for our Firefly fire starters.  This is NOT your ordinary sparking steel, it is superior in every way!  It is easy to spark and anti corrosive and it has a lower hardness so it is much less brittle and puts far less wear on your knife tools.   \nLarge long-lasting sparks.\n Colors that GLOW:  We plan to make the FireAnt in three different neon color tops: Orange, Blue, and Yellow-Green, each with a color complimented sparking steel.  These colors are bright and can be spotted easily if the FireAnt is dropped. AND THEY GLOW!  Each color will have it's own unique all-night glow color so you can easily locate your knife at night!\nEasy to see, especially in low-light conditions.\n Anti-corrosion coating: The sparking steel on every FireAnt will be coated with it's own color complimented anti-corrosion coating.  This paired with a low corrosive steel makes the FireAnt very resistant to any corrosion.  If it gets wet or goes through the washing machine it's no big deal.\nCorrosion resistant coating\n\n Helix Tinder Included- Every FireAnt comes with one Helix Tinder.  Helix Tinder is a custom extruded waxed cotton tinder designed to integrate into the corkscrew with the FireAnt. \nHelix Tinder is waterproof and blended with special additives to increase the melt temperature so it won't melt in your pocket.  Helix Tinder also has a low flash point so it ignites easily even with very small sparks, this helps to prolong the life of your FireAnt fire starter.  \n One Helix Tinder can be used all at once for a large hot fire lasting up to 2 minutes or a small piece can be cut off preserving the rest for later.  When separated or cut into 4 pieces each piece can burn for up to 1 minute.    \nOne Helix Tinder pulled into four pieces.\n Helix Tinder is waterproof so it is a very effective fire starter even in very bad conditions.\nHelix Tinder is waterproof!\nThis is no gimmick, FireAnt means business!\nWet hands, wet tinder, wet fire starter, wet knife, wet ground, submerged gear, rain, snow, sleet... no problem.  The FireAnt and Helix Tinder combination just works! \nWe want to make sure everyone knows the FireAnt fire starter and tinder is a real survival tool that means business, check out this video.\nPLAY\n\n FireAnt makes a great accessory.  \nNot only does it work great, it looks great too!  The FireAnt can add a bright splash of color and luminescence to your EDC selection, and with three colors to choose from you can pick your complement of the day or activity.\nFireAnt is designed for everyone!\nThis is the most important section!\nYOU are how projects are successfully funded, amazing people like YOU kind enough to take the time to share this project with others.  Thank you! Just tap on your favorite social platform icon(s) and share, it's that easy!\nRewards.\nJust click on the reward you want from the column at the right, enter the pledge amount and hit continue.\nIf you want more you can add that to your pledge amount.\nFor example: If you want the FireAnt 6 pack Early Delivery reward, but you also want a FireAnt 3 Pack reward, just select the FireAnt 6 Pack Early Delivery reward and add in the additional amount of the FireAnt 3 Pack. You can tell us exactly what you pledged for once we send out your backer survey after the campaign is over and it will ship with your earliest reward selection shipment time.\nStretch Goal: $50,000  | UNLOCKED!\nIf we meet or exceed the $50,000 goal:\n Pledges of $24 and up will receive 1 free Kickstarter exclusive color FireAnt with a Helix Tinder. \nPledges of $40 and up will receive 2 free Kickstarter exclusive color FireAnts with Helix Tinder.\nPledges of $75 and up will receive 3 free Kickstarter exclusive color FireAnts with Helix Tinder, AND have the option to choose as many of the exclusive Kickstarter color FireAnts as they want as one of their reward color choices\n\n\n What knives and tools will FireAnt work with? \nFireAnt will work with any modern Victorinox brand Swiss Army knife that has a smooth corkscrew tool.  Older style corkscrews have a groove running down along them, most of these will work too, but there are some that won't, especially if they are bent at all or have extra turns (really old ones). \nWe recommend using a knife model that has either a wood saw, metal saw (file), scissors, or an awl as these four tools work the best, but the FireAnt will work with any of these pictured tools:\nI already have a Firefly, why would I want a FireAnt too?\nThe Firefly (our previous project) and the FireAnt both have their place.  Here is a comparison of each and the reasons why you might want one or the other or both:\nFireAnt-\nAdvantages over the Firefly \nYou get to keep your toothpick.\nMore visually useful and appealing.  With a larger top it has color and glow brightness that are much better compared to the Firefly.  This makes it more visually appealing as an accessory and much easier to find at night.\nThe FireAnt comes in three color choices as compared with only two Firefly colors.\nEvery FireAnt comes with a complimentary piece of Helix Tinder.\nComes with special anti-corrosion coating for added protection from the elements.\nBecause of the shorter sparking steel the FireAnt is much more difficult to accidentally break compared to the Firefly.\nLess expensive.\nFirefly - \nAdvantages over the FireAnt:\nThe Firefly has a much larger sparking steel than the FireAnt.  The larger sparking steel makes it easier to get really good sparks which are necessary for starting fires with larger tinder like coarse grass or new dry leaves.\nThe Firefly has the potential to last longer because it has a much larger sparking steel.\nThe Firefly is more versatile.  The Firefly will fit into any Swiss Army knife with a toothpick slot, which is found in most models.  Even the smaller Classic key chain size knives will accept a Firefly Mini.  It is not restricted only to corkscrew models.\nThe Firefly doesn't take up any space in the corkscrew so you can carry a significantly larger amount of Helix Tinder in the corkscrew to use with the the Firefly if you have a knife with a corkscrew.  (Larger size Helix tinder made for the Firefly will be available after the FireAnt campaign if it is successful) \nRedundance is key in a survival situation and you can put different fire starters in different knives so we of course recommend getting both :)\nPledge With Confidence!\nWe will ALWAYS Deliver!\nWe don't just create projects on kickstarter, we help fund them too, and we know how frustrating it is to pledge for a project that never gets done.  We will NEVER do that to our valued backers!  If for some reason we cannot produce the product you pledged for we will send you a FULL refund guaranteed!\nWe have great respect for the integrity of Kickstarter and for the opportunity it and the amazing community of backers has provided and continues to provide for entrepreneurs like us.\nIf you help us reach our funding goal we WILL finish the project and ship your reward to you PERIOD.\nTimeline.\n2009 - Idea.\n2017 - Firefly project.

We've got experience and grit! \n\nWe have completed and delivered on two previous successful Kickstarter campaigns with thousands of happy customers around the world and we have learned some good lessons along the road. \n\nOur first project, SOL Water, was a success, and it taught us a great deal more about manufacturing than we knew before we started that campaign. SOL Water was a very complex project. We were able to develop and produce a new design of plastic, make 3 different complex production lines of tooling, design and manufacture several injection molded parts, ship all of our product to our warehouse from overseas, and deliver all of the rewards to our backers, all on a very tight budget. So, we've been around the block. You can check out the amazing SOL Water project and a link to purchase the product here and click the \"Available Now\" button if you'd like to purchase now for immediate delivery: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/740457940/sol-water-hydration-powered-by-the-sun\n\nOur second project, the Firefly, was even more successful with over 3,000 amazing backers! We really had fun with this one, but it also created a new logistics challenge of getting out a large number of packages to backers in every continent of the world in a timely manner. This time around though we had learned from our previous project and had most of the technical and logistics work and trials done before we even started the campaign which greatly reduced possible production delays and we were able to deliver a great product in full retail packaging to our large number of backers in a timely manner. Check out the game changing Firefly project here and click the \"Available Now\" button if you'd like to purchase now for immediate delivery: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fireant/firefly-the-ultimate-swiss-army-knife-accessory/description\n \nWith this current FireAnt project we have done all of the leg work, trials, testing, and even prototype tooling testing before starting this campaign. Our sparking steel formula has already been perfected and tested with the Firefly project. Our manufacturing partners are standing by ready to make full production tooling and rapid FireAnt manufacturing pending delivery of funds. We are confident that if this campaign successfully meets its funding goal FireAnt backers will get a great product without delays!

All games have been created along Italian authors and the illustrators that you have already seen in our previous titles. Each game has its own identity and the boxes are as small as 12x8 cm. You can carry them with you, slide the matchbox and play in just 20 minutes with cards and small bits that will make the whole experience so satisfying!\nNatural phenomena have had an odd behaviour lately, seasons seem to have been disrupted and animals are migrating in the wrong direction. The 24 East Asian traditional solar terms are out of sync. Your seasons must find their alignment so the sun can find its route again and set the order right among all living things.\nIn 15 days, players will take alternating turns. Each turn choose 2 out of 4 possible actions, trying to receive the  animals pawns for special abilities and completing sets of Season cards for the most points at the end of the game.\nMenace is approaching you. There seems to be a way out, but as a Samurai your first move is to reach for your weapons. Your basic instincts to run and hide have dissolved since the only option left is to fight for your honour. You are a rock and will hold tight, fighting the opponents face to face, using your weapons until the the very end.\nEiyo is a fast paced game where you need to strategically manage your weapons to defeat hordes of enemies. You will need to survive the attacks while gaining honour points that will be crucial at the end of the game.\nAfter relentless days spent diluting solvents and heating liquid mixtures in vials, the air is damp, while the old and overused books stored in the library of your laboratory smell of humidity and dust. The end of the day is approaching and you have just found the perfect transmutation. You decide to stay a little longer, but you know the candles will stay on until they consume completely.\nRebis is a 1\u20134 player game. To win, you have to play your alchemistic ingredients wisely in order to brew the best elixirs and find the right time to brew them to get the most points.\nThe multiverse has spoiled you given the vastness of incredible places and creatures to meet and observe. You smell spices from miles away, your pores dilate, your gills tickle and your three stomachs are growling like an echoing symphony. You get to the source of the tasty fumes faster than a ray of light, your taste buds start working as a glowing sign shows up on the horizon: \u201cServing succulent food and spicy, quenching potions during satellite setting hours.\u201d\nSpace Lunch is a 1-2 players, short, set-collection game. To win, you need to grab your preferred dishes before it\u2019s too late by choosing Food cards from the table. However, beware! Your opponent might interfere with your plans.\nThe new surface of Earth is at its most bleak appearance. It may seem completely infertile and arid, but on the horizon promising mountains of mud and clay arise higher and higher. Golems, the magical mutable creatures, are being summoned with synergies among the resources of the earth.\nGolems is a card collection game where you can use every card in two different ways. You have to decide whether you want to boost your Golem for victory points or save the resource to summon further Golems. With the use of Gems and special Runes you will be able to maximize your strategy to become the best Golem summoner.\nWe have always created games that we really enjoy playing and the Matchbox Collection is no exception, but every time we launch a new line of games, it is fundamental for us to understand if our vision resonates with you.\nAfter a year since our last campaign, we are very excited to share a brief moment with you to shape this new creation together; and this is among the most interesting and rewarding moments for us.\nKickstarter and retail are two very different worlds and both of them are extremely important for us, but sometimes you want to create something regardless of the production boundaries, and Kickstarter is the best place to shape the games we dreamt of exactly the way we envisioned them.\nThundergryph exclusive is a new way for us to experiment, understand the product better and find the best way to make it work; and while we are not offering a retail option, it doesn\u2019t mean that this line won\u2019t have a possibility of hitting retail.\nThese games might become a collectible exclusive to this campaign, but they could reach more players in the future as well.

Only by standing united will you have any chance of victory! \nLearn more about the Optional Buys: Return of the Sinister Six , The Infinity Gauntlet, Enter the Spider-Verse, Rise of the Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy Remix, Tales of Asgard, Playmat, Cardboard Locations\nPLAY\n\n Marvel United: The Core Heroes of Marvel United | The Core Villains of Marvel United | Designing the Heroes \n The Infinity Gauntlet: Learn the Secrets of the Infinity Gauntlet  | Rise of the Infinity Gauntlet \n Other: The Initial Promos of Marvel United \nMarvel United, The Infinity Gauntlet, Tales of Asgard, Guardians of the Galaxy Remix, Rise of the Black Panther, Enter the Spider-Verse, initial Promos, and Stretch Goals\nElektra, Kingpin, Daredevil, and America Chavez\nReturn of the Sinister Six, Squirrel Girl, and Doctor Strange\nNote that anything marked with this: \nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \n\n\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                                      \u00a9 2020 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 42nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is March 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Everything that we were planning as stretch goals have already, automatically, been included in each copy of the game!\nSo instead, we've got some great stuff planned: several polls so you can help to shape the finished game, sneak peeks at game content and components, and contests to win cool prizes!\nOnce again, we're partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information at the end of the campaign.\nWhen the campaign ends, you'll receive a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. As part of this survey, you'll have the opportunity to add more copies of the game at regular price plus $5 shipping per additional game.\nWe are partnering with depots in the USA, Canada, Europe, China, and Australia to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes being charged to you. Shipping to areas outside these regions may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before  placing an order.\nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address.

It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.\nMy influences for this game are rooted in the nostagia of my childhood. D&D, Planet of the Apes, Land of the Lost, Heavy Metal Magazine, Zork, and Monkey Island, to name a few.\n\nIt's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It\u2019s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery. \nYou move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. \n\nYou have an Ally Deck with 6 adventurers (6 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. From this deck you will randomly pick 2 starting Allies. But be warned, your path is paved in blood. If they die, and they will you will randomly select another Ally to take their place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a six-chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice chucking and more! It will require both skill and luck. \nThe hook is simple. In combat you perform actions at a cost. That cost is your character's hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points, which in turn leaves you weak and vulnerable. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles.\nPlease note: This is a simplistic look at some basics in combat. There are many exciting variables to actions and their outcomes detailed in the instructions deck. Check out Kickbacks, Status Effects, Rest meters and more!\nEnemies will fight in a similar fashion, with a few exceptions. They don't spend Hit Points and their actions are determined by the Action Deck.\nEach enemy you will face has different hooks and mechanics to make them interesting. Some have story branches that trigger in the midst of battle.\n\n\nWhat would an adventure be without pesky trash mobs getting in your way? You can't head out on your first quest without clearing rats out of a cellar, right?\n\nMy goal was to make this game with as few components as possible without taking away from the gaming experience. It's a clean minimalistic approach to an in-depth and engrossing adventure.\nThe focus has always been the story deck. The heart of the game. It represents the spire, and each card is a layer you uncover during your descent. \nFrom the very start I wanted ENORMOUS PLAYING CARDS. These are custom 6.5 x 3.5 inch cards. They are about the same size as an iPhone X and they're glorious. Here's what's in the box. \n\n\n\nThis is not a randomly generated gaming experience. The concept here is to experience a specific storyline with multiple chapter branches and endings. Your choices, enemy encounters and items you discover will influence the overall narrative. There are multiple endings to uncover, some more unpleasant than others.\n\n\n\nHere is a look at the current Card Progression Tree for Chapters 1 and 2 to help illustrate the branching paths. Each square is a card. Black = Story Card, Red = Item Card, Dark Red = Encounter. Your story can splinter out in many different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the complexities of the project I want to be transparent with the progress made and what's left to do.\n\nGreg is an Art Director and Graphic Designer currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. In his free time he's pumping whatever pop culture he can into his veins..or dreaming up new encounters for Spire's End!\n\nBenjamin is a Digital Artist from Berlin, Germany currently working as a freelance concept artist and illustrator. These days he uses every available minute for art and game design.\nErica is co-owner of Oaktown Spice Shop in Oakland, CA. Before starting a retail business with her husband, she was a journalist. She loves to cook and drink wine.\nChristian is co-owner of Hop Merchants Bottle Shop & Taproom, a craft beer bar in North Hollywood, CA.  He's a writer, a gamer and horror film fanatic.\n\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. \nThe shipping rates listed below are conservative estimates NOT the official costs. Please note that these estimates are based on the core game. Any Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign may change the weight and the size of the game, which could influence the final shipping cost. I will work to secure the best prices possible and attempt to lower these costs in proportion to the success of the campaign.\nBackers outside the countries listed above may be responsible for their own customs fees and any additional charges if and when they occur. Please message me regarding countries not listed for more information.\nPlease not that Spire's End is a work in progress, product is still in development.\nWarning: This is a fantasy/horror game that contains violence and disturbing imagery.

But with more than 15 years of graphic design and packaging experience, I am merely in a state of heightened panic.\n\nThis project, like many, started with very ambitious goals before it was wrangled into something reasonable for my first attempt. It began as a 12 chapter, 200 card epic. Due to the sheer scope of the game, production costs and the fact that I am just one person, the game is now 6 Chapters, with the hopes to continue later if successful.\n\nThe style guides and templates are set, and the writing for Chapters 1-6 are more than halfway there.\n\nMy aim is to keep things simple without compromising the game as much as possible. That being said, even with \u201csimple\u201d in mind I know that problems lurk around every corner. Game balancing and rewrites take time so I am giving myself a considerable amount of lead time to get this labor-intensive job done properly.\n\nNobody wants this game in their hands more than me. I dream about this thing. I spend my time in the shower planning the next encounter.

Based on the Root: A Game of Woodland Might & Right board game and officially licensed by Leder Games, Root: The TTRPG brings the tales of the Woodland to your RPG table!\nIn Root, you play vagabonds, outcasts from the normal society of the woodlands who have come to live in the spaces between, whether that's in the forests themselves or on the fringes of society. You are competent and skilled\u2014you have to be to survive as vagabonds\u2014and you aren\u2019t tied down to any particular place or faction. You might be a badger arbiter, serving many sides in resolving conflicts and defending their interests. You might be a cat scoundrel, sliding on your mask before you sneak out into the darkness to cause mischief and mayhem. You might be a wolf ranger, at home in the wilds and the untamed places of the woodland. \nRoot is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own games like Masks: A New Generation, Urban Shadows, and Zombie World. It uses the core framework of that system and provides a strong, simple way to tell your own stories of adventure in the woodland. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several vagabond archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of desperate situations.\nRoot creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Redwall, Watership Down, Mouse Guard, The Warriors, and The Guardians of Ga\u2019Hoole.\nThe Woodland is, first and foremost, a deep forest. It hides dark deeds, ancient ruins, and dangerous creatures. The land is not tame\u2014the trees and those who live in them are not safe.\nThe closest a denizen will come to safety in the Woodland are the confines of the clearings, areas either natural or paw-made where the trees thinned out and the denizens of the Woodland built lives. They set up homes and shops and forges, and they found safety in each other\u2019s company.\nOf course, it took no time at all for others to try to take power over these clearings. The Eyrie Dynasties were the first, and oldest\u2014the birds built their homes in the trees above the rest of the denizens, and soon enough believed themselves to be above those denizens in power and status, too. The Eyrie took control of clearing after clearing, until it was the reigning institution in all of the Woodland.\nBut the Eyrie's nobles and petty tyrants squabbled with each other over control and rulership. Until eventually, in the Grand Civil War (only \"Grand\" because it's the most recent), the Eyrie Dynasties tore themselves apart. They were left without enough support, armies, or resources to hold control over much of anything at all. And for a time, the Woodland denizens took charge of their own clearings.\nUntil the cats arrived. \n\nArmies from the far away Feline Empire swept into the now uncontrolled and undefended Woodland. Some denizens of the Woodland fought back, but the invaders were well-trained, well-equipped, and too much for any civilian militia to turn back. The valuable resources of the Woodland would feed the bellies of the Feline Empire. Soon enough, the Marquise de Cat, dispatched by the Empire\u2019s bureaucratic overlords, arrived to take control of the new colony, and the Woodland denizens found themselves under the paw of a new aristocracy.\nAs the cats were consolidating their rule and establishing new industrial buildings to tap the Woodland\u2019s resources, the newly reunited and resurgent Eyrie Dynasties returned to the Woodland, seizing power from the Marquise\u2019s forces to reestablish their hegemonic ascendancy. They rebuilt roosts in the treetops of the Woodland clearings, and opened up full war against the Marquise\u2019s soldiers.\nIn the midst of the blooming conflict, the denizens of the Woodland began sharing secrets and new words in the shadows. Foxes began stockpiling weapons, and mice began stealing communications between officers on all sides of the war. Meetings in root cellars called to a war for freedom, and the fires of rebellion began to smolder. The name of \u201cthe Woodland Alliance\u201d was whispered across the clearings.\n\nThe vagabonds have been a part of the Woodland for as long as anyone can remember. Outsiders and outcasts, criminals and ideologues, exiles and mercenaries\u2014those who didn\u2019t fit into the quieter lives of the clearings, who were hardy enough to survive in the spaces the other denizens avoided. Some dwelt in the forests themselves, completely eschewing the taboos against living in those most dangerous of places.\nIn times of peace, the vagabonds did what others would not, for a price of course. In times of war, the vagabonds found ample opportunity to fill their purses, from scavenging to sellsword work to straight-up thievery. In all cases, they would do what it took to survive, each one finding their own niche of safety and damn the rest.\nBut now, in the midst of this great war that threatens the whole of the Woodland, even the normally solitary vagabonds are finding it more and more difficult to survive by their lonesome. They are banding together, protecting each other, and forming into groups potent enough that even the great powers of the Eyrie and the Marquisate are taking notice...\nThe thick woods of the Woodland keep the denizens contained to the pathways and the clearings. To venture out beyond that safety is to risk running afoul of bandits, foul weather and rough terrain, and terrible things like bears. Fortunately, those paths between clearings are well-worn and patrolled by merchants and armed forces.\nThe clearings play home to many, many different kinds of denizen, from wolves to badgers to squirrels to opossums. But the primary inhabitants of the Woodland are the birds, foxes, mice, and rabbits. The birds spread themselves out among all the clearings, but most clearings are dominated by a majority of one kind of denizen. \n\nSome clearings will be open and friendly to any kind of Woodland denizen, from those who dominate their clearing to those who are from far away; other clearings will fear any strangers who come by.\nAs vagabonds, you can navigate the Woodland both on its paths, and by venturing into its forests, braving the dangers that no others will face.\nIn Root, you will travel from clearing to clearing, and you will take on jobs and missions from diverse sources, and in so doing you will reshape the Woodland as you change the course of the war between those who would rule it.\nTo do all that, the game uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty. The game has a set of moves, bits of mechanics that by and large say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you swing your sword at a towering buzzard Eyrie soldier.\nWhen you try to sneak past a group of bandits to plunder their secret stash.\nWhen you plead with the rabbit mayor to evacuate her clearing in advance of a major battle.\nWhen you try to trick a Marquisate guard post into giving you the food and supplies you desperately need.\nAnd so on. When you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, most of the time requiring some kind of die roll. You\u2019ll roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery vagabond has five stats:\nEach one is ranked between -2 and +3. You\u2019ll add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you clash sword-to-sword with a foe, you\u2019ll roll 2d6 + Might.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things will go your way! If you get a 7-9, you\u2019ll get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next\u2014and you can bet your tail it won\u2019t be good.\nThe Root RPG will have basic moves for all of the different common activities that the vagabonds are likely to get up to, along with special moves for traveling and battle.\nBeyond those basic mechanics, the Root TTRPG features a slew of specific and carefully designed systems for some of the important, unique elements of the Woodland.\nThe Woodland is a big place with many different clearings. The paths between the clearings are safer than the woods themselves, but they\u2019re certainly far from safe. And even though the vagabonds are brave enough to travel the width and breadth of the Woodland, it\u2019s not any safer for them than for anyone else. It might even be more dangerous.\nYour adventures across the Woodland will take you from clearing to clearing, using the paths or slipping through the forests in ways that only the vagabonds can. Every clearing has its own problems, after all, and that means every clearing is a bed of lucrative opportunities for enterprising vagabonds like yourselves. \nTo handle all that travel, the Root RPG features a set of moves designed to allow the vagabonds to move between clearings with ease at a player level, but with interesting complications and concerns at a character level. Will the vagabonds sacrifice their exhaustion to travel more safely along the paths? Will they spend more supplies and degrade their equipment to travel quickly through the forests? Or will they chance being waylaid by the many dangers of the Woodland\u2014anything from bandits to squads of soldiers to BEARS?\nVagabonds are all very skilled and capable individuals\u2014after all, they have to be in order to survive! To represent their capabilities, every vagabond has access to all the basic moves, their own special playbook moves, and weapon moves.\nWeapon moves are the skills that the vagabonds use in combat to wield their weapons with unmatched prowess. Each vagabond will have access to a portion of the overall weapon moves, and as long as they have the right weaponry to then use those moves, they can perform incredible feats, from smashing through heavy armor with a single blow, to bouncing arrows off walls to reach an unreachable target, to taking out unsuspecting foes instantly.\nIn Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game, each vagabond has three tracks representing their wellbeing. Their exhaustion track represents how tired they are, how much energy they have left to give. Their decay track represents how much of their supplies they\u2019ve used up. And their injury track represents how many major blows they\u2019ve taken.\nUsing the three different tracks lets the Root RPG land consequences in different ways, pushing the vagabonds to take different actions to deal with those consequences. A band of vagabonds with all their decay boxes marked will need to seek more supplies or the aid of a blacksmith, and soon, while a band with all their exhaustion boxes marked needs to find a safe place to hunker down and rest. Filling in these boxes will ultimately lead to more stories as the vagabonds move from clearing to clearing to resupply and recover.\nRoot: A Game of Woodland Might & Right, the original Root board game, featured a Woodland at war, caught in a struggle between different, powerful factions. The Marquise de Cat and her industrializing armies; the Eyrie Dynasties and their bureaucratic structure; the Woodland Alliance and its insurgent revolts. The Vagabond was one of the factions in the original game, but its role was often of a single adventurer, slipping in and out of greater conflicts, helping one side, hurting another, all the while ready to tip the scales in favor of one group or another.\nIn Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game, that idea of a living backdrop for the adventures of the vagabond is crucial. Clearings will not sit, static and unchanging, while the vagabonds go on adventures. They will be taken or lost in the wars between the factions. Sometimes those factions might actually improve the clearings. Other times those factions will destroy buildings, take advantage of the populace, and take hold of any valuable resources.\n\nAnd amid this ongoing war between the factions for control of the Woodland, the vagabonds will adventure and tip the balance. They will have reputations with different factions, allowing them to borrow resources or even lead forces from friendly factions, and leading to constant conflict with opposing factions. Their decisions will change the Woodland.\nWe\u2019re excited to bring to you two different books through this Kickstarter, along with digital versions of both and deluxe, Kickstarter Exclusive editions!\nRoot: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game and Root: Travelers & Outsiders will both come in PDF form.

Players will choose a personal design to follow, while trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats! \nCalico comes with many different cat and pattern goals to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are thousands of unique puzzles!\n\n  + Kickstarter Promo Cats \nKickstarter backers of Calico will also receive a special double-sided promo cat scoring tile and four additional cat tokens FREE! These cats add 'largest pattern group' and 'longest pattern line' scoring options, giving you more ways to play! After the Kickstarter campaign, these cards will not be included with the game.\nCheck out this How-to-play video by Bebo of Be Bold Games!\nLearn all about Calico with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCalico can be played solo! The solo game elegantly simulates a 2-player experience by turning the tile market into a conveyor-belt. Players will need to make difficult decisions about which tiles to take, as each turn brings changes to the market. The solo mode is simple to learn and does not involve any of the complexity of upkeep of an AI player - just you and a relaxing game of interesting puzzly choices as you sew your quilt! \n Family Mode\nCalico also has a family mode! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you simply flip over the design goal tiles and only play for cat and color points! It's a super accessible option that anyone can dive into, but still provides plenty of strategy!\n We believe Calico is has such a fantastic mix of approachability and strategic depth, that we decided to put a team together to make it a reality! The rules are simple, and the mechanisms of drafting and tile placement are accessible to a very wide audience. Anyone can perform the basic actions and have a great time trying to puzzle out what their next move will be.\nThe sense of accomplishment of putting together a beautiful quilt will satisfy gamers of all types. Although it is a perfect gateway experience for new gamers, more advanced strategy game players will be right at home with the variable design goals, which make the challenge and reward of each new game extremely satisfying.\n We know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Calico is the perfect game to do just that!\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have retail distribution to get Calico to a wider audience - this means this is your first and best chance to get the game. \nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support.\nThe pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value as our way of saying thank you for your early support. You are all so important the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without each and every one of you, and we very much recognize and appreciate that! We also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. This is going to be a lot of fun!\nWe are focused on you - please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve the backer experience, and we will do our very best!\nRetailers\nCertified retailers interested in backing can email us through our website: https://www.flatout.games/contact. Please use the subject line: CALICO RETAILER when reaching out to us. We would love to connect with you and offer you an opportunity to carry our game. We do not have a pledge level for retailers, but we will offer reduced prices on bulk orders to certified brick-and-mortar retailers.\nRahdo Runs Through Calico!\nTom and Marty from Slickerdrips play Calico!  \nWe have put a lot of time and effort into the design and development of Calico. We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is as good as it can be, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that will simply not be possible without a larger initial print run. As our funding numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and adding fun bonuses along the way!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the components \u2018fully stitched\u2019!    \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Preview!\nCheck out Slickerdrips' First Impressions!\n Check out Plumpy Thimble's Review!\nCheck out The Game Shelf's Preview here!\nCheck out Meeple Mountain's Review here!\nCheck out Draft Mechanic's Podcast Feature here!\nCheck out Open Seat Gaming's Review here!\nCheck out Steph's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out BJ's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out Purple Phoenix's Review here!\nCheck out What's Eric Playing's Preview here!\n Check out Variable Player Power Podcast Episode 1 featuring Calico!\nCheck out Geek Dad's Review here!\nCheck out Off Shelf's Origins article here!\n Check out Inquisitive Meeple's Review here! \n\n Check out Geek Craft's Review here! \nWe know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. You can read more about shipping in Update #6.\nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please contact us.\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the Cardboard Edison and LUCI award finalist Point Salad (available now from AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2020 from Crafty Games).\n What's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. Our approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This CoLab publication of Calico is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's meet the CoLab members!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Calico! You can check out her work here!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.  \n\nAnd, finally, YOU! \nThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about Calico! We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our first crowdfunding campaign, we have done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful. We are also Superbackers ourselves, so we have shown commitment to the amazing community on Kickstarter and have followed along on many other campaigns. In addition, we have members of our CoLab team who have been involved with successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

As a Squire, you get extra points for collecting loot that is useful for your hero, and bonuses towards completing certain quests.\n   Two cards are flipped to either side of the Story deck, so the Loot side is face-up. If you complete a Story, you get to pick one loot card to try to add to your bag.\n Story cards can be completed one of two ways:\n 1.  The item type on the left of the Story card shows the Item Value you need in your bag. \nA red weapon icon with the number 2 requires a combination of daggers, swords or bows that total 2 spaces in your bag.\n 2.  You can also use an item. \n     To use an item, pick a Loot card to take as your reward first. Then, use an item on the new Loot card to fully cover the item you wish to use.  \nA blue armour icon with '-1' means you must cover one complete helmet, shield, or chest-plate with an item on the new loot card.\nThere are a couple simple rules for placing Loot cards in your bag:\nYou must place one full item from the loot card into the same number of empty or occupied spaces in your bag. If you try to cover spaces occupied by items, the entire item must be covered. \n Junk items also count as empty spaces, but deduct 1 point each from your score if left uncovered.\nIf your bag doesn't have enough spaces to place an item from the loot card, (or you don't want to place a new card) you must return the loot card. \n    Once you have completed a story and placed a loot card, end your turn by flipping the story card over next to the deck. (If two loot cards are already there, you get to choose which one to cover.)\nOnce all possible loot cards are claimed, it's time to add up each Squire's points to determine the winner!\n *Hint: Each tier comes with a Score Sheet digital download to keep track of your high scores for each character!\nEach weapon, armour, magic or valuable item is worth 1 point each. Extra points are added for your Squire's card item combinations and bonuses.\n Identical items (ie. two daggers, two shields, etc) placed together are worth 1 extra point.  \nDeduct 1 point for each Junk item still visible in your bag.\nPrint and Play\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, I've made the early version of the Print & Play files available for FREE on PnP Arcade. Download here:\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/squire-for-hire\nBGG - Squire for Hire \nFind the Board Game Geek page HERE and add Squire for Hire to your pre-order collection.\n Playthrough Video (Solo) \nProvided by @Board_and_Brew \n Playthrough Video (Multiplayer) \nProvided by @VorpalBoard\n        Growing up, I was an all-around RPG gaming geek, artist, musician and general collector of nerdy things. I've always been a big fan of old school PC games like Morrowind, Diablo, Dungeon Siege, and Quest for Glory 5. I also collected card games of every kind, and would organise them into binders based on type, colour or just by the artwork that I liked. \nThat love of collecting and managing stuff never died, and served as the inspiration for making a game about the unsung heroes of fantasy - the Squires! (Honorable mention to all the horses and level up perks that gave our RPG characters extra inventory capacity). \n Squire for Hire scratches that inventory management itch, letting you collect and strategically place items in a fast and re-playable tile laying game you can take anywhere. I've packed as much as possible into 18 cards, and I believe have made a game that plays well not only as a single player time-killer, but also a two player game night addition. \n     However,  the game is not yet finished. The tabletop community has been incredibly supportive so far, and I'm sure the game will continue to improve with community feedback as the campaign goes on.\nPrototype Shown - artwork not final\nSquire for Hire can also be played solo, and makes a great way to kill some extra time on your lunch break, or while waiting for a flight, etc. In solo play, you must prove your worth by scoring at least 30 points to get hired! Keep track of your high scores to see how good you can get!\nLooking to play with up to four people?\nSimply grab another copy of the game at the discounted rate, shuffle the two decks together and you are all set! Doubling the card count also works great in two-player!\n\"Squire for Hire is a great game, it can fit in your pocket and can be played solo and with two players. It is ideal for travelling or when waiting for a friend or gaming buddy. It plays quick, has a small foot print and has a decent amount of choices available.\" \n- Matt, The Friendly Boardgamer \nhttps://thefriendlyboardgamer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/squire-for-hire-final-thoughts/\n\"I really like the game itself and how clever it is for just being 18 cards. The story cards flipping to become available loot cards works really well... We played twice in a row because it\u2019s a fun puzzle that plays so quickly.\" \n- Stefan, Foxbo Games\nI wanted to keep everything as lean as possible, without compromising on a quality, professional product that will hold up for hopefully hundreds of plays. And because the game comes in such a small package, the weight was also low enough to include FREE shipping to Canada and the US! International orders will be $5 extra shipping.\nYou also get a discounted rate on additional copies. To add one to your order, simply add $12 CAD (about $9 USD) to your order. (Remember, you can play with up to four people by adding an extra copy! Each copy comes with the bonus KS card).\nIf you've backed the Squire for Hire pledge, you can add a second custom card by adding $52 CAD (about $40 USD). \nFor international backers, your $5 shipping will cover the first two games. For each game past the first two, please add $5 PER GAME.\n What about Stretch Goals? \nSorry, not for this one. To keep shipping costs as low as possible (or free) I am limited in the amount of physical rewards I can add. However, I have included a few little bonuses to make sure this is a great product right out of the gate:\n Squire for Hire Illustrated Wallpaper - A hi-res illustrated wallpaper for your computer or tablet featuring the squires. \n Score Sheets - Download and print these score sheets so you can track your high scores with each Squire.\n UV/Gloss Coating on all cards and packaging. It protects them from dirt, scratches, and moisture.\n Upgraded Hook box - UV coated with printed rules on the inside. The cards do not fit when sleeved, so I wanted to offer something a little more protective than a paper envelope and paper rules. \n Kickstarter Exclusive Squire card - This will be a limited print of this extra card available only for the Kickstarter. We can come up with a new idea and vote on which one we want to include that fits with the theme of the game. (Since the game comes pre-shrink wrapped, this card will ship in a protective sleeve with the game, but should fit in the box once opened.) \n\nWhere can I find more of your games?\nAs an artist, I always have a project on the go in some form or another. I do everything from children's book illustrations and book covers to commissioned paintings and concept art. But I've always been an avid gamer in one sense or another and love designing my own games, even as a kid. The last few years, I've released a couple of my own games through The Game Crafter.

The artwork, packaging and graphic design are already finished for the base game. After the project is funded, I have allotted extra time to get the custom cards drawn. (I have imposed a limit to make sure it doesn't affect the timeline for ordering the cards). \n\nThe games will ship to me pre-packaged (minus the bonus cards) which will save a ton of prep time so I can ship them out quickly.

With an open call for designers, we found a great creative team full of innovative and diverse ideas. We work iteratively off of creativity, which produced a great set of new and fresh games.\nWe are proud to bring you the ten unique and wonderful games that make up Dice & Ink: Volume I.\nJoey Schouten is our developer, and has likely played and studied more roll-and-write games than perhaps anyone on earth. He is currently completing his thesis on board game adaptations of video games as part of the MSc Game Studies, an interdisciplinary study that deals with game design for non-entertainment purposes (such as serious gaming, or educational games). His wide and deep knowledge of the roll and write genre, and an uncanny ability to give meaningful and actionable feedback to designers, make him the person to head up development and scouting for Inkwell Games.\nOdin Phong (sounds like pong) is our Head of Publishing and Logistics, a lifelong gamer with a background in sales, warehousing and management. He brings industry knowledge, entrepreneurial spirit, numbers knowhow, and a growing expertise in the retail games establishment to the team. His contacts in the industry, profit and loss focus, outside the box ideation, and a willingness to undertake the less flashy side of games publishing make him highly qualified to undertake the physical publishing, logistics, and business operations for Inkwell Games.\nCalvin Wong Tze Loon is our Rulebook Editor Extraordinaire. Loves the English language and often uses his acerbic wit to call out injustice. His acute command of the language, and a well honed narrative sense make him invaluable as an editor and fiction writer for our book. Calvin has worked on other great games such as Pasaraya: Supermarket Manager and Fire in the Library.\nToni Catino (Little Island Gift Shops) started designing games when she was in middle school, first with custom Pokemon cards, then with games based on her favorite books and subjects. She loves all things board games, card games, and miniatures, but might love the designing of them just a bit more. Her goal in creating games is always to make something fun, that people will enjoy and want to share with their friends and family, because that\u2019s what board games are for!\nJesse Catron (Coral Relief) is a lifelong boardgamer. His game Salmon Run was published in 2013 by Eagle Gryphon Games, after which he took a hiatus from game design upon the arrival of his 3 children. He lives with his family in Maryland and works as an Optometrist.\nRobin Gibson (Kuiper Kowboys) has been compulsively designing games since he was very young. At any time he has several dozen projects on the go tabletop and video games, but lately his attention has been focused on one-page solo games in the Legends of Dsyx and Paper Pinball series, and illustrating Chris Anderson's Tempus Quest. Robin's major creative influences are only the most obscure video games and cartoons. He's heard that television exists with real people in it, but has yet to see any evidence of this. Robin lives in British Columbia with his wife and a small bird. He works as an educational assistant and homeless support worker.\nRyan Hoye (Icy Dice) began unofficially designing board games 7 years ago when a multimedia art project morphed into a simultaneous movement electronic board game based on Pac-Man. He has officially been doing game design for about 3 years as a creative outlet to balance out a relatively uncreative full-time job. To help foster his design skills, Ryan joined the newly founded Kansas City Game Designers in January of 2016 where he has playtested other\u2019s works and has taken in feedback on his own creations.\nGrace Kendall (Celestial Stories) is a bit surprised to take on the mantle of game designer, but after two years of working on co-designs they\u2019re proud to introduce their first solo game to the world! This celestial storytelling game is a natural fit for Grace, who has been telling stories for years and is often found lurking in the woods (where the brightest stars live). Outside of board games, Grace is a dedicated member of the wizard rock community and spends a ridiculous amount of time writing sad songs about books. When not telling stories, Grace enjoys eating macaroni & cheese and being barefoot.\nNat Levan (PenSylvania) is an experienced game designer known for New Bedford and Nantucket from Dice Hate Me Games, and Supertall and Timestamp from Buttonshy Games, and the 2018 ION award winning American Steel. He loves designing and playing games about cities, history, and overlooked industries. He lives in the Philadelphia Suburbs with his wife, son, and cat, where he has been designing games since 2012.\nJoe Montgomery (Lost at Sea) is a game designer in Seattle who finds his design inspiration from some of the most fantastic and unexplained corners of the world. He loves strange games and is hopeful that his designs will be as thought-provoking as they are enjoyable. Joe is currently working on a card game about constructing massive concrete structures for infamous dictators and a tableau-building game of alien archaeology set in late 1980\u2019s Norway. For the last year and a half, Joe has been bringing these games to the weekly Seattle game designer meet-ups for some brutally honest feedback.\nSarah and Will Reed (Scrapyard Rollbot) are a husband and wife design team. They started getting into board game design when Will wanted to create a board game for Sarah\u2019s birthday. Given the fact he has a vision disability, it was a bit challenging to get the project done by himself. So instead of giving up, he decided it would be a lot of fun to have her involved in the process.That first game turned out to be a game called Scrapyard. More games, such as Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture and Project Dreamscape, followed. Now, years later, Will and Sarah are revisiting the Scrapyard theme for Scrapyard Rollbot.\nBehrooz \u2018Bez\u2019 Shahriari (Flowers over Towers) has been fascinated by games since her first memory: from Prince of Persia and Lode Runner on computers, to multi-day epic games of Risk and pencil/paper games played against classmates in school. In 2008, Bez found modern board games and within a few years had started designing tabletop games. In 2012, Bez moved to London and found a regular playtest group, which allowed for the iteration and continued design/development of her first mass-produced game. Yogi/In A Bind continues to sell well. However, Bez is most proud of her 2nd thing - a game system for which many games have been created and a community continues to develop. Bez continues to self-publish games and started pitching games to other companies in 2019.\nAlexander Shen (Islands of Atlantis) works as a Senior Technical Program Manager at one of those Silicon Valley companies where you have to circle around the parking lot for a space if you show up just a tad too late.

He named his company Cheapass Games, and we're still going today.\nSince that first year, we have released more than 100 original games: card games, board games, dice games, free games, and more. \nCheapass Games in Black and White is a collection of all of our black and white games, with the rules and histories of favorites like Kill Doctor Lucky, Lord of the Fries, Button Men, and many others. It also has many more obscure games, like Escape from Elba, Pennywise, Dogfight, and The Lost Pueblo of Doctor Green, and a few prototypes and unreleased games you've never heard of.\nIf you're a fan of Cheapass Games, an aspiring game designer, or just interested in the history of the company, read on.\nThis is the simplest campaign we have ever run. We have just one product: the book itself, in electronic and paper form. Our \"Collector's Pack\" includes the print and electronic versions of the book, as well as a limited edition book plate signed by James Ernest. \nBecause this is just a book, it can't contain the actual boards and cards from many of these games. However, during this campaign we will also post 30 of the best-loved games in a free print-and-play format, one on each day of the campaign. Check back daily for updates, challenges, and surprises!\nWe will also be playing as many of these games as we can, in a week-long livestream, broadcast from the Greater Than Games headquarters in St. Louis. This marathon will take place April 8-12, the second week of the campaign, and will feature the whole Cheapass Games family, folks from Greater Than Games, and surprise special guests!\nCheapass Games in Black and White will cover more than 100 Cheapass Games in their original form, including the cover art, sample board and card art, and complete rulebooks. We've changed almost nothing in these games, except where we absolutely had to (like removing our old street address from the credits). Note: While games are not playable from the book, we're posting a free print-and-play game every day of the campaign to join our already-extensive library of free games at cheapass.com!\nFor a sample of what's to come, check out these preview sections of the book covering Huzzah! and Kill Doctor Lucky!\nWe don't have a final page count, but our current guess is roughly 600 pages! Along with the games, the book includes designer's commentary on each one, including company history, design challenges, and sometimes examples of the prototype games that led up to the final product. \nThe dimensions will be roughly 10.5\" x 7.5,\" hardback, with black and white pages throughout. (Even for the few games that were in color. Because hey, we're cheap!) \nThis is one of Carol's accounting textbooks, cleverly wrapped to look like the real thing. The cover design is still not final.\nCheapass Games was founded in 1996 by game designer James Ernest and his wife Carol Monahan. Our early games were cheap black-and-white games in paper envelopes, sold without spare parts, so players had to scrounge their own pieces like pawns, dice, and tokens. Two of our earliest games, Kill Doctor Lucky and Give Me the Brain, won Origins Awards for the best games of 1997.\nOver the next few years, Cheapass Games released dozens of titles, sometimes averaging a new title every month. We introduced the imprint \"James Ernest Games\" in 1998, with our first full-color game, FALLING. In 1999, we introduced the Button Men brand, which had more than 20 expansions and over 300 characters. (But for this book it still only counts as \"one game.\")\nIn 2001 we introduced the cheaper-than-cheap \"Hip Pocket Games\" line, which included several small card games priced at $4-$5. Nearly every single one of those games made it into the GAMES 100. And throughout this period, James Ernest continued to design games for Cheapass as well as other game publishers.\nIn 2006, Cheapass Games took some time off. After releasing more than 100 titles, we decided our current business model was unsustainable, and James Ernest took a break to work in the digital games industry, while still maintaining a website full of free games. \nCheapass returned to printing in 2013 with the help of Kickstarter, starting with a deluxe reprint of Unexploded Cow. Since then, we have run eleven successful campaigns, including Pairs: A New Classic Pub Game and Tak: A Beautiful Game. Our latest entries in the \"black and white\" market, Veritas and Fish Cook, were great games, but met with lukewarm success. Thereafter, in this phase we have focused primarily on deluxe games for retail stores, and an ever-growing assortment of free games on our website.\nNow Cheapass Games has partnered with Greater Than Games in St. Louis, entering another exciting phase of our history. This book project comes at a perfect time to collect all the legacy games in one place, and make room for amazing games still to come. \nJames Ernest demonstrates how to use the product\n \"Cheapass Games practically defined gaming for me early in the board game renaissance, much more than big crossover hits like Catan. James Ernest ran the game equivalent of a punk rock zine. Always worth more than you paid, always bold and creative, sometimes simply revelatory.\"\n-Chris Floyd, Game Director, Deck Nine Games \n \"If you've ever wanted to get to know a designer and their games, James Ernest's conversational, familiar style makes you feel like you're in the room with him; chatting about life, games, and juggling. Cheapass Games in Black & White is a fantastic peek into the history of how the company got started and how each game was lovingly cobbled together.\"\n-Jessica Fisher, Gameosity writer and Geek & Sundry contributor \n\"James Ernest not only changed the games industry, he also changed the way the industry thought about itself. By proving that low-fi could be high art he gave it the biggest kick in the ass since Dungeons & Dragons, and earned a legion of devoted fans by doing it. If you want to know how, or you have aspirations to change the games industry yourself, then read this book to understand the importance of being Ernest.\"\n-James Wallis, Designer, The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\"Cheapass Games wasn't just a trailblazer for a kind of lo-fi gaming that put fun first and pricey gewgaws last -- it was a showcase for absolutely brilliant game design, a punk genius of the games world. Ernest's behind-the-scenes history of the company and its products reveal a business as humane, human-scale and idiosyncratic as its games.\"\n-Cory Doctorow, New York Time bestselling author of Walkaway and Radicalized\n\"Quantity is a type of quality.\"\n-Christopher Badell, Editor-in-Chief and Co-owner at Greater Than Games\nShipping is complicated. Here's what you need to know.\n We don't include the price of shipping in our level price, because it's different for different destinations. And if we bake it into the US pledge level price, people mistake the higher pledge level for the retail price of the product.  So, when you select a pledge level, there will be an additional shipping charge based on your location.   \nNow, on to a more detailed explanation of the shipping charges for each of these regions:\nFor US backers, we are offering $6 shipping. Fortunately, this Kickstarter campaign is for a book! That means that we can use the USPS Media Mail Service to deliver your reward. It might take a few days longer, but it is cheap! All US orders will ship from our US warehouse in St. Louis, MO via USPS.\nFor Canadians, we are offering $12 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the books enter Canada. Of course, $12 is not quite the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Canada for every possible Canadian destination. However, it is close to our estimated average, and we really want to make this book as accessible as possible in Canada. $12 is a nice, low, flat rate that we can live with from a business perspective. All Canadian orders will ship from our US warehouse, but be delivered via FedEx Canada - we will cover all customs and import duties.\nFor Australians, we are offering $25 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Australia. Because Australia is such a large country, $25 is not the actual cost of shipping to everyone in the country, especially to the people who live outside of major cities. However, we really want to make this book as accessible as possible in Australia because we know how hard it can be to get US products in Australia. We have lowered this cost substantially by partnering with an Australian distributor and fulfillment house. All Australian orders will be shipped by VR Distribution.\nFor Russians and South Americans, shipping will cost $59 per item. This does NOT include any customs duties or import taxes. Unfortunately, this is incredibly high, and reflects the fact that it is incredibly expensive and incredibly difficult to successfully ship any items to these countries. In addition, we are only willing to make a single delivery attempt to you in any of these countries. If any shipments are lost or returned to us, we will unfortunately not be able to re-ship them. We will refund you your pledge minus a 20% fee to cover Kickstarter and other fees. We really do not want to do this, as it will cost us an incredibly large amount of money (the actual shipping charges, and then the return charges if the item is returned). However, it costs us even more money every campaign to ship multiple times to countries with very complex customs and import regimes. All Russian and South American orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nFor Europeans (including EU countries as well as Norway and Switzerland, but unfortunately not Russia or other non-EU countries), we are offering $17 shipping + VAT. What does this mean? Well, it turns out that the EU has been really tightening the rules on VAT and import duties recently as a result of widespread VAT fraud on the part of foreign companies. You can read some of the details here, but the summary is that, according to EU law, almost all items imported into the EU are subject to VAT charges (generally 20%-25% in the case of board games) based on the actual sale price PLUS the actual shipping cost. That means that, for example, for a $59 game with $17 shipping, the 24% VAT will be assessed against the total $76 price, and will come out to approximately $18.24. Fortunately for this campaign, it turns out that most of the governments in Europe (though not all) have decided that books should be taxed at a substantially lower VAT rate! \nNote that this law applies no matter how we fulfill the campaign. If we ship from the US, each parcel is subject to a VAT charge once it enters the EU. On the other hand, if we ship a bunch of goods to a fulfillment center in the EU, the whole shipment is subject to VAT when it enters the EU and, even though the goods are arriving in bulk, the VAT is based on the actual sales price to consumers (in this case, on what they paid during the campaign), not on the lower wholesale or manufacturing cost, so this method doesn\u2019t actually save any money on VAT charges (though there can be other benefits). In this case, all European orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nVAT rates for books and games vary wildly. If you want to look into it in more detail, this website has a good amount of information. For the rest of you, here is a handy chart!\nEuropean Shipping Questions\nQ: Why are you charging VAT separately from shipping charges for Europeans?\nA: As we mentioned above, the VAT charges are based on the sale price + shipping. If we include VAT as part of the \u201cshipping\u201d charge, EU customs is likely to consider that whole charge to be \u201cshipping\u201d and charge VAT based on the full amount, including what we already charged for VAT!\nQ: How much am I going to pay to get this game in Europe?\nA: There is a fixed $17 fee per item for shipping, which you will pay via Kickstarter. Then, before the campaign is fulfilled, we will correctly calculate each European backer\u2019s VAT and charge you for it via the pledge manager before shipping out your parcel. We will wait to use the pledge manager, since your VAT rate will vary depending upon the final shipping address you give us within Europe.\nQ: Will I have to pay any customs clearance fees or anything when I receive my shipment?\nA: No, you will not! We will have Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK fulfill this campaign for European backers, which means that, after we charge you for VAT through our pledge manager, we\u2019ll handle the payment processing for VAT and import duties on your reward. Then, Spiral Galaxy will ship all of your parcels out from within the EU and avoid any weird delays or further charges.\nQ: Where are you getting all of this information? It seems stupid and wrong and I don\u2019t like it.\nA: We talked to a lot of shipping companies, attorneys, and other professionals about the implications of EU law and how, exactly, VAT works. For a decent summary, the government of Finland has a pretty helpful website (and the information is, for the most part, broadly applicable across the EU).\nQ: Wait, but [insert other Kickstarter here] shipped stuff to Europe for way cheaper than this. Why can\u2019t you just do what they did?\nA: They either lost a ton of money on shipping, or they committed customs fraud, and we don\u2019t want to do either of those things. \nQ: Why do Norway and Switzerland have to follow these rules? They aren\u2019t in the EU!\nA: That is true! However, the customs regimes in Norway and Switzerland are very similar to those of the EU, by design.\nQ: What about Brexit?\nA: Brexit could complicate a lot of things, but what exactly it might complicate about this depends on the final form it takes. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if/when we come to it, and let you know about anything we wind up doing to work through it. Unfortunately, no one knows what will happen with Brexit, including Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. If you have any secret information, please let us know. :)\nQ: I hate VAT; is there anything I can do about it?\nA: Us, too! Honestly, the only thing you can do is vote and call your local politicians. We\u2019ll do the same over here to see if we can avoid a long, stupid trade war.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a fairly low-risk project. We are not unfamiliar with how to print books.

We noticed on our desk a number pad. Unappealing and boring. That\u2019s when we decided to experiment with it and just have fun. The Digit number pad is a retro-themed wireless mechanical number pad, which for sure will make you fall in love with numbers. So go ahead and spice up your workspace.  \nDigit number pads gives you the features of two products in just this one single product. It works as a number pad and a calculator. \nWith standard number row, there is plenty of scope of errors as it requires the fingers to travel a lot slowing down your productivity. The digit number pad is not only made to look good but also to increase productivity by bringing a great tactile response, sturdy mechanical keys making number inputs fun and spontaneous. \nYes, the Digit number pad is a calculator also. Solve your math problems with its stand alone mode and forget your phone. We promote less distraction and more productivity. You can also directly transfer the results to your computer, iPad or phone.  \nConnecting cables is just not our thing so we made it wireless. If that keeps you sane, go ahead, connect the wire. We have both the options. Wireless connectivity with bluetooth with just a few simple steps makes it super easy to use. It can also be used for 1 month after just a single charge.  Go wireless and get organized, be more productive and less distracted.  \nDigit number pad is part of our family and so it has taken over our family\u2019s unique design. It\u2019s inspired by the 1960\u2019s design style, retro, colorful and with quirky dot keycaps. It comes in three color variants, paired perfectly with our four season keyboard. \nGet a physical sensation of knowing that you are actually working. You can hear and feel the keycaps clicking against the pad as you crunch the numbers away, thanks to the Gateron key switches. \nHook up your laptop, iPad or phone at the same time and switch easily. Digit can connect with 3 different devices via the Bluetooth at the same time. \nDigit Number Pad enjoys 2 modes. Check what the Digit Number Pad is capable of:\nShort press the \u2018CALC\u2019 key to switch to calculator mode, and with a short press of \u2018NUM\u2019 key, you can switch between Number Pad Mode and Keyboard Mode. Super convenient and versatile.\nLED Backlight makes the key light up at night when you need extra assistance. With 2 backlights, your eyes can relax and work even late at night.

Although they share the same layout of keys, Digit Number Pad enjoys 2 modes - calculator and keyboard mode.

When pledging, just select the number of decks you want. You get to choose which designs you want in the backer survey we send out after the campaign is over. \nAir Deck 2.0 easily fits on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table\nAir Deck 2.0 is made with the same high-quality materials as the original, but we've made a couple of upgrades (apart from the new look):  \nOur new decks are designed so they\u2019re even more resilient to wear and tear.  \nThe boxes (including our current 1st generation Air Decks) are upgraded to .4mm waterproof synthetic paper, which makes them more durable than the .3mm we shipped with the original campaign. \nThe ink on the box is now more resistant to scratching.\nWe'll be planting mangrove trees to offset any CO2 emitted from production and shipping of the cards.\nThis time around we also offer stretch goals. Several other designs were also popular in our community feedback surveys. For us to be able to offer these, we need to reach a couple milestones:\nStretch goal #1 and #2 reached!\nThe idea for the original Air Deck was conceived by fellow globetrotters Ursus Negenborn and Rune Kippervik while traveling South East Asia. We love playing cards, and we just couldn\u2019t find a deck that was perfect for carrying at all times. As we\u2019re big fans of optimization, we decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers ourselves. \nThe Air Deck founders\nThe original Air Deck that started it all\nWith the Air Deck 2.0 we did not want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.\nWhile regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, Air Deck 2.0 is extremely durable\nThe cards grip nicely and have a premium feel\nThe Air Deck 2.0 takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and is 100% waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of. \nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result is a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on on both sides to provide excellent handling.\nThe Air Deck 2.0 handles well and shuffles easily\nWe created the new designs for Air Deck 2.0 with the wonderful feedback we\u2019ve received from our community. \nWarp speed and Astronauts playing cards come with the same minimalist fronts as the original white decks. For our new classic design, we\u2019ve given the jack, queen, king and the joker a more traditional look. \nDespite their smaller width, the cards are as easy to read as a standard sized decks. The full-sized length ensures that it also handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nOur Classic design has traditional looking face cards\nWarp Speed and Astronauts Playing Cards have the same minimalist look as our original deck\nThe Air Deck 2.0 comes with a durable waterproof synthetic paper tuck box\nWe love traveling this beautiful blue ball we call home, and we believe we should care for it as best we can. There\u2019s only one earth after all. The Air Deck 2.0 is an environmentally conscious product to begin with, as it contains almost half the materials of its competitors. In addition, we\u2019ll also offset any CO2 that\u2019s emitted from the production and shipping of the project, by planting mangrove trees in Myanmar with Worldview International Foundation. Mangrove trees are pretty awesome, as they\u2019re one of the most effective tools to bind CO2 to the soil and prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere. They\u2019re ten times more effective than most other tree species, and as a bonus, they also help sustain coastal ecosystems, protect the shorelines from damage by storms and acts as a filter to maintain water quality. The more decks that gets pledged, the more trees will be planted. \nWe will plant mangrove trees with World View International Foundation\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs of the cards have been finalized, and we\u2019ve made the prototypes you see in the video.

It performs better than nonstick pans that cost over $130, at a fraction of the price. No gimmicks. No BS marketing claims. Just premium, long-lasting performance at an honest price. \nWe love nonstick pans for cooking eggs and delicate foods, but they have always been a frustrating purchase for us. Because the truth is that ALL nonstick pans eventually stop working and start sticking when the coating wears off. There\u2019s no magic fix for this.\nPeople basically have two options: buy cheap nonstick pans that may last a few months or years at most, or expensive ones that may last a bit longer, but will still need to be replaced. Both options seemed pretty bad. So we decided to create something better.\nOur goal was simple. Create an insanely long-lasting and durable nonstick pan, and sell it for a price that\u2019s fair and affordable. We think we nailed it.\nSo how is it that we can make a nonstick pan that performs better than expensive ones which cost well over $100, and sell it for a fraction of that price? Simple. By cutting out traditional retail middlemen and selling directly to you online, we\u2019re able to offer incredible quality, at wholesale pricing \nPeople often ask how long nonstick pans last, and the true answer is \"it depends.\" The lifespan of a nonstick pan is not just related to the quality of the nonstick coating, but also to how frequently it's used and how it's cared for. \nWhat IS much clearer, is knowing when you need to replace your nonstick pan. Scratches. Sticking. Flakes. Hotspots. If your nonstick pan has any of these, it's time for an upgrade. \nBad Nonstick! Bad!\nThe Misen Nonstick System is made of two key parts: an industry leading, PFOA-Free Nonstick Coating, and an innovative Plasma Primer. Both elements work together to form a Nonstick System that is absurdly durable, and provides long-lasting performance.\nA good analogy for how nonstick coatings are applied is painting a wall. While the quality of the paint/coating and number of layers used matters, so too does does the primer, or how the wall/pan is prepared for accepting the paint/coating. This primer layer is a crucial and often overlooked element in making great nonstick. \nRather than using a traditional 'grit blasting' primer method, for the Misen Pan we decided to use an innovative Plasma Primer. Infused with Titanium, the Plasma Primer Layer is 2.5 times more effective than the traditional primers, and extends the hardness and abrasion resistance of nonstick coatings.\nPlasma Primer: How We Tested\nAdmittedly, we were skeptical when we heard about the very buzzword-y \"Plasma Primer.\" There are so many BS nonstick claims (\"it'll last forever!\") and infomercials, and we thought the Plasma Primer might be another gimmick. But after research, it seemed the the Plasma Primer was legit, and we wanted to test it out.\nWith the help of a low-profile shaking machine, we performed a series of forced abrasion tests meant to simulate long-term wear. We tested the Misen Nonstick Pan against many other nonstick pans without a Plasma Primer: Cheap Pans, Expensive Pans, and even Ceramic Pans. The Misen Nonstick Pan outperformed all of them.\nForced abrasion testing to simulate long-term wear\nIn forced abrasion testing, the Misen pan showed considerably less wear than other pans\nIn addition to the Plasma Primer, the second and equally important part of the Misen Nonstick System is...the nonstick coating itself! To again use a painting analogy, the quality of the paint/coating itself, and the number of coats/layers applied affect performance.\nFor our pan, we use Dupont's premier 3-Layer Platinum coating, modified to work even better with our Plasma Primer. This PFOA-Free coating is Dupont's most scratch and abrasion resistant nonstick finish, and is even designed to withstand normal metal utensils and abrasive scouring pads.\n(this was really fun)\nWe know safety is a major concern with nonstick pans, and dislike how many brands omit information about their nonstick, like what coating they use. We want you to be as informed as possible about the tools you're using to cook for yourself, your family, and your friends. To answer a common question of \"is nonstick safe?\", the short answer is yes. PTFE cookware is safe to cook with, but you should avoid very high temperatures. For more information and specifics, check out our FAQ.\nFor the base of our nonstick pan we used a 4.2 millimeter thick, commercial-grade aluminum construction. This thick base ensures a flat, even cooking surface for the life of your pan, and helps provide amazing heat distribution for better cooked foods.\nOn the bottom of our pan, we bonded a stainless steel plate to ensure it's compatible with any heat source. Gas, induction, electric - they all work. \n4.2MM thick aluminum base provides even heat distribution\nA Quick Rant! Many brands claim their nonstick pans are 100% dishwasher safe, and that you can use metal utensils on them. This is terrible advice! While doing either once in a while won't kill your pan, over time they wear your nonstick pan down faster. Don't do it!\nIt\u2019s important your pan feels comfortable and balanced while in use. The Misen Nonstick Pan has a cast stainless steel handle, riveted to the base for a strong, reliable connection that will last. The pan also features a removable stay-cool silicone grip with a textured underside for incredible comfort and control.\nPan heats up. Handle stays cool.\nThe design process will always be at the heart of Misen. Lovingly obsessing over every single consideration of a product is pure joy for us, and it was no different this time around. After countless sketches, prototypes, testing, and an unholy amount of eggs cooked (the smell...), we knew we had a nonstick pan that was truly special. \nCheesy Ending :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter Campaign, and with each successive project we've launched, we've made a point to be farther along in development and ready for production.

Sporkatula? Foonula? We couldn't decide, so we decided to call it Morsel. \nWe wanted to design a better utensil that solved all the shortcomings we saw in conventional sporks and camping utensils. And after a year of serious sporking, we think we've succeeded.\nSquishy but not sticky, for easy scraping on any surface.\n      Eating should never be the crux of an adventure, so our goal is to make eating just a little bit easier, no matter what you're eating out of.\nScrape every last bit of food, every single time. More food in your stomach, less cleaning, and less waste.\nMorsel's long length is perfect for scraping every last bit of food from your Mountain House meal without getting your hands dirty.\nSometimes length matters.\n      Morsel is designed to be more versatile and useful than other utensils. Simply put, it's designed to work better.\nPro Tip: Morsel is a perfect gift for anyone who eats food.\n     Stretch goals are additional goals in case we exceed our original funding target - like if (by some miracle) Morsel goes viral on the interwebs.\nWe have a bunch of wild ideas for spin-off products, and if our campaign is successful enough we'll be able to bring them to life too. Ideas like...\nCool Colors - Get a spork to match your style\nMorsel Mini - Same spork, smaller size\nMorsel Spoon - For the spooning purist\nDo you dig it? Well the only way we'll reach these stretch goals is if you help us spread the word. So please, tell your friends about Morsel. If not for us, then do it for the adorable little Morsel Mini.\nBy supporting Morsel's Kickstarter, you are helping us fund the injection molds and food-grade materials needed to order our first batch and make Morsel a reality.\nBut more than that, you're helping support a couple of freelance inventors who have spent an entirely unfathomable amount of time and energy designing... a really cool spork.\nMorsel Spork is just the start. We want to continue creating innovative and functional culinary contraptions - ones that work equally well for the discerning outdoorsy person, the family picnicker, or the van-dwelling vagabond.\nWe're here to shake up the spork industry, and you're invited.\nWe're two Portland-based product designers trying to bootstrap our way into spork production. We've already collaborated on a bunch of cool freelance design projects, and as individuals we've each successfully launched and fulfilled crowdfunding campaigns. Over the last decade we both worked in product engineering and creative design environments, and are experts at turning napkin sketches into real things (for realsies).\nZac | Website\nAlex | Portfolio | Website\nIt started with a simple idea: to make a spork with a rubber edge.\nZac just wasn't satisfied with the sporks on the market. He vented to Alex about how camping sporks were all basically the same, and they all sorta sucked at being used as eating utensils. He wanted something that would fit any shape - which led to the idea of having a soft, rubbery spoon.\nThis was probably the first of Zac's countless silly product ideas that had genuinely piqued Alex's interest. The whole product could be simple, elegant, and functional - and they felt that previous attempts at reinventing the spork had fallen short of what a spork could truly be.\nThey agreed to tackle the Ultimate Spork Project, and set to work. Following a traditional product design process, they began by examining all the things they did and didn't like about current spork tech. They started dreaming of all the ways they could impove the spork. And they spent beer-fueled nights sketching concepts on post-it notes, sorting ideas, and evaluating manufacturing risks and feasibilty for different concepts.\nAfter a lot of heated discussion, emotions, and coffee, they started to focus in on a general design plan. From there, they spent countless hours sketching and hand-carving sleek models out of foam, creating 3d-printed concepts, and working on the design's functionality and manufacturability.\nThe quest for a better spork was on.\nWe started making a list of all the other little things that annoyed us about conventional sporks. Things like...\nTiny, barely-functional fork tines\nSpoons that drip liquids\nHandles that break too easily\nHandles too short for deep food bags\nWe wanted to address all these common spork complaints, while blending the solutions into a single, elegant utensil. One that functioned as well as any normal kitchen cutlery, and one that didn't feel like a compromise.\nOur designs evolved, literally, into a complex asymmetric shape that allows for continuous contact, whether digging into tight corners, or scraping along the surfaces of big bowls.\nWe've crafted countless prototypes from clay, foam, and plastic, and we've bought fancy 3d-prints to validate and test our design.\nMorsel is the result a year and a half of spork-centric obsession. A quest to create the rad, versatile utensil that we always secretly wanted, and you never knew you needed - until now.\nAs a couple of product design perfectionists, we're proud of what Morsel has become - an expression of form that makes no sacrifices in function.\nOr, in the words of a random internet person...\n     We still need your help to spread the word. If you think Morsel is a cool product, please, tell your friends, and share Morsel on social media.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoth as a team and as individual professionals, we have been integral to countless product design efforts over the last decade.

What if the story depended on the choices YOU made? \nSound familiar? You've probably heard of game books where you get to choose your path by reading a series of text paragraphs each ending with a fun choice. But what if...\nWhat if a game book implemented GRAPHICS into the game play? What if instead of text driving the action, text AND graphics combined to create a visual sensory experience?\nI'd like to introduce you to the next evolution of game books: \nThe Ultimate Solitaire Game Experience\nI'll be straight up with you. We keep current with the Solitaire Gaming Community. After all, we have one of the most popular and successful solitaire board games on the market in Hostage Negotiator and catering to solo gamers is one of our core brand strategies. I am telling you right now these books are an incredible Solitaire experience. And they are so accessible even to those of you that don't normally play games solo. \nThere is zero setup time. Open the book and begin playing. Start and stop at will, play time is whatever you want it to be.\nThey tell a cohesive and engaging story.\nThey include puzzles, riddles, hidden numbers, and other challenges that will test you at every step.\n\"I need a game to play on an airplane tray table\" - you cannot imagine how often we hear this from the solo community. Look no further!\nThe books feature a variety of themes and story lines each with different rules and gameplay twists on the core system.\nOk  I'll throw my personal opinion in here. This is the BEST game book experience I have EVER had and it is hard for me to imagine going back to text based game books after this. And I've played all the greats like CYOA, Lone Wolf, Fighting Fantasy, Sorcery!, and more.\nStill not convinced? Let's take a peek inside... \nLooking at your character sheet, you'll decide how to split your 20 skill points between Strength, Dexterity, and Will. As you experience the book and fail the first few times, you will learn what configurations might be better than others. \n                   Now that you are ready let's skip to the end of the intro (watch the project video for the full intro if you prefer)...\nAha! Your first choice!\nWhich way will you go to start your adventure?\nThe rest of the frames in the book from this point forward have choices of where to go and what to do. You'll encounter foes, puzzles, traps, riddles, and much, much more! You'll need to hurry as time is tracked as you go... Don't move too fast though! You don't want to miss spotting a hidden number that could be critical to your objective... \nCan YOU spot the hidden number in the frame below? (Don't worry, the below frame is from the intro and is modified. This is not an actual hidden number in the book - as to not spoil anything)\nOk this one was simple, the real thing won't be so easy!\nIf this was real and not just a made up example, you would flip to frame 27 and perhaps discover the villain was holding something important in his hand. \nI can tell you want MORE! Well to experience the adventure you are going to have to pledge for these books. But let's look at the other four in the set, shall we?\nThe sacred sprouts known as \"the tears of Nuwa\" have been stolen by 3 thieves. You are a bounty hunter hired to track them down and return the sprouts before the apocalypse is unleashed! And make a bit of money in the process...\nYou'll choose your primary skill... are you a master burglar? A master of disguise? Or proficient with thrown weapons? Choose one and grab your deadly poisons because adventure awaits!\n                  Here is the map of the city you'll see when you start your adventure. Which district will you visit first? With book in hand you will simply turn to the frame where you want to go!\n Will you find the Goddess' Tears and save the world?\n If you don't know what Loup Garou means, here's a hint...\nYep, it means Werewolf (it's French). You've been bitten and you are now a young werewolf. You'll have to learn to control your powers if you are going to find your master and solve the mysterious events going on in the town of Whitehorn. You'll choose your profession and, using the skill tree, gain new abilities as you level up throughout the game!\nThere is a lot of info here, don't strain your eyes trying to read it! We will cover it in more detail in a project update.\n       Loup Garou features combat!  You will fight monsters, creatures, human enemies and other foes! Like this Ghoul! (frame number and info removed as to not spoil anything)\n Defeat your foes to gain valuable Experience Points (XP) and Loot!\n\nEver wondered what it was like to be the mayor of a small town in the wild west? Well here's your chance to find out...\nNo one said it was gonna be easy though! You'll build buildings on a map to earn income, create jobs, attract new citizens, and gain a whole host of other benefits (and sometimes consequences) to help you manage the critical aspects of town! \n     Your Town is the most complex of the 5 books and will take tons of smarts. Can you manage the town as a successful mayor? Or will you fail yourself and the townspeople who are depending on you?\nIt will take every bit of intuition and deductive reasoning you can muster to solve the cases in this one! \nChoose to play as Dr. John Watson or as Sherlock himself. The unique system allows you to play over and over without learning the solutions of each case until you have successfully solved them. But will you be able to ignore your curiosity and play through it again without looking at the solutions?\nYou'll question many suspects along the way... but will you ask the right questions? Will your observation skills be up to the task? (Don't worry! The frame below has been modified and all text changed as to not spoil anything)\nUse your instincts, your intuition, and most of all - your brains, to solve the Four Investigations!\n________________________________________________________________\nIf you aren't excited about these books by now then we are shocked! Quite frankly, we don't want it to end with these books! If this campaign is successful, we will be bringing you even more of these books in the future!\nStill don't believe us? We sent preview copies of Captive out. Let's see what others are saying...\nListen, if you are a genius and lucky enough to get through one of these books on the first try, well then we bow to you (unless you cheated). But the chances are if you are playing legit, it will take you at least a handful of tries to complete one. You are looking at several hours of game play in each book. Think a bit like something similar to Time Stories in book form a bit. Not to mention each book has a point system of achievements you can try to accomplish. And these books are the sort where you can put them on the shelf for a year or several months and you'll be able to revisit them again unless you've got one of those photographic memories where you never forget anything! \nThe retail cost per book will be $22.95, so by choosing any of the below pledges you'll be receiving a significant savings. Choose the full set to get the best possible deal!\nConcerned about shipping cost? Grab a few friends and add additional copies at the same pledge price for each copy. Additional full sets can be added without any additional shipping expense! For example, if you add 3 sets of books for a total of 4, you still only pay shipping as if you ordered just 1 set! \nLimited advanced shipping opportunity for USA backers! We will be shipping some books by Air Freight to make sure we have product available (at full retail) for the Origins Convention in early June. If you would like your rewards delivered early, you can select the Advanced shipping opportunity for an extra $15. We expect these copies will be able to be delivered 3-4 weeks before the main shipping estimated in June. Limit one set per backer, additional sets are not allowed due to limited space.\nWe MAY add more quantities to the Advanced shipping level depending on Demand and availability to do so.\nGraphic Novel Adventures are self-contained games within a book and are English translations we are printing under license of previously released French game books from publisher Makaka Editions. As a result, we will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. However it should be noted that the more we achieve with this campaign, the greater likelihood we will be able to translate and produce MORE Graphic Novel Adventures! \n\"When will the books be delivered?\" \nGet this... files have already been provided to our manufacturer. They are standing by with their hand on the button. So we are planning to be able to deliver these books at lightning speed and are targeting June for our delivery estimate. We just need to hit the funding amount and then we say go!\nWe are offering retailer pledges for USA/Canada retailers that are interested in purchasing 4 or more sets of the books each including the slipcase. Simply back for $1 and send a message to the project creator to validate yourself as a retailer and get our retailer-only pricing. Then, prior to shipping from the factory we will ask you to finalize your quantity commitment, but you can pay at a later date prior to final shipping. We will verify all retailers! \nAuthor and Illustrator Credits (note many use nicknames):\nCaptive - Author: Manuro / Illustrator: MC\nTears of a Goddess - Author: Manuro / Illustrator: Ben Jurdic / Inks: Damien Gay / Translation: Adam Marostica\nLoup Garou - Author: Moon / Ilustrator: 2D / Translation: JF Gagn\u00e9\nYour Town - Author: Shuky / Illustrator: 2D / Translation: JF Gagn\u00e9\nSherlock Holmes: 4 Investigations - Author and Illustrator: CED / Translation: Adam Marostica", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVan Ryder Games has successfully funded and fulfilled several projects.
