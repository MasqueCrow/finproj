[{"backer": "Paul Phillip Meyer", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "My name is Julian Velard. I was born in Manhattan and I live in Queens with my wife and growing family. I'm a professional musician, a songwriter, and a piano player, and I am not Billy Joel.\nWhen I started out in the music business 20 years ago, I thought I was gonna be the next Billy Joel. Instead, I wound up playing piano bars for a living. Now, after two decades of living in the shadow of the Piano Man, I've decided the only way for me to become a STAR is to write a MUSICAL!*\nWith the help of my friend Mark from The Park, I've created a MUSICAL!* about my life. It starts me and Mark and it's a 100% TRUE, BRUTALLY HONEST LOOK AT MY CAREER AND MARRIAGE!** It's the best thing I've ever written and I believe it will make it to BROADWAY!*** \nThis is where you guys come in: staging a musical is a very expensive proposition. The average Broadway show costs around $6,000,000. I do not have that kind of money. I've set up this Kickstarter in the belief that together, we can raise this amount in the next 60 days. I've outlined the steps needed for us to reach this monumental achievement in crowdfunding, beginning with the release of the Official Queens Cast Recording of the MUSICAL!* and the below stretch goals.\nI'm offering some exciting stretch goals including a full production of my MUSICAL!* on Broadway!\n Most Broadway productions have wealthy producers who put tremendous financial backing behind a show. I, unfortunately, do not have any wealthy producers. But for all of you would be \"micro-producers,\" I will be 100% transparent with all the costs of this show. Here is a very accurate graphic that shows all of the money I've spent so far, and what I plan to do with the investment we raise.\nThis is what a MUSICAL!* costs folks, no joke!\nMost Broadway producers get a share of the profits in exchange for their investment. I cannot offer you a share in the profits. But I can offer you several amazing rewards, including the following:   \nSouvenir Letterpress Ticket Good For Admission to Opening Night on BROADWAY!**\nA one-of-a-kind Queensbill\u2122 for my MUSICAL!* that comes with your CD purchase of the OQCR.\nBe a member of my Tech Team!\n\nA digital exclusive 4 song cover EP entitled \"Play Piano Man\"\nPrivate Zoom Shows where you choose the set list!\nFOR SERIOUS BROADWAY!** PRODUCERS ONLY\nA lot of you reading this have been following my career for a long time. I know you (like me) have wondered why I'm not more famous. This is your chance to make a difference and put my name up in lights where it belongs. We need to get this done in the next 60 days before I fall into the rest of my life of being a dad and a husband. IT'S NOW OR NEVER!

I'm a French Singer Songwriter exploring the US and Canada one French song at a time, and I need your help to record my new album in Qu\u00e9bec\nI am a full time, independent, French singer songwriter originally from Paris, France (now based in Portland, Oregon since 2006) exploring the USA and Canada one French song at a time\u2026 I make a living playing music and take care of my own booking, marketing, production and promotion. It's a lot of work but I love it. \nLast June I was selected and received a grant from the \"Centre de la Francophonie des Am\u00e9riques\" (a non-profit based in Qu\u00e9bec) with the help of l'ANIM. As the only French speaking artist from the USA, I got to go and attend a workshop and perform at an incredible festival called \"Festival en chansons of Petite-Vall\u00e9e\" in Gasp\u00e9sie, North-East of Qu\u00e9bec. There, I met a famous record producer Guillaume Arsenault and a wonderful blues-rock singer songwriter Jonny Arsenault who was just featured on The Voice in Qu\u00e9bec. \nJonny Arsenault & Eric John Kaiser\nAfter our collaboration ended last summer, we talked about the possibility of doing an album together. My next album! This will be an incredible opportunity for me and I need your help to make it happen. Most of my songs are in French and recording an album in Qu\u00e9bec, in such a vibrant music scene, would be an incredible opportunity for me and hopefully open many doors and take my career to the next level. I could then present it to bookers in Qu\u00e9bec and record labels in Montreal to get help with promotion and distribution.  \nWhat I need & What you get\nMy last 3 albums have been recorded here in Portland, Oregon. Going over to Qu\u00e9bec to record this next one would represent a big challenge for me and there are higher stakes. I need to pay for \nPlane tickets (over $600), \nLodging (TBD)\nThe studio in Qu\u00e9bec ($400/day). \nThe producer's time ($3000), \nProfessional session musicians (as much as I can afford)\nMixing ($2000) once the album is done, \nMastering ($700), \nCD duplication ($2000) \nDistribution... \nIf I get more money that what I'm trying to raise, it will help me with promotional costs (to pay for a graphic designer to do the cover art, a Public Relations agents here in the US to promote the release, for ads, for touring...)\nUSB Baguette\nIn return for your contributions you will receive anything from\nAn advanced digital download of the album before it's release as well as acoustic demos of the song.\nA signed CD with a hand written note that I will send directly to your home\nYour name on the liner notes\nA T-shirt with a French Hamburger on it\nA hand made flash drive shapped like a baguette with on it all my 4 previous albums. \nAn acoustic concert in your own living room\nA signed guitar (the one I used to tour in Louisiana). Better than a live crocodile right ? \nTickets to an exclusive solo CD Release Party\nGet to play a song on stage with me and my band at our CD Release show\nand MUCH MUCH MORE... (check out the rewards on the right -->)\nKEEP IN MIND IT'S ALL OR NOTHING. IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL I RECEIVE NOTHING (and if the campaign is not funded it will not cost you anything) SO THIS IS WHY I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.\nIF I MEET MY GOAL, the extra dollars will help me invest in marketing to promote the release of the album. \nI'm not alone\nBeing an independent musician, I'm always used to doing everything on my own as much as possible, so asking for your help and support isn't easy. It makes me feel very vulnerable. But I still need to give you a chance to do it if you want. To be part of my team and of this new adventure. Making records is my life, it's why I've been doing this all this time. Your help pushes me to continue to do what I'm doing. It gives a meaning to everything. I can't do it without you. \nKicktarter is not an investment or charity.

I tapped 20 holes in some of the larger trees on the farm and collected enough SAP to make about a gallon of syrup or more.  The pan in th e barn that was my grandfather's worked only for a couple hours due to the prior boils being to hot.  The pan eventually had holes develop and I resorted to boiling the rest with a cooker and propane tank.  I ended up making 1 and 1/2 gallons of syrup that season.  I told a couple co workers about this and they asked me if I could sell them some.  I looked into what the prices were from around the area and sold the syrup to them.  They were waiting at the door the next day excited to tell me how awesome it tasted.  From that moment I knew that this was an opportunity I could not pass on and began purchasing equipment for a larger scale operation.  In the spring of 2015 I expanded to 137 taps and produced 30 gallons on a homemade Evaporator built by my father and a flat bottom stainless steel pan I purchased online.  This summer I purchased a used 2 1/2 by 8 foot Evaporator and several tanks and am expanding to over 900 taps each having the potential to give me between 8 to 15 gallons of SAP and around a 45 gallons per gallon of syrup, I can produce between 160 to 300 gallons of syrup for the 2016 season.  I am asking for your pledge to help me expand again this year and to purchase the candy making equipment and supplies so that I can produce more than just Syrup. I plan on making both Cotton Candy and Maple soft candies. Thank you for your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike all products that are dependent on mother nature, Maple Syrup has two flaws and that is the amount of time the SAP will flow, and how much sugar the SAP will contain. I have put the necessary limitations on the pledges so I am sure to have the minimum amount of syrup needed to fill pledge orders. As long as the amount of SAP flows as it has in the past I am still going to be able to make 200 gallons of syrup.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Shane Cunningham\n4 created \u00b7 1 backed\nMy name is Shane Cunningham I am 30 years old and am a fourth generation farmer.

Our operations are guided by chemical free, biointensive, permaculture practices. We are dedicated to sustainably strengthening our community through healthy food accessibility, outreach, and education.\n\u201cMicro Farms has created an exciting sustainable business model that has taken local and organic food to a whole new level.\u201d -Anna Perks, Business Sustainability Advisor, Boulder County\nJoin the Urban Agriculture Revolution:\nWe are partnering with homeowners in the Denver metro area which we affectionately call our \"Yard Partners.\"  Our community of Micro Farms Yard Partners provide us with yard space and water to install bio-intensive organic gardens and in exchange receive a full share of produce from our weekly Micro Farms CSA. We maintain each Micro Farm, building the soil for seasons to come, and harvest fresh, nutritious food that we then distribute through CSA shares, Farmers\u2019 Markets, direct sales and local, sustainably minded restaurants.\n\"This is the best model ever: lettuce instead of lawn, with a box of organic veggies each week, the satisfaction of precious water used for produce not bluegrass, and a wonderful group of urban farmers to work with. We couldn't be happier to support Micro Farms in their mission.\" - Molly & George Mayfield, Micro Farms' \"Yard Partner\"\nHelp Us Grow:\nAfter our first year of operations, we have found a permanent one acre home in Arvada, Colorado to headquarter our operations and build our model Micro Farm. This will serve to streamline operations, house our new Wash Station and Cold Storage facilities. Our Kickstarter Campaign will allow us to construct these facilities as well as perform essential repairs to storage buildings and replace the existing greenhouse roof. The goal of our campaign is to increase efficiency in our operations, so that we may grow sustainably and increase both the access and supply of healthy, local produce.\n\u201cWant local organic produce? You can\u2019t get more local than your neighbor\u2019s backyard!\u201d - Matthew Zald, Chief Operating Officer, Micro Farms\nEstablish Our Roots:\n$7,200: Washing Station with Integrated Water Repurpose Irrigation System:  Our Permaculture inspired washing platform will serve multiple functions in this system. While streamlining our ability to clean and provide quality control for our produce, this wash station is designed to capture and store water used for irrigating our on site model Micro Farm. Harvesting water for a second use allows us to provide garden irrigation as well as aid in the function of the cold storage facility located below. \n $6,600: Cold Storage: On-site cold storage will vastly increase the longevity of our produce, allowing us to both drastically reduce food waste and increase nutrition availability. The cold storage will be a walk-in cooler built into a hillside and will be just just under 120 square feet. This provides natural temperature and humidity regulation while greatly reducing the amount of electricity needed to operate. The storage is located directly below the washing platform to both maximize efficiency and minimize our land footprint. \n $2,500: Greenhouse: The existing greenhouse is in need of repairs to make it operationally viable. The new roof will be composed of polycarbonate sheets designed to maximize solar gain and heat retention. This conversion is a crucial component in extending our growing season and the size of our production by allowing us to start large numbers of seedlings for our outlying Micro Farms and producing multiple harvests through the year. \n$3,200: More Micro Farms!! We have a growing list of excited and willing homeowners that are eager to convert their lawns into local, organic gardens! While we are incredibly grateful to see our Micro Farm family grow, each new site comes with installation costs, such as materials for our customized drip line irrigation systems. As our organization has grown in size, we are hoping to rapidly increase the number of Micro Farms this coming season in order to aid us in our mission of increasing hyperlocal food production and accessibility. \n $500: Shed Repairs There\u2019s nothing special about sheds, but they\u2019re a farmer\u2019s best friend when storing tools, equipment and supplies at the end of the day. Fortunately our new headquarters have two of them, but they are in need of some serious repairs, if they are to keep out the elements and any curious creatures.\nWhy Micro Farms?\nColorado\u2019s population is forecasted to increase approximately 60% by 2035 and double by 2050 with most forecasted to occur along the Front Range. The State projects a significant future water supply gap, beginning to develop in the 2014 and growing to 1,000,00 acre feet by 2050. The gap will primarily result from municipal and industrial needs. By 2050, total municipal and industrial water demands are projected to double relative to 2009 demands. Currently, Denver Water estimates that 48% of it\u2019s retail water is being used by single-family homes with the average user using 50% of that water for maintaining their lawns. Lawns use enormous amounts of water and only produce extra work, i.e. mowing, for the homeowner. Furthermore, according to the USDA, consumer demand for organically produced goods continues to show double-digit growth. Also, organic products have shifted from being a lifestyle choice for a small share of consumers to being consumed by a majority of Americans with two-thirds of consumers interested in buying local to support local economies.\n\"The folks at Micro Farms have mastered the Simple and and the Brilliant: who knew that our urban/suburban expanses of lawn could be tilled into organic veggie patches? Don't mow - let it grow! They've developed a brilliantly simple way to re-purpose land and precious water into beautiful gardens through hard work and tender care. Sean Conway and his group are professional and a pleasure to work with; we were delighted to donate part of our back yard to them.\" - Molly and George Mayfield, Micro Farms' \"Yard Partner\"\nMicro Farms is poised to divert homeowner\u2019s water usage to more productive uses for our local community as well as to capitalize on the increased population and demand for locally grown organic food.\nMicro Farms in the News:\nDenver Channel 7 ABC: \u201cLakewood startup wants to farm your yard for free\u201d \nhttp://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/lakewood-startup-wants-to-farm-your-yard-for-free\nDenver Channel 31 Fox: \u201cMan turns people\u2019s yards into micro urban farms; everyone benefits\u201d \nhttp://kdvr.com/2015/09/01/man-turns-peoples-yards-into-micro-urban-farms-everyone-benefits/\nThe Denver Post: \u201cLocal Farmer brings unique business to residents\u2019 backyards in Golden\u201d \nhttp://www.denverpost.com/golden/ci_28700984/local-farmer-brings-unique-business-residents-backyards-golden\nSeedStock: \u201cColorado Man transforms backyards into Micro Farms\u201d \nhttp://seedstock.com/2015/10/12/colorado-man-transforms-backyards-into-micro-farms/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any building projects there are inherent risks of unforeseen circumstances, delays, weather, and budget.

I remember the joy of watching blank pieces of paper slowly birth images out of nothing. Now that my work is almost exclusively digital, I miss the opportunity to savor the magic of watching an image develop as I had with the earlier methods. \nThe vision\nMy project is for a camera that simultaneously captures scene and movement in a singular image, rather than stitching it together through a series. Instead of revealing two degrees of reality as with the traditional established shot, this project will capture the moment as a world unto itself. Not only will it allow me to leave a legacy unique to the history of photography and to the art world, it will connect me as an artist to the roots of my craft using silver highlight prints, and as a man profoundly inspired by a childhood spent working with my father. \nI seek funding to build a circular camera with a seven-foot diameter that photographs onto a 4\u2019 by 25\u2019 Halide print. This construction removes the separation between medium and subject, placing the subject intimately within the camera rather than apart. Rather than have the usual scenario where the camera and subject are separate, this places the subject within the camera and creates a more intimate experience between medium and subject. In turning the camera within itself, it also removes the photographer and lets the subject dictate the final results more. It is also important to effectively utilize this unique format by shooting an equally unique scene: A model will play an angel hatching out of an egg. The action will be played out while the camera takes a simultaneous image of the action occurring. \nWhat's needed\nTo complete this vision, I seek $5000 to fund the following aspects of the process: The design of this camera is for a four-part modular system which allows the camera to travel without the dependence on a heavy vehicle. The blackout cloth listed below will be used on the inside of camera to make it light proof. The photo paper is the film itself. Since this design calls for a 25' seamless image, the only option is the use of two 53\u201d x 100' rolls of photo paper. The latent image will need to be developed by use of darkroom chemicals and three large trays. The trays need to be of a special construction due to the size of the photo paper and in order to be resistant to chemicals and acids.I estimate a total of six weeks to finish this project from acquisition of funds to completion: two weeks to both acquire the materials and cast the model, two weeks for construction of the camera, and an additional two weeks to construct the egg and wings. In the event that I have overfunded the project, the overflow will be redirected into the project itself, i.e. purchasing more elaborate props and setting up the scene within the camera.

The comic began in 2007 and today there are nine volumes. Each one is its own story and an entry point to the larger universe of Atomic Robo.\nWe started publishing these archives to the web, at atomic-robo.com, back in January of this year. All nine volumes are already online for free. Currently, all-new never before seen content is going up starting with The Trial of Atomic Robo. The highly anticipated all-new volume, The Ring of Fire, starts soon with a prequel story to catch folks up on the world of Atomic Robo! \n But don't just take our word for it, here's some praise for Atomic Robo: \n\"Unanimously heralded by fans, creators, retailers and critics as the perfect first comic to give to a non-comic-reader.\" - CBR\n\"It's smart, but its also a hell of a lot of fun.\" - IGN\n\"Thanks to a terrifically focused creative team, 'Atomic Robo' remains concerned with crafting a greater fiction, maintaining a sleek comic book pace, and welcoming new readers at every turn.\" - Multiversity Comics \n\"Entertaining, but a bit Underwhelming\" - Sean Rueter \"s1rude\"\nGOALS - HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!\nAtomic Robo started as monthly print series available through comic shops. We changed all of that at the beginning of this year by putting everything online. The response has been amazing. We reached over 100,000 unique visitors and served over EIGHT MILLION pages. But we recognize that a lot of folks still prefer physical copies. For instance, our core audience who supported us from the beginning! Or our new fans who want to own a piece of Atomic Robo. \nSo we're gonna reprint every volume and we're gonna do it right. These aren't just the same old trade paperbacks with new logos. No, no! We\u2019re making some crazy improvements while we\u2019re at it.\nYou always asked for hardcovers. So, boom, you\u2019re getting HARDCOVERS.\nWe're re-lettering the first five volumes to be in line with the improved fonts of later volumes.  \nEvery single volume will include exclusive all-new material in the form of THE SECRET FILES OF DR. DINOSAUR. These are going to be completely sane and ordinary. Behold! \nWe want all nine volumes of Atomic Robo back in print so every volume is available to everyone. We spent a lot of time evaluating how to best handle this, and ultimately decided on \"grab bag\" reward tiers. It's a little weird, so we're gonna talk you through it.\nGrab Bag?\nYou will not be able to choose exactly which books you're getting unless you order all nine of them. Every tier between one and eight volumes will be a randomized set of books. But don't worry, each book you get will be unique, i.e. no repeats.\nThis lets us control the inventory so we can make reliable cost projections and deliver these to you below retail prices. And let's be honest. There\u2019s nine volumes of Atomic Robo. If you\u2019re here, you like at least eight of them. The odds are in your favor.\nPracticality\nPrinting nine volumes is a logistical obstacle course. Allowing individual backers to select their sets of books would radically increase the cost of shipping/handling, increase chances for errors, and make it almost impossible for us to make accurate cost projections. Most importantly, we have to reach a minimum print run for each of nine different books or risk selling them to you at a deep loss. And then go bankrupt. And then no more Robo. Let's not do that.\nThe best way to keep the inventory under control and to guarantee the lowest prices on these books is to offer \u201cgrab bag\u201d reward tiers. \nPhilosophically\nWe\u2019ve always said, \u201cYou can start with any volume and read the rest in any order.\u201d Now that we\u2019re in control of publishing Atomic Robo, we\u2019re pushing that aspect hard. These hardcovers don\u2019t even have numbers on them! Each story is an entry point into the larger Atomic Robo mythos. \nWe've heard it a million times at conventions: \"But which one's first?\" SPOILER ALERT: it doesn't matter! We already made every single volume an ideal entry point.\nSure, you need that completionist mentality to keep track of The X-Men or Batman. We get that. But it has no place here. Especially now that the entire Atomic Robo back catalog is online for free. If you really, really, really need to read this stuff \"in order\" then start here.\nBut, hey, we know it\u2019s a little weird to get random books. So, we\u2019re gonna help out those of you willing to support this crazy endeavor. Since doing grab bags will help reduce the price of production across the board, we're cutting prices on every item in this campaign.\nEach and every volume you get through this campaign is discounted AT LEAST 20% versus the retail price. PLUS you get DRM-free PDFs. To make this savings as clear as possible, every tier posted below calls out its discount in dollars.\nHigher reward tiers include postcards from the Atomic Robo universe; being included in a special thanks/sponsor section in the books themselves; becoming a canonical Action Scientist; or getting original artwork from the series!\nWOW. WHAT VALUE. WHAT OPPORTUNITY. YOU SHOULD ALL RUN - DON'T WALK - TO THAT BACKER BUTTON - TODAY!\nA NOTE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nWe ran into a host of issues with international shipping during our previous campaign. A lot of shipments disappeared, got returned, or were damaged before they got to our backers. We did a lot of reshipping. And in some cases we had to reorder high-dollar exclusive items to replace what was lost. We were using standard international shipping because it was the cheapest option for you guys. But this didn't offer any sort of insurance, so all the extra costs were on us. There was no customs brokerage either, so many of our international backers felt they had to pay for shipping twice.\nNever again.\nThis time around we're dealing with packages that will be weighing in excess of 13 POUNDS (6KG!) so international shipping costs will be high no matter what we do. Even so, we were horrified at the idea of hundreds of dollars worth of books getting lost or damaged. And we don't want our international backers being asked to pay for additional fees upon delivery. \nSo this time around, anything OUTSIDE the U.S. or CANADA is getting shipped via UPS Worldwide Expedited. This service gets your goods to you in FIVE business days max. It includes tracking, insurance, and customs brokerage. If anything goes wrong with these shipments, you will know immediately, and we will be able to respond faster than ever. Best of all, we'll get refunds for any lost goods and the shipping so we can easily replace them without eating into already slim profits.\nThat said these services do not come cheap. The next service down didn't include insurance, customs brokerage, or live tracking, and was around 2/3 the cost. Given our previous experience, we did not consider that savings worth the risk. If we ran into any of the international shipping problems from the previous campaign, we'd have to re-ship, we'd still be out of all the money, we still wouldn't know what happened, and you'd still have paid more in shipping for essentially no reason. So, we're only offering the fastest/most secure option for outside the U.S. and Canada. \nCanada gets a bit of a pass on this. We didn't see many Canadian packages go missing, but when they did it still stung. So we're shipping via DHL International with Delivery Confirmation. This literally cuts the shipping cost by 1/3rd for those of you in the Great North. Higher tiers will still be pricey to ship, but remember at those levels we're moving 13lbs/6kg worth of books and other goodies.\nP.S. - We're working with BREADPIG to make sure things stay on track. Mostly this means keeping shiny objects away from us as much as possible. It's a tough job, but they're up to it.\nPickyDuck helped us put together the video. They're awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRe-lettering will take some time. That's been scheduled for. \n\nLayout will take some time pending how many SECRET FILES OF DR. DINOSAURS pages there are per volume. The total page number for those will be part of our stretch goals WHOOPS SPOILER.\n\nBut those are manageable. What we're most worried about are port problems. The West coast had a pretty nasty strike during the last half of 2014. If something of that calibre happens again while we're waiting for books, there's nothing to do but wait longer. \n\nWe're also working with BREADPIG. They've done over 10 million dollars in crowdfunding projects.
