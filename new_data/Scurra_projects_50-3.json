Cold-blooded betrayal has never been so much fun!\nWe played over 100 games at UK Games Expo with overwhelmingly positive feedback. With the art and design complete, we need to raise \u00a33000 to get Game of Blame professionally printed.\n        Choose from one of six Roles. Advanced rules add unique abilities to further your ambitions.\n  Each turn you raise Issues by playing up to 3 cards onto the Blame pile. Each Issue played must share at least one emblem with the card beneath it. The number of Issues you play triggers an event:\nPlay no issues, draw 3 cards\nPlay 1, draw 1 card\nPlay 2, swap 2 Roles\nPlay 3, accuse another player\nIf an Issue\u2019s emblem matches your Role\u2019s emblem \u2013 it is your responsibility.\nWhen you accuse someone you both go through the Blame pile and count up your responsibilities. If the accused player has more, they take the Blame pile. Otherwise you must take the Blame!\nAfter someone has taken the Blame, the other players may take advantage of the confusion by burying a secret. Take a card from your hand and hide it under your Role card.\nPlay then restarts with the blamed player turning over a card to start a new blame pile and then taking a normal turn.\nThe game ends immediately when the draw pile is empty. Everyone counts up the Issues in their hand that match their current Role and add 6 for each Treason card. The higher your score, the worse your punishment.

We're giving you an extra pair free to compensate.\n      Having stumbled upon a study by social psychologist Dr. Adam Galinsky proving colorful socks literally change the way we think, act and how others perceive us, we knew we had to test the theory.\nWe created a batch of incredible socks and went to work. We found those wearing colorful socks received 427% more comments on how well they dressed and 97% of people wearing Bryt Socks felt happier and more confident! \nAs a result of our research and requests for more designs we injected 8 proven features into the drab sock and created the ultimate 25 designs. Bryt Socks say - 'I know the rules and I\u2019m confident enough to break them.'\nSee what our founding community from June 2015 had to say.\nAfter our first campaign we shipped over 10,000 socks from a limited range of 9 designs in the most unforgettable boxes on the planet. Our backers said:\nSo we listened, enhanced the technology and brought you more enviable designs to choose from.\nWhether you're at work, the gym or its time to play, Bryt Socks 2.0 will make you the standout performer and centre of attention.\nSince our first campaign in 2015 we've got much better at producing the ultimate colourful sock. We're now able to bring you more designs for a better value at up to 51% off retail prices.\n  Prices shown in USD and EURO are approximate conversions from GBP. \nOnce the project ends, we'll send you a Backer Survey to gather your design and size choices. Pick how many pairs you want at this stage.\n    Bryt means - BOLD\n  9 designs wasn't enough. With plenty of requests for more we created the ultimate 25 designs.\n  25 Awesome Designs\nWe learnt that shipping charges feel bad but are essential to receiving your product. As a compromise we're throwing in an extra pair for International backers and complimentary shipping for all UK pledges.\n      We have partnered with Playtonic, a fellow British Kickstarter-funded company to dream up the merchandise item you\u2019ve all been waiting for\u2026 limited edition Yooka-Laylee socks!\nTo buy a pair, select a reward tier between 1 - 9 pairs and when our campaign ends you can choose your size and design options in the post campaign backer survey. You\u2019ll want to keep a pair fresh for when Yooka-Laylee arrives.\nThey're crafted in the same material with the same added features as the rest of our range of 25 designs.

That is why I have turned to Kickstarter\u2122 to turn this University project that has expressed my ambitions and utmost dedication, into a fully fledged video game.\nWithin the Metro Manager game, players will take command of a Metro Station and utilise pathways, escalators, elevators, CCTV, Staff and much more, to run an efficient, profitable and most importantly, safe Metro Station.  In order to do this, players must be able to satisfy an important criteria of 5 demands:\nSafety - This is determined by how secure your Station is to vandalism, theft and emergency situations.\nSanitation - This is determined by how clean your Station is. Litter, puddles and footprints are only some of the circumstances that negate this demand.\nAvailability - The more amenities your Station offers your Commuters in the form of Vending Machines, Advertising, Ticket Booths or Coffee Shops, the better this demand is satisfied.\nReliability - Commuters in the Metro Manager world love a fully staffed Station. Absence of Station Staff  will hamper this demand.\nAccessibility - Commuters prefer a quick transit between the entrance, to the platform. If your Commuters are left wandering aimlessly around your Station, confused as to where the platform is, this demand will plummet.\nOf course, satisfying these demands is only half the battle! Each demand will at some point, cause ramifications for another. For example, satisfying the Safety rating will inevitably cause Accessibility to drop, as the precautions, such as installed Ticket Barriers to ward off freeloaders will increase Safety, but also decrease the time it takes to transit between Entrance and Station.\nPlayers will make money in the Metro Manager game through ticket sales, and may also acquire further funding from third party sponsors, such as installing a Bicycle Hire outside your station, to encourage more people to commute more efficiently, whilst pocketing the profit made from the freedom of choice.\nIn terms of what I am raising funds for now, is to get Metro Manager actually rolling as a game. Most, if not all of the in-game assets have been drawn out, and digitally rendered to my satisfaction, and the logic of the game is also complete, now I turn it to the kindness and gratitude of our Patron's to help me get this game - for lack of a better phrase - on track!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a Game Programmer, my skills in C# coding as well as with handling the Unity game engine (of which I am hoping to build the game on) are primitive, at best. I still need a lot of education within those realms, however I remain optimistic as I am not a person to easily back down from something I know next to nothing about. This is my dream and I am going to do everything I can to the letter, to ensure it's delivered on time.\n\nAs for when I imagine Metro Manager to be released, I am hoping for a early 2017 release, ideally January.

She is not easily pleased, but what god is? To prove your worth you must perform sacrifices according to Inanna\u2019s sacred rituals. Place your workers in workshops to gain resources and goats. Offer up the resources to Inanna and use the goats to trade for new workshops and abilities. Only the swiftest and cleverest noble will become the ruler of Sumer.\nA worker placement video game! \nSumer takes the board game mechanic of worker placement to a new level. Each day, you and your competitors will awaken at dawn to begin your worship. Run and jump around the ziggurat to place your workers so they'll collect resources. You only have 2 workers, so you better figure out your strategy, move fast, and claim workshops before your friends beat you to it!\nReal-Time Dynamic Auctions! \nWhoever is willing to sacrifice the most goats gets Inanna's blessing! The auction is simple \u2014 just move left or right to change your bid in real time. Each auction is a mind game of bluffing and bravado, and you never know an item\u2019s real price until time is up! Trick your opponents into overpaying for their bids while you snag good bargains for your own!\n                                                       For an in-depth look at the basics of how the game is played, check out our gameplay explanation video:\n1-4 players - Play local with up to 4 players. Master playing solo or try to beat up to three of your friends.\nDevious AI - A variety of personalities and skill levels makes the game a challenge for any player.\nOnline multiplayer - Much of the development funding from this Kickstarter will go towards letting you test your skills online against friends and strangers.\nComfortable game length - With a game experience of 20 to 30 minutes, Sumer plays in a fraction of the time of a comparable strategy board game.\nInfinitely replayable - Randomized setup and a huge variety of different auction items make each playthrough a unique strategic experience.\nNuanced strategies - There is no single key to winning. Being quick on your feet and making smart long-term investments are both crucial to victory. \nSumerian culture - We\u2019ve worked with professional historians to bring you the ancient civilization that invented writing, beer, and board games.\nCustomizable gameplay - Play the way you want by turning on variants like Big Head mode and Hidden Auction Items.\nYour controls - The game can be played with controllers, mouse and keyboard, all at the same time! \n\nWe wanted to make sure that playing Sumer felt like playing a board game designed from the ground up to be a video game. While there are digital versions of existing board games, we wanted to make something that took advantage of the affordances of video games - in other words, a board game that could only ever be digital.\nThe two board game mechanics at Sumer\u2019s core are worker placement and auctions. We gave each of them a digital twist to bring them to video games. \nEach mechanic has its own phase, and the two are deeply intertwined. Use the worker placement phase to compete for points and prepare for the auction. Then, use the auction phase to build your strategy with items that will help you get more points in the next worker placement phase. Learning to take advantage of both phases is therefore key to victory.\n \n\nAs ancient civilizations go, Sumer is pretty obscure. Heck, most people think it\u2019s called \"Sumeria\". That\u2019s understandable, since the culture was lost and forgotten until only about 150 years ago. \nWith the help of historians and our own research, we drew from a wealth of Sumerian culture and mythology that inspired the mechanics and visuals in our game. We hope you get to know this intriguing ancient culture while playing.\n\nDid you know that Sumerians...\n\n...invented writing? Originally used for counting bushels of barley, the written Sumerian language, like Latin, was used for thousands of years after their culture came to an end.\n...built the first cities in the world? We actually chose Sumer as our setting because we wanted to create the sense of building up a city from nothing.\n...invented both beer-brewing and the drinking straw? They used huge straws to sip beer out of massive pots without having to drink the muddy part at the top.\n...wrote the world\u2019s first literature? They composed the cycle of Gilgamesh stories which became the basis for the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered the earliest great literary work.\n\nGugalanna, Bull of Heaven\n\nAtmospheric Music\nAlthough we know what materials and instruments the Sumerians used, nobody knows exactly what their music sounded like. Armed with contemporary research and the few surviving examples of ancient Mesopotamian music, composer Neil Quillen has created a beautiful, atmospheric soundtrack. Try giving our title screen music a listen:\n                                      UPDATE: \nFor $75 you can get the FOUR NOBLES and a t-shirt!\nFor $500 you can voice goats, workers, sound effects and music. A special option will be available in game that turns on your set of custom sound effects.\nIf we hit our goal of $25,000, we will release the great game of Sumer on PC and Mac. But even more funding gives us the possibility of adding additional features and would allow us to bring the game to more platforms.\nWe formed Studio Wumpus to explore the exciting possibilities of digital board games. If we combined the social experience and elegant systems of board games with the visceral thrill of video games, what sort of new experiences could we create?\nWe\u2019ve been working on Sumer for the better part of 2 years. The game was jointly designed by the four members of the team, with each member taking over an important development role as we progressed. Although the initial phases of development were supported by the NYU Game Center Incubator, we've been working independently without external funding since fall 2015.\nWho are we?\nOur core team consists of four people: Misha Favorov, Sig Gunnarsson, Josh Raab and Geoff Suthers. We handle the design, code, and implementation of everything in the game.\nWe have been working with several freelancers to create our stunning visuals and music, including artists Jet Landis and Adam Alexander, and composer Neil Quillen.\nWe are in the final stretch of the game development process, but there is plenty left to do in the next few months. That is why we need your help!\nThe greatest task ahead of us is implementing online multiplayer, but we will also be commissioning art, music, and voice-over work and adding that last bit of extra polish to the game. Visual feedback and high-quality voice acting gives better cues to players, helps with learning the game, and creates a more engaging experience for both players and spectators.\n\nSumer is a game about its community of players, something we want to share with as many people as possible, and we feel that online play is vital towards letting Sumer reach its potential. The more people that play it and master its strategy, the better it will be for the community.\n\n\nWe were Greenlit by our amazing community in just 8 days! We\u2019ll get Sumer up on Steam Early Access within the next few of months and once it\u2019s up, you will get constant updates on the game until we release it at the end of the year.\nA successful Kickstarter campaign means we are able to implement online multiplayer and get the game to it's community in less time. It will let us continue working with our incredible freelance talent for more great art, music, and voice-over work. It will let us make our best version of Sumer. The finish line is in sight, and we can get there with your help.\n www.sumergame.com | Facebook | Twitter | Steam Greenlight", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is always a risk to making a whole new kind of game like Sumer. Breaking new ground means that there haven\u2019t been many games we can look to for guidance. The good news is, we\u2019ve already spent the time figuring most of this stuff out. We\u2019ve iterated continually on our user interface to make the game easier to learn and understand so that players can enjoy the fast-paced gameplay. Of course, nothing is perfect, and there may be unexpected delays as we make improvements based on feedback from the Early Access community.\n\nBeing a new game studio also has its challenges. We have a strong background in game development, but this will be the first time we\u2019re self-publishing on Steam or consoles. We expect some kinks in getting the game onto all target platforms, but our network of game developer friends and contacts will help us get those sorted out quickly.\n\nRest assured: Sumer will be released. If unexpected delays accumulate and funds deplete, we will still work hard to get this great game into your hands.

Using some of the world's most beautiful works of art, players complete these masterpieces using transparent cubes in an attempt to become famous artists. It takes about 40-60 minutes (approximately 20 minutes per player).\nStarving Artists is played over a series of turns. Each turn represents a new day. On each day, you must choose between: buying new canvases, painting the canvases you already own, or working in order to get more paint. If at the end of the day, you've completed a masterpiece, you can sell it to earn more paint and food.

But, you'll be competing in the limited marketplace for paintings with anyone else who wants to sell.

Players take turns launching their squadrons, dogfighting in space, firing torpedoes at the enemy carrier, and escaping back to their own mothership. There, they reload, refuel, and line up on the flight deck to launch on another mission. It's a Sci-Five Minute game, built on the Unity Engine, that you won\u2019t want to miss!\nHow It's Played\nBoth sides begin the game with:\n1 Frigate - a support ship that maintains a defensive line against incoming enemy fighters and bombers, and can help recover damaged ships\n3 Starfighters - starships that are purpose-built for shooting down enemy fighters, but can be used to torpedo the enemy mothership\n3 Torpedo boats - heavy attack starships that are purpose-built for taking out the mothership, but can be used to shoot down enemy fighters\nPlayers get a dice roll on their turn and have a number of options available to them according to the result. Some numbers give you multiple options, so you'll have to choose which to do.\n1-3 Activate a Squadron - Advance a launched squadron this many spaces towards the enemy carrier. If the squadron is within this many spaces of the enemy carrier, it fires a torpedo at the enemy then turns and begins the trip home.\n3-5 Activate the Carrier - Advance a squadron one space in your own carrier. Squadrons need to be recovered upon arrival, then moved from the flight deck to the hangar bay to be refueled and rearmed, then returned to the flight deck for launch.\n5-6 Activate the Frigate - Move the frigate one space in either direction. The frigate acts as a support ship, shooting at enemy spacecraft and repairing damaged friendly spacecraft. Each starship counter is double sided. One side has a squadron at full strength, the other has the squadron damaged.\nDamaged squadrons cannot move or shoot, but they still occupy that space on the board. If your frigate can get to them in time, the squadron can be repaired and continue its mission. If any enemy gets a hit on a damaged squadron, it is destroyed and removed from the game. The first player to eliminate all enemy squadrons from the game wins.\nBackground on the Project and Team\n\nPocket Option Games- In 2015 board game artist Chris Ferguson, set out to solve\u2026well a SMALL problem. Board games had been increasing in size, weight, and price, so much that many people could not afford them; this is especially true in many countries where the costs of shipping are more than the entire board game. In 1977, Metagaming Concepts introduced microgames: a hex map, a counter sheet, and a rule booklet, all in a ziplock bag for $2.95. They were accessible, playable, and portable. Unfortunately, Metagaming went bankrupt after 9 years. Chris formed Pocket Option to pick up where they left creating small, lightweight, fun games that could be designed quickly (1-2 months) and delivered worldwide for $11.62 or less (roughly the same $2.95 adjusted for inflation). After 7 successful Kickstarted projects microgames, including Carrier Commander, he is glad to see that the micro-gaming fan base is still out there.\nHappy Day Games The lead Developer and Publisher of this project Happy Day Games has helped more than 30 teams with production of mobile titles and like Pocket Option, is accustomed to short development cycles and believes they can compete the digital version of the game in a 3 month time frame and launched as a free-to-play product with an Early Access launch in July 2016. If the Kickstarter for Carrier Commander: Digital Edition is successful both studios plan to continue to work together to bring the rest of Pocket Games\u2019 library to its mobile fans.\n\nThe Kickstarter Plan\nOf the $25,000 the goal, the majority of funds ($15,000) will go towards funding the 4-man, three month development costs for Happy Day Games required to build the basic game described above. The remaining funds cover addition QA and bugtesting costs, game-related services, Kickstarter processing fees, and a small amount of marketing expenses. We plan to ultimately release Carrier Commander: Digital Edition as a free to play game, potentially with some in-game purchases but nothing that would have any bearing on gameplay mechanics.\nAllocation of Funds\nJust like the microgames we\u2019re working on, we want to keep this Kickstarter simple, inexpensive, realistic in scope. With only three funding tiers ($5, $10, $35) we don\u2019t want to ask too much from anyone. This is the first of what we hope will be many mobile microgames and we just want to see it get off the ground.. We\u2019ve picked a few stretch goals at what we think are reasonable funding tiers. Each in-game feature will likely add another month of development if achieved and another $5,000 in monthly development expenses: -\n$30,000 \u2013 Expand the scope to design Carrier Commander: Digital Edition and all in-game objects in 3D (for just $5,000 more than the original target!)\n$35,000 \u2013 Port the game to PC on the WIndowsd\n$40,000 \u2013 Add in-game DLC support and new cosmetic skins for different ships.\nWe will likely add a few more stretch goals to this list in the first week of the Kickstarter and we want to invite our backers and fans to tell us what other game-features they might be interested. If the the budget it there we\u2019ll put the work in. Regardless of whether the scope of the project expands to include these features, we still expect to deliver the Early Access version of the base game to our backers sometime in July.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from raising the funding, we don\u2019t\u2019 foresee anything standing in the way of the game getting out on time.

I had started a daily exercise - thinking of a new game concept each day. My 5th idea was for an early version of Wibbell, inspired by Prolix - a fantastic word game that - similarly - allows you to also use letters not depicted.\nI played it with fellow designers and toy industry professionals, who generally all enjoyed it.\nPlaytime was increased from 3 minutes to 15ish minutes (originally getting X cards triggered the end of the game, but that then became the end of just one round).\nLetter distributions were balanced and this is an area I continue to tinker with - perfection is impossible but I strive to get as close to as possible.\nAt UK Games Expo 2015, I playtested 3 games for the deck publicly. After the positive reception, I committed to the project and it was a side-exhibit at the parties I hosted when In A Bind was released. By Summer 2015, I had a fair few games for the deck, had worked out the basic format and was sending out early prototypes and planning the KS.\nI've continued working on other games for the deck. As I show it around, folk who play the prototype fall in love with at least one of the games and often invent ideas for new games, which could be playtested and developed further.\nThe game has been enjoyed by game store owners, gamers and non-gamers. It has been playtested and ideas submitted by Matt Leacock (Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Pandemic Legacy); David Brain (Keymarket); Ian Vincent (Ticket to Ride: India); Rob Harris (Modiphius).\nCards will be about 58x88mm. They will have black core - it will be impossible to see through them. They will be - at minimum - 300GSM. This thickness gives the cards a good durability and feel. The cards will be packaged in a single tuckbox.\nThere are 48 cards in the deck. 8 of each border design. 6 of 8 common letters. Uncommon letters appear 1-5 times each and are paired with the common letters.\n\nRemaining cards in the box will be used for rules etc.\nApril/May - Kickstarter runs and is (hopefully) funded.\nJune - Playtesting at UKGE 2016, testing possible-final letter pairs.\nJuly/August - early concepts for final art, sending out new PNP files to backers\nSeptember/October - 1st attempt at final art, new PNP sent out to backers, stress-testing borders' usability, testing at Essen, early concepts for all remaining art sent to backers.\nNovember/December - Final art.\nJanuary/February - printing\nMarch - contingency time in case something bad happens\nApril - delivery to backers\nSHOPS/RETAILERS\nIf you are interested in stocking Wibbell++ 2 months before the general release, please get in touch. I have an option for retailers that allows copies to be bought later at trade price, for a nominal deposit now.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWibbell has been in production for over a year.

I learned a lot about the process of making something awesome. I have a history of delivering what I say I will.\n\nThis time, rather than strive to get stuff done faster, I've given myself marginally more time than the original In A Bind took, in order to do it even better, whilst still having time to enjoy life and not constantly stress out - an issue in the past.\n\nWhereas boardgames on Kickstarter have trended towards the point where they are basically a 'pre-order system' with rules and components nearly all finished, I am offering future games where none of the mechanisms or themes are known. \n\nAll of the games will probably not be to your taste. The games will be designed to cover the gamut of possible playstyles and appeal to a wide variety of players. There will be something for everyone.\n\nI have 10 games that only require - at maximum - a few tweaks. But this late-stage development can require many hours of playtesting so I want to ensure there's an audience/demand to prioritise this.\n\nIf there is demand for even more games, I will devise & design new games, inviting other designers to submit their own ideas to be developed. \n\nThe core 5 games have been tested by strangers - designers, gamers and non-gamers - and they are all games I feel stand up on their own. Even before taking future games into account, you're getting a great set of games.\n\nI am still working on the final art for the typography and card borders.

They are called \u201cneoreactionaries\u201d or, more fancifully, the \u201cDark Enlightenment,\u201d a term coined by Nick Land, an expatriate British exacademic philosopher cyberpunk horror writer whose unexpected turn towards far-right politics electrified a bunch of people on Reddit. He was inspired by the works of Mencius Moldbug, a pseudonymous blogger famed for calling for Steve Jobs to be made king of California and tasked with maximizing profit for the state, and also for claiming that black people make good slaves. Moldbug is more usually known as Curtis Yarvin, a Bay Area software engineer who got his start as a writer in the comment section of Overcoming Bias, a transhumanist blog featuring, among others, the work of Eliezer Yudkowsky, a crank AI scholar who thinks preventing his ideas for sci-fi novels from becoming reality is more important than preventing malaria, and who freaked out once when a computer program from the future threatened to hurt him. The confluence of these facts may or may not be the doom of humanity. And just wait til we work in Thomas Ligotti, Alan Turing, William Blake, Frantz Fanon, China Mi\u00e9ville, and Hannibal Lecter.\nNeoreaction a Basilisk is a work of theoretical philosophy about the tentacled computer gods at the end of the universe. It is a horror novel written in the form of a lengthy Internet comment. A savage journey to the heart of the present eschaton. A Dear John letter to western civilization written from the garden of madman philosophers. A textual labyrinth winding towards a monster that I promise will not turn out to be ourselves all along or any crap like that. \nAccidentally composed by acclaimed cultural critic Philip Sandifer (TARDIS Eruditorum, The Last War in Albion) it is initially only available in limited and 100% Kickstarter-exclusive editions. And what happens to it after that is basically up to you. \nWant to know even more about the book? Well, I've posted five excerpts on my blog.\nExcerpt One\nExcerpt Two\nExcerpt Three\nExcerpt Four\nExcerpt Five\nNeoreaction a Basilisk itself is written and, barring layout of the physical book (which I\u2019ll start working on the moment we hit goal) ready to send out. But I\u2019d like to go through and add a set of footnotes and citations, write a couple essays on loosely related topics, and do a more traditional, permanent edition. So basically, I\u2019m selling some weird special editions via Kickstarter to fund that. \nEBOOK EDITION\nOK, so this one is admittedly not really a weird special edition so much as a nicely formatted ebook of Neoreaction a Basilisk in the format of your choosing.\nCONSPIRACY ZINE EDITION\nNow we get into the interesting ones. A print edition, with pages lovingly hand-taped together and photocopied in the style of 80s zines. (And then scanned in and published via a reputable print-on-demand company because we\u2019re not in the 80s anymore thank God.)\nPreview of the Conspiracy Zine Edition\nCOLOR EDITION\nInstead of third generation photocopies of my taped together pages, this edition will consist of high resolution color scans of the taped-together pages subsequently photocopied and artily degraded for the Conspiracy Zine edition.\nPreview of the Color Edition\nSIGIL EDITION\nPrinted on a single ream of continuous-feed printer paper (the kind with the holes on the side), every copy of this edition will be signed, and have a 100% unique sigil drawn on it. What will the sigil do? Launch it and find out.\nORIGINAL PLATES\nAn edition of one - I will put the original taped-together pages in a box and send them to you.

From Vox Day to Vivian James, a look at Gamergate in the tradition of \u201cGuided by the Beauty of Their Weapons.\u201d\n$6000: Theses on Trump - ACHIEVED!\nPREVIEW OF THE ESSAY\nBecause every leftist critic\u2019s got to have a Trump piece, my humble contribution to the genre. The sort of think-piece that notes, \u201che likes his women like he likes his buildings: big and decorated in gold.\u201d And that\u2019s still only the fourth thesis.\n$7000: \"Theses on Trump\" on the Blog - ACHIEVED!\nAt this threshold, I'll post the final version of \"Theses on Trump\" to Eruditorum Press. An October surprise to end all October surprises, I reckon.\n$8000: Austrian School Economics (guest starring Jack Graham) - ACHIEVED!\nDISCUSSION OF THE ESSAY\nCome on. You know you want me and Jack Graham doing an analysis of the economic philosophy of Ted Cruz. Seriously, this is great stuff - a school of economics heavily influential in libertarian thought that rejects the applicability of empiricism and math to economics in favor of a textual argument from first principles in which all of economic thought is a series of necessary implications of the allegedly self-evident premise \u201cindividual people act.\u201d And people who believe this have the gall to sneer at Marxism.\n$9000: \"The Blind All-Seeing Eye of Gamergate\" on the Blog\nAt this level I'll post \"The Blind All-Seeing Eye of Gamergate\" to my blog so that I can get a bunch of death threats on Twitter from people with anime avatars.\n$10,000: Lizard People, Dear Readers\nA delve into the paranoid murk of classic conspiracy theories, starting with David Icke's contention that the world is secretly run by lizards, and probably getting a bit weird from there.\n$11,000: All Backers Get Bonus Essays as an Ebook\nAt this threshold, all backers of the Kickstarter, at any threshold, will get an ebook of all the bonus essays that go into the finished version, including a short piece that will be exclusive to this collection and never distributed anywhere else.\n$12,000: TERFs\nA look at Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists, the adamant leftists who are strangely indistinguishable from Gamergate. Probably starting from the gloriously bonkers title metaphor of Janice Raymond's 1979 screed The Transsexual Empire.\n$13,000: A Brief Magical Ritual To Neuter The Alt-Right\nAt $13,000 I will conduct a brief magical ritual on the Eruditorum Press site in order to forever blunt the power of the alt-right as embodied by neoreaction. Backers are advised to consult my past work in order to assess how much this goal is complete and utter trolling.\n$14,000: A Short Story\nAt $14,000 I will round out the final edition of Neoreaction a Basilisk with a short horror story riffing on some of the themes in the book and gesturing at a few more.\nFor now, Neoreaction a Basilisk, my strange journey into right-wing philosophical horror, is available for your purchase.

In autumn 2015, we approached Paul Smith with an idea \u2013 what if we could turn Trafalgar Square into a giant crazy golf course? Together, we brainstormed a list of the eight best creatives we could think of, and approached them to sketch out the crazy golf course of their dreams. The designs went through feasibility studies until each artist, architect or designer finalised their vision. \nOur designers have given us behind the scenes peak on what visitors can expect from theirCrazy Golf structure.

The Festival also commissions its own Landmark projects and interventions in public spaces across London. Previous Trafalgar Square projects have included The Tournament, a giant ceramic chess set designed by Jaime Hay\u00f3n.\nThe Tournament in Trafalgar Square by Jaime Hay\u00f3n for the London Design Festival 2009\nFestival audiences are significant, with an estimated direct audience of over 375,000 people from over 75 countries in 2015. \nWe want this number to rise in 2016 \u2013 not only to entertain, but to bring innovative, never before seen design to the masses and inspire the next generation of creatives. With your support we can make this happen.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nThis is a project for the public, funded mostly by the public. Realising a project of this ambition and scale is expensive \u2013 we hope to raise half of the required funds through Kickstarter and will match-fund the rest through sponsorship. The Festival is actively seeking this extra support through its network of supporters, but if we do not meet our \u00a3120,000 target the project won\u2019t go ahead.

It only takes a few minutes to learn or to demo!  \nThe game is set in the Golden Age of Steam where a number of entrepreneurs have set out to supply trains to their international client\u00e8le: you are one of these entrepreneurs and you'll do everything you can to make sure your train is the best of the best!\nYour train will be made up of the cards that you collect during the game including:\n1 Engine, 1 Tender, 1 Fuel, 1 Crew and however many carriages you think you need to win the game\nHow to Play\nTo play the game, a nominated player selects 1 Enquiry Card. This sets out the objective of the game:\nHaving selected an Enquiry Card, each player must then select a Crew Card which sets the baseline scores for Speed, Power, Comfort and Capacity for the players train - these are the four attributes that the trains will be judged on:\nEach player then takes one card at a time from the Train Cards pile to begin assembling their train. A player can try and win the game by submitting their train when they fulfil the objective set out by the Enquiry Card, and their train has all the components required (1 Crew, 1 Engine, 1 Tender, 1 Fuel, and as many carriages as they feel they need):\nThe remaining players can each take 1 more card from the train cards pile before submitting their train. If they can't fulfil the Enquiry Cards objective then they lose the game, is they can then they submit this train. The train that best fulfils the objective on the Enquiry Card is the winner.\nWhat's Included\nIn all, there are 54 cards, each meticulously designed and printed on glossy, durable gaming card. These are presented in a card box. \nIncluded in the game are:\n2 Instruction/Help Cards\n7 Enquiry Cards\n5 Crew Cards\n40 Train Cards\nWhy Just the Ticket needs your help\nThis is a Kickstarter campaign in its purest form in that if we don't reach our funding goal, Just the Ticket simply won't make it in to the world at all.

That plus freight shipping and the art, design, individual shipping, and Kickstarter processing fees amount to our goal. We really believe in this game and we're doing everything we can to make it a success, but we need your help to place the first order.

Starting a company is expensive, and so I've already put a lot of my own time and money into getting Scuttle! ready to bring to the world.\nDue to the success of the campaign, I've been able to get copies of the game into retail stores, and Jellybean Games is going to have a really solid foundation for future projects!\nThis project has been a collaboration between Peter C.

Build a political party in a familiar but fictional world, recruiting politicians to your cause, developing your manifesto of support winning ideas, campaigning for the support of the public, firing off salvos of slander & sabotage at your cunning rivals, and surviving catastrophic events that shake up the nation you\u2019re playing the game of politics in. \nStatecraft - the Political Card Game\nEach game of Statecraft starts off with selecting a scenario, which represents the current events of a fictional nation, and with players selecting their political party\u2019s leader, who\u2019ll form the central character of your party\u2019s team. Supporters are then drawn from the deck to form your nation's population. All this translates to over 180,000 possible starting set ups.\nStatecraft Game Layout\nStarting layout tutorial\nPlayers manage their hand of cards to carry out a series of political \u2018manoeuvers\u2019 during their turn, whether spending cards recruiting new politicians to their party, using cards announcing new policies with their newly minted team members, campaigning for the support of a key demographic or dialing their favourite cable news network to divulge some damaging slander about their opponent.\nUsing policies and claiming supporters tutorial\n For most of Statecraft's scenarios, the player who claims the most supporters will win. They'll have to manage their ideological stance to attract new supporters but retain old ones, and fend off attacks from opponents who are plotting to poach their supporters away with sickly populist promises.\n Statecraft has a lot of unique gameplay features, as well as some tried and tested conventional mechanics which make the game tight. The things that make Statecraft really special, though are shown below, from the hundreds of thousands of different set ups to the unique ideology mechanic.\n\n\nManaging your Pledge\nIf you want to upgrade your pledge level, then all you need to do is click the \u2018manage your pledge\u2019 button next to the campaign video, which will take you to a list of pledge levels, where you can select a new one. Nice and simple.\n\nPrint & Play Edition\nAll pledges of \u00a35 or more will include a set of fully illustrated and organised files which you'll be able to print off, and play a full game of Statecraft with. These will come in English, Spanish, French and German, with more languages in the works! The manufactured game will be produced in English.\nWhen we reach a certain amount of funding level, we'll be able to make Statecraft even better for each and every backer! As we get further up the ladder we'll reveal more of the exciting things we'll be able to bring to Statecraft, including more expansions, card art, quality upgrades and more.\nEver time we hit a combined 100 shares of the 'magic status' on Facebook and Twitter, we'll get Zak to add card art into the core game!\n\nEvery time we hit a combined 100 new Facebook likes and Twitter follows, we'll get Zak to add in another!\n\nFor every 10 pictures of babies dressed up as Donald Trump and/or Boris Johnson shared to our Facebook or Twitter, that's +1 card art!\nThe same goes for original poems about your national government, extra points for them being written in crayon.\n\nFacebook Likes + Twitter Follows at launch = 913\n\nLINK TO MAGIC FACEBOOK STATUS\nLINK TO MAGIC TWEET\n\nLINK TO FACEBOOK PAGE\nLINK TO TWITTER PROFILE\n                                                      Statecraft has been designed with expandability in mind, with plenty of opportunities to build new fictional, or even non fictional, worlds to fill with your nefarious political plans.\nField characters like Barack Obama and Margaret Thatcher, and announce policies like the NHS and drop strikes, with the National Politics: UK and the USA expansion\nNational Politics comes with 27 cards which expand on the core game, with new scenarios, characters, policies and events from the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This set adds a contemporary and real-life edge to the Statecraft system, giving you the opportunity to play as the outrageous characters of real life politics. National Politics is included in all pledge levels of \u00a325 or more*\n*Except for Benign Educator\nWe have loads of ideas for more expansions, including:\nAssets and Agents (adding in 2 new card types to Statecraft) \nNational Politics (East Asia, South America, North Africa, The EU) \nExtreme Policies (incendiary policies from around the world) \nExtreme Supporters (challenging to claim!) \nStatecraft: Histories (historical characters)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign using the project pledge manager. By doing it this way and not charging through Kickstarter, we will pass on any savings we make on shipping, packaging, handling and pack mule fees directly to you, charging shipping cent for cent.\n\nFor the prices below, the upper values represent the worst case scenario. Shipping covers professional handling, packaging and shipping by experienced fulfillment companies in the US, Canada and the EU.\nWe currently are able to offer EU, US and Canadian friendly shipping, meaning we absorb all import/sales taxes and also means you don't have to wait for your pledge because of pesky customs forms and charges! \nEstimated shipping prices, charged after the campaign\nClick for more info on our website!\n                                                                                              The Political Compass was one of the key sources of inspiration for us, as it provides a really interesting insight into where political parties or candidates sit in relation to each other, and where you sit relative to them too! It's even more interesting to see parties from different countries together, like we've done below using their data!\nThe Political Compass provides a method of categorising your political ideology in 2-dimensions. Rather than defining yourself as 'right' or 'left', 'liberal' or 'conservative', the Compass does both at once, giving a richer understanding of political persuasion.\nWhat does the political compass mean?\n                                                                                   We've got a really strong team of talented game designers, artists and graphics people as well as having a successful project already under our belt, Molecular. We've gone strides forward since Molecular, learning more and more about everything from designing the game itself to getting it to backers, putting together a far more efficient shipping pipeline, and working with much better manufacturers to ensure quality and speed.\n\nWe're now working with 6 fledgling game designers to publish their ideas over the next 12 months, across an incredible range of themes and game styles.

We're working with a very skilled designer, so we're confident we won't hit any serious delays with the design side of the project, as they are very experienced and have been in constant contact with the manufacturers.\n\nMANUFACTURING DELAUS:\nBoard games are pretty complex things to make, so we've partnered with PandaGM, one of the industries most respected manufacturers, to ensure that everything is done professionally and to a high standard. Panda have worked with dozens of successful Kickstarters, delivering high quality games on time.\n\nSHIPPING DELAYS:\nFreight from the factory to distribution centers around the world can be quite variable, but we've factored that into our timeline. We've also built in time for the distribution centers to ensure that everything is packed correctly and safely, so you get your games in good condition. We've come an incredibly long way since organising all the freight handling and shipping logistics of Molecular ourselves. We've also had a quiet word with some pirates.\n\nRISK OF BEING PUT ON GOVERNMENT WATCHLIST:\nAs we're producing a satirical politics game, there's a chance that our benevolent overlords will revoke our freedom and send us to some kind of gulag in the Highlands of Scotland.

It\u2019s a chance to host an unforgettable night of fun with your friends as you race against the clock to twist your brain around puzzling problems and cunning clues. \nWe can\u2019t tell you too much without ruining the surprise, but these are not just pen and paper puzzles. There are locked boxes! Keys and codes that must be found! Feats of dexterity, quests for knowledge and mind-bending brain teasers that must be accomplished.  \nEscape Rooms are a wildly popular new form of live gaming sweeping the country. The basic concept is a group of people gets locked in a room and has to solve puzzles both physical and mental in order to find keys and codes that will get them out of the room. In our game, we have all the awesome excitement, so players can have the same immersive and challenging experience in the comfort of their own home (and for a lot less money!). We\u2019ve done a lot of research and despite the massive popularity of Escape Rooms, there is nothing like this on the market.\nYou will receive a beautifully designed, fascinating box. You will take off the lid and notice that there is a panel that you CANNOT LIFT until you start the game.\nIntrigued, you will invite your friends over for the ESCAPE ROOM IN A BOX PARTY. You can even make appetizers, drinks and decorations from the Official Escape Room In A Box: The Werewolf Experiment Party Planner (which you found right under the box lid.)  \nThe day of your party will arrive, everyone will be excited and curious about what's to come. You will eat, drink, be merry and gather around a table to begin this once in a lifetime experience.\nYou will lift the lid and\u2026\nWe can\u2019t tell you any more without spoilers and we would never do that to you.\nOkay, we can show you a little more:\n                                                               Actually, it\u2019s better:\n1. Location: Maybe you don\u2019t live anywhere near an Escape Room. Maybe you don\u2019t want to drive to an unknown part of town or pay for a babysitter. Escape Room in A Box is in the best location (your house) with awesome parking (because it is at your house.)\n2. Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Like, $30 a person! That\u2019s $180 for your six person group! Our game is a fraction of the price for 152% of the fun.\n3. You won\u2019t be locked in a room: For those of you who love puzzles but hate the thought of being locked in a room, in our game you aren\u2019t locked in a room. You are just stuck with a box\u2026of AWESOME. And themed snacks.\nAnyone who loves Escape Rooms. Anyone who loves puzzles. Anyone who wants to host a super unique party. Anyone who wants a really fun team building exercise or ice breaker: companies, schools, clubs. Families who want something that will bring them together without being bored or staring at a screen. Also, just, everyone. Are you breathing? Buy this game.\nYes, the game is primarily a one time use game like the real Escape Rooms or Murder Mystery Night Games. As you'll see when you play, it isn't just solving puzzles, the puzzles are part of a complicated web of clues and meta puzzles that lead you to your goal, so after the first play you'll know too much!\nHowever, we want some replay-ability, so we will be selling a very cheap refill pack (included FREE with the kickstarter!) that will include a .pdf of the puzzles, replacements for the elements that are used up, and instructions for reconstructing the box. We will also include a \u201cgame master script\u201d for the host so that you take charge of certain elements (timing, hints, etc.) as you lead another group of your friends through their adventure and watch them escape their terrible werewolf fate (or not!). \nIf you\u2019re up for a room-sized adventure in a pint-sized box, then grab some friends and a little kibble (just to be safe), and head on over to this game\u2019s Kickstarter before its time runs out too! - Ryan (Cardboard Republic)\n                    Review from The Room Escape Artist!\nWe're on LAist!\nInterview on Fanboy Comics!\nWe're on Geek & Sundry!!!!!!\nReview from The Room Escapist!\nArticle about us on escape-rooms.com!\nArticle about us on Intervirals!\nWrite-up on Giant Fire Breathing Robot!\nWe're on Amy Poehler's Smart Girls!\nWe're on World of Wonder!\nMisplaced Pixels did an awesome story about us!\nWant to make your Escape Room Party even more immersive and atmospheric?\nLauren Rock of Boonzy Arts Candles specializes in hand crafting candles to enhance the gaming experience.

The Werewolf Experiment Candle is herbaceous and woody with slight hints of amber and citrus.\nThe candle is 8oz, 100% soy wax, has a cotton wick, premium fragrance oils, and features original Escape Room In A Box artwork. Each candle has around 50 hours of burn time, so you can certainly enjoy it before you game to anticipate what's to come and then after to remember what a blast you had.

God save the Queen!\nLondon, 1899- The board for Victoriana\nTension that builds throughout the game: As the three elements of the conspiracy are revealed, so are Agents of the Mastermind. This results in a game that gets more challenging the closer you are to victory.\nTime made tangible: Each time the clock advances a quarter hour, all the Leads in play physically turn a quarter turn clockwise. If a Lead ever returns to the 12 o\u2019clock position, it is lost forever. Players use this visible timer to prioritize their actions.\nMultiple resources that need to be managed: Players must balance abilities, movement, and trauma in order to stop the conspiracy before time, the most limited resource of all, runs out.\nFantastic variety: With more than 100 unique Leads, 20 possible Plots, 13 fearsome Masterminds, and the whole of 19th century London as the setting, Victoriana will never play the same way twice.\nEngaging theme: Combining characters from Victorian literature with real-world scientists, politicians, occultists, and more, Victoriana offers a rich, exciting world for players to experience.\nOne of the many nefarious plots\nThe Goal of Victoriana\nDiscover the three elements of a vast conspiracy that threatens London- Mastermind, Plot, and Locale- before the clock strikes midnight!\nThe Gameplay of Victoriana\nInvestigate Leads: Lead cards represent information on the conspiracy!

But hurry- take too long to investigate a lead and it will go cold!\nDiscover the Plot: Spend leads to eliminate plot cards. Players are rewarded for each plot they eliminate, but beware- a dangerous agent of the conspiracy lurks in the plot deck as well.\nReveal the Mastermind: Each mastermind is protected by three henchmen. Spend leads to put these villains away for good.\nTraverse London: Avoid sinister agents! Collect help from Scotland Yard!

The idea that the soul of every person contained light and dark halves locked in eternal struggle is an old, old idea, but the Victorians made that duality manifest. Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the prime example, but you can see the themes elsewhere in The Invisible Man, Mina's struggle against Dracula's bite, and Holmes' rebellion against stagnation."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Relaunch Update #2", "update_content": "Hello, backers,\n\nApologies for the radio silence, but rest assured it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve been idle.

The aim is to make the most fabulous world you can, before your tower collapses. \nFabulous Beasts is brought to you by an experienced team of game designers, artists and engineers including Alex Fleetwood (Hide&Seek) and George Buckenham (Wild Rumpus, Panoramical). The soundtrack for the game is being created by Disasterpeace.\nThe digital app is compatible with modern Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.

While stacking bits of firewood and watching pelicans fly by, he had an idea for a game that linked the balance of nature with the balance of objects. \nOnce back in London, Alex called up George, Tim and Lyall - who he'd worked with while making games at Hide&Seek. With the help of Play Sandbox they started working on a prototype with the Engineering department at Bath University. Chris began helping us with hardware, and rapidly became the fifth member of the team. \nWe use technologies like 3D-printing, Arduino, Autodesk Forge and Unity to bring indie creativity to hardware as well as software. We love working together and shaping all the different elements of the game in parallel. \nWe've spent the last year taking the game to festivals, evolving the design, and developing the game. We'll tell you all about it during the campaign.\nWe're lucky to have the backing and support of some fantastic people from the games and hardware industries. But what we're trying to do is something that's rarely been done before. Companies who make games that bridge physical and digital are mostly ginormous multinational corporations. \nWe've got a refined, award-winning prototype and we've built out a manufacturing plan with experienced partners in Hong Kong and China. The fastest way for us to carry out that plan is with your support. \nMost importantly, we want to start a conversation about the future of this game with YOU. We're so excited about being able to keep adding to and improving it and we have a ton of ideas - from different game modes, to extra pieces, to hardware upgrades. With your support, we can make them all happen! \nIn order to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low, we are working with a Hong Kong based logistics partner to pick, pack and ship all rewards to local fulfilment centres in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, and then on to you. EU rewards will therefore be delivered from within the EU. We expect to ship all other rewards direct from Hong Kong.\nShipping prices for the Core Edition / Core Edition Plus / Maker Edition vary as follows from territory to territory:\nUK, US, Canada, Australia: \u00a310 (approx $15 USD / $20 CAD  / $20 AUS ) \nWestern EU* (excl. UK): \u00a315 (approx \u20ac20) \nAll other countries: \u00a325\nOther rewards are charged by weight and volume accordingly.\n*Western EU includes: France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Greece", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing \n\nA key challenge for our game is the manufacturing process. We are working closely with JDH Sourcing, a Hong-Kong based company who oversee every aspect of the game's production from the electronic components to the packaging. JDH work with partners including Teenage Engineering, PowerUp and Perfect Bake. Our team has visited the factories we will be using to see their processes first hand. We have already adapted the game's physical design and electronic engineering so that it can be produced at scale. \n\nDigital Development\n\nThere's a risk that we might not ship the game with all the advertised features, or ship late. The game is already quite fully featured and has been developed in Unity to minimise costs and problems with porting from the current iOS build to Android. We have a working build on Android devices\n\nWe have budgeted time and resource to develop the features we have planned for the core game and any features added in stretch goals ahead of our proposed shipping date in November 2016. \n\nWe also need to ensure compatibility between our hardware and your device. We have planned in testing and QA to deal with this and we are in discussion with Apple and Google about certification.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "BIG BIG News from Beasts of Balance HQ", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "Brand New Game on Kickstarter from Beasts of Balance publisher Modern Games", "update_content": "Hey Everyone!\nWe are excited to announce the launch of Raid, a strategic, micro-deck building card game with a norse mythology theme from the Modern Games team, on Kickstarter today.\nYou can learn more and be one of the first to back it at: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moderngames/raid-a-viking-card-game\nWe appreciate any support your can send our way and hope you're enjoying Beasts of Balance!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Modern Games acquires Beasts of Balance", "update_content": "The Beasts are Back!\nMaybe you were wondering what would happen to Beasts of Balance after Sensible Object was acquired by Niantic last year.

Inspired by the works of Alexandre Dumas, The Princess Bride, and other works of high adventure, 7th Sea played fast and furious, emulating the pace of movies like Captain Blood, The Three Musketeers, and Pirates of the Caribbean.\nAnd now 7th Sea is back in the hands of its original creator\u2014that\u2019s me! John Wick!\u2014and that means it's time to bring 7th Sea back to your gaming table! \nRead on to hear more about 7th Sea, but I want to say a huge THANK YOU to all our fans who have made this the most successful tabletop RPG project in Kickstarter history. We've broken every record and funded eleven sourcebooks, six maps, three novels... and much, much more.\nIf you want all the books, we've funded, you should check out these two reward levels:\nAnd if you want to take a look at Second Edition, backers can download the Quickstart TODAY! It\u2019s got everything you need to try out the game, including pregen characters, mechanics, and a starter adventure!\n7th Sea is a tabletop roleplaying game of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Th\u00e9ah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe. Players take the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and protecting the rightful kings and queens of Th\u00e9ah from murderous villains.\nCore Rulebook Mockup\nAs a 7th Sea Hero, you might...\n\u2026 save the Queen of Avalon from treacherous blackmail! \n\u2026 thwart a dastardly assassination attempt on the Cardinal of Castille! \n\u2026 raid the villainous fleets of Vodacce merchant-princes! \n\u2026 free the Prince of the Sarmatian Commonwealth from a mysterious curse! \n\u2026 make decisions that alter the very course of Th\u00e9an history!\nIn most roleplaying games, you start off as a 1st-level loser who\u2019s terrified of the goblin with a broken knife. In 7th Sea, you are a Hero, an icon of Th\u00e9ah ready to live and die for causes that matter. You can take on ten thugs with swords, knives, and guns all on your own. You don\u2019t start off digging through old dungeons hoping to find a copper piece or two. No! You are trusted knight, a loyal bodyguard, or even\u2026 an adventuring queen herself.\nIn other words\u2026 you\u2019re d\u2019Artagnan, Milady de Winter, the Dread Pirate Roberts, Jack Sparrow, Julie d'Aubigney, and the Scarlet Pimpernel all rolled up in one!\nThis is a game of high adventure, mystery, and action. \nThis is a game of intrigue and romance. \nThis is 7th Sea.\nEach of the Nations in Th\u00e9ah is a unique culture, a country that prides itself on a national identity and a unique voice. There is no League of Nations in 7th Sea; each country stands alone, plotting its future as best it can in the face of dangers both internal and external.\n7th Sea characters usually come from one of the eight Th\u00e9an Nations:\nAvalon: Green and enchanted, this union of three kingdoms has recently risen to the forefront of The\u0301an politics under the leadership of Queen Elaine.\nCastille: Headquarters of the Vaticine Church, this fertile nation was once the home of science and reason, but it has fallen under the spell of corruption and fanaticism.\nEisen: A proud yet broken land, Eisen is a nightmare brought to life by three decades of mass murder kept at bay by heroes as dangerous as the horrors lurking in the Nation\u2019s shadows.\nMontaigne: One of The\u0301ah\u2019s most powerful nations, Montaigne leads the world in art and culture even as its Emperor crushes the populace beneath his thumb.\nSarmatian Commonwealth: Two nations bound by a single crown, the Commonwealth is a democratic monarchy where all people are equal, even kings.\nUssura: A Nation torn between traditional isolationism and an ambitious ruler who will do anything to drag his Nation into the future, no matter the cost.\nVestenmannavnjar: A Nation of raiders and warlords who conquered the world\u2019s economy by hammering their swords and spears into coins.\nVodacce: The former cradle of civilization, Vodacce is now split between seven merchant Princes whose complex and nefarious schemes reach every corner of the world.\nBut the world doesn\u2019t stop at the edges of Th\u00e9ah. In fact, the world of 7th Sea is going to get a whole lot bigger...\nI get more questions about 7th Sea than any other game I've written. Fans of the game truly love the world we created back in 1999 and were sad to see the game go out of print.\nFans of the 1st Edition should know that Th\u00e9ah is still largely as they remember it. We still have Vodacce Fate Witches and Montaigne Porte Magic, but some of the other Nations have undergone subtle changes. Eisen, Vestenmennavenjar, and Ussura are just a little different than they were before. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still recognize them, but just as fifteen years can change a person, fifteen years can change a Nation, too. And you\u2019ll get to explore a brand new Nation\u2026 the Sarmatian Commonwealth!\n7th Sea: Second Edition gives me a chance to not only bring the game back to all its devoted fans, but also to give it a new engine with plenty of chrome. Since 1999, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the roleplaying game industry. We have new design tools, new publishing options, and new ideas about what makes a roleplaying game work. I want to take advantage of all that new stuff and help 7th Sea become the game that I always wanted it to be: fast, fun, furious action that tells the stories of great heroes facing impossible odds amidst global politics.\nWe\u2019ve also got big plans for the book itself: a gorgeous 300 page, full color, fully illustrated hardcover tome. We\u2019ve got new artists helping us bring the world of Th\u00e9ah to your gaming table in all its grandeur and glory, and we\u2019re working with KrakenPrint to bring the book to your table in both a traditional hardcover edition and in a leather-bound, foil-stamped, embossed (and de-embossed!) pirate edition. Check out our Rewards section to learn more about what we\u2019re planning on printing.\nBut like I mentioned above, we are making the world a whole lot bigger than just Th\u00e9ah. We have huge plans to fill in the map of the entire world: new continents, new Nations, new sorceries, new adventures! All of them are waiting for first-time players and those intimately familiar with the first edition of 7th Sea.\nFans of the old game will be glad to hear we still have the classic five Traits\u2014Brawn, Finesse, Resolve, Wits, and Panache\u2014as well as Skills to describe your character\u2019s training and experience. However, instead of Roll and Keep your Trait, it\u2019s now Roll and Keep Everything. That\u2019s right, you keep all your dice and use them to resolve risky and dangerous actions.\nAfter you roll, you take your dice and make sets of 10. Each set is a Raise. You can use Raises to accomplish goals, overcome obstacles, and dodge consequences. In other words, Raises make your character awesome. And as a 7th Sea Hero\u2026 you\u2019ll have lots of Raises.\nWe\u2019ve streamlined the rest of the system as well, making it faster, more dramatic and easier to learn. We made dueling possible for everyone, not just swordsmen: if you can pick up a sword, you can get yourself into a duel. Everything about the new system is designed to get you into the action! \nWhether you\u2019re a fan of the original edition or someone who\u2019s never played before, you can download the Quick Start right now and see for yourself what the new 7th Sea looks and plays like. Just back the Kickstarter (even at $1!) and you can start your adventures in Th\u00e9ah!\nBut 7th Sea: Second Edition isn\u2019t the only book we\u2019ve got planned for this line; we\u2019re also excited to announce our full line of 7th Sea sourcebooks, each one a new opportunity to expand what 7th Sea is all about. Here's the full list of every sourcebook funded by this campaign:\nWhy are we expanding out to new lands? To give the game more scope, to encourage exploration (and piracy!) and to bring a wider variety of faces and voices to Th\u00e9ah\u2019s shores. We think 7th Sea needs more sea travel, more adventure in far off places, and a more diverse setting.\nBut we're also committed to making sure that this project doesn't drag on forever! We'll be delivering these books over the next year and a half, according to the release schedule above. We'll keep folks updated as each project develops, and we might be able to get one or two out a bit early.\nIf you'd like to grab one of the sourcebooks, add $40 to your pledge or select a reward tier that includes sourcebooks. You can also check out the ALL THE BOOKS, OFFICER or ALL THE BOOKS, PIRATE tier to snag all eleven sourcebooks at a great price.\nThe 7th Sea community was always one of my favorite parts about working on the line when I was at AEG. I still get messages from people who tell me that 7th Sea saved their life when they were homeless or they almost named their kid after a 7th Sea character. Amazing stuff.\nIn order to capture that community again, we asked our backers to tweet, share, and contribute to the campaign with their own unique images and ideas. Over the course of the campaign, our fans have unlocked a dozen social stretch goals, including new Sorte cards, digital wallpapers, early previews, and more!\nIf you want to see the awesome selfies, LEGO ships, and more created by our backers, search on social media using the hashtag #sailthe7thSea. Thank you to everyone who contributed to unlocking these goals! Your fellow backers appreciate it!\nWe're so incredibly excited about the return of 7th Sea and our reward tiers are packed with cool stuff. We\u2019ve got  physical books, 1st Edition PDFs, special play opportunities, and even a treasure chest filled with exclusive 7th Sea artefacts!\nSince we\u2019re funding a whole line, we\u2019re handling rewards a bit differently than you might be used to on Kickstarter. When you back at a level that includes a sourcebook, you choose which sourcebook you get when the campaign is over through Backerkit. You're free to get any book you want or even snag multiple copies of the same sourcebook if that's what you want.\nIf you're interested in getting all the books, check out the ALL THE BOOKS, OFFICER and ALL THE BOOKS, PIRATE tiers that include virtually every product we're funding, including all the sourcebooks!\nOn to the rewards! \n$20 - EXPLORER: You receive the FULL COLOR 7th Sea: Second Edition PDF, including everything you need to play the game, maps of Th\u00e9ah, and more!\n$40 - SCHOLAR: You receive PDFs of ALL BOOKS/PRODUCTS we unlock through this campaign including PDFs for ALL 1ST EDITION BOOKS!

And we'll be joined by additional collaborators that we know and trust, like \"Audio Daredevil\" Kenny Young (Tearaway, LittleBigPlanet) and composer Daniel Pemberton (Steve Jobs, The Man from UNCLE, LittleBigPlanet). And hopefully we'll be joined by you as well!\nInspired by games like Earthbound and Secret of Mana and films such as The Goonies, we would like to take these, along with of our favorite childhood memories, and channel it all through our years of experience making games.\nThe key ingredients of Knights and Bikes:\nIn Knights and Bikes, you can play as Nessa and Demelza on their quest for the truth behind the medieval legends of Penfurzy, an island on the fast track to financial ruin and literal destruction. Recruit a party of creatures from all walks of life, enlist and inspire deflated islanders, and embark on an adventure to find the hero the island so desperately needs.\nTeaming up with Demelza's pet goose, and the pickled severed head of a fallen-knight, they fling Frisbees at demons, trick-out their bikes to reach new locations, and increase their abilities with each islander they rescue.\nOk ok, what Demelza said.\nPedal Yourselves into Danger!\nPlay it single-player, or with a friend!\nTo purchase an add on, all you have to do is:\nClick \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d (or click here). \nClick \"Change your pledge\" \nAdd the costs (including shipping) of the add-ons to your pledge amount without changing your tier. \nThat\u2019s it. We'll ask for all the details in the backer survey after the campaign.\nTrailer Super Cut\nSome of our lovely friends and fans helped us put together a new, extra shouty cut of our trailer!\nKnights and Bikes is currently confirmed for PC, Mac, and Linux. It's also coming to Playstation4, and all pledges at, or above, the Digital Game Plus tier are eligible for the PS4 version.\n\nWe will update this section if and when we add more platforms. \nKnights and Bikes takes place on the island of Penfurzy, an island off the coast of Cornwall, where great medieval legends have driven centuries of culture. Inspired by Rex's childhood, it is a place where fact and fiction are inextricably intertwined. \nAs such, the island has a case of multiple identities. On one hand, it is a home for the islanders who live a life full of tradition, history, and pride. But on the other hand, it is a tourist attraction that is expressed almost as self parody through arcades, crazy-golf, and other fleeting diversions.\nOur story takes place in the 80s when the island's most prized relic is proved to be fake, raising questions about Penfurzy's legends. We pick up in the fall of 1987, the end of the island's worst tourist season ever. All the mainlanders have gone home. Well, all except one. \nAs Nessa and Demelza begin their search for the truth behind the island legends, they unleash mysterious spirits that possesses many of the island's inhabitants, human and animal alike. It's up to our heroines to figure out what these spirits want, where or even when they're from, and ultimately how to stop them. \nKnights and Bikes is filled with characters for you to meet (or be) from all walks of life. They each have their own goals, personalities, and abilities. Here are some of the cast:\nNessa is an orphan from the mainland who follows an old keepsake to the island hoping to learn who she really is. As an outsider, she clashes with many of the islanders, but not Demelza, who becomes a fast friend.\nSample Ability: Frisbee-Lob\nDemelza is a video game-obsessed believer in the Penfurzy legends. She comes equipped with a Power Glove in her quest to fight for the honor of her favorite video game hero. She lives in the island's Caravan Park with her father Gryffyn, but dreams of the mainland and all the comic-books and video games that might exist there.\nSample Ability: Puddle-Splash\nCaptain Honkers is Demelza's pet goose. He has an incredible sense of smell and an insatiable appetite for seaweed.\nSample Ability: Peck\nThe Pickled Knight claims to be the great hero of legend, but even if true, spending many years trapped in a briny rockpool has robbed him of his looks (and abilities).\nSample Ability: Ankle Bite\nIslanders come in all shapes and sizes, each trying to support themselves on this remote island--from the volunteer running the mobile library to the bike-shop-owner. But as things start to go wrong on the island it will be up to you to save them from the ancient spirits. And some may have special talents or items that could be helpful to your quest. \nSample Ability: Worrying\nKnights and Bikes is an Co-op Action Adventure Game where players will explore an island on foot and on bikes, find treasure, battle through \"dungeon\" areas, rescue islanders and upgrade their gear in the town hub.\nLocal Co-Op - Play through the entire game alone with AI helpers controlling the other characters in your party or have a friend join you on this mysterious adventure.\nExplore - Jump on your bike and ride through the ominous wilderness areas of the island following the ever trusty beak of Captain Honkers.\nTreasure - Trade collected treasure to acquire new abilities as well as upgrading those you already have by employing the various odd abilities of rescued islanders.\nQuests - Complete the noble requests of the islanders to win their favor by rescuing loved ones, finding ancient relics, and solving puzzling mysteries.\nBattle - Keep an eye on your health as you fight your way through treacherous dungeons using your improvised arsenal. Execute your combat abilities against possessed creatures to free them from their violent spiritual possession.\nThe rewards we're offering are as important to us as the game, so everything is made by us for you, and not farmed-out to third-parties.

We remember a time when games were something that you would play with your mum, dad, brother, or neighbor and together you could join forces and defeat the ultimate baddie.\nWe wanted to capture the feeling of forming a group, being part of something bigger, but also finding out who you are and where you fit into the world. Of course, a game about friendship wouldn't be complete without the ability to play with friends. We hope that we can give our players an experience that brings them together like so many video games anchored some of our best childhood friendships.\nThe theme of the game is inspired by several classic movies of the 80s like Goonies and ET, films that show the adult world from a child's perspective, and the ways in which they try to understand it.  \nAnd the art-style is a mixture of Rex's own natural style, combined with influences from Eyvind Earle, Ronald Searle, Alex Grigg's exceptional \"Phantom Limb\" short film, and the production-design of Paranorman.\nWe've been extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to meet fans of our games in real life. It's an amazing feeling, but when we hear what they loved most about the game, we wish they had been there the entire time.\nKickstarter gives us an opportunity to recruit a group of fans who share our passion for this project. They can cheer us on and keep us moving forward when we are feeling down with misdirected doubt. More importantly, they can let us know if we're losing perspective and veering off track.\nOn such a small team, it's critical to not only get more voices, but the right voices. We're hoping that Kickstarter is a great way to find you all.\nRex Crowle served as the Creative Lead on both Tearaway and Tearaway: Unfolded and was a key artist on the LittleBigPlanet series.

He also worked on Moshi Monsters and created the iPad multiplayer game Ring Fling.\nTwitter: @oneofmoo\nKickstarter: Kickstarter Profile\nKnights and Bikes is an idea that we've been thinking about for a while. We have created a few different areas in the game to establish the range and consistency of the art style. We love the way it looks already, but will continue fine tuning it over time.\nOn the gameplay side, we've used these various areas to experiment with three of the core aspects of the game. We have built a conversation system to talk to the islanders, deal with quests, and purchase new gear. We've created a basic dungeon as a testing ground for our many enemy and weapon prototypes. And we've created a sprawling forest to get a feel for the explorational aspects of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a very ambitious project, especially for a team of two, but we definitely feel like we are up to the challenge. We each have over a decade of experience making games and have worked together for many years on a number of projects. Not only do we have experience making games with the backing of a studio, we have also shipped games with smaller teams like EpicWin and Ring Fling.\n\nEven though there are only two of us, we do cover a lot of disciplines, each willing to dive into any task that we think will result in making a better game. In addition, we are being smart about using off the shelf solutions (like Unity, Spine, and Yarn) when possible.\n\nWe also have a great support structure. On the personal side, we have great friends and family who have supported us through difficult projects before. On the development side, we have many friends in other development studios big and small who can give advice and lend a favor when in need. Speaking of which, we have some stretch goals in mind to bring in some specialists to help with certain aspects of the game to make it even better. But we'll talk about that if the time comes.\n\nOverall, we believe that with the combination of our passion for the project, support from our fan base, and help from our friends, we will be able to complete Knights and Bikes to the level of our extremely high standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #66", "update_userinfo": "Collector's Special Edition, Xbox, and Game Pass!", "update_content": "Howdy Backers!\n\nLong time no speak!

We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it.\u201d\nWhat does it mean, for you, yes, you\u2014the reader, the avid science fiction fan, purveyor of the imaginative even when faced by the banality of a day-to-day life\u2014to support a publication that is colored, and we mean, like really, really colored, by the nuances of culture, race, and history? For one, you get to read something that would dispel the notion of POC-penned science fiction as somewhat inferior science fiction. We will work very hard to come up with a lineup that will counter this assumption, and we will succeed in doing so.\nWe believe in science fiction\u2019s transformative powers, its ability to remedy the dreariness of our lives. People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! will exist, with your kind help, of course, to relieve a brokenness we\u2019ve enabled time and time again by favoring certain voices and portrayals of particular characters. We won\u2019t harangue you with guilt trips involving the importance of openly listening to the assimilated, the colonized, the misappropriated. That\u2019s just not how we roll. What we aim to do, instead, is to challenge you: Join us because it is fun to do so. We don\u2019t mean fun as a vehicle for trivializing centuries of injustice that resulted in the lack of representation for certain groups of people because power structures were skewed heavily in favor of a chosen few. We mean fun as the satisfaction we get in those light-bulb-in-the-head moments of our lives, the satisfaction we get from meaningful conversations that lend clarity, the satisfaction we get when we move past those feel-good-driven acts of tokenism, the satisfaction we get when we read stories that have palpable artistic and intellectual values that speak of our present time and most of all, our future.\nAs we said in our submission call, we will not be asking writers who submit stories to tell us what makes them \u201cpeople of colo(u)r.\u201d We leave that up to your world experience, your conscience, your sense of community, and your sense of fair play. And like the other hugely successful initiatives of Lightspeed\u2019s Destroy series, People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! is saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here. We have always been here.

In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF\u2014and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales. When you read LIGHTSPEED, it is our hope that you\u2019ll see where science fiction and fantasy comes from, where it is now, and where it\u2019s going.\nLIGHTSPEED is a two-time winner of the Hugo Award, and stories from LIGHTSPEED have been nominated for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award, and the World Fantasy Award. Previously, we crowdfunded our two other \"Destroy\" special issues: In 2014, we published Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014 and won the British Fantasy Award; and in 2015, we published Queers Destroy Science Fiction!, which received similar acclaim.\nWhen not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy.\nAll of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED.\nYou'll find our various reward options in a column on the right side of this page (PC/Mac) or on a separate page (iOS/Android). Below are some explanations and clarifications of our various reward options.\nAll backers who pledge at least $5 (the DESTROY SF! reward level) will receive an ebook copy of the LIGHTSPEED POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue. The special issue will be available in June 2016.\nAll ebook rewards, including ebook subscriptions, will be made available DRM-free in epub, mobi, and PDF format via our ebookstore. Mobi is primarily for Kindle/Kindle app users; Epub works on lots of things, such as Nook, Kobo, and iBooks.\nIf you select one of the subscription rewards, your subscription will begin with the June 2016 issue.\nSince all of the subscription rewards include the DESTROY SF! reward, the POCDSF special issue won't count against your subscription; so if you buy a one-year subscription, you'll really be getting 13 issues, rather than 12, etc.\nIf you are an EXISTING SUBSCRIBER: If you choose one of the subscription rewards, we'll just extend your current subscription by the specified term (i.e., by 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Note: We can only do this for subscribers who subscribe directly via the LIGHTSPEED store or via Weightless Books; unfortunately we can't offer to extend subscriptions for Kindle Periodicals subscribers. When we send out the Kickstarter survey after the campaign concludes, we'll ask you which store your subscription is currently with and renew it accordingly.\nIf you want the DESTROY PRINT reward, but also want to back at a higher tier, we also have options for that. Just look for the rewards that have PRINT in the titles.\nTo our international backers who want the DESTROY PRINT! reward\u2014we apologize for the stiff fee ($20) for international shipping, but that's what it costs, unfortunately! The print edition will likely be between 1-2 lbs., which means the shipping will be $18+, so we rounded that up to $20 for the \"handling\" part of \"shipping and handling.\"\nPREMIUM REWARD - Video Chats: Chats can be about whatever you want (within reason!) in connection with the theme of the project. So that includes the business of writing and publishing, science fiction/fantasy in general, POC SF/F specifically, etc. But if you just want to squee about your mutual interests, that's okay too!\nIn the event we massively exceed our goal, we'd like to thank our backers by offering the following stretch goals:\n(#1) $10,000 - Essays & Artwork Booster - UNLOCKED!\nThe Personal Essays we're posting on Kickstarter throughout the campaign will also be included in the issue, and we'll double the number of stories illustrated in the issue from four to eight.\n(#2) $15,000 - Destroy/Subscriptions Booster - UNLOCKED!\nIf you chose a LIGHTSPEED subscription reward, you'll get LIGHTSPEED issues #1-73 (including the POC Destroy Science Fiction! issue), and your subscription will begin with #74 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-73, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nIf you chose a NIGHTMARE subscription reward, you'll get access to NIGHTMARE issues #1-45, and your subscription will begin with #46 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-45, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.\nAll other reward tiers will get 3 additional back issues of LIGHTSPEED (for a total of 6), plus 3 back issues of NIGHTMARE and 3 back issues of FANTASY.\n(#3) $20,000 - JJA POC Sampler - UNLOCKED!\nLIGHTSPEED publisher John Joseph Adams will assemble an ebook sampler of POC-authored stories previously selected for publication in his many projects. Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be like a short anthology (about 50K words; about half the size of a normal anthology). All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#4) $25,000 - Podcasts Booster - UNLOCKED!\nWe normally podcast 4 (out of 8) stories we publish on our website each month. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll podcast all 7 short stories we publish on the website, plus one of the flash fiction pieces. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\n(#5) $30,000 - POC Destroy Horror! - UNLOCKED!\nWe'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Horror! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, NIGHTMARE. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Oct. 2016]\n(#6) $40,000 - POC Destroy Fantasy! - UNLOCKED!\nWe'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Fantasy! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, FANTASY. FANTASY merged with LIGHTSPEED in 2012, but we'll revive it for this one special issue. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Dec. 2016]\n(#7) $50,000 - JJA POC Anthology Booster\nWe'll make the JJA POC Sampler (the $20K stretch goal) into a full-sized anthology (about 100K words, about 20-25 stories). Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016]\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, then increase your pledge by the relevant amount.\nThere\u2019s no way to tell us NOW which add-ons you want (an unfortunate limitation of Kickstarter), so we\u2019ll get that information from you during the Kickstarter survey process after the campaign is over. Basically we\u2019ll send out the surveys and ask if you added any add-ons to your pledge, and then we\u2019ll cross-reference everything with the pledge data.\nSound complicated? It is! But it's the only way to offer the full array of options our backers have previously requested during our other campaigns.\nAdd-On Selections\nNote: All of the trade paperback rewards listed below INCLUDE the shipping price.

Pledge now at the Initiate level or higher to be eligible to become a SUPER BACKER when the campaign resumes! Details in the latest update!\nCharacters are the lifeblood of The Tower experience. This update delves into the characters, both new and old, who will be appearing within The Tower.\nLet's Talk Consortium includes the detailed narrative chart and post-mortem for CONSORTIUM Game One.  \nThe Factions at War for our Allegiance update goes into discussing factions and the Bishop classes and how it all ties into gameplay.\nIn the Consortium Bishop Combat 2.0 update , we dive deep into how combat in The Tower will be dramatically improved over the original Consortium combat experience.\nOur fourth update goes into how The Tower will be both a standalone AND continuing experience.\nOur third update is up, and this time we take a closer look at The Churchill Tower itself.\nIn our second update, we get DEEP into discussing how Diplomacy and the Spoken Word will be a major part of the gameplay. \nWe just released our first update:  The iDGi Mandate.  In here Gregory discusses the nature of Interdimensional Games and what drives us.\nThe experience of The Tower is one of absolute freedom of movement, speech and action, within a single-location, sandbox environment. There will be no cut scenes, and full control will never be taken away for \u201cgamey\u201d reasons. Immersion is absolutely paramount, and to that end the world within the Tower will feel realistically alive and reactive to however you choose to approach each and every situation.  \nA branching, \u201cwaterfall\u201d narrative and dialogue system should appeal to those looking for a truly replayable experience, and will ensure that your decisions are plentiful without feeling cheap or obvious.\nDiplomacy is a key way of traversing the narrative. Choose to speak anytime and anywhere with the push of a button. While rather difficult, you will be able to play through the entire experience without raising your weapon. Trick, bribe, scare, hire, or simply convince potential combatants to disarm, all while developing relationships with your crew, other Consortium officers, the London Police, and any other characters you meet throughout the experience.\nThe Bishop\u2019s arsenal of customizable, futuristic gadgetry gives him immense freedom of movement. Run faster, jump higher, glide through the air, breathe underwater, and fall from great heights, all while exploring every nook and cranny of the Tower.\nThe Bishop can also utilize highly experimental, potentially dangerous stealth technology, such as invisibility and sound dampening.\nFind yourself in the middle of intense firefights, and choose to either kill or incapacitate all those in your way. The Consortium officers working with you will praise you for using non-lethal means, but will react with increasing alarm should you too often resort to murderous violence. There may also be other factions interested in aiding you through the Tower, should the Consortium turn its back on you.\nAs with CONSORTIUM before it, many events within The Tower will play out regardless of your interaction with them, creating an environment cultivated for immersion and replayability. Your chosen actions (and inactions) within this environment will cause ripples, dramatically impacting the unfolding narrative in major ways.\nWe aim to simulate not just the Churchill Tower, but the people inside it and the world around it.  In many ways, we are striving to realize the \"One City Block RPG\" idea purposed by Warren Spector.\nThe following video takes a deeper look at some of The Tower\u2019s core mechanics, while also demonstrating three different ways the world press could respond to your actions as Bishop Six \u2013 is he a diplomat, ninja, or lunatic? Featured is Kiril Angelov, antagonist from Consortium Game One, and he's just been asked to comment on Bishop Six's \u201crecent behaviour.\"\nThis 2042 is connected on an unprecedented scale. Due to the unusual nature of the Churchill Tower hostage situation, there are literally billions of people watching your every (visible) decision unfold. We want you to feel as though your choices as Bishop Six carry weight on a global scale, and that those choices actually mean something.\nCrowds have formed around the tower, hundreds of police and reporters are on the scene, and you are at the centre of it all.\nThe Tower is a role-playing game in which you play as yourself, and you are being given the opportunity to physically control a man in a parallel world. His code name is Bishop Six, and he\u2019s a field agent for the Consortium, a powerful peacekeeping force in the not-quite-utopic future of 2042.\nThe Churchill Tower: most of our adventure takes place on top, inside and under this massive skyscraper in the heart of London, England\nWhen a hostage situation suddenly erupts within London\u2019s monumental Churchill Tower, Bishop Six and a team of Consortium officers are sent in to subdue the terrorists, and rescue the hostages. It sounds simple enough, but when the layers peel back you'll find that they just keep peeling. Everyone seems to want the Bishop on their side, but none are very keen to reveal just what \"their side\" truly stands for.\nConcept of the Churchill Tower Power Facility. This is where the hostages are being held, and is initially your primary mission objective.\nDiscover the source of an unnatural earthquake originating from below the Tower. Find out what's really behind the Tower's malfunctioning builder nanites. Befriend or manipulate the London Police to your advantage, or have them turn against you. Attempt to uncover the truth about the Consortium King (a sentient A.I., and the source of our connection to their world), his creator, the terrorists, your crew, and the Tower itself. Even gain the attention of a mysterious benefactor whose \"alternative\" ideas and perspectives will begin to make you question your definitions of \"friend\" and \"foe.\"\nWe're excited about creating an atmosphere where you're in the middle of a conflict for your trust and loyalty, with multiple sides struggling to keep your attention.\nTo further complicate matters, an old enemy of the Consortium tells us that within this \u201cgreat tower\u201d a global event is about to originate. The King demands our help in dealing with this, claiming multiverse-scale destruction if we refuse. Does his understanding of who we really are affect his judgement? And is the Consortium really the selfless peacekeeping organization he claims it to be?\nWithout warning enemies seemingly become friends while multiple factions vie for our assistance in unraveling a mystery stretching back thousands of years. Amidst all this chaos there is one question that only you, as the Bishop, can answer: Whom can you trust?\nThe Terrorists have taken over the Churchill Tower Power Facility, and believe it to be capable of arming a globally banned orbital bioweapon \u2013 they\u2019ve been sent in by unknown parties with instructions to prove this to the world through the use of the press.\nThe Consortium's main concern is the securing of the civilian hostages being held in the center of the Churchill Tower, and they are relying on you to make this happen as quickly as possible. Despite assurances that the Power Facility houses a safe, modern fusion reactor, the Consortium King is worried about it being tampered with and causing a devastating explosion that could destroy all of London.\nOne possible outcome...\nMysterious Benefactors encourage you to actively rebel against the Consortium. Potentially join them after gaining their trust, uncover their identity, and discover their claims of truth about the Consortium King and his officers.\nThe London Police are at first warned to keep their distance while the Consortium handle the situation. As things progress, the Police Chief can end up as friend or foe entirely dependant on your actions and interactions with him.\nA police cruiser surveys the situation...\nThe Churchill Tower itself will sometimes seem to be working for or against you: state of the art security systems, initially controlled by the terrorists, and the \u201cmalfunctioning\u201d builder nanites will need to be controlled and understood before they interfere with your mission.\nCivilians populate the various sections of The Tower, and include the hostages and any other people remaining behind after it was evacuated. As with everyone else, every civilian you meet will be a unique, fully fleshed out human being.\n1)  Add-ons can only be added at the $20 tier and higher\n2)  Simply choose what you want, and add the amounts to your pledge amount. Keep track of what you chose, as come survey time you\u2019ll need to tell us what add-ons you wanted.\n3)  Shipping charges to the U.S and Canada are *included* in these numbers, but other places in the world may have to pay additional shipping charges (to be worked out post campaign).\nT-shirts.  $60 for one, $80 for two  \nAdditional copy of the Backer Special Edition of Consortium: The Tower. $15\nFull name (or name of your choosing) used somewhere in the lore/gameworld.  $50  \nVidal's physical journal.  $110 \nPoster of The Tower signed by the team.  $80\nNon-signed posters, choose from two designs.

This means that what characters ended up where, inventory, decisions, relationships, and many conversational choices will be preserved as they were at the end of Game One, and in turn will affect situations and dialogue throughout The Tower. \nNew to the Franchise: An update will go into more detail on this, but for now you can rest assured that you do NOT have to play Consortium Game One in order to fully understand and enjoy the Tower from start to finish.\nThe Interdimensional Alternate Reality Game\nThe A.R.G. is packed with heavily layered backstory and lore for the iDGi-1 Trilogy through interactive media of all types. This particular rabbit hole goes as deep as you\u2019re willing to dig, but is absolutely not necessary to fully understand and enjoy Consortium and/or The Tower. To dive head-first into our Alternate Reality Game, started in 2010, click HERE and choose \"Experience.\u201d\nFor the latest from the A.R.G., click HERE and then select \u201cCONSOLE\u201d in order to access the iDGi-1 Command Line Interface. This is the first version of this console, and contains a single release of documents mostly pertaining to the Churchill Tower and events surrounding The Tower\u2019s story. Keep an eye out for hidden codes, and attempt to uncover a video the Consortium King does not want you to see!\nMaking games is expensive.\nWe will be gauging the success of this campaign to help us understand how much interest there is out there for this type of game, and of course how far you want us to go in realizing this project. We know exactly how to do it, and we're capable of going the whole way, but we can only do that if YOU - the global gaming market - WANT this type of game to be realized to the fullest extent possible.\nOther than what we established with Consortium, The Tower does not follow any specific formula or genre staple. Funding these kinds of projects using only traditional channels is difficult and would require us to make compromises, or at least oversimplify what we want to accomplish in designing this simulation.\nSimply put, we do not want to compromise on the vision of what we know can be accomplished.\nWe learned a lot from running the first Kickstarter for Consortium, and we feel more confident than ever that we can do this right on all fronts. The success of this campaign will quite literally Kickstart the production of The Tower and give us the means to fully produce it.\n70% of all money raised here will be spent on the salaries and invoices for the artists, programmers, designers, sound/foley folks and immense amount of voice production required to build this game. More money means larger workload, longer production cycle, and/or more employees to pay.\nThe remaining 30% will go towards all the various production and business expenses that are necessary, such as licensing fees, legal, accounting, development hardware / software, backer rewards and studio space. We have always been a partially-remote company, meaning we can hire from anywhere in the world, and employees are able to \"work from home.\" This in turn saves a lot on office expenses most companies pay a great deal for.\nWe built Consortium Game One over a long period, and on a budget that was very small considering what physically went into it. We've become very good at ensuring that everything goes where it needs to go in order to get the game made. This is a passion project for us, and so the game always comes first.\nWe do have various options for investors beyond what we raise here, but it really does entirely depend on the overall performance of this campaign to determine what kind of deal we can get. We want to make the ultimate version of this game, and therefore want its development budget to be as high as possible. No surprise there :)\nGiven our experience with making the first Consortium on an extremely tight budget, we are confident that we would be able to comfortably produce a great game with the minimum amount we're asking for here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike the campaign for our first game, this time around we are asking for a much larger portion of our total budget, and are therefore taking a bigger risk with launching this campaign. With the CONSORTIUM campaign we had already largely completed the game and required help to get us to the finish line (our CONSORTIUM Kickstarter goal covered about 10% of our total budget). With the larger scale of The Tower we are aiming for a larger total budget with a much larger portion of that coming from Kickstarter. \n\nWe already made CONSORTIUM. All of the core user interface, characters and game mechanics will be making a return in The Tower, albeit with a great deal of polish and improvement. This means that a significant amount of development risk is reduced compared to your typical project that has to make everything from scratch.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Interdimensional Games Inc\n3 created \u00b7 23 backed\nFounded by videogame industry veterans, iDGi is a collection of highly creative and driven individuals dedicated to advancing the art form...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "iDGi and Consortium in 2019...", "update_content": "Hi there,\nMany of you were interested in our project but did not follow us to Fig...just in you are still interested in our project...Consortium: The Tower is now available on Steam Early Access!\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/626250/Consortium_The_Tower/\nHere is the latest trailer for you all!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Consortium: The Tower NOW AVAILABLE", "update_content": "Greetings would-be KS backers of Consortium: The Tower:\nWe're one year into full production of the direct sequel funded by our successful Fig campaign, Consortium: The Tower, and we've made amazing progress!  \nHere is the video update:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Consortium: The Tower -- Project Update, June 2017", "update_content": "Hey folks,\nThere are just a couple of things we'd like to talk about real quick as we move toward our upcoming Fig campaign.\nInterdimensional Games Public Community Forum"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Last chance to support us and become a Super Backer!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nWe've spent much of the past week recuperating from the first half of this crowdfunding effort, but we promised you all a full update this week on how we're planning on resuming this campaign.

With it, you can play hundreds of word games and card games. Instead of numbers, sets and runs, you use letters and make words.\nLetter Playing Cards are for all ages. Whether you\u2019re just starting out learning your letters and words in pre-school, or a scholar of the English language, fascinated by words. Whether you're a backpacker travelling light and meeting new friends, or a parent with too much luggage.\nIt's a whole new dimension on the phrase \u2018Let\u2019s have a game of cards\u2019.\nExtensively play tested, vowels and high frequency letters carefully balanced to make game play smooth. High quality, 310gsm linen cards, printed by MPC (www.makeplayingcards.com) - the world renowned custom deck manufacturer.\nHere\u2019s the short list of some of the more popular games you can play with Letter Playing Cards.\nWord Poker; Texas Spell \u2018Em; Rummy / Gin Rummy; Brag (3,4, 5 card or 9 card!); Patience / solo games; Hangman; Snaffle - the letter grab game; Old Maid; Murder (or Mafia); Word Black Jack; Letter Cheat; Word Speed or Spit; Go Fish; Hearts; Indian Word Poker; Moogle; Spoons; Letter Whist; Anagrams; Crosswords; Ghost; Flash Cards, Spelling tests, Word Bridge.\n\nAll backers will receive a pdf rule book of several games, to get them started. There are many more games you can play and learn. And as more people play Letter Playing Cards, more games will be invented and shared.\nThe Story Behind the Game.\nI'm Rafi Arkin, an award-winning games designer. I love playing card games. Playing cards are one of the most versatile, portable and universal games on the planet. Everyone knows a game or two, and a deck of cards brings people together.\nI also love word games too.\nI had a moment of inspiration last year, when making a set of flash card letters for my daughter: Letter Playing Cards.\nBringing playing cards and word games together as one. A deck of cards that anyone can play with and hundreds of new games just waiting to be created and shared.\nWhat are you funding?\nAfter the excitement of launching my first game, Foundation, in 2012, and winning Best Abstract Game of the year at the UK Games Expo, I\u2019ve caught the bug. I have so many more game ideas I want to share with the world. Letter Playing Cards is the first.\nSo I\u2019ve kept the funding amount as low as possible to enable success. The smallest viable print run, \u00a3200 (roughly $300) excluding postage to get going. This will fund the first edition print run.\nThe money raised will only go on printing, packaging and sending of the decks. (And any fees from Kickstarter etc.)\nNext Steps\nOnce we\u2019re successfully funded, it\u2019s simple. We press the button on the printing process, and start printing the decks of cards. So that everyone can receive their rewards.\nMPC will be producing the high quality playing cards. Linen stock, 310gsm. Poker size. They have produced some of the most successful Kickstarter playing card projects.\nStretch Targets: Get One, Give One.\nLetter Playing Cards is really about have a great time playing card games. But I want to give something back, if I can. So if we reach the stretch target of 250 backers, we\u2019ll unlock \u2018Get one, Give one\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a really simple concept. Once we hit 250 backers, every pack you get as a backer, we will give another pack to an organisation that could use these cards to help kids learn their letters through play.\nIf you are a school, or educational organisation from anywhere in the world, and would benefit from receiving free packs, then get in touch. As soon as we hit our stretch target of 250 packs, we can start sending decks out to people who need them.\nThis works because of scale. We\u2019re able to increase our first print run, and reduce the production cost/pack. Simple and transparent to you. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept delivery separate.\nTo reach our stretch goals, we will only just break-even on the funding vs. costs. And that excludes our time, design work, or prototypes we\u2019ve already paid for.\nRewards\nThere are really just two main rewards, with an early bird and normal backing amount, and savings on multiple packs if your backing amount is higher.\n1 x Letter Playing Card deck \u201cHearts & Spades\u201d\n1 x Letter Playing Card deck \u201cDiamonds & Clubs\u201d\nYou can play most games with just one deck. Some games you\u2019ll want more cards for more people, or to include all 4 suits in your game.\nWho\u2019s in the team?\nRafi Arkin came up with the game idea, and brought it to life. I\u2019m an award-winning games designer, and also works in marketing, developing strategy and running successful advertising campaigns for many successful brands.\nI\u2019d like to thank\nDarren Kisner, for his magical copywriting tips.\nShed Simove, the Ideas Man, for general motivational pep talks and top tips.\nVarious people, you know who you are \u2013 for play testing Word Poker and Texas Spell \u2018Em.\nIsabelle and Sophie Arkin \u2013 for play testing a number of children\u2019s word games.\nKickstarter \u2013 for allowing me to share this project on their wonderful website.\nMPC - For printing the prototype decks\nThank you\nIf you\u2019ve reached the end of the page, then we\u2019d like to thank you for your interest in the project so far.

We\u2019ll be working with Jacek Tuschewski, audio director and sound designer on League of Geeks\u2019 recent hit Armello!\nFIGS LOCALIZATION\nAll the stories within The Warlock of Firetop Mountain will be translated into French, Italian, German and Spanish.\nIn 1982, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, co-founders of Games Workshop and the first distributors for Dungeons and Dragons in Europe, wrote the first Fighting Fantasy gamebook - The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. In a time when videogaming and the RPG industry were in their infancy, the adventure gamebook allowed wannabe adventurers to journey to other worlds, engage with evil forces and decide the fate of themselves and the quest they were set upon.\nWith the success of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain came a whole series of Fighting Fantasy adventures, over 50 of them with supporting novels and tabletop role-playing systems. Tin Man Games has already developed and released 8 of the original books as digital gamebook apps.\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain is nearing the end of pre-production. This means that the story, tech, and design have been finished and we have a detailed plan for the rest of development. We need to implement the remainder of the artistic elements for the game itself, prepare sound and music, and finish design of the user interface. Should the Kickstarter exceed our initial goal, we will be looking to localise to several languages.\nWe've signed a deal with Otherworld Miniatures in the UK to use their range of pewter figurines in The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. \nTo replicate the handmade look and feel, we first 3D scan the figurines into the computer and then digitally paint them to replicate a similar style to physical miniature painting.\nFor the more unique denizens of Firetop Mountain, such as Zagor above, or for hero characters or creatures that do not have pewter figurines, we will be modelling and texturing these from scratch.\nDeep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain lies an untold wealth of treasure, guarded by a powerful Warlock \u2013 or so the rumour goes. Several adventurers like yourself have set off for Firetop Mountain in search of the Warlock\u2019s hoard. None has ever returned. Do you dare follow them?\n Wait... that's just one adventure. How about we try something different?\nFurious at the cowardice of your Orcish lackeys, you, the Orc Chieftain, decide to take matters into your own hands. You will single-handedly infiltrate Firetop Mountain and drive out those foolish dwarves. And you will do it for the glory of almighty Zagor!\nOr how about this?\nDeep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain, your dwarvern ancestors once made their home. However, they were drawn out by an army of evil Orcs, who have since taken over the mountain for themselves. Will you venture into Firetop Mountain and reclaim your ancestral home?\n\nIt looks like there are more stories to be told within Firetop Mountain than first thought...\n\nCombat has always played a big part in the Fighting Fantasy series. We have developed a new combat system, known internally as GridBluff, where both you and your opponent move or attack simultaneously. Enemies use different attack patterns and you must anticipate their moves whilst positioning yourself for the fatal blow.\nFor old-school Fighting Fantasy fans, we will also be including the option to use the standard dice rolling mechanics as found in the original books.\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain was the entry point to the Fighting Fantasy series and introduced readers to the world of Titan, in particular the notorious land of Allansia. We have a grand vision and want our version to do the same for a new digital generation of adventurer.\n\nFollowing the release of Warlock, we plan on expanding our reach in Allansia and will be adapting a number of classic Fighting Fantasy titles such as Deathtrap Dungeon, the trap-filled and monster-infested labyrinth of Fang where many heroes compete in the Trial of Champions, followed by Citadel of Chaos and City of Thieves.\nWe also want give players the opportunity to take digital miniatures from one story into another and further expand those locations. What would happen if Throm the Barbarian from Deathtrap Dungeon turned up in Firetop Mountain or Bigleg the Dwarf from The Forest of Doom decided to enter the Trial of Champions?\nTin Man Games was founded in 2008 and released their first title, Gamebook Adventures 1: An Assassin in Orlandes, in March 2010.\nA strong release schedule followed and in 2012, Tin Man announced they were working with Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson to produce titles from the Fighting Fantasy series. Eight FF adaptations have since been developed using the original Gamebook Adventures Engine, including The Forest of Doom, House of Hell, Starship Traveller and Caverns of the Snow Witch.\nTo date, Tin Man Games has released over 30 digital gamebooks across Steam, Humble, the App Store, Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. These also include licensed titles based on Judge Dredd, Ryan North's To Be or Not To Be, Gary Chalk's Gun Dogs, Zach Weinersmith's Trial of the Clone and Matt Youngmark's Choose-o-matic series.\nFrom left: KG Tan, Oscar Francis, Clinton Shepherd, Kamina Vincent, Ben Kosmina, Neil Rennison, Ed Blanch (not pictured: Emma Rennison)\nFighting Fantasy is a trademark owned by Steve Jackson & Ian Livingstone \u00a9 1982, 2002, 2010, 2015.

Explore a few scenes, talk to some people, solve a puzzle and guess which Murakami stories inspired us in this demo! Send your answers to BitByterz@gmail.com by 8th of November and the winner will be a character in the game.\nThree years ago I sat down with a friend to brainstorm for making a game. We both came up with the idea of a game inspired by short stories of renowned Japanese author Haruki Murakami. His work had inspired us profoundly and we thought that the vague, surrealistic reality of his fictional world would have a great potential for being turned into something visual and could lead to the creation of odd characters, an essential element in game design. After a while, my friend moved to another country, but I continued working on the idea. I wrote a script for the game, inspired by more than 20 stories by Murakami and started working on the game with a new team.\nWhat does memoranda mean? Memoranda is the plural form of Memorandum, which is defined as \"a short note designating something to be remembered, especially something to be done or acted upon in the future; reminder.\"\nMemoranda is a classic 2D Point & Click game for Linux, Mac and PC. It include more than 40 scenes, 30 characters and numerous puzzles. The puzzles are not always very easy to solve, but there are always enough clues in the story to solve them. This is the protagonist, who little by little realizes she is forgetting her own name. Interestingly, after working on the game for several years, we forgot to actually have a name for this character, and just use a nickname for her. But is she really losing her memory? Or is there something else that would explain the strange circumstances? We will find out as the story unfolds.\nThe story happens in a little town, where there are both laptops and bamboo water clocks. The town has a European-like architecture but that doesn't mean it belongs to somewhere in Europe. The characters include anything from a WWII surviving soldier to an elephant taking shelter in a man's house hoping to become human. But there's one thing that all characters have in common: they all are losing something. And that could be anything...it could be a name, a film reel box or someone's sanity! Our primary mission is to help the main character find her name back.\nMeet some of the characters, Look at some scenes and see how we animated the game:\nThe game's sound and music is still in process. To get a feel of the sound design listen to these three samples.\nWe have emptied our pockets during the first rounds of developing the game. To finish the development, which includes sound design, code optimization and debugging, and plug-in purchases, we need additional support. If we reach our Kickstarter goal, we will be able to finish the game in two or three months and release it on Steam website.\n Where the money goes? Please look at the pie chart below:\nWe have worked on this project for three years and we are confident that with additional funding we can devote all our resources to finishing the project in the next few months. Currently, we are working on the final stages of the development, namely debugging the alpha version of the game and working on sound design and music. Given that we have passed the biggest hurdles and are in the final stage, we are confident that the risk of not finishing the game is very small and close to zero.\nWho Are We\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee below the bamboo clock!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "The iOS version is ready and will be available on the App Store on November, 1", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Anyone interested in localizing? :)", "update_content": "Hi All,  \nThe whole team at Bitbyterz wanted to thank you all one more time for helping us make this project happen.

Now I'm remaking the game for a younger audience.\nDraw a card! Read it aloud! Now do what it says... forever.\nThose are all the rules of the game! As the games go on you will balance cards on your body and contort yourself. You're In A Bind, but you still need to draw your next card!\nAll the while, you'll need to remember to do your 'triggered binds' on your turn, making animal noises and jiggling, patting or clapping.\npracticing reading\nlearning the names of basic bodyparts\nteamwork, as older children read the instructions for preschoolers\nmemory, for triggered binds\nco-ordination and dexterity, specially when drawing cards\nIn a Bind Jr takes around 15 minutes. It's best for 3-6 people but you can play with even bigger groups by combining decks and splitting into teams.\nEach card has an instruction. All are supremely simple alone, but the combinations are not!\nThe goal is survival! If you can't (or forget to) follow an instruction, you get a warning. 3 strikes and you're out!\nTeam-based mode: anyone on the team can draw, anyone can read the card and any one person on the team needs to follow the instruction.\nFor even more teamwork, try co-operative mode! Everyone draws, reads the card aloud, then gives the card to someone else. How far can you make it through the deck?\n\"A great ice-breaker for new members of the family.\" - a foster parent at a public demo\n\"Fun, zany, good times\" \"It could go over real well as an educational game due to its focus on different body parts.\" - Bower's Gaming Corner\n\"I think the game works really well.\" \"The rules sheet is perfect.\" - Imagination Gaming\n\"Always creates a fun atmosphere.\" - Rob Harris, organiser of Playtest UK,  Developer at Modiphius\n\"Genius idea!\" \"How does this not already exist?!\" - Andrew Smith, founder of Spilt Milk Studios\n\"The best game ever\" - Elzbieta Momola (attendee of the Edinburgh 'Crowdfun' event)\n\"The kids had a lot of fun, which is really the whole point of the game.\" - Bower's Gaming Corner\n \"My kids had a BLAST!\"\nTwo years ago, I started designing a game that had one 'physical' card. After the first playtest, I was encouraged to delve further into the physical aspect and within a week had created a game with challenges that forced folk to hop around tables, spin around, and make long noises.\nBy December 2013, I had simplified it manyfold and strangers at a UK game convention all enjoyed it. The concept was proven!\nOver the next few months, I continued simplifying the game, then tweaking the cards for maximum fun, ensuring it was difficult but never impossible.\nLate 2014, it was kickstarted and by June 2015, backers were enjoying their own copies. At this point, In A Bind is on sale in various shops around the UK and hundreds of people have enjoyed it!\nBack in January 2015, I attended the UK Toy Fair. One shop owner suggested that I make a children's version, something that's been suggested by a few more folk in the past few months.\nI have done my due diligence, testing and research. I've watched around 30 children and hundreds of adults playing this game. Younger children specially love the triggered actions and silly noises, whilst everyone enjoys the contortions of their friends and the physical challenges they overcome.\nI wish to present: In A Bind Junior.\nI took the best cards from the expansion, took away (or modified) cards that overly frustrated 4-year-olds and added more animal noises.\nIn A Bind Jr is simpler (and sillier) and has been proven to still be fabulous fun, even for adults!\nThis game is aimed at children from around 4-8. As long as one of the children is old enough to read, they should be able to play together without adult intervention.\nIf it's played as a family game, every generation will have fun - children, adults and grandparents.\nThis is the first edition of In A Bind Jr, and also (almost certainly) the smallest print-run. Each edition will feature all-new artwork, so if you care about 'limited edition' things, this will be the most 'exclusive'.\nFuture editions will be similar but different, tweaked based on feedback.\nA NOTE ON PRICE\nThese prices are calculated at 10% above my costs, based on a print run of 500. This is a venture, aimed at printing a small print run to test demand and get some feedback, rather than making profit.\n\nThe 'discounts' for buying more games is entirely due to the cost of postage.\nWhen this is sold after the KS, the RRP will be \u00a39.\nYou are getting a great deal, if I may say so.\nAll-new art. Watercolours. More fantastical creatures.\nRemoved left/right, modifying cards.\nRemoved cards that refer to specific fingers (e.g. index finger).\nRemoved 'one eye closed' as some younger children can't physically do this.\nRemoved some other cards (e.g. 'two arms touching') to lower difficulty/frustration.\nRemoved some other cards (e.g. 'this card in armpit') to avoid wear and tear.\nAdded 'triggered binds' that appeared in the expansion, modifying them to trigger once a round (not each turn).\nAdded a lot more animal noises (ducks, cows, lions, frogs\u2026).\nDuplicated some cards that ask you to put this card somewhere. They will still all have unique art, but the character will remain consistent, to help comprehension. One card - 'this card between 2 fingers' is duplicated 6 times, whilst 'this card on top of head' only exists once to make the game generally easier. There are still 55 unique cards with 40 unique instructions.\nAdd \u00a33 to your pledge and I will write a small dedication to you (or a friend) inside the lid. You can either tell me what to write (up to around 50 characters) or just give me the name(s) and leave the rest up to me.\nIf you are buying multiple copies, add \u00a33 for each copy you want signed and dedicated.\nIf you want to buy a copy of the original In A Bind + Expansion pack, add \u00a314 to your pledge for each copy you want.

As mentioned, I personally struggle to do just one thing. But as stated, I'll wait until the IAB Jr files are sent off to the printer so I can progress to the next thing with a clear conscience. Next time, I'll be more mindful of my need to switch projects from time to time and give myself the time and freedom to do so.\n\nYesterday, on a bus to Scotland, I put my new laptop to good use and finally finished the manual and card front PDF. The box art is also done, though I edited one picture this morning, so it must be re-rendered. The card back is the only thing remaining.\n\n\nI previously suggested you could mix IABJr with IAB cards. I forgot that Trefl and Cartamundi print at slightly different sizes. As such, they might be difficult to shuffle together.\n\nI'd known this going into the campaign and had mentioned this (under 'Add ons'). But I'm sorry for briefly forgetting and perhaps getting someone's hopes up.\n\nAnyway, I'm still going to go with a near-identical card back. I think that has more potential for hilarity and - since the fronts of the original IAB are all black and white - they're still easy to distinguish.\n\nAfter I redo the card back to fit the new dimensions, it's a case of uploading a few Gb of art files, getting it verified by Trefl (the printer I'm using) and then waiting for them to get it done. Most of this will require almost no input from me.\n\nI am going to run my next KS on Thursday.\n\nI think at this point, you should expect to get your games at the end of May/start of June, though this is just an estimate and it depends where in the world you live.\n\nI have not yet sent out surveys to get your addresses. I will do so soon, and then I will need you to fill that out at some point before I can post you anything.\n\nThis year, I actually have a stand at UK Games Expo - my first time that I won't be there as a volunteer but a trader! - and if you're in the UK, you could come over to grab your game, if you prefer that option.\n\nHaving attended for 5 years as a non-trader, I can say that it's a lot of fun.

Stop them by whatever means necessary. \nA single selector (phone number, email address, name) is all it takes for your team to surveil a target. It\u2019s your job to decipher the intel, and follow the trail to its source.\nBut surveillance has a price...\nIn the paranoid world of the NSA, anyone can become a target, and soon your friends are in the firing line. \nEveryone has something to hide, will you reveal it?\nWant a taster? Try the demo to get a first look of what the finished game will be like.\nNSA HQ, Fort Meade -where the story unfolds\nTop Secret is a narrative-driven game played by email. Fundamentally, it\u2019s an exploration of the complex issues raised by the Snowden leaks.\nBlend of fact and fiction: You\u2019ll investigate the journalists involved in the Snowden leaks and the methods they used to cover their tracks. Uncover real messages sent by Snowden at the time.\nNon-linear, branching narrative: You choose who you surveil and in what order. The direction your investigation takes is entirely up to you.\nShorter, richer: Numerous unchosen possibilities add depth to the story. You will only see a fraction of the game content in a single playthrough.\nDelayed consequences: Players are encouraged to roleplay rather than optimise strategy - choices will have significant consequences, but not necessarily immediate or expected ones.\nAsk more of players: The game will demand your curiosity and focus. But hey, you\u2019re leading an investigation for the NSA, it was never gonna be easy right?!\nReal-time story  \nThe narrative unfolds in real-time over many days. The player has time to reflect on their choices, and immerse themselves in the story.\nPlaying by email adds new dimensions to traditional interactive fiction. A delayed response can mean a character is busy, disinterested, or cautious. A quick reply can signify impatience, anger, or excitement. Top Secret injects meaning into both the contents and timing of a message.\nMaster the encryption methods used by Snowden\nPlay with the real encryption method used by Snowden\nReceive and decrypt enciphered messages at critical moments in the game. Use your ingenuity and crypto skills to uncover all of the secrets!\nFor added authenticity, Top Secret can be played with PGP so you can encrypt/decrypt every message in the same way Snowden did to hide from the NSA.\nAll you need to play the game is an email address!\nYou will receive and reply to real emails from the characters in the game. You read and reply to them just like any other normal email you receive, directly from your inbox.\nThe content of each message suggests various reply options to the player. Including one of the options in your reply continues the story. E.g. for the message:\n\u201cShould we do X or Y?\u201d\na valid response would be:\n\u201cLet\u2019s do X\u201d\nBut choose wisely! Your choices determine how the story progresses and can have unforeseen consequences.\nFor interactive fiction fans, Top Secret is more a choice-based (rather than parser) game. Email latency does not encourage much experimentation with replies, so the game tries to make valid options completely transparent. It\u2019s about the choices you make, rather than working out the possible responses.\nPlatforms supported\nBest played by email, Top Secret also supports offline play on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux\nTop Secret is best played in real-time by email and can be played on any device which supports email. The game will also be available as a digital copy for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\nThe digital copy is DRM-free and is completely playable offline. The content is identical to the email version, but messages are sent and received immediately from a fake inbox.\nAll reward tiers with the game include both the email AND digital copy.\nUntil now Top Secret has been entirely self-funded, but I need your help to finish the game.\nSo where will the money go and why I am asking for \u00a38000?\nYour support will cover the cost of the remaining programming and content creation. After fees and physical reward costs, the money is broken down as follows:\n- 70% will fund the writing and gameplay iteration\n- 25% will be used to improve the game tech and content-creation tools (both of which will be open sourced)\n- 5% will fund art assets for the reward tiers (poster, t-shirt) and promotion (logo, wallpapers)\nJust as importantly, I really need your feedback and knowledge to make this game the best it can be.

Top Secret is going to be a collaborative experience, I want you all to get involved!\nFailbetter Games Incubation\nTop Secret will be incubated by Failbetter Games! They\u2019ll be giving advice, support, and office space throughout the development of the game. \nExperts in game writing, Failbetter have successfully taken a game from Kickstarter to launch and beyond so know the best practices when it comes to developing a crowdfunded game.\nRead more about the incubation and what it means for Top Secret here.\nProgress\nI\u2019ve already been working on Top Secret for 10 months now and have a prototype. Emails are sent to the player in real-time, replies are received, PGP encryption is supported, and all the core gameplay elements are in place.\nBut the game is not yet finished!

I created this game by working backwards from that price point, figuring out the size and weight limitations to be able to mail it anywhere in the world at the cheapest possible rate, and then setting the leftover amount per game as my production budget.\nIn this two-player tabletop game, each person controls a starcraft carrier and its six squadrons of fighters and bombers. Players take turns launching their squadrons, dogfighting in space, launching torpedoes at the enemy carrier, and escaping back to their own mothership. There, they reload, refuel, and line up on the flight deck to launch on another mission.\nParts of the Game: Carrier Commander will consist of a board printed on a single 14 pt card, with the rules printed on the back and the counters printed on the left and right margins to save space and printing cost. The board, rules, and counters will all be available as print & play .pdf as well.\nEach side has:\n1 frigate - a support ship that maintains a defensive line against incoming enemy fighters and bombers, and can help recover damaged ships\n3 starfighters - starships that are purpose-built for shooting down enemy fighters, but can be used to torpedo the enemy mothership at need\n3 torpedo boats - heavy attack starships that are purpose-built for taking out the mothership, but can be used to shoot down enemy fighters at need\nBreakdown of Expenses: The minimum print run is 250 copies. Here is the line item breakdown of cost per game. Note: I collected quotes from 22 printers before figuring out how I could do this; this itemized list is as good as inexpensive as I can possibly make it. Here is the exact breakdown, using the heaviest and most expensive contents from the stretch goals. Obviously, if we don't hit those stretch goals, it will be a bit lighter and a bit cheaper. Also, as volume goes up, the per-unit cost goes down (except the postage and Kickstarter fees, which are fixed).\nKickstarter & Credit Card Fees $0.300 (0.000 oz)\n24 pt Board @ 4\"x9\" (102mmx229mm) $0.340 (0.445 oz)\n100# Rule Sheet @ 4\"x9\" (102mmx229mm) $0.171 (0.223 oz)\nInternational Postage for Letter @ 1 oz $1.200 (0.010 oz)\n#10 Tyvek Envelope $0.348 (0.110 oz)\nAddress Processing $0.380 (0.000 oz)\n2 mil Zip Lock Bag @ 4\"x9\" (102mmx229mm) $0.140 (0.110 oz)\nTOTAL - $2.879 (0.898 oz)\nSo if all stretch goals are unlocked, we'll squeak in under the weight limit (probably the single most important part of the whole project, as increased weight means higher postage cost) and the per-game cost will still be under the $3 pledge level.\nThis game requires one 6-sided die. Players roll the die on their turn and have a number of options available to them according to the result. Some numbers give you multiple options, so you'll have to choose which to do.\n1-3 Activate a Squadron - Advance a launched squadron this many spaces towards the enemy carrier. If the squadron is within this many spaces of the enemy carrier, it fires a torpedo at the enemy then turns and begins the trip home.\n3-5 Activate the Carrier - Advance a squadron one space in your own carrier. Squadrons need to be recovered upon arrival, then moved from the flight deck to the hangar bay to be refueled and rearmed, then returned to the flight deck for launch.\n5-6 Activate the Frigate - Move the frigate one space in either direction. The frigate acts as a support ship, shooting at enemy spacecraft and repairing damaged friendly spacecraft.\nIn this example of play, consider the following situation.\nEach starship counter is double sided. One side has a squadron at full strength, the other has the squadron damaged. Damaged squadrons cannot move or shoot, but they still occupy that space on the board. If your frigate can get to them in time, the squadron can be repaired and continue its mission. If any enemy gets a hit on a damaged squadron, it is destroyed and removed from the game. The first player to eliminate all enemy squadrons from the game wins.\nThe margin on this game is thin enough that I can't open up my other games as add-ons just yet. If I did, we'd run the risk of unlocking a stretch goal because of the funding level, but not actually being able to afford it because the money that would have paid for it instead needs to pay for other games.\nBut what Ican do is let backers add additional copies of Carrier Commander for $3 each. You can add any number of copies you want, it could be one additional game, it could be 21 additional games. This will effectively turn one backer into multiple backers, because the games will mail separately in individual envelopes. Unless, of course, I can find some newfangled way to squeeze multiple games into a single envelope and not go insane trying to keep thousands of backer incentives organized and accurate. For now, they'll mail separately.\nKickstarter Crowdfunding - Friday, September 4 - Sunday, September 27\nFunds Deposited - estimated Monday, October 12\nPrint Run Commissioned - estimated Tuesday, October 13\nPrint Run Shipped - estimated Tuesday, October 20\nPrint Run Arrives - estimated Monday, October 26\nIncentives Mailed - estimated Tuesday, October 27\nUSA Incentives Delivered - estimated beginning Wednesday, October 28 (In the past, 97% of USA incentives have been delivered within a week, but I've had USPS take up to 23 days.)\nForeign Incentives Delivered - estimated beginning Tuesday, November 3 (In the past, most European incentives arrived in 5-7 days, Spain and Italy in 6-9 days, the rest of the world 10-16 days; Australia and Canada can take up to a month, Argentina can take two months.)\nUNLOCKED! - Upgrade Board to 16 pt Cardstock: 14 pt is about normal for trading cards and card games, and a bit thicker than normal playing cards. But it's kind of thin for a board. When we reach this level of funding, I'll be able to upgrade the board from 14 pt to 16 pt card stock.\nUNLOCKED!! - Upgrade Board to 24 pt Card Stock: Now we're talking! I've got samples from the printer, and this is good stuff. Whereas the 14 and even 16 pt stocks can be difficult to handle, this card stock is thick enough that you'll be able to manipulate it, grip the edges, and flip it, unlike the thinner stock, where you sometimes have to push it to the edge or up against something to get a handle on it.\nUNLOCKED!!! - Upgrade to Separate 24 pt Board & Counters and 100# Rules Sheet: Having the rules on the back of the board saves money, but it can be a pain in the neck, until you've played a few games and have them more or less memorized. At this level, I can afford to have the rules printed separately from the board, and the counters, too. That means that you won't have to worry about messing up the board with a bad cutting job on the counters.\nUNLOCKED!!!! - Add a 2 mil Zip Lock Bag: Sometimes the local post offices aren't too careful with your mail. Sometimes it gets wet. (Too bad all the junk mail seems to arrive in perfect shape, though, right?) At this funding level I will purchase zip lock bags in bulk and all games will be packed and mailed in a bag for protection against the elements.\nUNLOCKED!!!!! - New Missions & Counters: At this funding level, the volume discount will make expanding the game affordable. Carrier Commander will grow from a single mission game (Carrier v. Carrier) with two teams of 7 counters to a three-mission game (Asteroids! Trench Run) with two teams of 15 counters, overlays to turn carriers into bases or freespace, and new options such as defense towers, asteroids, mines, dropships, space marines, civilian space trains, and AWACs. It also adds the ability to \"charge up\" your forces by calling Flight Quarters, Shields Up, or Admiral on the Bridge.\nThe new rulebook, with two new missions, options for advanced play, and solo rules.\nThe new counter sheet, with all the new units, overlays, and charge ups.\nUNLOCKED!!!!!! - Gloss Laminated Counter Sheet & Resized for DVD Case: At this level, I can upgrade the counters to a gloss laminated sheet. This will increase the longevity of your game and help protect it from the ravages of time and handling. The downside is that the board will be slightly thinner to make up for the weight of the laminate, but you handle the counters a lot more than you handle the board, so that's a smart trade, right? Also, the gloss will help those colors pop. Another great thing about this stretch is that by switching to the more expensive printer, it opens up different sizing options, including (drum roll) one that is just about perfect for a DVD case. I won't be able to mail the cases to you, but if you want to store your game in one and have an extra, here it is. I'll even work up a cover for you to print out and slip in.\nUNLOCKED!!!!!!! - Another $3 game!: This is where the heat-bonded lamination stretch goal breaks out of single digit cents and turns a profit in the double digits again. So if we hit this funding level, I will consider this both a creative success and a financial success, and I will commit to creating another $3 game. I don't know what it is, yet ... but I'll commit to doing another one.\nPocket Option Games was started by me (C. S. Ferguson) to revitalize microgames. Board games have had a colossal increase in size, weight, and price, so much that many people can't afford them. In 1977, Metagaming Concepts introduced microgames: a hex map, a counter sheet, and a rule booklet, all in a ziplock bag for $2.95. They were accessible, playable, and portable. Unfortunately, Metagaming went bankrupt after 9 years. Pocket Option Games picks up where they left off. $2.95 in 1977 adjusts for inflation to $11.62 in 2015. So I'm creating small, lightweight, fun games that can be produced and delivered worldwide for $11.62. Slip a game under the cover of a book, in the corner of a handbag, or into a jacket pocket. That's what makes these pocket options. Take a look!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Project must fund. (duh) \n2) I must remain sound of mind and body.

Thousands of random characters are born, live and die as the game is generated, creating totally unique societies each time. When starting a new game you do so from your character's birth, choosing your parents and all your major life choices as you grow up. Your choices determine your personality, your friends, relatives, business contacts and your enemies.\nThere is no set story. The game generates thousands of characters, events and interactions to set the scene: as a player, you are born into this world and form relationships in it before the game starts. You\u2019ll then be able to create your own legend within this world: explore the known (and unknown) solar system, trade goods, run missions, leverage your contacts, and avenge members of your family as you see fit.\nHere's the core gameplay loop you'll experience when playing the final game (some features coming soon):\nYou land at London's space port and immediately head to the market to see if an old contact of yours, Caleb Churley, will still give you a good deal on your cargo. Whilst offloading your metal delivery, you discover through chatting to Caleb that he needs a parcel taking to Vikon on Venus. It's a bit of a distance, but you know they're short of water at the moment, so you buy all you can fit into your small ship. Caleb's grateful for the parcel delivery, so you get a good price on the cargo.\nYou drop by the bar on the way out, and discover that Rachel Holden was seen in Vikon recently. You've been meaning to try and track her down, as you've been asked by the local crime syndicate to keep them up to date with her whereabouts. This little trip is turning into the perfect excuse to handle some unfinished business.\nYou debate whether to take passengers to Vikon. Your ship isn't fitted with passenger cabins yet, but it's worth seeing who wants to go. In a local hotel you find three people keen to go: almost too keen. They're willing to pay way over the odds for transport, which means you're likely to have someone on your tail once you leave Earth's safe zone. We can run that risk, but in order to have space for the cabins on your ship, you'll need to remove your escape capsule. That means if the ship gets blown up it's game over for you. It's a huge risk, but you could really do with the money... plus one of the passengers is the son of Charles Heckler, someone you'd love to get an introduction to...\nSol Trader isn't just a concept: it's already in beta. This game is already real, and already fun, with all the features listed above (apart from those listed as \"coming soon\"). We are already greenlit on Steam.\nI'm on Kickstarter to raise awareness, to give people a chance to get in on the beta process early, and to help make the game awesome during the final few months of development. The money I've asked for will mainly go towards artwork and music costs:\nIf you back at the \u00a310 OWNER level and above then we'll send you a copy of the game on release. If you want additional copies, then just add \u00a310 to your pledge for each extra copy.\n\u00a310 was originally the early bird tier, but it seems unfair for people to get a better price just because they happened to check the site quicker than others. Therefore I've decided to offer everyone on Kickstarter the \u00a310 early bird price. The price will go up to the retail pre-order price of \u00a315 as soon as the campaign ends!\nBy backing this Kickstarter at the \u00a320 INSIDER level and above you'll get a access to new beta builds as they are released, right from the end of the campaign. You will be able to shape the game during its final months. Plus you'll get some great rewards, too :) INSIDER will still be available after the campaign ends but will cost \u00a325 instead of \u00a320 - don't miss the Kickstarter price!\nI have no plans to launch on Steam Early Access as it restricts beta access only to people using Steam. There will be a regular Steam launch on game release. The game will retail at \u00a315 on Steam.\nmore varied missions\ndifferent cultures\nmore planets to explore\na full weapon and ship customisation system\nmore artwork and sound\nIf we blow through our target, then I have more awesome stuff I'd love to add! See the Stretch Goals section below.\nThe preview demo only has about a third of the art content I want it to have on launch. Aamar Rana my resident artist has some cool concepts for some extra jump gates and there are many more planets and moons to create. Some of the money will go on commissioning this artwork, plus custom art for some of the rewards.\nI have commissioned a soundtrack from the awesome Andy Dollerson and he's done a great job of capturing the mood and feel of the game. We're planning four main tracks, with more as a future Stretch Goal. As a taster, here's the first preview track:\nThis roadmap is subject to change and reordering, but will give you an idea of what's left to do and what order I'll add new features in.\nAt the start of my career, I worked for four years as a professional AAA games programmer. I worked at Elixir Studios, working on Evil Genius, Republic: the Revolution and other unannounced titles.\nAfter this, I built a software service company from scratch to 12 people, creating and shipping lots of software projects for customers. I started programming 30 years ago and have been programming professionally for 16 years. I now train other programmers and blog and speak at conferences regularly on programming and team dynamics.\nVisit my blog for more about me \u226b\nI've been working on Sol Trader since November 2011.

You will also get a Steam key.\nAccess to the beta program: You'll get access to a special forum which I'll use to distribute new build of the game and to gather feedback. Builds will be released regularly and I will spend a good deal of time reading and responding to feedback and engaging with the community.\nA digital copy of the Sol Trader soundtrack: You will receive all the music composed for the game as a set of high definition music files.\nThe Sol Trader guide: you will receive a digital PDF book with hi-res art, all the schematics and images of the various ships and the history of the Sol Trader universe.\nAdd a name to the ancestor database: you may add one name and surname of your choosing to the database of ancestor names. A fixed number of these names will be taken at random when generating a new history. All names must be approved by me before being added and must fit into the game world.\nPrinted Sol Trader manual: We have a real treat in store for you here. We're producing a cloth covered hardbound version of the Sol Trader manual, with embossed silver leaf title. The book will contain both the regular game manual (distributed free with the game as a PDF) and the Sol Trader guide.\nLife time season pass for upcoming DLCs for free: you'll get a free key for every piece of DLC content I ever produce for Sol Trader.\nCoaching Conference calls: I work as a software team consultant for many different companies, teaching development, games, code, great team practice, testing, communication and leadership. I'm offering a one hour consultancy session on Skype where I can hear the issues you're facing, make recommendations, point you to other resources and help you avoid common errors.\nI've written a lot of articles at http://chrismdp.com - have a read for an idea of how I might be able to help.\nThe conference calls need be during UK office time and both be scheduled within 60 days of the Kickstarter closing.\nDinner in London: I'll take you out to a slap up dinner at a top restaurant in central London, where you can ask lots of questions about the game, pick my brains about game development, marketing, or chat about anything you like. We'll pay for food and wine, you pay your own travel costs. You must be available to come to London in early December 2015. This one is for over 18s only.\nName an in-game city: All names must be approved by Chris before adding :)\nDesign a ship: come up with a concept picture, name and description and we will add your ship permanently to the game. All designs and text must be approved by Chris before added and must fit into the game world.\nDesign a famous NPC: Your NPC will form part of the history of the game before the generation starts, and their story will be written into the history as printed in the Sol Trader guide and manual.

It's also possible that any stretch goals will cause this deadline to slip slightly, or I need to tweak game balance more than expected to make the end result better. \n\nIt's definitely coming out though. I've got this far. If there are any delays in shipping the game next April, I'll communicate promptly through Kickstarter updates.\n\nThanks very much for checking out my campaign: if you have any questions please do let me know.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Ealdorlight's Kickstarter is live!", "update_content": "Dearest Sol Trader backers,\nIt's the moment you've been waiting for - the Ealdorlight Kickstarter is live!\nVisit the campaign >>\nI decided fairly early on that I wanted to take Ealdorlight to Kickstarter.

It's both the game I had always wanted to play as a kid and a present for my daughter to enjoy today \u2013 for her to have fun, and perhaps even learn something in the process. In the 2 years I\u2019ve already spent on development, it would sometimes cross my mind that I should've just bought her some candy or a toy instead, but since I've gone so far it'd be rather silly to back out now. Encouraged by my cooperation with OhNoo, I want to finish what I started, in the scope that this game truly deserves.\nOhNoo: TSIOQUE is the next stage of our in-house engine we had created for our previous games. Aside from controlling the protagonist, you can also control the camera. This small element adds dynamic to the classic adventure gameplay. We're also developing a dynamic music system, changing moods and themes to fit the player's actions. You can hear the sample of it in the demo. It's the blend of dynamic music and rich frame-by-frame animation that makes the game unique.\nA 100% hand-drawn adventure with a unique atmosphere and a vivid, individual style, by the award-winning animation filmmaker and self-proclaimed genius Alek Wasilewski.\nStory with a twist \u2013 a clever storyline that may surprise you.\nHumor? Check. Darkness? Check. Suspense? Check! What more could you ask for?\nLOTS of 2D animation \u2013 all characters and items are hand-animated, frame-by-frame, old-school-style.\nA living, breathing environment, full of hidden interactions. Did we mention the game would have lots of animation?\nExceptional soundtrack by Edward Harrison (NEOTOKYO, LUCKY DAY FOREVER) and Elle Kharitou, dynamically illustrating the gameplay and adjusted to your every action.\nThe protagonist \u2013 a little girl with a talent for bringing chaos and destruction wherever she goes. Those who dare stand in her way are in for a lot of trouble...\nBeautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds.\nFully voiced dialogue tracks.\nNot just for children \u2013 a multi-layered tale, created with respect for both younger players and older, more demanding ones, which can be appreciated by everyone on their own level.\nYou can \"die\" in this game! - It's an adventure game, so explore, solve puzzles... but beware. You will not always have the comfort of infinite time for solving a problem \u2013 sometimes you may need to think fast! Other times, you may want to think twice before choosing a course of action, as the wrong decision may cost you your freedom... or worse!\nNon-episodic storytelling \u2013 you will find no \"Find out what happens next, pay more money!\" cliffhangers here. We are not particularly fond of episodic gameplay, so here, you get the complete experience \u2013 the story told from start to finish, from the introduction to the grand finale.\nA changing, mysterious and dangerous world \u2013 even before the Wizard's attack, the castle held many secrets. Now, bound by a powerful spell, the castle has not only become home to demons and magical creatures, but also, itself, has been affected by the evil power... It bends and shapeshifts, forming layers upon layers of transformation and illusion... It is an essential part of the plot and \u2013 especially later in the game \u2013 is tightly integrated into the gameplay.\nThe primary source of inspiration was inarguably LIFE, which always writes the best stories. But of course we do not live in cultural vacuum. While developing Tsioque, we couldn\u2019t help but be inspired by the things that amazed and captivated us in our childhood days spent in front of the pale glow of CRT monitors.\nThis surely included the clever, humorous storyline backed by striking, unique art style in DAY OF THE TENTACLE; the simple gameplay and serious approach to younger players in Ron Gilbert productions such as PAJAMA SAM; the beautiful, dark, dangerous world seen through a young boy\u2019s eyes in HEART OF DARKNESS, ; the wonderfully animated epic fantasy and its gruesome punishments for player\u2019s mistakes in DRAGONS LAIR, or INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, an old Lucasarts classic with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and action, where carelessness could cost you dearly.\nALEK: I have extensive experience in running projects solo. Instead of knocking on hundreds of doors, spending my time trying to convince people my idea really is great, I often preferred to simply do it. I would then lock myself in seclusion and, forgetting about the world outside my workstation, spend months \u2013 sometimes years \u2013 chiseling practically every aspect of production, until it was done. I was prepared to make great sacrifices, because nearly all my projects were born out of passion \u2013 and this one was no different. Here, I also decided to do everything I could single-handedly... but after 2 years of almost constant work, a realization eventually passed through my thick stubborn skull into my brain. I am no longer the person I used to be. I've now become a loving husband and father. I have people in this world that I cared about and I have been hurting them with my total commitment to work \u2013 the work I was supposed to do for them. For my family, I finally had to admit to myself I couldn't do this on my own anymore. I need your help. We need your help.\nOhNoo: We're a small team of 3 enthusiasts, creating games at near-zero budgets. We keep raising the bar for ourselves and our games, and this is the result. TSIOQUE is an amazing game, with great animations, dynamic music and fully dubbed characters. It's a great next step for us, but we cannot finish it without your help. Among other challenges, we need more animators to produce a large amount of frame-by-frame animation, and this requires more funding.\nWe are still determined to complete TSIOQUE, even if it means doing it only with our own hands, at minimal cost, with bare-minimum outside help.\nHowever, with your support, we can invite more artists to the project and truly let it spread its wings. Everything would get done quicker, be prettier, more detailed \u2013 and, eventually, we could simply put everything we intended there, after achieving a certain stretch goal.\nThis would give a terrific boost to practically every aspect of the production, but especially ANIMATION \u2013 2D frame-by-frame animation is a painstaking task, which just happens to be the visual highlight of this project. We are not even dreaming of reaching a budget allowing us to fairly compensate such work \u2013 that is why most (or almost all) animation is still going to be done by Alek \u2013 but animators invited to collaborate do deserve half-decent pay for their effort.\nThe funds gathered would also be used to support the following:\nBACKGROUNDS\nSOUND DESIGN (music and sfx)\nVOICE ACTING\nTranslations (if the appropriate stretch goal is reached)\nPorting to new platforms (if the appropriate stretch goal is reached)\nOur initial and primary goal is to reach $35,000. If we are able to reach more, we'll be able to fulfill the folowing strech goals:\n35,000 \u2013 BARE BONES \u2013 the game is made and we don't starve in the process. Hooray!\n45,000 \u2013 MY HOMES ARE MY CASTLES \u2013 Android, Ouya and iOS versions + translations to Spanish, German, Russian, Italian, and French.\n\nOriginally, the game is being developed for PC in English and Polish. We would like to release the game on other platforms and in other languages as well.\n55,000 \u2013 EPIC! \u2013 The soundtrack will be performed by a philharmonic orchestra.\nYou have listened to TSIOQUE's soundtrack and thought it was impressive? This may be just a taste of the real thing. Release the true potential of Edward Harrison's and Elle Kharitou's music and make a full orchestral soundtrack a reality!\n70,000 \u2013 WIZARDRY \u2013 Additional mini-episode somewhere near the end of your journey. Become the Evil Wizard and discover the true motivations behind his evildoing.\n85,000 \u2013 LEGENDS OF THE KINGDOM \u2013 Delve even deeper into the world of TSIOQUE and uncover ancient legends \u2013 stories about ancient heroes and beasts, providing a richer background of the Kingdom's history. These will be hidden in dusty libraries and secret chambers in the Castle.\n99,999 \u2013 OOPS! \u2013 More animations for failures and wrong actions, all too common in adventure games. You think taking on a monster with a shoelace is a great idea? Try and see what happens!\nThe world of TSIOQUE is inhabited by creatures of all sorts \u2013 humans, animals, monsters, you name it. Do not let appearances deceive you: some seemingly nice people may not necessarily have the best intentions, and a terrifying-looking monster may not be all that evil. Fortunately, even in worst-case scenarios, Tsioque can always count on help from her friends, whom she will find in the least expected places.\nTSIOQUE - Our protagonist, the princess. While still just a little girl, she's not the type of princess who waits for Prince Charming to come rescue her. She's a warrior princess - strong, extremely stubborn, used to taking matters in her own hands. Her will is made of iron but her heart's made of gold. Her relentless curiosity constantly leads her to trouble.\nTHE WIZARD \u2013 Our main villain, the evil sorcerer who \u2013 taking advantage from the QUEEN's absence \u2013 claimed rulership of the Kingdom and imprisoned princess TSIOQUE. Powerful, cunning and full of insatiable ambition, he considers the Kingdom just a stop on the way to total world domination. A (quite literally) dark character, with a constant frown on his face, the WIZARD is filled with inner anger so great that it emanates from the top of his head with a flame of evil magic.\nTHE GOOD QUEEN \u2013 Princess TSIOQUE's mother, gentle and kind, but just as strong as her daughter. In the beginning of the story, she leaves to a faraway land to battle an evil PHOENIX threatening the Kingdom.\nIMPS \u2013 A small army of the WIZARD's magically created minions. With the WIZARD too busy plotting world domination, it is those creatures that stand between TSIOQUE and her freedom. They may seem bumbling and stupid, but they are not to be underestimated. The castle is crawling with them, and if they see you, you are doomed.\n...and much, much more.\nThe game is being co-created by OhNoo Studio and Alek Wasilewski, who assembled a team of independent artists to help his vision come to life.\nThis is just us, a couple of guys, and people who wish to creatively support our continued work.\nWe are not a big company. We do not have sponsors, publishers, investors or shareholders. We do not even have an office. This campaign is not a marketing stunt, a \u201cproof of concept\u201d supposed to coax our superiors into handing us millions of dollars. We really want to fund this project through this campaign!\nCall us naive, but we really count on your help.\nYou can watch Alek's latest film LUCKY DAY FOREVER below (warning: NSFW):\nIf you want more, visit his Youtube channel, and keep an eye on this website as well.\nHaving completed Amelia, we raised the bar and started working on a dark point-and-click adventure game \u2013 \u201cTormentum \u2013 Dark Sorrow\u201d. We raised funds for its completion on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform. The game was released in 2015, and is available on Steam.\nBoth of our games were well received. \u201cAmelia and Terror of the Night\u201d got 5 stars on iOS and Android, while Tormentum has a 72 rating on Metacritic, as well as very positive reviews from players. Unfortunately, critical acclaim is not always followed by commercial success, and this is why we still need your support. One of the reasons is that we do not have a marketing budget. We are just good at doing what we love, which is making games \u2013 the rest is happening on its own. We do whatever we can to promote our work, but what we have learned is that without money for advertising, you really need a lot of luck to succeed.\nWorking on TSIOQUE, we use our experience in creating games for both older and younger audiences. If you want to find out the result, put your trust in us.\nAll backgrounds in the game are made by one talented illustrator \u2013 Micha\u0142 Urbanski.\nMicah\u0142 Urba\u0144ski \u2013 He is a translator by education and an illustrator by choice. Around 2013, he decided to pursue his lifelong passion and began a professional career in visual arts. Since then, he has cooperated closely with Alek Wasilewski and the OhNoo indie game studio as a background painter, and has done freelance work within projects by some of the major Polish studios, such as Platige Image or Juice.\nMusic is an essential element in any game, inseparably combined with the player's every move. Just as in movies, it can make \u2013 or break \u2013 the whole experience. TSIOQUE\u2019s awesome dynamic soundtrack is created by 2 artists: Ed and Elle.\nEdward Harrison: aka 0edit, is a composer, sound designer best known for the Neotokyo OST and for his previous collaboration with Alek on Lucky Day Forever. While he continues to develop his distinctive flavor of cyberpunk electronica on upcoming projects, he has relished the chance to return to orchestral composition. Tsioque is in many ways a dream project for him, as it was his childhood (and enduring) love for the classic LucasArts adventures of the '90s that inspired him to compose for games in the first place.\nElle Kharitou: Self confessed as utterly obsessed with music, sound and noise (and caffeine), Elle Kharitou, aka blissbox, is a classically trained composer and sound designer, specializing in complex, genre dissolving Electronic music. Her works have a unique and highly visual flavour which she is putting to use on a number of upcoming audio-visual projects. She is now drawing on her love of 20th century orchestral music to bring a rich and distinct quality to the world of Tsioque.\nBy helping us finish our game you will \u2013 of course \u2013 gain our infinite gratitude. But that is certainly not all!\nPerks with physical rewards have shipping costs included, so you do not have to worry about extra costs being added.\nHere are the backer rewards with brief descriptions. Do not hesitate, become a backer today! You know you want to!\nThe 2 perks below are inspired by the tradition of medieval sponsors, who \u2013 along with a piece of art \u2013 bought themselves immortality.\n1) Knight $300 (limited: 30)\nYour face will be found among the figures inhabiting a painting or fresco in-game. The final look may vary depending on the style of a given art piece, but it will unmistakably be you.\n2) PATRON OF THE ARTS $2500 (limited: 5)\nYour likeness will inhabit the foreground of a monumental painting or become the sole subject of a portrait. Set in an honorable spot in the game, your individual painting will be impossible to miss. Be depicted as a knight, magnate, princess, cleric, peasant \u2013 as long as such a person could have existed in medieval Europe, your imagination is the limit!\nA limited, signed physical version of the painting on canvas will be sent to you by mail.\nPerks\n(Click to enlarge)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with every undertaking, there is a chance of failure. The project is ambitious, the budget is very small, so maybe we are overreaching ourselves and we will not deliver on time.\n\nThen again it is more likely that the project will be completed, and its ambitious character will be a challenge and a constant source of motivation for us. We did not start yesterday \u2013 we already have a lot of assets completed, a working demo and the script for the whole game. We make a good team that always finishes what it starts. It is a matter of honor rather than just ambition. \n\nALEK: I have over a decade of experience working on micro- and zero-budget projects, wearing almost every hat possible. I also created and coordinated commercial projects. Regardless of the scale of the campaign's success (or even lack thereof), I have complete confidence that I know what needs to be done in order to lead TSIOQUE to successful completion.\n\nOHNOO: We know how to use every dollar we receive.

I've been commissioned to write an article on current affairs in the Chimeric Empire. I suppose if some horrific event befalls me, I can use it as fodder for my next poem. Provided I survive...\"\nA House of Many Doors is a 2D exploration RPG coming to PC in July next year. I want to make the kind of game I love to play: a game with narrative depth, compelling characters, and branching, nonlinear storylines.\nIn A House of Many Doors you are an explorer, poet and spy, traversing and mapping the House \u2013 a vast parasite dimension that steals from other worlds.\nYou explore the House in a clanking train with mechanical legs. You will discover bizarre civilizations, assemble a dysfunctional crew and level up your poetry, while clinging to life and sanity.\nI've already spent nine months developing A House of Many Doors, so I have a good idea of how much longer I need to complete it. The bulk of the programming is done, and the blueprints have been drawn. Now I just need time to build a House on that foundation.\nNot convinced? Why not try out the early pre-alpha demo?\nMy influences include Sunless Sea, FTL, Planescape: Torment, the works of China Mieville and H.P. Lovecraft, Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, and that feeling you get when you're very alone in a big dark house.\nThe further you travel, the stranger the things you find.\nIn A House of Many Doors, your main quest is to find an answer to one of three questions. What is the House's purpose? Who built it? And how can you escape?\nBut that's just the main quest, and it's only the beginning. Your irons will be in many fires.\nBandits and other predators will chase you down in the darkness.\nI want you to feel like a particular type of 19th-century polymath - a Richard Francis Burton or a Gertrude Bell. An absurd figure with absurd talents who propels themselves confidently into absurdly terrifying situations. \nIn the game you are both a journalist and a poet, and each of those careers comes with its own challenges to face throughout the game. The poems you write are procedurally-generated, and over time you will build up a proud canon of stirring titles: \"The Troglodyte Vomiting of the Mirrors,\" \"An Elegy on the Reluctant Hell of Grief,\" \"Ode to the Strangling Toad.\" Your poems and travelogues are your route to fame and fortune.\nA procedurally-generated poem.\nAnd of course anyone who travels to distant civilizations is going to be in high demand in the game of whispers. Play the espionage game well enough, and you might change the course of history.\nThe City of Keys. Dominated by an enigmatic Governor and a looming Factory only tenuously connected to reality. Art by Catherine Unger.\n As you explore the House, you will journey through a labyrinth of procedurally-generated architecture. \n It's not all procedural generation, though - your Navigator will guide you towards rooms in which you'll discover carefully-designed areas of interactive narrative. \nThese rooms are packed with quests, stories and lore - by \"lore\" I mean the House's intricate history, ancient secrets and complex politics, much of which will lurk below the surface and only be revealed in hints and half-truths. In these cavernous rooms you might find cities or ruins or ten-mile-high abomination gods made of inexpertly conjoined crows. \nThe adventures you'll have there are accompanied by the wonderful artwork of Catherine Unger. \nIn these rooms you tackle side-quests, gather resources, and plot intrigues before launching yourself once more into the dark.\nAugustus Ribbins: just one of the Pilots you can recruit. Art by Catherine Unger.\nA House of Many Doors focuses heavily on its characters. You recruit a rag-tag bunch of dysfunctional souls to accompany you on your expedition, and each of them has a secret or not-so-secret agenda. You must talk to them, build their morale, and uncover their secrets, if you hope to keep them both loyal and alive.\nThere will be dozens of characters to choose from, each with tons of dialogue and a well-defined arc - which can be abruptly cut short.\nDeath comes easy in the House, and the attachments you have formed with your crew will be at risk every time you fight. A character's storyline won't necessarily end if they're killed in combat, but it will certainly change to reflect their death. And you may well have lost a friend.\nExchanging artillery fire with another train.\nCombat is a real-time-with-pause system which relies on careful management of both your crew's placement in the train and the distance between you and the enemy. \nIt is generally a last resort - even after upgrading your kinetopede with powerful weapons and a thick hull, you should never expect to escape a battle unscathed. \nThe other vehicles you encounter within the House will be as bizarre and varied as the civilizations themselves - biomechanical flesh-wagons, gigantic beetles, the hollowed corpses of gods. That's just the start.\nSo what will I use your money for? What made me choose the \u00a34000 target?\nThe \u00a34000 will go towards a fantastic, atmospheric soundtrack - which is hugely important in a game that involves a lot of exploration - and to fund art by Catherine Unger, who has agreed to draw all the game's illustrations. \nThe rest of the funding for her art will come from my savings - unless this Kickstarter exceeds its target, in which case extra funds will go towards extra artwork!\nYou might wonder, given the above budget, how I\u2019m going to be able to work on this game full-time for the next year. I\u2019m very pleased to announce that Failbetter Games, the indie studio behind Fallen London and Sunless Sea, have agreed to partially fund the creation of my game! Their funding will be enough to pay for all the writing and coding - a.k.a my living costs for 10 months - meaning your money will only be going towards extremely cool art and lovely music!\nHere\u2019s a pie chart:\n (This is why I need an artist.)\nI'm seeding the House with dozens and dozens of hand-designed rooms - gems of narrative carefully scattered through a procedurally-generated world. The game is currently able to generate over 1 million rooms, each of them unique, but the hand-designed rooms risk getting lost if the number available is not limited. So, on release, there will be approximately 40,000 rooms to explore. This limit not only leads to a balanced experience, but also means I have the ability to add more rooms with ease. Unless the game fails this Kickstarter, or is a total commercial failure, I plan to continue to add new rooms and settings to the House as new ideas come to me.  \nThe game you play on release will be a complete game. But new content will constantly be added. New places to discover. New characters. Established content will be deepened. More and more branches will be added to existing storylines.\nFor \u00a35 now, you could have access to a game that will continue growing for years to come. And of course, I'll maintain my dev log all the while!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFunctionally, the game's code is nearly complete, bar some polishing. The only thing missing now is breadth: almost all of the systems are in place. Of course, for an exploration-focused RPG, breadth is extremely important!\n\nI've done enough work on the game, however, to know how long it will take to add the content I've planned. And my July deadline for release is based on a pessimistic estimate - bar some kind of personal disaster, I'm not worried about missing it. \n\nHere are the main risks or problems I can foresee:\n\n1) Feature Creep. If the game is commercially successful, I want to continue to update the game with free content, 'expanding' the House after release. But I mustn't do this during the development process! \u2018Feature creep' is a notorious problem in game development, and if I fall prey to it I might slip behind schedule. The fact that I'm aware of this risk will help to mitigate it - I just need to ensure that I stick to my plans, which are already ambitious enough.\n\n2) Data Loss. Losing data to corruption, burglary, or some other minor disaster has the potential to set the project back a great deal. To mitigate this risk, I\u2019m making regular back-ups online, as well as regular back-ups to a laptop and 4 different external USB devices.\n\n3) Compatibility. I've been testing the game on various different machines, from gaming rigs to laptops, and I've already found several problems only appearing on one machine that I've had to iron out. Towards the end of the development cycle, this could end up eating a lot more of my time than anticipated. To mitigate this risk, I've allotted a very generous period of time for facing this challenge in my schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "At last, an update: Sunless Skies is out now!", "update_content": "Imagine me lifting this Kickstarter from the shelf, blowing off the dust, rubbing away a spot of dirt with my sleeve.

The player finds a dialogue option which very clearly flags a potential romance. Ah, so this character is one of the Romance Options, the player thinks.

Players should know the rules of the game to play it. There is no AI or rules enforcement, but at the same time it has the freedom to play the game your way - exactly as if you were playing at a real table. However, we have done a lot to make each play for you a good experience: \nautomatic game setups, card dealing, drafting etc. \nplayer\u2019s turn control, timers, game phases indication \ninteractive zones on the table with predefined automatic actions \nintelligent counters for tracking victory points and many other in-game parameters \ncustom surfaces, game room wallpapers, sound effects advanced camera controls \u2026 and many other useful features!\nTabletopia is accessible from all perspectives.

Artem and Dmitry are the creators of Playtox and have a lot of experience in the gaming business. Tim is known in Russia for different projects in the digital field (Promo Interactive, Next Media Group), but also actively participates in a board game business (Igrology game studio and Tesera.ru main boardgame portal in Russia).\nBy spring 2014 Artem, Dmitry and Tim created a company named Tabletopia Inc USA and started the development. The team was quickly assembled, and the project has been moving rapidly since. The main development team is located in Novosibirsk, Russia, but there are more people working on the project from Russia, Ukraine, USA and Germany.\nWe have a lot of plans for Tabletopia, and we are constantly strengthening our team. Until now, it has all been financed by the founders directly. And now we need the support from the gaming community to make the project better, and to prepare for the international public launch (December 2015). We have a lot of plans - like advanced game tutorials, PBEM and Hotseat play enhancements, customizable visual effects for game objects and many other features.

The format varies from country to country, but the concept remains the same: you and your team face series of puzzles and challenges, and escape the room within 60 minutes. What we are creating is a whole new level for this industry.\nAbout us\nAfter extensive market research, involving traveling to 5 countries and playing 60 games, we realised that there is a huge room for improvement and innovation, and just like that, Enigma Quests was born. \nThe process of design and creation of puzzles\nWe call our games Live Quests. The general format is very similar to escape games: 60 minutes, small team, challenges. However, in every quest we design, you will have a much bigger objective than just escaping the room.\nThe objectives, as well as the puzzles, are designed to be part of the theme of the quest. We aim to challenge every team to bring out the best of their creativity, quick-thinking and teamwork. Once inside, you may be quite surprised at the hidden talents in yourself and your teammates! \nAre you ready for the challenge?\nThe Quests\nOur first quest is called 'School of Witchcraft and Wizardry', and is designed for every one of you out there, who always wished to have magical abilities. This will be your chance to prove everyone that even if you never received that letter from Hogwarts, there is still a little magic in you.\nA sneak preview from The School\nOur second quest will involve your team carrying out the biggest heist in the modern history. You will have to be very precise and organised. You will encounter the biggest challenge of your life, and will have to make tough choices. In the end, your snatch will depend only on your teamwork and attention to details. \nIn our third quest, you will be leaving the Earth and traveling across galaxies in search of new worlds. The views may be breathtaking, but the challenge is not an easy one. On top of that, there will be more obstacles for you to overcome together as a team and safely navigate the spaceship. \nWhy us?\nThis activity is very new and we wouldn't be surprised if you never heard of these games before. However we aren't the first one to launch in London, let alone in the UK! So what makes us different?\nWe believe that there are three most important aspects to a great immersive experience, be it an escape game or a live quest: quality, immersion and innovation. \nWithout quality, nothing stays for long. We design every puzzle and every prop to be of high quality material, and where we can't source what we want - we create it ourselves. \nOne of the handmade props for The School\nWithout immersion, it would just be another puzzle hunt. We love puzzle hunts, don't get us wrong, but to provide the highest possible value for money, we pay attention to every tiny detail to achieve deep level of immersion, until when the players lose themselves in the surroundings.\nWe design the puzzles with innovation in our minds, and aim to be very high-tech. There are no padlocks in our rooms, no hunt for numerical codes with tiring amount of numbers. Everything feels real and highly interactive. \nRewards\nWe believe that those supporting the businesses at the start should have access to exclusive discounts that are not available anywhere else. \nWe also realise that many would be reluctant to try a new activity that they never heard of. This is why we'd like to offer discounted tickets and a chance to get the full experience at the reduced price for all of you out there, who believe in us and would like to back us. \nThere is a limited number of Super Early Bird tickets providing the biggest value with up to 57% off from the full priced ticket - so grab these while you can!\nThere are also Early Bird Tickets, priced at only \u00a317 per person (down from \u00a330 pp in full priced ticket), including VAT, available for different team sizes.\nThe tickets will not have an expiry date, so you can pledge now and book your game whenever you want!\nBeta Testers\nWe also need the brave ones among you to come and help us with the final testing of our first room. By the time we deliver these rewards, the initial tests will be undertaken, but we want our Quests to be perfect, and we need your help to eliminate any and all mistakes.\nPlease note that we plan to host the Beta Testers before the general bookings start. If nothing goes wrong - lucky you for getting the full experience at this price! If a puzzle malfunctions, or we discover some imperfection in the room - please remember that this is the final testing and something is always bound to go wrong before it's ready. \nThe timetable for test slots will be released once the campaign finishes. Please book a time once you are sure you can make it. In case you can't come on the dates released, you will have an option of transferring the ticket to someone else's name, or being issued a voucher for the amount you pledged to be used in any future bookings, (with no expiry date), so you have nothing to lose!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhile our first room is already under construction, and the biggest costs like deposit and rent are covered, we still find ourselves a bit short of funds for the final push. \nIf we manage to hit our target, we plan to invest part of funds in making the props as we intended them to be while designing the quests. The rest of it will go to marketing and promotion, so if you can't decide your reward at this moment - you can still help us by sharing this campaign with your friends and spreading the word about us!\nMeet the Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest obstacle we have faced so far was securing the premises in the location we wanted at the price we can afford. We are now located in the heart of London between Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations, and are in the premises everyday to ensure construction is going as planned. \n\nIf we manage to hit our target, we are set to launch this September (the exact date to be released over the course of campaign). In case we don't reach our funding goal, we might have difficulties in some prop building and finding beta testers, which in turn will delay the launch date. In this case, we might run this campaign again and hope for a better response, or keep working on the room until we get it right ourselves. \n\nIf any setbacks do arise, we will inform our backers immediately and tackle the new challenges heads on!

Out of all the things we wanted to do, the biggest one was to collaborate! As a multi-billion dollar company, collaboration isn\u2019t easy. Everyone has to get on aboard and approve, not to mention the process is dreadfully long. Well with us indies, we are the IP owners. All you need is couple of people giving the OKs. Well we asked around and few of our fellow developers said YES. Introducing Popup Dungeon, Little Devil Inside, and Duke Grabowski.\nLittle Devil Inside Collaboration\nPopup Dungeon Collaboration\nIn Pirates War \u2013 The Dice King, you are a pirate captain competing with others. Like other \u201cproperty trading board\u201d game, you can buy land, build buildings, upgrade them and in the end the richest person will win each match. However, you don\u2019t have to just \u2018talk with money,\u2019 you can battle with one another and as a captain, you and your crew will have great effect on the battle ground. By setting up strategy and with luck your dice, anyone can become the Dice King.\nOn Islands of the Tiakoke in the Tricita Sea, one Amunnite miner finds a treasure filled with gold coins. In Tiakoke Island it was considered as local news that a miner became the richest man in town but for pirates overseas it was the news of the century. It turns out that the treasure was the looted goods from Captain Morgan. Jake Morgan was the greatest pirate known in history. He was considered the Dice King. He moved to 7 different continents and pillaged all that he could. It is said that its even enough to buy a country. He was famous for targeting only Royal Merchant\u2019s ship and he never stole from the common people.\nThe fact that Tiakoke Islands may be the spot where Captain Morgan hid his trinkets set a fire in the minds of every pirate in the world. And yes, they are all gathering to this land, one by one. Only by finding Captain Morgan\u2019s treasures, will it bring all fame, money, power and the title of next Dice King!\nOn April of 2011, Artist Ddaepil and Designer Gon met for a drink. Like any other day, they talked about usual mundane game topics until a breaking news appear on TV. It was about a Korean ship taken captive by Somalian pirates. In that moment, they wondered what would it be like to create a game about pirates. Obviously they didn\u2019t want to create a game where pirates take hostages and ask for ransom. Rather, they wanted to create a game based on their memories of pirates from childhood. Adventurous story about eccentric, witty and (somewhat) rough pirates. They wanted a world where animals, fish and humans co-exist, where Voodoo and ghosts were real. Most of all, a story, where all pirates with each individual stories gathered in one place for one purpose; to collect captain Morgan\u2019s treasure, hidden somewhere in the Islands of Tiakoke.\nWith that in mind, they began their development by creating characters one at a time. Lightning Beard was the first character they created. Duke was the second one but it was first non-human character. Later came Sowa based on Ddaepil\u2019s son and Ellie based on Gon\u2019s daughter.\nSince then, for a good 4 years, Ddaepil and Gon began designing characters. It was a slow process. They had their regular jobs. They created them one by one whenever they can, hoping that someday their dreams will come to a reality.\nNow shifting from Ddaepil and Gon. We focus on Sean and Donghyun. In 2012, they were developing PC games and the game industry began shifting from PC to Mobile. They watched the industry grow and technology advance. They believed that soon mobile games would be the next multiplayer and PVP arena for the gamers. By the year of 2013, Sean began his own project within his firm to create a multiplayer board game. However in months, due to \u2018internal reasons\u2019 (whatever that means), the project was scrapped. Sean didn\u2019t want to return to PC game development. So he left the company to create his game on his own and Donghyun joined him. On a bright spring morning of 2014 Sean, Donghyun, Ddaepil and Gon had a meeting where they shared their dreams. They realized their paths crossed. In a week, they decided to work together; thus Pirates War was born. Now, one year has passed, what once was a concept (idea) has turned into a game (reality)\n The game is simple. You move by rolling the dice and you can build fortress on your land. When you visit other\u2019s territories you can pay or choose to fight. Win and take their land.\n Landing can be bought and building can be upgraded. If you upgrade the building, the defense upgrades as well. Upgrading the building is important because each time you go around the islands of Tiakoke, you collect tax at the starting point. Upgrade allows to collect higher amounts of tax. REMEMBER LAST MAN WITH THE MOST GOLD WINS THE GAME.\nTax Collecting\nEntrepreneurs speak with money but we pirates speak with POWER as well! Win against your enemies and destroy their fortress. If you got the extra cash, take their land and build your own.\nIn-game Battle\n Some players are more fit for defense while others stronger in offense. Always size up your enemy before choosing to battle.\nNot all islands are there to build fortresses. Some bring you fortune but others like Kraken or the navy can destroy your game play. If a treasure island appears hold off all things and sail like the wind!\nWeather\nWeather greatly affect game play. When you meet a storm, your dice becomes less effective and you can move less. Watch out! When we create a new map the weather conditions will be added.\nStorm is coming\nBGM\nListen to the music and sail the Islands of Tiakoke. Drink up me hearties!\n    Captain Upgrade\n This is not your regular offline board game. One match does not determine everything. Just like your gameplay, your pirate evolves as well. As you evolve the competition will become more fierce. Few wrong moves can lead you to bankruptcy or few right ones can turn the tables around.\nShip Upgrade\n \nEvery captain has its own quest. Each mission you accomplish can reward you, some even give you crew members. Quest will be continuously added, bringing more diverse fun to the game.\n   We didn't choose the road that everyone takes. Instead we chose a road that has not been proven and is considered dangerous/reckless. However, the road that we chose was meticulously researched and thought out. We are working on our first title, board game for both Web/Mobile/PC/MAC, and we are targeting the North America & Europe. Yes, it may seem idiotic that a Korean company is working on its first title for a market that is not their native but we made this decision under democracy because it made sense to do so for everyone. We are Idiocracy.\nWe have been working on this game for quite some time now and we are beginning to see glimpse of its finish line. Never the less, it is still a glimpse. There is so much more that we wish to do; polish our game, add more music scores, voice acting, multi-language support and most of all, just add more content. We want additional systems like clubs or guild, and more characters. If we receive help from you (the community), we will have a \u2018bigger\u2019 game initial release and provide the game at a faster speed.\nAlso, being a small company which is just starting up we don\u2019t have any fan base and it\u2019s very difficult to receive genuine feedback from regular users. Kickstarter has the ability to give a chance to communicate with rich community who wants to get involved with our development and give us feedback.\nMost of us have played some sort of board game at one point in our life. It could be classic card games or property trading games and many experiences were great because you got to play with others and enjoyed the sheer thrill of victory.\nHowever as we get older our lives become much more complicated with obligations and it becomes much more difficult to play simple board games with friends. That is why people have \u2018board game night\u2019 or \u2018card game night.\u2019 On the other hand, technology has come a long way. Not only are we able to communicate with others from a long distance but the number of activities we can enjoy with each other grow everyday. With that in mind we wanted to create games that encompass all the factors mentioned above. We wanted to create a board which everyone can play with anyone they please at any time and any place. It\u2019s an ambitious dream, but it\u2019s a one we want to achieve with Pirates War \u2013 The Dice King.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face is bringing the games to the multiple platforms. Nothing would make us happier than to release the game on Mobile, Web, PC and Mac on the Day One of official service. However, being a cross platform game that requires multiplayer and online connection makes it very difficult to achieve. At the same time, we still want to roll out to multiple platforms. Therefore, at initial start we might only have 1 or 2 platforms available but we will do our very best to bring our games to those said platforms.\n\nAnother challenge is something that all game developers face; delivering the game on a promised deadline. Our development team has great amounts of experience in developing games in both online and mobile games. However, even with all this experience combined, there is a possibility that problems may occur and we won\u2019t be able to meet our promised delivery date.\n\nHowever, should a case like this happen, we will never let our users catch the news off guard.

First you sit down and build your world, then you destroy it. You tell the story of a hero who tries to save their home. But in Downfall, the hero fails.\nThe game works in any kind of setting, from mythical fantasy to the real world to high-flying science fiction. It's made to tell a whole story in a single 2-4 hour session and doesn't require preparation, dice, or a GM. \nNew to story games? Check out this short documentary. The game they're playing is none other than Downfall.\n\"The magic of Downfall isn't that you build and destroy a world in a few hours \u2014 that\u2019s easy! \u2014 it\u2019s that it creates a place and people you actually care about, even as you lovingly take turns burning it to the ground\u2026\u201d -Ben Robbins, creator of Microscope, Kingdom, and Microscope Explorer\nYou build your setting together, creating a rich physical and cultural landscape to destroy during play. If you enjoy world-building, you'll love making a society in Downfall.\nYou begin by choosing a Flaw\u2014something like greed, complacency, or loyalty\u2014 to serve as the theme of your game. This long-ignored Flaw has finally surfaced to show its teeth. Though the Flaw has always been there, it is just now beginning to destroy everything it created.\nThen you create a detailed set of traditions, practices, and beliefs that your society holds dear. These are the pieces you will break throughout play.\n\"Downfall's unique approach to world creation sets players up with a rich web of referents and cultural artifacts at their fingertips. For relatively little effort at the outset, the crumbling society jumps into vivid focus.\" - Jackson Tegu, creator of How We Are Like The Storm\n\"Downfall is, hands-down, the best game I\u2019ve seen at giving you structured, step-by-step tools to build a culture that doesn\u2019t feel like an off-the-peg genre exercise, is fleshed-out enough to be navigable and intriguing, yet doesn\u2019t take the entire game to set up. It produces worlds that are genuinely unexpected, without requiring any vast leaps of creative brilliance.\"Sam Kabo Ashwell of These Heterogenous Tasks\nWe role-play to explore the collapse of the world, witnessing and shaping the destruction of our home through our characters.\nDownfall features phrase-based escalation in the style of games like Archipelago and Polaris, and one of my favorite things about the game is how smooth it is to go from narrating an intimate scene to executing bold actions and sweeping changes.\nPlay continues until the characters' home has met its downfall. Sometimes when the game ends you mourn the destruction of the world, but more often it's bittersweet\u2014you see how broken the world was and feel that it was better for it to have burned. Sure, it was awful for the characters, but it made a great story. \n\"I had no idea the story would get so creative and complex! It was extremely collaborative and we built on each others\u2019 ideas.\" - Kelly Michelle Baker, author of The Waters of Nyra\n\"Downfall's key phrases are awesome. With just a few words, you can unlock the innermost feelings of a character, add a hefty price tag to the Hero's brash action, or find out what comes of any move another character makes. They're tools that allow players of any skill-level to make the most of the game.\" - Marc Hobbs, creator of Eden\nI'm really interested in games that focus on a single cohesive story, and Downfall does a great job of delivering that by letting each person take turns playing the hero.\nThe game features a cast of three main characters, which are created collaboratively, and each character contributes something different to the game. The Hero is the protagonist, trying to save the world. The Fallen is the  antagonist, trying to corrupt the Hero and the world. And finally the Pillar is an average person, trying to stifle change.\nThe characters rotate. After playing two scenes you pass your character sheet to the player on your left. You were just the Hero a moment ago, but now you get to play the Fallen. \nCharacter rotation means you interact with all of the characters from different perspectives as you shift who you are playing throughout the game. It also focuses play on a single story\u2014the story of the Hero's failure.\n\"Downfall games were my most memorable play experiences of 2015. Sharing characters means the story trumps everything. It is *the* game to play if you have just three players.\" - Jamie Fristrom, creator of Energy Hook\nDownfall has been played at Story Games Seattle, Story Games Olympia, GoPlayNW, in countless cafes from Seattle to South Korea (and who even knows where else), and with people of all experience levels, from those who've never played story games to story game veterans. It works, and I know it works because of the numerous hours that have been put into play-testing it with a wide variety of people over two and a half years.\nI've got some crazy skilled editors on hand and a brain-trust of indie game developers to give me good advice, and I myself am a veteran story gamer (I've played a really wide variety of indie-RPG systems\u201477 by my current count! Wow!). I've made Downfall the kind of game that I love to play over and over again. \nWant to see the game in action? Check out this condensed example of play!\nDesigner/artist/architecture intern Audrey Gibson is doing the art and it looks awesome. The art is all about looking back at collapsed societies and seeing the ghosts of their buildings. She studied images of historical ruins and recreated them to be something a little more fantastic. I wanted someone with an eye for architectural design, and Audrey was the perfect choice.\nVideo Music: There's Probably No Time (Chris Zabriskie) / CC BY 4.0\nDownfall is a genre-neutral game, you can play it in any setting that you dream up.

We\u2019re out to shatter that illusion. \nCreative Commons (\"CC\") is a nonprofit dedicated to Open. CC licenses are free copyright licenses creators apply to their own works, enabling the public to reuse the work under certain conditions. Sometimes CC licensing is core to a business strategy, and sometimes it is simply a way to increase the number of eyeballs on a work. In all cases, CC brings an element of social good to the table. \nWe want to show the world the full spectrum of open business models made using Creative Commons. Our goal is to begin to answer what we consider one of the most important questions of the digital age: how do creators make money to sustain what they do when they are letting the world reuse their work? \nWe are starting this work by trying out our own open business model here on Kickstarter. We want you to both support us, and help steer this project. Ready? Read on...\n[main photo credit: \"Creative Beauty at Creative Commons\" by Kristina Alexanderson, used with permission but available on Flickr under BY-NC-ND 2.0.]\nHere's the plan: \nWith your help, we are going to identify and select a diverse group of two dozen businesses, creators, and organizations from around the world succeeding with business models made with Creative Commons. Then we're going to dig deep into how they work to show how using Creative Commons can produce economic and social value. \nOur goal is not to identify a formula for business models that utilize CC, but instead to gather fresh ideas and dynamic examples that will help spark new, innovative models that build on what is already working. \nWe want to spread this knowledge far and wide to inspire others to use what works for them. At the end of the process, we'll publish an ebook that puts together everything we learn and create an interactive online tool to help others build their own CC-made business models.\nNote: Creative Commons is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Your contribution is tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law. CC will issue tax receipts for all donations exceeding $250. \nWorking in the open\nThe book will be the culmination of a year-long learning/writing/listening/creating process. We'll be working entirely in the open, using Medium as our virtual sandbox.\nHere we'll share little nuggets of wisdom we pick up, our half-baked ideas, and whatever else is in our heads as we explore this work. Throughout the process, we will publish 6 polished, in-depth articles on Medium that consolidate what we\u2019re learning.\nThe point of all this is to work collaboratively with you. We definitely need your financial support, but we also want to borrow your brains. We don\u2019t want to create this book alone. We need insights, contributions, and ideas from you - our community.\nPut another way, this Kickstarter is itself a business model made with CC (how meta!). By using crowdfunding to engage a community, sharing by default as we go, and collaboratively building the final product, we\u2019ll be doing our own experiment with an open business model.\nVisual depiction of our business model for this Kickstarter\nWith the proceeds from this Kickstarter, CC will: \nCreate in-depth profiles of 24 successful CC business/revenue models based on your votes; \nVisually depict each business model and extract at least 3 high-level lessons for each one; \nDistill common strategies and patterns in the various business models and publish 6 long-form articles on Medium;\nCreate a lightweight interactive online tool that helps people design open business models; \nPublish an ebook (licensed CC BY-SA) that combines all of the profiles, analysis, and recommendations from this project.\nTimeline \nVote tally and results for business profile winners will be announced on September 1, 2015.\nIn-depth Medium articles will be released on the following schedule (shorter Medium posts to be published almost daily):\nSeptember 15, 2015\nOctober 15, 2015\nDecember 15, 2015\nFebruary 15, 2016\nMarch 15, 2016\nApril 15, 2016\nEbook and interactive online tool published by July 15, 2016.\n[Early drafts of articles will be distributed to backers for input to Kickstarter Co-Creators 10 days before publication.]\nHow you can get involved\nNominate! Anyone can nominate businesses, organizations, and creators you would like to see in the book. \nVote! Kickstarter backers can vote for who they would like to see profiled in the book.\nShare! All of you (financial supporters, or not) are invited to produce your own open business models using our tool available as a Google doc. You can post and share your models on our Google+ community to give and receive feedback from others in the community. We really want your input as we go, so follow along with us on Medium, and tell us what you think. \nCo-Create! Kickstarter backers can become co-editors of the project with us! We\u2019ll share early drafts, get your feedback, and work with you to shape the content we produce. \nReuse & Remix!

As an educator and serial startup specialist, Paul thrives at making visible the possible and bringing new possibilities to life.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo mitigate risks associated with editing, laying out and producing an ebook, Creative Commons plans to use a combination of do-it-yourself tools with do-it-for-you services from ebook service providers. \n\nBy using votes from backers to determine who we profile in the book, we hope to learn about new creators and businesses using CC in innovative ways. This process also creates some risk, however. To help avoid any possibility of being trolled or of having the book include only creators of one type, we'll publish parameters during the campaign. Note that backers only get one set of votes regardless of how many rewards they purchase. \n\nUltimately, the ebook will only be as good as the level of engagement by you, our co-creators. We plan to write it using a community-driven process, which means gathering ideas and contributions from all of you, collaboratively editing drafts, and thinking of the entire project as a work-in-progress. CC has plenty of experience with this; our legal tools are created in exactly this same way. But to do this well, we need your help.\n\nWe also want to ensure that this project produces something more than narrative success stories. Our goal is to create something that will be useful to others who are in the process of creating something or want to make whatever they do more open.

Reaching further goals will allow us to build more sets, more puppets and more models in order to produce the other two adventures. Obviously, these adventures were orginally produced for the audio medium only. However, we shall be adapting and embellishing these stories to create exciting new episodes for film. So yes, there will be explosions!\nWHAT ARE THE MINI-ALBUMS?\nThe mini-albums were one of the ways you could enjoy old and new adventures with International Rescue in the days before home video. Whilst many of the albums are narrated soundtracks from television episodes, three special stories were produced exclusively for audio.\nFAB - THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN\nWhen reports come in from the Himalayas of kidnappings carried out by the Abominable Snowman, International Rescue sends Lady Penelope to investigate. She soon reveals the dark truth and finds herself a prisoner of The Hood who will stop at nothing to get the secrets of the Thunderbird machines. Can International Rescue save Penelope in time?\nINTRODUCING THUNDERBIRDS\nThe prequel! In this story set before the first episode of the television series, Lady Penelope and Parker head to Tracy Island in order to discover more about International Rescue. There, they witness the Thunderbird craft in action for the first time. This is unashamedly a celebration of Thunderbirds' best technology!\nLADY PENELOPE INVESTIGATES... THE STATELY HOME ROBBERIES\nStately homes across England are being targetted for their precious jewel collections. The villains will stop at nothing to complete their task. Their next victim? Lady Penelope. Can she and Parker thwart their diabolical plan?\nREWARDS\nPledging money to this Kickstarter is the only way you can access our rewards and guarantee yourself a copy of our completed Classic Thunderbirds production and photo magazine. These limited edition packages will not be made available in shops or online stores.\n\nMULTIPLE REWARDS \u2013 If you would like to pledge for a number of rewards, or for multiples of the same reward, simply manually input your total pledge amount and drop us a message so that we can make a note of what you would like. Get in touch if you have any questions!\nIn addition to being offered the chance to purchase exclusive discs of the finished production (available region free on DVD and BLU-RAY and in both NTSC and PAL for DVD), we are also offering Kickstarter backers several exciting opportunities including:\nA 48 page, retro-style magazine crammed with rare and previously unpublished stills from the original 1965 series of Thunderbirds.\nTickets to our invitation-only celebrity premiere.\nProps and costumes from the production.\nA once in a lifetime opportunity to visit a working Supermarionation film set.\nAlthough any production can encounter slight setbacks, we hope to fulfil all rewards by Christmas this year. With a screening date already set, we'll be working hard to ensure that you'll have your rewards during Thunderbirds' 50th anniversary year.\nNOTE: Further reward levels will be unlocked once we reach our target and continue on to stretch goals!\nIf you have any questions about the rewards, additions, or changes, then please message us during the campaign.

Stephen has worked as a director, producer and writer for twelve years. Apart from leading the overall project, Stephen will also direct the first episode.\nANDREW T. SMITH - Associate Producer, Script Editor\nAlso a writer and filmmaker, Andrew was the associate producer, co-writer and co-editor of Filmed in Supermarionation. His current film, Cartoon Carnival \u2013 which he is producing and directing \u2013 unearths the early pre-sound history of animation.\nJUSTIN T. LEE - Post-production, Graphic Designer, Puppeteer\nJustin has worked in post-production as a visual effects artist and animator for many of the world's leading brands. A lifelong Thunderbirds fan, Justin left behind advertising to come and join us on Filmed in Supermarionation where he undertook no end of roles, including designing all the beautiful artwork that accompanied the film.\nDAVID ELLIOTT - Supervisor, Director\nDavid Elliott, who was a director on the original Thunderbirds, will be part of our crew! He will work in an advisory position, helping us to ensure authenticity PLUS, if we reach our stretch goals, he will be directing an episode for us \u2013 his first episode of Thunderbirds in 49 years!\nANDY ROLFE - Set Design and Construction\nAndy worked with Gerry Anderson on several projects and also worked on Filmed in Supermarionation, where he was responsible for some incredible recreations of the original Supermarionation sets. He other work includes beautifully detailed 1/3 scale props and sets for films like Wolfman, Casino Royale, and Skyfall.\nDAVID HICKS - Director of Photography\nFilming anything in 'Supermarionation' is a tricky art. Because everything is in miniature, everything has to be filmed in a very precise way to give it the necessary sense of scale. David was the Director of Photography on the puppet sequences for Filmed in Supermarionation and will be bringing his expertise to us again for this project. He will also be working on the next generation of Gerry Anderson shows, Firestorm.\nBARRY DAVIES and CHRIS KING - Puppet Construction\nBarry Davies is a master at producing studio-standard Supermarionation puppets. He learnt directly from Thunderbirds' Chief Puppeteer Christine Glanville, and his services were engaged many times by Gerry Anderson. Aside from building the puppets, Barry will also be creating and installing the mechanisms in the head. No radio control here - we'll be using 60s methods! The accuracy of Barry's engineering and artistry will add to the authentic feel of this episode.\nChris King is also an expert at producing Supermarionation puppets. Aside from his own creations which are indistinguishable from the original screen-used puppets, he is a master at restoring Supermarionettes that have survived from the 60s. Chris will also be creating characters for us - most notably The Hood. The original puppet is missing in action, but thanks to Chris we now have a beautiful sculpt indistinguishable from the original.\nMAMAS PITSILLIS - Model Construction\nMamas is an expert model builder and well-known to Anderson fans for his incredible recreations of the original studio miniatures. Mamas will be working to ensure that the models of the Thunderbirds craft we use will be as accurate as possible.\nJAMES FIELDING - Unit Photographer\nOur journey will be documented for Kickstarter backers by photographer James Fielding who also worked on Filmed in Supermarionation. James will be capturing much needed publicity shots to help make this a celebration to remember.\nAND...?\nMORE NAMES TO BE REVEALED DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN! THEY'LL BE WORTH WAITING FOR...\nPraise for 'Filmed in Supermarionation'\nWhat is Supermarionation?\n'Supermarionation' \u2013 a portmanteau combining the words 'Super', 'Marionette' and 'Animation' \u2013 was coined by Gerry Anderson in 1960 to describe his sophisticated puppets. Whilst other television marionette heroes were constructed of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, Supermarionation involved the use of characters with beautifully sculpted fibreglass heads (with multiple heads featuring different expressions to fit the mood). Most significantly of all though, these puppets could talk in time with the dialogue via a system that converted individual syllables into electrical impulses that allowed the characters' mouths to open and close.\nThe special effects unit were pioneers in their field. They developed their art of shooting effects entirely with miniatures until their efforts were the best seen on television and film. Many of the team \u2013 including Academy Award winners Derek Meddings and Brian Johnson \u2013 went on to produce the visual effects for motion pictures such as Superman, Alien, Star Wars and James Bond.\nWe will be embracing these classic techniques. For Thunderbirds 1965 we will have:\nReal puppets\nReal models\nReal sets\nAnd, of course, REAL EXPLOSIONS\nOh - and the proper tungsten wire they used in the 60s, just in case you thought we were going to use nylon as in the video!\nEvery element of the production will be undertaken by professionals who are experts on how the original show was made.\n

To do this, I have adjust my shipping discounts from previous projects. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 and/or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.   \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes. \nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a cooperative Tower Defense game Tiny Epic Defenders and a intergalactic dice driven/engine building game Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began January of 2013 on Kickstarter with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has sold a collective total of over 20,000 copies.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Kingdoms\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Defenders\nTiny Epic Galaxies, the third installment in the series. \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Galaxies Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nGamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future!

There are no separate Add-Ons during the project.  \nIf you'd like to add additional copies, or other menu items, to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you may do so within PledgeManager. \nDo not add to your KS pledge for add-ons, you will pay for them in PledgeManager.\nCheck out our exciting PledgeManager menu below:\nPledgeManager is a post-project service used to collect backer's shipping data and to provide additional product options.

It is prone to many opportunities for mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects from Kickstarter.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer we have used to create Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures, the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders, and Tiny Epic Galaxies. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition will be our next!\n\n3. Professional fulfillment is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders and, the soon to be shipped, Tiny Epic Galaxies. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process, as to involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nI will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! Lets bring Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition to the gaming world!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS PROJECTS' STATUS: \nTiny Epic Galaxies is currently in production and within 1 month of its estimated delivery date.\n\nTiny Epic Defenders, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Fantasy Frontier, Dungeon Heroes, the Fantasy Gaming Figures and the Mini GIANT Meeple Project have all completed fulfillment successfully.

I'm very impressed. Hands down the best project I've backed on kickstarter.\"\nKS backer Robert H says \"Hey just got my game... Looks awesome, will break it out tonight! I have to say this is one of the most well run Kickstarters I've participated in.\"\nNow we're launching a new expansion! The Emma Expansion uses the characters and events of Jane Austen's novel \"Emma\" and puts them into a game of Marrying Mr. Darcy. \nMarrying Mr. Darcy is a strategy card game where players are one of the female characters from Jane Austen\u2019s novel Pride and Prejudice. Players work to earn points and attract the attention of available suitors. Our heroines do this by attending events and improving their characters, but advantage can be gained by the use of cunning. All of their efforts are in hopes of marrying well and becoming the most satisfied character at the end of the game!\nThe Emma Expansion includes 6 new Heroine Cards, 5 new suitor cards, and 60 new event cards all inspired by Jane Austen's \"Emma.\" Just replace your Marrying Mr. Darcy Heroine, Suitor, and Event cards with the new Emma Expansion and you are all set to play! You'll enjoy new Emma-appropriate activities such as Blunders, Interference, Gossip, and Revelations. Additionally, each new playable Heroine features a new \"lady power\" for variation in gameplay every time!\nWHAT IS INCLUDED\nThe Emma Expansion includes: 78 Cards (60 Events, 6 Heroines, 5 Suitors, 1 rules card, 6 player guides), 1 tuck box.* \n*Please note that you will need the base game of Marrying Mr. Darcy: the Pride and Prejudice Card Game in order to play the Emma Expansion. The base game is NOT included in some reward tiers. \nThe new playable Heroines are Emma Woodhouse, Jane Fairfax, Harriet Smith, Augusta Hawkins, Miss Bates, and Anne Taylor. The new Suitors are Mr. Knightley, Mr. Elton, Frank Churchill, Robert Martin, and Mr. Weston.\nLEARN TO PLAY\nYou can get a brief overview of the rules and how to play Marrying Mr. Darcy by this video, or by reading the full rules here. The Emma Expansion will simply have new Heroines, Suitors, and Event Deck!\n STRETCH GOALS!\n$10,000 The minimum amount needed to launch the Emma Expansion. WE DID IT!\n$12,500 We will solidify our \"Mash-up\" rules for mashing up Emma and Marrying Mr. Darcy cards and publish them online. Want Emma to marry Mr. Bingley? Now she can! See FAQ for details! WE DID IT!\n$15,000 We will include 3 cards in every Emma Expansion that will make it playable with the Undead Expansion. Because zombies. WE DID IT!\n$20,000 We will design a new expansion based on another Austen novel in 2016. WE DID IT!\n$25,000 We will make the new 2016 expansion (from the $20,000 stretch goal) Beta test version available to all Emma expansion backers as a free PDF Print & Play. WE DID IT! THANKS EVERYONE!\nREVIEWS\nStill not sure this is for you? Check out our reviews here!\nFAQ\nDoes the $15 reward come with a hard copy of the expansion? YES! If you pledge the $15 tier, you'll get a hard copy (printed cards in a nice tuck box) shipped to you in January! In addition, you'll also get a PDF version emailed to you in August. \nI want to add another copy of the expansion to my order. Can I do that? Yes, you may add ONE additional copy of the Emma Expansion to the $15 reward tier or higher. To do this, add $12 US or $16 international to your total. You must also indicate you've done this on your survey when the campaign ends.\nI want to add another copy of Marrying Mr. Darcy to my order. Can I do that? Unfortunately, no. That will make our shipping and pricing a lot more complicated, and we also have a certain number of games allocated for this Kickstarter. US customers can buy another copy from Amazon, and international customers should check out this blog. I'm sorry we can not accommodate that!\nCan't I just buy the base game now? Why is that included in some rewards? Yes, you can purchase the base game now by visiting here. However, selecting that reward tier will help us fund our new expansion. Additionally, while Marrying Mr. Darcy is widely available, there are some non-US locations where it is difficult to acquire. If you do choose the $45 reward tier, please note that everything will be shipped to you once the expansion arrives from the printer (estimated January 2016). \nHow far along are you in making this? The game design is complete, and we are about 95% complete with the art and graphic design. We will be completing the final proofreading during the campaign, and should be sending the files to our printer no later than mid-August. \nWhat's up with the $75 \"Your Own Event Card\" reward tier? You can create your own Event card for use in Marrying Mr. Darcy or the Emma Expansion. You can select a vintage graphic used on any of our Event cards and write your own personalized text! Want to gossip with Mrs. Your Name, or perhaps Sir Your Name invites you over for cards? Need to propose to your significant other? We will work with you to create a special and functional Event card.  We will ship you 5 printed copies of your Custom Event card. These cards will be printed at a different printer that can do small print runs, but we have found these cards match the game cards very closely. We will guarantee your Custom cards will arrive in time for Christmas 2015! If you also order a copy of Marrying Mr. Darcy, we can also guarantee that by Christmas. However, the Emma Expansion will be shipped separately (estimated Jan 2016). These custom cards will always be an exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nWhat's the deal with the $200 \"Your Own Hero/ine Card\" reward tier? Game artist Erik Evensen will draw your likeness as a Heroine, Suitor, or the Old Maid (your choice). You can select your lady powers or suitor preferences, customize text on the card, and use it to play either Marrying Mr. Darcy OR the Emma Expansion. You can see some examples of custom cards here. We will ship you 5 printed copies of your Custom card. These cards will be printed at a different printer that can do small print runs, but we have found these cards match the game cards very closely. We will guarantee your Custom cards will arrive in time for Christmas 2015! If you also order a copy of Marrying Mr. Darcy, we can also guarantee that by Christmas. However, the Emma Expansion will be shipped separately (estimated Jan 2016). These custom cards will always be an exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nHey, can I play a mashup of the Emma Expansion and Marrying Mr. Darcy? I want Harriet Smith to marry Mr. Bingley! Our first stretch goal is to solidify our \"mashup\" rules and publish them online. This will involve a description of how to set up a mashup game, as well as new marriage points assigned to characters from separate books. It should be noted that these games were really designed to be played as separate entities, encapsulating the feel of each individual book. However, if you are the adventurous type and agreeable to working through unexpected scenarios in a ladylike manner, you should have a fun time making all your head canon dreams come true. \nWill I eventually be able to buy this expansion in my friendly local game store? If we meet our funding goal, we will release the new expansion for distribution and sale online and in stores through our distributor after our kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled. By ordering the game on kickstarter, you help us fund the print run and will be one of the first to own the Emma Expansion.\nI'm a non-US backer and I have a question about shipping costs or VAT. I am using a US based company, Game Salute, to do fulfillment of this campaign. I have made a good faith effort to estimate weight of the game and packaging and charge the correct amount to backers for shipping. I understand shipping to non-US countries is expensive. Additionally, non-US backers MAY need to pay VAT when their package arrives depending on the laws of the country you are in. If you feel the shipping or potentially paying VAT is outside what you would like to contribute, we understand. I would encourage you to read this blog on buying Marrying Mr. Darcy outside the US for links to stores that carry the game and will potentially carry the new Emma expansion in the future. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPossible risks for the project include printing, production or shipping delays. This is a self-published indie game and I am not relying on a company to manage the project. I will have no direct control over the print run, delivery of games to the warehouse or reward fulfillment, which will be completed by third parties. As you can see, the game design, art, and file preparation are nearly complete so there should not be any significant delays related to game design. \nAdditionally, we are working with trusted game printer AdMagic who has many years of experience and has successfully completed and delivered three fantastic looking print runs of Marrying Mr. Darcy to the Game Salute warehouse. Game Salute will be shipping kickstarter rewards to backers, and they have fulfilled many successful campaigns in the past. I have made a good faith effort to calculate all costs accurately and estimate a reasonable timeline. \n\nI will make sure the files get to the printer, all the bills are paid, and follow up with AdMagic and Game Salute as necessary. We've worked together for the past 2 years getting Marrying Mr. Darcy into stores and so far so good!

Why? Because often they do not fit into the very narrow and uniform editorial policies of global media brands.\nCurrently a great swathe of the world intuitively understands that we are not seeing the full picture.\nThis is the role of Renegade Inc. to articulate what's really going on. Then give independent context, narrative and alternatives that you won\u2019t get anywhere else.\nToday the world is changing faster and more fundamentally than ever before. So now we need the opinions and ideas of many different thinkers, artists, economists and businesspeople who we feel should get more airtime. In fact, at a time when the world needs sensible alternatives, their opinions are vital.\nRenegade Inc. was founded by Ross and Megan Ashcroft.\nIn 2005 we began to realise that there was something profoundly wrong with the global economy. We didn\u2019t feel that it was an option to do nothing. We felt compelled to act so in 2007 we launched Renegade Economist.\nWe wanted to rethink ways of doing things. We read everything we could on banking, the economy and economics. We also watched conspiracy films and a slew of mainstream films that said everything yet left us unsatisfied. We thought we could make a contribution.\nOur first project was the award winning independent feature documentary \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d - released in 2012.\nWatch the full movie for free here\nThe film has been an international success. It\u2019s now been seen by many millions of people in cinemas and broadcast stations worldwide. It has over three million views on YouTube and has enjoyed more than three hundred Q and A sessions in seventeen countries.\nWe continue to receive weekly messages explaining how much the film has resonated, and asking \u201cWhat is next?\u201d\nThe answer is Renegade Inc.\nInitially the new media platform of Renegade Inc. will focus on three sectors:  \nEntrepreneurship or new business \u2013 which includes our already established commentary on the financial sector\nSelf-Learning \u2013 which we believe is a more accurate description of the education of the future\nThe Arts - recognizing that creativity is the driving force behind improving anything.\nWhen we toured Four Horsemen around Europe, we met Renegade Inc.\u2019s audience and noticed that they were a multi-generational mind-set - not an easily defined demographic. We called them \u201cCohort C\u201d as they wanted community, causes and to co-create. We couldn\u2019t help but notice that that Cohort C is a powerful new force in global citizenship who feel that mainstream media isn\u2019t fulfilling all their needs. \nWe feel that now is the time for an independent media platform that works in partnership with its audience. As this is better suited to our interconnected age than agenda-driven media that permanently transmits but rarely listens.\nAt Renegade Inc. we consider our audience our partners and encourage them to shape the content we make.\nWe do this by simply listening to our partners and creating the content they would like to see. Our partners will shape our content with suggestion of stories and editorial feedback.\nIDFA 2011\nEach week we will bring you a film and radio interview with array of guests (many of which our partners will have requested).\nWe will also begin work on a short documentary in partnership with Steve Keen and other leading world economists. This will highlight where next for the global economy so you can navigate the age of volatility.\nSome of our previous work with Professor Steve Keen\nWe will also begin to make a documentary on how the education system in the western world is faltering. To do this we will partner with our colleagues at Independent Thinking. This will allow us to offer solutions to navigating a system that values testing over student development.\nThe word has sometimes had mixed connotations.\nWe define a \u2018Renegade\u2019 as someone who - through their actions \u2013 peacefully and positively disrupts how people think and act. Not referenced by gender or background these people inhabit all walks of life and the their mind-set has quietly created a latent social revolution of enormous consequence.\nRenegade etymology is to switch allegiance from one system or set of values to another that better fits your worldview, life or values.\nWhilst making Four Horsemen our aim was to take seemingly complex ideas then simplify and share them. .\nOur next step is to create an international platform that does the same thing across a range of independent content.\nThis is the foundation of Renegade Inc. We aim to bring to the surface the \u2018hard to get at stories\u2019 which do not get airtime.\nWe also want to bring context from some of the most respected sources from around the world \u2013 as we have done with the financial sector.\nRenegade Inc. aims to leave its members better informed, more illuminated or inspired.\nTo date all Renegade Inc.\u2019s work has been funded from our own resources. That is how we have maintained independence.\nThis year we have already launched the new Renegade Inc. website in beta and posted all the work to date from the last years.\nIn all, there are over two hundred and fifty pieces of media content. All our Renegade channels have been consolidated under Renegade Inc.\nBut quality content is not inexpensive. We have now reached a point where we need proper funding for Renegade Inc. which will allow us to broaden our platform for those who think differently. We also need funding so Renegade Inc. can continue independently. We do not want to have go 'upstairs' for \u2018sign off\u2019.\nWe have the ideas, knowledge, experience, business management skills, contacts and excellent access. Now we need extra financial resources to unlock the potential.\nWe are asking for US$45,000 to build out the media platform and produce regular content.\nThis money will also pay for further development of our online presence, underlying technology including app development and partner platform, editorial staff salaries, rent and studio costs for the first six months.\nWe want to bring together the best talent and combine an audience who can partner with us to produce great work.\nRenegade Inc. will continue its recent accelerated production of new material on a weekly basis. We will add to the existing commentary - with regular interviews giving context and analysis. It will also produce content on topics that have received scant coverage but impacts our lives.\nIn 2016 we will examine further funding sources including launching a subscription funding model. We need our partners to support our correspondents so they can report on the \u2018hard to get at stories\u2019 that matter.\nHere are some of the perks you can get if you contribute to our Kickstarter.\nBrief Inc. Podcast, Field Notes, Buttons, and Polo\nSo Renegade Inc. has now arrived. It is a new independent media platform aimed at people who think differently. It is international. Its mission is simple: Create and broadcast content that informs, illuminates and inspires.  \nWe already have a track record of doing this. Broadening this in 2015, is particularly important when so much of the world we live in is in a state of flux. Our reaction to uncertainty must combine context and perspective. This is best done in partnership with you.\n We hope you will support this platform, in whatever way you can.

So partners can support us and influence our output. We will also look into working with sponsorship and advertising partners that fit our ethos.\n\nWith Editorial Suggestions we'll endeavor to follow through on your suggestions, but cannot guarantee that every person suggested will be available or able to take part in an interview.\n\nAnd of course in any production process it is common to encounter setbacks.

It's planned to be released for Windows and Mac via Steam. We've already got the all-clear from Steam to distribute with them. Yes, there will be controller support! This Kickstarter's goal is to fund the initial release entirely. Due to the amount of content and lore we want to show in the game, we have two expansions planned. But worry not! Backers that contribute $10 or more will receive all planned expansions free of additional charge!\nExploration and combat in Diluvion take place in fully 3D open-world zones.\n The world of Diluvion is an unforgiving place. Forced into the ocean by the Great Flood and now trapped under an impenetrable layer of ice, humanity hangs by a tenuous thread. By a twist of fate, you, an aspiring submarine captain, have been given the honor of commanding your first sub. With a brave crew at your command, you now venture into the unknown.\nA 2D cutaway view reveals the interior, where you can meet characters and manage your crew.\nDiluvion contains a mix of 2D and 3D elements. While exploring in your sub, you'll view the open world around you in 3D. When visiting towns and interacting with your crew, a cross-section view reveals intricately painted 2D interiors.\nThe cross-section view showing the interior of Dweller Colony 92.\nAs the captain of your sub, you have access to an array of weapons in addition to sonar and salvaging abilities. Sonar is essential for getting information about the world around you. However, it can be a deadly game of cat and mouse. By sending out a sonar ping, you also alert hostile subs in the area to your presence.\nSonar in action\nCombat in Diluvion is derived from the classic space trading and combat simulation genre. We drew inspiration from games like Wing Commander and Freelancer. The combat is fully 3D, and your sub has multiple weapon rooms which can lock on to enemies. There's a full arsenal of underwater weapons to master as well; bolts, torpedoes, mines, and railguns, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. \nThe swift Huron sub has a torpedo lock on two enemies.\n In the video below, Jacob talks about combat basics as he plays the pre-alpha build!  (Sorry about the missing thumbnail, youtube be trippin'.)\nWhile designing the subs, we put a lot of thought into what's inside. There's a great emphasis on the interior of your sub and the crew that operates it. Different Gunners will give unique firing bonuses, Helmsmen can increase the effectiveness of your ship with advanced maneuvers, and a good Sonar Tech can give you the edge in a long-range torpedo battle. Additionally, your crew can often function semi-autonomously. For example, your gunners can be told to engage previously designated targets while you're busy dodging a torpedo! \nThe more crew you have in a station, the more operational bonuses it will have!\nAs you progress through the game, you will naturally find yourself in larger submarines, and to operate them you'll need a bigger crew. There will be also be new job classes you'll discover as you advance.  In the video below, Jacob shows the crew mechanics and narrates the details.\nThe denizens of the flooded world generally fall into one of three factions: The Icers, the Royals, and the Dwellers. They each have their own culture and technology, but the biggest defining factor is their geography.\nThe Icers tend to live in colonies drilled into the ice or anchored near it. They have exceptional advanced technology and hope to one day finally drill all the way through the ice. The Royals live in great domed Old World cities on what used to be the surface. They see themselves as the rulers of the flooded world, and their Houses control immense military power. The Dwellers live in the darkest depths of the oceans. They survive by fishing and mining, and are the most superstitious inhabitants of Diluvion. In the murky darkness of the sea floor, they turn to their religion for guidance, worshiping the strange sea creatures around them.\nWe started on Diluvion as soon as we finished Ballpoint Universe in early 2014. We spent a lot of time developing the lore and technology that would exist in our sunken world. A good portion of 2014 was spent developing the visual style, and learning how to apply that to assets across the board.\nOnce the art style had been developed to a point we were happy with, we began developing a pipeline that would work well for our small team.\nIn early 2015, we completed our vertical slice which contains a majority of the key core gameplay elements including combat, docking, looting, crews, dialogue, and inventory.\nWe're working with Razer to create the highest quality in-game audio for Diluvion.\nWe are a proven team of developers who have shipped games to many platforms including Steam, Desura, Wii U, iOS, and Android. We were awarded the Indie DB 2013 Visuality award for Ballpoint Universe. Our team has a combined total of 19 years of game development experience, 12 years of programming experience, and 13 years of Unity game engine experience.\nLeo Dasso is guy from North Carolina who's been designing games since he was 16, and drawing since age 3.
