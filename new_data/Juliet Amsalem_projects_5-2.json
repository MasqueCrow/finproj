[{"backer": "Juliet Amsalem", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introducing Froggo's Adventures Interactive Enamel Pin Collection\u2728\nHi there, I go by Pinnovating! \nI\u2019ve been making pins for about 3 years now! You may find some of my previous projects on here as well as on my Instagram! @pinnovating\n\nWant to follow along with Froggo? \nClick HERE! (for more Froggo!)\n\nI\u2019m so happy to introduce my beloved Froggo & Friends pin concepts & finally bring them to life! \n\nProject info:\nEach Goal Tier SET  will unlock the freebies along with the pin. For example 1 \"pin\" tier also unlocks all the freebies that come with it. Each TIER SET  you pledge for gives you EVERYTHING that's part of that set! You can pick from any of the unlocked Tier Sets! Want to match with a bestie? Sure you can pick 2 of the same tiers! But I won't be able to mix and match the unlockables!  You will have the opportunity to add specific ones after the campaign is over in the \"add-ons\" section of the survey!\n\nEach Froggo Adventure comes with it's own Story! These are the tales of young Froggo and Snail going out on an adventure to solve some mysteries and expeditions!! These will be KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE! SO DON'T MISS OUT!!\n\n *Every backer will receive one free small pin board! * (One of the unlockable freebies from the first Tier!)\n\nRaffle Prizes:\nFor everyday you're part of the project you will be entered in a RAFFLE GIVEAWAY! The prizes will be announced after the campaign is over from the unlocked selection, including pins and the freebies! The winners will be announced daily! Your backer number will be your raffle ticket! Only participating backers can be winners.\n\nFroggo's Adventures Limited Edition Pin Designs:\n***These are Digital Mockups and final Design colors may vary ever so slightly due to the screen color differences***\n Freebies will be announced in the \"Updates\" section! Stay tuned!\nMy previous projects:\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nProject & Risks:\nI\u2019ve experienced many difficulties with manufacturers in the past, luckily with time I have been able to get more experience under my belt and have learned how to handle tough situations and approach problems with effective solutions. I currently run a monthly pin patreon with over 60 members!\n\nDelays can happen!! This industry is a very finicky one. Please be understanding of the process, I communicate most efficiently on Discord. I've been doing nearly daily to weekly updates so please join us there if you'd like to be super hands on with the project! But Ks will mostly be for just major news and updates!\n\nThe pins will come in matching packaging (also great for gifts!) Packaged individually for extra security. All pins will have 2 pin backs attached to them as well as a backstamp (with the exception of the mini gatchas).  All boxes will be shipped via USPS First Class, which includes tracking.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Froggo Project! He is a very loved Character of mine, inspired by the challenges we face to bring positivity and change into our lives. Did know thats what frogs symbolize? Google it! It\u2019s worth checking out!\nI hope froggo brings you as much happiness and care as he does for me! Have a wonderful day!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere may always be the possibility of challenges along the way, if anything were to be of concern I will notify you to take the best course of

We're Evan and Josh, lifelong quirky board gamers and general mischief makers. You might know us as the creators of Puns of Anarchy and Charty Party, both games we've previously Kickstarted and are now real live things.\nWe love words.  And while beautiful sentences have a time and place, it's the bizarre and terrible writing (usually found on the internet) that's our favorite. From nonsensical Facebook posts to unhinged Craigslist ads,  we can't get enough.\nBut, unless you're in the middle of a heated Youtube debate, crafting a hilariously terrible sentence can be tough. That's why we made Ransom Notes: a game that gives you no choice but to create awesomely horrendous sentences to get your point across.\nWe wanted to make a party game that would be playable over and over, and be totally unique every round. We've playtested dozens of times, and the only things that've stayed constant are hilarious, tears-streaming-down-your-face funny sentences people come up with.\nWe love this game concept, but only get to produce it with your support. So, please help us bring Ransom Notes to life! \nThanks,\nEvan + Josh\nMeet our Stretch Goals!\nWe've been amazed by the support for Ransom Notes so far, and we want to make the game even better! \nUNLOCKED!\nIf we can get to $160,000 raised, we'll be able to include 200+ more word magnets (for a total of 800+) in each game. These will include some of our favorite words to play with, from \"bulbous\" to \"innards!\"\n\nUNLOCKED!\nIf we can get to $75,000 raised, we'll be able to include five extra \"Roast the Judge\" cards so you can make fun of your friends with word magnets right to their face.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince launching our first game, Charty Party, and our second game, Puns of Anarchy, we've learned a ton about card game production and have a fantastic relationship with our game manufacturer. We've just completed our fifth print run of Charty Party and have a great understanding of the timeline and logistics for getting games produced, shipped, warehoused, and sent to your door. But, creating a game with word magnet tiles was new to us, so we're working hand in hand with our manufacturer to make sure the components are all high quality and long lasting.\n\nIt's also really important to us that everyone gets their games on time. We were able to stick to a quick delivery timeline with our last games, and we plan to do the same with this one. That's the reason we've decided not to include lots of gimmicks or custom reward elements, since they can really muck up timely production. And, even though the current pandemic situation has affected supply chains everywhere, we've been in constant communications with our manufacturing and fulfillment partners to do our best to ensure we can deliver on time despite new uncertainties. As always, we'll keep all backers up to date on the production with frequent, transparent updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 33 or more", "title": "Full Ransom Notes Game", "descp": "The complete Ransom Notes game in all its glory!

As a result, I have gained valuable experience in understanding not only how to manage a Kickstarter campaign, but about manufacturer standards, quality control, and how much time it really takes for pins to be made.\n\nThere is always the risk of factory mishaps which can delay the progress of a Kickstarter. These can include pins that have the wrong color, a high defect rate that requires a reorder, shipping delays, and other issues that can delay the production of pins. I've done my best to anticipate that sometimes these things happen (especially considering how crazy this year has been due to COVID), and I have set my delivery date accordingly to allow for PLENTY of time to get these all out to you!\n\nBackers will be notified every step of the way on whether we're ahead of schedule, on schedule, or delayed, so there will be no surprises!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nEnamel pins are made of a combination of hard enamel and plated metal.

The year 2020 is almost over (finally!!), and I am sure that this has been a challenging year for many of us. To be honest with you, the kitties and I are both feeling a little exhausted. So, I designed this set of pins to remind myself and hopefully anyone else who sees them, that it is okay to take a break and chill. I hope you like this set of pins, and thank you so much for your support!\n\nPledge now and pay later!

During production, some minor changes might be required to ensure the product is manufacturable. Usually these changes are very minimal, and will not have an impact on the overall aesthetics or the turnaround time. However, if any issues arise, I will send out an update to all my backers immediately.\n\nDefects - If any of the products (pins, stickers, and postcards) are defective upon receipt from my manufacturer, I will get them remade.

We're Fluffnest, a group of friends here to bring all the soft and fluffy things that we love to you! Lily, our designer, loves all things fluffy and cute! Our organizer, David, enjoys penguins. And Jenn, well she\u2019s just here to help! The PuffPals are a passion project that we\u2019re so excited to share with you!\n\nWhat is a Puffpal?\nHave you ever wondered what it'd be like to hold a cloud? Cuddle with one? It's something close to that. Puffpals are the happiest, softest, bestest friends you could ever ask for! Winston (Cream) Ollie (Green) Melon (Pink) and Tommy (Blue) are our cuddly herd of sheep that are eager to join your family! And no farm is complete without a wide assortment of other friends. As the campaign progresses, each stretch goal will unlock one of our sheep's best friends!\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur friends are not cheap to take care of (or manufacture). Plushies have a pretty big initial production cost, Kickstarter allows us to make the plushies we want to make without bankrupting ourselves in the process! And it's great that we get to share it with you at a discounted Kickstarter exclusive price as well \u2665\ufe0e\n\u2665\ufe0e Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform! Your card will not be charged until the end of the campaign! You can edit or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends! \u2665\ufe0e\n\nWinston the Cream Sheep: The oldest of our family, Winston\u2019s head is in the clouds most days. He\u2019d much rather be lazing around with his friends watching the clouds float by than anything else. Despite his broken wings, Winston still dreams of flying with the rest of his family.\nOllie the Green Sheep: Ollie is the most energetic of his siblings, always eager to play or start up a game. Ollie is often the one to drag his family into all sorts of trouble, encouraging his herd to be more adventurous and fun. He still can\u2019t seem to convince her siblings to skydive, though.\nMelon the Pink Sheep: Melon is the brains of the operation, trying her best to keep her siblings in line. It\u2019s all fun and games until one sheep loses its way, so Melon keeps track of everything going on in her little family. Melon\u2019s favorite activity to do in her free time is counting sheep.\nTommy the Blue Sheep: The careful sheep, Tommy is shy and quiet but is full of not just fluff but love. He sticks close to his siblings and follows them everywhere, hoping one day to muster up the courage to be as outgoing as they are. Tommy\u2019s one hobby is writing poetry about the pastures and farmland he grazes.\n\nWinston was not easy to come by! It took many many prototypes and searching many many manufacturers to get him to this state of perfection \u2728\n\u2665\ufe0e ALL PLUSHIES ARE ROUGHLY 8 INCHES TALL (EXCLUDING EARS) AND 12 INCHES LONG \u2665\ufe0e\nThe fluffy part is made out of soft coral fleece and the rest of him is ultra soft minky fabric! They\u2019ve been tested and they are safe for all ages!\n\n\n\n\n\u2665\ufe0e We will unlock more rewards if we reach more funding goals! You may pledge for locked goals to help us reach them faster!\u2665\ufe0e\n** STRAWBERRY COW AND HALLOWEEN SHEEP ARE IN PROGRESS**\n\u2665\ufe0e You may add on additional items on top of your current pledge!

I'm an illustrator & graphic designer, who loves making fun and cute designs! My brand mascot is an adorable little ghost named Spirit, who loves to have fun! \ud83c\udf42\nBy pledging to this campaign, you are helping to bring to life enamel pins of little Spirit, something I have wanted to do for a few years but never had the courage to do! And just in time for spooky season~ \ud83d\udc7b  These pins are all hard enamel, gold plated mini pins, each measuring just under 1\" on the longest side! They all have screen-printed details, metal clutches and my logo stamped on the back!\nThe price you pledge for will also be a cheaper rate than any leftover pins will be sold for in my shop, so pledge now (or grab an Early Bird tier, if any are left!) to ensure you get the best price! Once the initial goal is met, there will be several stretch goals available. Your pledge can be increased, decreased or cancelled at any time if you want to add more pins or change your mind. And because this is an all-or-nothing campaign, you won't be charged until the end of the campaign, and only if the initial goal is met.\nThe initial goal of $240 will fund production, packaging, shipping and Kickstarter fees for one pin, \"Logo Spirit\"!\n\"Logo Spirit\" has been unlocked! 24mm in size. Colors and details are subject to change.\nIf the initial goal of $240 is met before the campaign deadline of September 9th, stretch goals will begin to become available! When stretch goals \"unlock\", that means the campaign has earned enough money to fund them. However if the campaign ends just shy of a stretch goal unlocking, that pin will not be available.\n\"Witch Hat Spirit\" has been unlocked! 24mm in size. Colors and details are subject to change.\n\"Happy Spirit\" has been unlocked! 21mm in size. Colors and details are subject to change.\n\"Pumpkin Spirit\" has been unlocked! 21mm in size. Colors and details are subject to change.\n The final pin stretch goal is this set of teeny tiny board fillers! The trio counts as ONE pin, and will come as a set! \nThe \"Tiny Pin Set\" is unlocked! Each pin is 13mm. Colors and details are subject to change.\n\nThe final stretch goal after the pin goals are met will be freebie stickers to all backers! Designs coming soon~\nEarly Bird rewards are available in limited quantities, for a very limited time! Each Early Bird comes with a specified number of pins, and vinyl sticker sheets featuring the pin designs and other fun Spirits! Grab them before September 1st!\nEarly Bird Rewards feature two or four pins, plus vinyl sticker sheets!\nAugust / Early September: The campaign period will last 2 weeks, ending on September 9th. Within this time, I will be sharing my project with anyone willing to listen! I will also be designing additional stretch rewards, just in case.\nMid September: If the campaign is funded successfully, I will be able to send pins to production in mid-late September (Kickstarter funds take up to two weeks to deliver into my account).\nOctober: Assuming pins are successfully in production in late September, October is production month. My manufacturer's turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks, and if all goes well and no reprints are needed, pins should arrive to me in late October.\nNovember: Operating under the assumption that all pins get funded, I will need a few weeks to sort through them all for quality control, packaging, fulfilling rewards and shipping. This may take a while for one person! So I've given myself a cushion of time through November to fulfill all rewards, and if there are ANY delays, I will send out an email to backers with updated information!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my 8th production of enamel pins, so I am familiar with the process.

To ensure pins are produced within the timeline, my order will be submitted for production as soon as funds are received (which can take up to 14 days after the campaign ends).\n\nOnce pins arrive to me, depending on the total end quantity (read as: depending on how many stretch goals are met), it may end up taking longer than one week to sort through for quality errors, attach backing cards, and assemble pin(s) and other backer rewards for shipping.

Usually these changes are very minimal, and will not have an impact on the overall aesthetics or the turnaround time. However, if any issues arise, I will send out an update to all my backers immediately.\n\nDefects - If any of the products (pins, stickers, and postcards) are defective upon receipt from my manufacturer, I will get them remade.

My adorable whiskers never brush against it and never hurt because of whisker stress!\n\nEnough Water Every Day\nKittySpring ensures I satisfy my daily need for a cup of fresh water (0.8 oz/lb) for 2 looong days. Now Mom and Dad don\u2019t need to fill up my bowls and refresh the water in them several times a day. It\u2019s a life saver for both of us!\nPawesome addition to any home interior\nI simply can\u2019t stop admiring the sleek design of my new fountain! It can be placed in almost any corner of the house and still look great. \nHard to knock over\nI\u2019ve already paw-tested KittySpring. After hitting the light yet stable fountain a few times, it never flipped over! The fountain stands strong against any of my paw attacks. No more puddles of water, I promise.\n\nPurremium, safe materials\nKittySpring is made of FDA and RoHS certified materials, which means all of its components are  100% non-toxic, safe, and me-friendly. \n\nNon-electric, just gravity \nI never knew what gravity was until I got my KittySpring. Meow I know \u2014 it\u2019s a kind of thing that fills up my dish automatically once I lick a few drops \u2026 and it never adds to Dad\u2019s bills. Meowgic!\nSilent like a sweet nap\nKittySpring has no motor, which means no scary noises for a fluffy like me and a quiet night\u2019s sleep for Mom & Dad. \n\nHard  to destroy\nThe durable materials make KittySpring my long-term water fountain: time and even naughtiest of tricks will never put it out of order. \n\nNo need to replace the filter\nThe built-in stainless steel filter lasts for years. This actually means 2 things: no troubles for me and no extra expenses for Mom and Dad.\nEasy to install\nSimply unbox it, fill the bottle with water and place it in any corner of your house. No plugs, no cables needed!\nTrack the water level easily \nWith the transparent water bottle, Mom and Dad always knows when it\u2019s time to refill the bottle of my favorite water. \nEasy to clean \nCleaning KittySpring is super easy and super important. Make the dish and the bottle bacteria-free in seconds by simply taking them apart and washing in tap water using a brush or sponge and soap. Everything is also completely dishwasher-safe.\n\nSingle size. RRRight size\nKittySpring is purrfectly suited for both large cats like me and small kittens. Depending on the size of my fellow cats, KittySpring offers enough to drink for 1-2 days. And it will always stay fresh!\nGood for many cats  \nWith its ultra-large dish, KittySpring can serve water not only to one but even two cats. The second cat is often my friend, Max. We just love drinking together from this fountain!\n\nDesigned with comfort-loving cats in mind\nEach component of KittySpring is designed to combine useful with pleasant and comfortable. Thanks to its ergonomic design, drinking water from this fountain is almost like drinking from a natural spring.\n\nTwo pawesome color options for your cat\nCrystal White\nEmerald Green  \n\nKittySpring vs Regular bowl\n\n\nAbsolutely cat approved\nKittySpring is approved by all representatives of my cat family. This means British shorthairs like me, Bengal and Persian cats, Sphynx, Scottish folds and all the rest just love KittySpring.\nDimensions and Weight\n\nOur Pawesome Story\nLast year my cat, Oscar, suddenly fell ill. The vet diagnosed the fluffy with dehydration and resulting kidney problems. The poor thing had to go through lots of pain and long treatment to regain his kitty self. We all worried for him pretty much as he was our team\u2019s absolute favorite. \nAnd fortunately one bright day he started meowing happily again. We all sighed with relief and decided to join our efforts and design a water fountain that would help cuties all over the world avoid such problems and always stay hydrated. \nIn designing KittySpring, we considered each detail of feline physiology to turn our fur friends\u2019 drinking experience into the most enjoyable and comfortable one. We also tried to balance cats\u2019 preferences for running and still water, creating an amazing gravity fountain perfect for any cat. \nWith KittySpring, we hope to improve the life of our fluffies, keep them healthy and help loving cat parents like you take better care of them. \n\nBy backing now, you\u2019ll get KittySpring at a discount that is only available during the crowdfunding campaign. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll join our community of cat parents and receive useful tips on keeping your furry friend hydrated and healthy.\nWe ship worldwide!

I\u2019m Lauren Yu, also known as @missdoodlesalot on Instagram/Twitter! I've being making fandom and original merch for the last couple of years and have been pursuing it full time since I graduated. I've been creating enamel pins the last several months, and self funded 4 of my designs. Now I've decided I want to reach a wider audience and have my ideas be crowdfunded.\nFor this kickstarter I created 2 rootin' tootin' cowboys and 2 dastardly bandit pins that are full of personality. I love creating adorable and silly designs of animals that standout when you look at them. I think with each design there's something for any animal lover to enjoy.\nWith this campaign, I wanted to focus on these 4 designs to start, but there are several other designs I plan to release if all 4 of these get funded! If we continue to surpass the goals set there's also the possibility of unlocking more goodies! The more pledges I get, the more stuff you all receive!\nAll pins pledged for in this kickstarter are at a discounted rate from my retail prices on my store. If the project is funded, backers can also purchase additional pins on top of their pledge for the kickstarter.\nPlease note that you will NOT BE CHARGED until the campaign ends with successful funding! \nThe Tumbleweed Mini Pin will be free with all pledges!\nWestern Frontier Washi Tape will be available to pledges of 3pins or more. I will also have it available for preorder after the campaign for $6!\n June 30th: Kickstarter Campaign launches\n July 20th: Campaign ends. \n Late July: Kickstarter processes and collects fees. Surveys are sent out\n August/September: Pin Production\n September/October: Pins start being shipped! (Tracking Number Included for those who pay for tracking)\n PIN MANUFACTURING: 70% of the funds will go towards producing the pins\n PACKAGING: 5% will go towards packaging supplies (ie mailers, backing cards, etc)\n SHIPPING:  15% will be towards shipping the packages out\n KICKSTARTER FEES: Everything else goes toward Kickstarter fees. Kickstarter charges every successful project a small fee for credit card transactions and for using their platform.\nAll past enamel pins I've designed and self funded! Each are available on my etsy (link via the picture).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA common risk with enamel pin production is slight variations from mockup designs and finished products. I'll be in close contact with the manufacturer to make sure that any, if at all, changes are minor. All backers will receive standard grade pins even if there are some second grade quality pins.\n\nAnother thing for backers to keep in mind, is that different screens show the colors of each design differently. I will do my best share updates of the pins during production and in different lighting.\n\nDue to COVID, there is the possibility of delayed shipping/production, even more than there was before. I will continue to maintain close contact with my manufacturer about the production process as well as updating my backers on all updates I receive. \n\nPlease be sure to check if your country is accepting nonessential mail as there are some countries that aren't due to COVID. Customs and international travel may increase shipping times. To make sure packages do not get lost, please make sure that your address is current and up to date.\n\nBackers will be notified immediately if anything happens to the pins during production, packaging, or shipping.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Yeehaw!

Since then, we've passed three more of our funding goals ($10,000, $15,000, & $20,000). Our new goal is to make it to $25,000 by the end of July, but we can only do it with YOUR help! If we reach $25,000, we'll have some extra money for the next round of production, and we'll begin the process of creating new vegan milk chocolate products (hopefully by Halloween)! We'll also be able to help animal sanctuaries even more. Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey so far! We appreciate each and every one of you, and we still can't believe all of the support you lovely people have given us.\n- Brian & Charlie, AKA the Veggie Brothers\nWe're a vegan milk chocolate company owned by the Veggie Brothers and based in Gainesville, FL! This Kickstarter marks our official launch and the creation of our first chocolate bar, Vegan Rice Crunch. Vegan Rice Crunch tastes as delicious as the milk chocolate you already know, but without the animal cruelty.\nThe Veggie Brothers, Brian and Charlie Trupo.\nWe are Brian and Charlie Trupo, 21-year-old twins who grew up in Delaware. Two years ago, we created an online blog on Instagram called Veggie Brothers to spread the message of compassion, empathy, and being kind to all kinds. Since then, we've gained a following of over 25,000 people. \nIn our experiences as vegans, we discovered a gap in the vegan chocolate market, so we decided now would be the perfect time to launch our own vegan milk chocolate company. Our mission is to create the best vegan milk chocolate in the world and help animal sanctuaries at the same time.\nOur Vegan Rice Crunch is a vegan milkless rice crunch chocolate bar. Vegan Rice Crunch has the same creamy taste you're used to with milk chocolate, but we achieved it through the use of cocoa butter instead of dairy. It's free from dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, gluten, and soy!\nVegan Rice Crunch Ingredients: Vegan Cane Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Unsweetened Chocolate, Wholegrain Brown Rice, Rice Syrup Powder, Sunflower Lecithin (An Emulsifier), Salt, Natural Vanilla, Natural Flavor.\nThe minimum cost for our first round of production is approximately $7500. We have an idea, we have a passion, and we have a dream, but as university students, we simply don't have the funds to do this ourselves. All we need is demand and for people to want to buy our products. That's where you come in!\nThrough Kickstarter, we're pre-selling our Vegan Rice Crunch bars, and if we reach our goal then we'll start production on August 15th and get your chocolate to you as soon as we can.\nTo order Vegan Rice Crunch bars, click on \"Back this project.\" We have 5 different bundles that you can choose from!

So even if your laptop is under 13 inches, the corners will stick out if it is greater than 11 inches. \n**Please note that the purse is Not meant for carrying very heavy items on a regular basis. The interchangeable straps are not meant for carrying heavy loads, and could potentially break if you choose to continually abuse them. If you want to carry around textbooks or large boulders, please consider getting the backpack!**\n\u2727 Backpack Special Features: \u2727\nDimensions: 17 x 12 x 5.5 inches (not including height of eye bumps)\n  made of waterproof* Oxford fabric\n  can carry 11 lb (5 kg) of weight\n  weight-bearing padded shoulder straps so you may carry heavy things comfortably\n  padded laptop compartment (will Not fit a 17 inch laptop, anything smaller is ok)\n  the back features an open pocket, perfect for shoving papers and receipts inside and then promptly forgetting about them\n  *Waterproof actually means water resistant. please do not dunk your frog bag in a body of water, he will be wet because water is wet. spills and raindrops are ok. the fabric repels water, but is not meant to be submerged. \nUpdate July 8th @ 12:45 PM: I didn't know you were supposed to measure laptops by measuring diagonally. Whoops. I have personally tested that a 15 inch laptop will fit, but I don't have a 17 inch to test. The height of the interior compartment of the backpack is 16 inches vertically. Please measure your laptop vertically and see if it will fit!\n new! \u2727 Mini Bag \u2727\nthis bag was added last minute out of pity for those international shipping prices. The sample is still being made, so all images and info is subject to slight changes.\nMini Bag features:\nDimensions: 8 x 7 x 2 inches\nIta window dimensions: 4 x 6 inches\nmade of PU (fake leather). Same material as the purse.\nhas 2 magnetic flap closures and a 6 inch tall open pocket on the back for shoving your phone in quickly\neach compartment has 1 zipper pull.\nwill Not have interchangeable straps. it can be worn as a purse/crossbody only. the strap will be length from 2 feet to 4 feet. This is because it must be as light as possible to not go over 1 pound for shipping reasons.\ncan fit an entire Nintendo Switch Lite inside. can fit a normal Switch if you remove the joycons.\nperfect for carrying your phone, wallet, keys, and a piece of lint. maybe 2.\n\n\nCurrent images are of the prototype made of scrap material. This is not the color that will be used. Other adjustments that will be made to this prototype:\nno loop on top\n  Son\u2019s nose will be slightly less pointy\n  no rings on back for interchangeable strap option. Purse strap will not be removable.\nI will update this section as well as on social media with any new info as soon as I have it.\n\u2727 freebies \u2727\nWhen you purchase a bag, you will receive the following free items as part of your pledge!\nx1 enamel pin. 1.5 inches, with 2 rubber backing posts. The bones in the bag have a pearlescent effect.\nx1 faux leather knife keychain. Give to your frog so that he may secure his own skeletons to place inside the bag. \nx2 ita inserts. Each bag comes with default pastel pink and blue. \nThe free enamel pin and knife keychain are one per person. If you wish to purchase more, you may do so via Backerkit once the campaign is over. If you pledge for the pin and knife only, you do not get anything free. \nUpdate, July 10th: As celebration for absolutely destroying the funding goal, knife keychains will now be 1 per bag instead of 1 per person. \n\u2727 ita inserts \u2727\nWant more colors to choose from? Need more inserts to display your giant frog pin collection? well you\u2019re in luck because they come in packs of 2; each pack costs $5. All inserts feature a small lilypad design on the lower right corner. There are 6 extra inserts total. \nThe following extra inserts will be purchasable once the campaign is over via Backerkit.\nPastels - 1 yellow & 1 light purple insert\n  Minimalist - 1 black & 1 white insert\n  Holographic - 1 light & 1 blueish purplish insert\n  Inserts are NOT interchangeable between any of the bags. If you want multiple bags and multiple insert packs, you will be able to add them to your pledge once the campaign is over via Backerkit. If you do not see the combination of items you want, just go for the correct amount of bags. you can purchase more inserts and pins later. \n \u2727 unlockable stretch goals \u2727\ni like the color pink. i realize that some people do not. hence, i have made some more neutral color variations as stretch goals. If the dollar amount stated under each bag is met during the Kickstarter, you will be able to select it as an option once the campaign is over via Backerkit. I must have a minimum of 80 people per variation, so if I only get 20 people wanting a specific variation, I\u2019ll have to ask you to choose again. \n$16,000: Backpack - Olive green outside, pastel blue interior lining.\n$22,000: Purse - Olive green outside, pastel blue interior lining.\n$28,000: Backpack - Dark grey/black outside, lavender interior lining. Color of facial features may change. \n$34,000: Purse - Dark grey/black outside, lavender interior lining. Color of facial features may change. \n$40,000: Purse - Pastel pink outside, pastel pink interior lining. Hot pink blush. this is the opposite of neutral colored\n$50,000: Backpack - Pastel pink outside, pastel pink interior lining. Hot pink blush.\nMini bag color variations will unlock when the purse and backpack versions have both been unlocked. So if we reach $22,000, all 3 bags will be unlocked in olive. \n**Please note that colors chosen are approximate, and will vary between the two bags due to differences in the material.**\nEdit July 8th @ 2pm: oh geez we already hit all the goals. i don't have time to make another graphic so here's the new color goals:\n$75,000:  Lavender color for all bags\n$95,000: Shimmery silver color for minibag and purse only (the backpack fabric doesn't have a shimmer option)\n$105,000: Yellow for all bags (pastel for mini and purse, brighter for backpack)\n\u2727 how this works: \u2727\nThe Kickstarter campaign will run for 2 weeks. If you pledge, you will not be charged until the campaign ends. Once the campaign is over, I will be using Backerkit. Backerkit acts as a campaign extension and pre-order store. You will be able to select what variations you want, as well as purchase different add-ons, such as extra inserts or bags. This is also where you will pay for shipping. If you missed out on the campaign, you will still be able to pre-order what you want via the Backerkit pre-order store.\n\u2727 you Must check your email: \u2727\n do not just pledge and assume you will get your bag without having to do anything else. please use an email that you will check, and keep an eye out for emails from Kickstarter and Backerkit. If you do not fill out your Backerkit survey when it is sent to you, I will not be able to send you your bags. instead i will just keep your Kickstarter money until you ask me for a refund, or pay the shipping you owe. \nYou should also keep an eye on your email in case your Kickstarter payment doesn't go through. If there is an issue when Kickstarter tries to collect your payment when the campaign is over, you will have only 1 week to fix it. \n\u2727 timeline: \u2727\nOnce the campaign ends, it will take 2 weeks for Kickstarter to give me the funds so that I may purchase the goods. In those two weeks, I will set up the Backerkit preorder store. Backers do not need to access Backerkit until I send out the surveys, and that is when you will be able to purchase add ons. \nI will then wait 1-2 weeks until I have everyone's surveys, requested add-ons, and shipping payments.\nBag production is estimated to take 1 month. Due to the heavy load, they must be shipped to me via boat, which will take 30-35 days. After that, it will take me ?? weeks to check all bags, pack, and ship. I am a full time student, so how long this takes greatly depends on my school schedule and how many family members I am able to force into helping me. \nThe current time estimation is October, 2020. But that is just an estimate. I would like to avoid the holidays as much as possible, so at the Very latest things would be mailed out in November. worst case scenario, though. \n\u2727 questions? \u2727\nIf you have any urgent questions, please do not message me via Kickstarter! Please use the contact form on my website to get in touch, and I'll respond to your email as soon as I am able. but please first check the Kickstarter FAQ, the bag FAQ currently on my website, and read over this whole article closely to see if your question has already been answered.

That's okay! I've put together this Pledge Calculator to help you figure out how to pledge for the merch you want. The instructions and calculator chart are below.\nSTEP 1: Select the reward tier for the most expensive item that you want. Example: If you're interested in an enamel pin ($12), a tote bag ($20) and a banner ($55), choose the banner ($55 + $8 shipping) reward tier to start.\nSTEP 2: Now you'll be adding the funds needed for the rest of your items. The guide shows each item and their cost + shipping. Add the necessary funds for each item you choose to pledge for. Example: An enamel pin is $12 and shipping is free. A tote bag is $20 + $5 shipping. $12 + $20 + $5 = $37 gets added.\nSTEP 3: Add all your numbers together. Starting reward tier + additional item total + additional shipping total = PLEDGE TOTAL. Example: $55 starting (+$8 shipping) + $32 (added item cost) + $5 (added shipping cost) =  $100 TOTAL.\nHave any questions? Do the numbers not quite add up, or does your shipping seem off? Send an email to deadkickstarter@gmail.com and I'll help you sort it out!\nADD ON ITEMS COST:\n July 24 - Kickstarter campaign ends.\n Mid-August - Surveys sent out after funding.\n September - Production of rewards.\n October - November - Fulfillment and shipment to all backers.\nPlease keep in mind: This predicted timeline is based on turnaround estimates given by manufacturers and my own experience in fulfilling Kickstarters and pre-orders.\n Your pledge will go towards:\n Production of rewards - 60%\n Shipping and shipping supplies - 30%\n Taxes + Fees - 10%\nThese percentages may change slightly as stretch goals are reached.\nAny questions, concerns, or just want to give me a shout on social media?

Follow me on Instagram (@itsgeoffrey) and check out my Etsy Shop for pins I've already created!\nCreative Clout is a pin collection to celebrate the joys (and frustrations) of being a digital illustrator and graphic designer. With silly puns and relatable lines like \"Make it Pop,\" Creative Clout was made for the modern artist.\nThis pin project will allow me to focus on each element using some of the best quality materials possible. Each pin will be hard enamel with a brilliantly reflective, rose gold finish. They range from a generous size of 1.5\" (38mm) to a statement-piece-worthy size of 1.75\" (44.5mm). The pins will be mounted on their own special cards with a secret message behind each pin.\nBacker's Tips\nRisk-free pledging: Pledge now, pay later! You can also increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge before the end of the campaign. If this campaign doesn't reach its goal, you will not be charged. Please pledge for as much as you think you'd like. \nLimited time offers: Pledges cannot be changed after the end of the campaign, so make sure you get everything you want! Also, Early Bird specials are only available for a limited time.\nLowest price possible: Backing this project not only guarantees that these pins will be produced, but will also guarantee you're getting high-quality pins at the lowest price possible! Pins after this campaign will be available on my Etsy for $12 each (+shipping) rather than the Kickstarter special of $10 each (+shipping) or Kickstarter Early Bird special of $9 each (+shipping)!\nCustomize your pledge: Want more pins than your pledge is worth? Add $10 per additional pin you would like to receive! For example: To get 5 pins and you select a 3\u00d7 Hard Enamel Pin pledge, add $20 + shipping to your total.

I'm Geen aka Geeniejay, and this is my first Halloween pin collection which is something I've been dreaming of for a very long time. As it's the most wonderful time of the year, I have tried my best to capture the most wonderful spooks, goofs and cutes in these pins! I hope you like them, now step on in...\n*Door creaks open* Welcome to Geenoween! Be careful where you step as there's a few disgruntled bat macarons hopping around in the dark.\nGeenoween is where all of your spooky dreams come true, bringing together the best elements of spooky season to create a rather large collection of pins featuring; spooky treats, witch's essentials, kawaii familiars and other creepy creatures lurking around the corner. \nWhether they are your companions for the spooky season, or to help you show off your creepy spirit through the rest of the boring year, these pins are waiting for you to choose them, or haunt you if you don't! Muhuhahaha!\nAll the Geenoween pins will be hard enamel, gold plated, have rubber clutches, and my signature stamped on the back. The sizing will vary and will be specified next to each design!\nBuying multiple pins means multiple savings! The more pins you pledge for, the bigger the discount. All pins in the Kickstarter are a lower price than they will be once made and sold in my shop. In addition to this, larger pledges will notice that rewards of 11 pins or more have an even bigger discount! More on this in the \"Why Kickstarter?\" section below!\nStretch Goals:\nIf new pins get unlocked that you want to add to your pledge, you can either; use the 'Manage' button next to your pledge details and add the necessary amount, or alter your reward tier to the amount of pins stated in the reward title.\nAll stretch goal amounts are in GBP - Pound Sterling.\nEarly Birds:\nEarly bird tiers will get 2 free sticker sheets! If we unlock more extras along the way, they will either be automatically included in the Early Bird rewards for free, or be discounted.\nOnce the campaign ends, a survey will be sent out for you to tell me which pins you have selected for your pledge.\n cheaper prices! I'll be doing these pins at a special Kickstarter only price of \u00a36. Whereas, all 30mm and 40mm pins are \u00a37 in my shop. That means savings of \u00a31 per pin. Larger or more complicated pins (such as the love potion and castle designs) will be sold for \u00a39 in my shop. Which makes it a saving of \u00a33! But keep reading...\n EVEN MORE SAVINGS! Reward tiers for 11 or more pins turn into the price of just \u00a35 per pin. So if you were to buy the full collection through Kickstarter rather than my shop, the total saving would be \u00a328! \n buy now, pay later! You can secure a pin spot now and Kickstarter will take the funds from your bank when this campaign ends. You can check the end date at the top of the campaign!\n you can edit, increase, decrease or cancel your pledge at any time whilst the campaign is still running\n extra prezzies! I'll be giving free sticker sheets for all early bird pledges. There may also be more freebies added along the way depending how the project goes!\n\n10th September - campaign goes live\n10th October - campaign ends\n2 weeks whilst funds are processed, then I can order the pins and any extras\nPins will take about 20 days in production\nNovember - pins arrive with me and I quality check, pin onto backing cards, and package up the rewards to post\nThe costs are split up into categories - pins and extras production, packaging (backing cards/mailers/bags) and shipping, and kickstarter fees. Here's a graph to show the comparative figures:\nI'm an illustrator living in Stafford, UK. My main inspirations for my work are fashion, Japan, kawaii culture, my favourite shows and movies, and of course, Halloween! I've always been attracted to the creepier side of life since a young ghoul, watching The Nightmare Before Christmas and reading Tim Burton books opened my little mind to the macabre and I never looked back! If you would like to see my other pins and many more cute and creepy items you can have a haunt of my links here:\nEtsy shop\nInstagram\nTwitter\nFacebook\nThank you and well done for making it out of Geenoween alive. Happy Halloween!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 4th Kickstarter project and usually, the process is pretty smooth.

Rather, in the spirit of The Little Prince, it is the extraordinary tale of a small girl with an island in the Seine. There, she begins a garden\u2014but not a garden of flowers. It will be a garden of people, she says: Paris. \nIn the center of her garden, the little girl plants her greatest treasure of all: Notre Dame de Paris. She watches as heaven reaches through the cathedral's windows. She wonders as the people in her garden change through kingdoms and empires and revolutions. She weeps as war ravages and burns. Over 850 years of history, her garden changes\u2014as people must. And through it all, her most beloved flower, Notre Dame, resolutely offers divine solace and light, and the little girl learns much about life, freedom, love, loss, and the glory of new beginnings. It is a story about Notre Dame, but much deeper, it is a story about all that Notre Dame has stood for. \nThe little girl admires the most beautiful flower in her garden: Notre Dame de Paris.\nIncludes faux stained glass windows built right into the cover\nBuilt into the front cover are a series of stained glass windows (made with printed clear plastic).

Her people loved her. She loved her people. Her song rang across the city and across the years, bells mingled with mystery through the ups and downs of joy, war, suffering, prosperity, and happiness. Her story spans the ages of kings, emperors, presidents, revolution, and change. \nAnd then, like most of the world, we were stunned as we watched flames erupt through her roof. Like the light that pours through her windows, we had come to believe she would always be there\u2014a beacon of hope and inspiration, a quiet touch of the divine in the midst of the world's clamor.\nWe are grateful to know that Notre Dame will always be there, due in large part to the generosity of the world and those that love her. \nWhile that reconstruction goes on, we wish to offer a tribute of our own\u2014a story of hope and love, of life and rebirth. In this book, through illustration and prose, we pay homage to the grand story of Notre Dame\u2014who she is, how she was, and what she has come to mean to millions the world over for 850 years. And in the spirit of giving back, we pledge that for every book sold, we will donate a book to kids in need\u2014book for book.

I put the images online and they went viral. So I kickstarted a book, \"Malls Across America\", and they went more viral. In a crazy twist of fate, that book ended up getting released by the publisher Steidl who printed the work that inspired those photos - books by William Eggleston and Robert Frank.  Unfortunately, Steidl didn't print nearly enough of the books, so the Kickstarter backers of that project, \"Malls Across America\", were some of the few people who were able to get it. It has been out of print for 6 years now, and currently trades for upwards of $1000.  At some point I want to re-publish that book, but for the time being it remains out of print and out of reach. At first I thought I would use some of the classic images in the new book, \"The Decline of Mall Civilization\", but I found hundreds of other powerful images that deserved to be seen so we decided to keep it completely separate. The two books have very different feels as well. \"Malls Across America\", which was designed by the incomparable Peter Miles, is all single images over double page spreads. This time we spent a lot of time and effort pairing the images into diptychs that play off of each other in interesting ways.\nWe are incredibly excited to make \"Decline of Mall Civilization\" available.  We hope you might consider pre-ordering it via this Kickstarter - don't miss out. \nSebastian and me by the blue Corolla that carried us across country.\nBackstory\nIn 1989, I was a sophomore at NYU when I took my first photo class, \"Color Printing\".  My teacher was awesome and our first assignment was to watch the film \"River's Edge\".  At the time, I was dating a girl who went to Stony Brook and I'd take the Long Island Railroad out to see her every other weekend.  One weekend, shortly after I had started the class and had to find a subject for my class project, I happened to go to the Smith Haven Mall with her and immediately knew I'd found a place to shoot. I was a Religious Studies major who took a lot of anthropology and sociology courses, which helped me to think of the the mall in complex ways. I was especially interested in considering the mall as something of a privatized public square. While I focused on the people, I thought about the way that they interacted with each other and the space. The teacher loved the work and encouraged me to continue it that summer. So my friend Sebastian and I packed ourselves in his Corolla station wagon and we hit the road without any real plan at all. \nRichard Sandler on \"The Decline of Mall Civilization\". Sandler published \"Eyes of the City\" last year\nOur first stop was Columbus Ohio. We stayed with my aunt but we didn't find a mall. We then hightailed it to Detroit where we hit the jackpot with the Woodfield Mall.  It's a beauty and there are probably a dozen in the book from that one. Next stop was Chicago- then South Dakota, and on and on. All in all, we hit about 15 malls. We got some great images but it wasn't really their time. By 1989, the \"Pictures Generation\" - with its focus on more constructed and deconstructed images - had pushed street photography out of the galleries. They were doubling down on big ideas and conceptual work. I went on to take a couple other photo classes, but turned my attention to making music and making films. I shot a lot of images, but my main outlets for them were fanzines and album covers. I moved on to making films.  In 2010, I re-discovered these slides and the rest is history. \nThe 10 images that will be available as limited artist's proofs \nOnce you back the project you'll be able to see more of the images in the book via the updates.

I am Venetia, aka: ChocolateRaisinFury. I am a digital artist who has been working full time selling my own art for 3 years now, selling on websites such as Qwertee, ShirtPunch, TeeFury, and selling at conventions across the south of the UK. Now thanks to encouragement & help from Gilles Bone  (<3), and all of my wonderful social media followers (Thank you Rachelle for your advice as well!), I have decided to run my first ever Kickstarter for making enamel pins! \nThe Hard Enamel pins are made from my Eeveelution collection, and different eeveelutions will (hopefully!) be unlocked as more stretch goals are reached. You will be able to select any of the unlocked pins you want at the end of the campaign :)\nEach Eeveelution will also have glitter on their bodies! \nThese are the first pins I have made, so the colour of my mock-ups may vary slightly from the final products (and they may vary with how they look on different computer screens), but I'll do my very best to work with the manufacturer for accuracy, and give updates to you guys!\nThe Rainbow Enamel pins in particular are designed for each individual pin to be unique, as is the nature of their manufacturing process.\nThanks to all of your support & feedback, I have added these pins on as stretch goals! \n** ARTWORK MAY CHANGE SLIGHTLY **  I am working with my manufacturer and am in the process of sorting out proofs to make sure the pins come out as I want them to, but I may have to simplify some of the more complicated elements. \n\nBacking Card Preview:\nAs a thank you to everyone who pledges and sticks with me throughout my first ever Kickstarter, I'll be giving out these 5.5 x 8.5 inch sized mini foil prints, exclusive to Kickstarter campaigns!\n \u2606 70% - Mould Fees & Pin Production \n \u2606 10-15% - Shipping\n \u2606 10% - Kickstarter fees\n \u2606 The remainder goes to backing cards & packaging supplies.\n June: Kickstarter campaign runs\n July: Payments are processed & surveys sent out. Free prints will be ordered.\n Mid/ Late July: Kickstarter funds come in, Pins & Packaging are ordered.\n Mid/Late September: Pins arrive and I begin the grading process. \n Late October/ Mid November: Rewards get sent out to all the lovely people who pledged! <3 \nI have put November as a send date incase things run late as this is my first campaign, I wanna make sure I get things right :) plus since I am based in the UK it may take a while for US & International orders to arrive!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs previously mentioned, this is my first Kickstarter and Enamel Pin collection but I will do my best to get everything sorted in a timely manner, and solve any problems that may arise. Since I work for myself and my business, I can dedicate all of my time to this campaign. The designs have also already been approved by the manufacturer. \n\nRewards are sent out untracked due to the high price of tracked shipping, but if you'd like the extra security and you'd like your pins to be sent with tracking, just add \u00a39 (GBP) to your pledge and include in the comments that you'd like it :)\n\nAs also previously stated, with any pre-order the final product can vary from the mock-ups. Hard Enamel paints can come out quite differently to on screen colours, but with the help of others who have much experience in the pin industry, I'll do my best to keep them looking good :) \n\nThere may be hold ups due to shipping delays or misprints, but I have faith in this manufacturing company. There may also be delays incase of a huge number of backers since it's just me working on this project, but in this event I will enlist help from my ever-faithful friends <3\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "\u2606\u2606 B GRADE PINS \u2606\u2606", "descp": "- Don't mind imperfections?

For inquiries  go to CulpritCreative.com !\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNuudii System has been over 3 years in development and was created by 3 women from the fashion Industry who have been listening to the needs, challenges and experiences of women and their boobs!\nWe have developed and Patent Approved Nuudii, and with a Design Patent pending. \nWe found that by truly listening and involving women in the development process, we were able to engineer and design the best product. We aim to constantly evolve and expand our technology to include additional sizes so more women can have the Nuudii Experience. We are honored and excited to be here on Kickstarter, where we can connect directly with you (and your boobs! )\n\nBoobs are wonderful , and complicated - just think about all sizes and shapes - and Bra Production is a highly complex industry - However, we created a 'never been done before' manufacturing process. We found an extraordinary partner in the US , that by working with Nuudii, is reviving a dying industry. This campaign will provide the much needed capital to fund the build out of our production lines, re-establish an industry and enable us to share Nuudii with women of throughout the world.\nWe created a duplicate factory line in our Design studio in Brooklyn, to ensure that our designer could develop Nuudii right alongside our wear testers and ensure that Nuudii could be easily recreated in a factory environment, (always a huge challenge for any industry is moving a prototype to a proper production environment ). \n\nWe have now successfully tested a production run in the factory. We have built the supply chain of our Eco Friendly packaging and set up fulfillment for seamless deliveries. We have planned with all of our partners to allot time for production to fulfill and deliver rewards. \n\nRISKS \n\n1. We want to make sure our customer expects a completely new experience.\nNuudii does not feel or perform like you are wearing a bra - It is important to understand that this is different, it is not a bra and not the same experience as a bra.\nNuudii has no hardware, fits different, with the feel and look of being braless. \nThere is no constriction, it allows your real shape to remain, while it gently lifts and allows your boobs to move within Nuudii. Nuudii System does not mold your boobs and allows them be themselves. Wearing Nuudii may show side boob and some sheerness. \n\n2) Sizing and how to guide our customers to order the right size.\nNuudii is a very flexible fit because of the stretch. We currently offer sizes Small, Medium and Large, which covers sizes 32B - 38DD. And Nuudii actually gets better with wear. We will expand sizes in the future when, with your help, we are able to fund this highly technical development process. \nFor sizing and fit questions we have specialists on our team to connect with, as well as offering Free shipping with in the USA. When you receive your Nuudii and if you need a different size, simply let us know and send within 10 days of receiving your Nuudii and we will happily make a onetime exchange, free of charge (Note - shipping charges both ways apply for International orders exchanges).\n\nPlease note \nLocal Duties, Taxes, and Fees: Some international backers will be subject to local customs import duties and taxes; these backers will be responsible for covering all of their local customs duties and taxes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nSustainable Packaging", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support our Campaign", "descp": "Much gratitude for your support in our movement to Free The Boobs!\nINCLUDES:\nThank you Message\nGet access to all our news and more", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["297 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 44 or more", "title": "1 X Nuudii Tee System", "descp": "Experience Nuudii Tee System !\nRetail Value $49\n$5 off + FREE Back Clip $5 value & Lifetime Membership Rewards\nWe\u2019ll contact you to choose your sizes and colors after the campaign\nChoose from sizes Small - Medium - Large\nColors - Nuu Light, Nuu Brownz, Nuu Black\n+ Free USA Shipping\nINCLUDES:\n1 X Nuudii Tee System\n1 X Free Back Clip & Wash Pouch\nVIP Lifetime Membership Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["5,707 backers", "Limited (293 left of 6000)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 85 or more", "title": "2 X Nuudii Tee System Duo", "descp": "Experience Nuudii Tee System !\nRetail Value $98\n$13 off + FREE Back Clip $10 value & Lifetime Membership Rewards\nWe\u2019ll contact you to choose your sizes and colors after the campaign\nChoose from sizes Small - Medium - Large\nColors - Nuu Light, Nuu Brownz, Nuu Black\n+ Free USA Shipping\nINCLUDES:\n2 X Nuudii Tee System\n2 X Free Back Clip & Wash Pouch\nVIP Lifetime Membership Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["2,610 backers", "Limited (270 left of 2880)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 123 or more", "title": "3 X Nuudii Tee System Trio", "descp": "Experience Nuudii Tee System !\nRetail Value $147\n$24 off + FREE Back Clip $10 value & Lifetime Membership Rewards\nWe\u2019ll contact you to choose your sizes and colors after the campaign\nChoose from sizes Small - Medium - Large\nColors - Nuu Light, Nuu Brownz, Nuu Black\n+ Free USA Shipping\nINCLUDES:\n3 X Nuudii Tee System\n3 X Free Back Clip & Wash Pouch\nVIP Lifetime Membership Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["585 backers", "Limited (55 left of 640)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 133 or more", "title": "Gifting - Some Boob Freedom", "descp": "3 x Nuudii's Gift wrapped\nGUYS if you can't wear it, gift it.., to all women in your life.\nWomen share the love...gift to girlfriends, wives, daughters, mom\u2019s, bff\u2019s, or sisters.\nIncludes 1 x Nuu light 1x Nuu Black 1x Nuu Brownz\nWe will reach out to you at the end of the campaign to get the size details.\nChoose from sizes Small - Medium - Large\nFree USA Shipping\nINCLUDES:\n3 X Nuudii Tee System\n3 X Free Back Clip & Wash Pouch\nGift wrap\nVIP Lifetime Membership Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (20 left of 65)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 408 or more", "title": "12 X Early Bird Nuudii Tee System", "descp": "Share the Freedom!\nSave $180!\n12 X Nuudiis to Share, Gift or Party Favors\nRetail Value $588\nWe will contact you once the campaign ends to choose your sizes & colors\nChoose from sizes: Small - Medium - Large\nChoose from colors: Nuu Light, Nuu Brownz, Nuu Black\nFree USA Shipping\nINCLUDES:\n12 X Nuudii Tee System\n12 X Free Back clip & Wash Pouch\nVIP Lifetime Membership Rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["30 backers", "Limited (10 left of 40)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 808 or more", "title": "24 X Early Bird Nuudii - Gift or Sell", "descp": "24 Nuudiis of your choice\nThat's $368 off!

Thus, I created the first card. \nThe First Card I Made!\nMy Instagram followers loved it so much, I tried my hand at a few more. And once I started thinking about the imagery in both the show and the Rider-Waite deck, I was consistently surprised at how well they overlapped. So I kept going and going and going to try and finish a full Major and Minor Arcana deck of 78 cards and designs.\nDrawing on iconography from both the cartoon and the Rider-Waite deck, I've created individualized suits and pay tribute to the major players.\nMajor Arcana: Almost all of your favorite characters show up here--and maybe a few extras, too! \nAxes (Swords): These focus on the human inhabitants of the Unknown. \nAxes of the Unknown are acting as the traditional Swords suit\nPentacles: This suite is full of your favorite pumpkin people of Pottsfield, and maybe a couple vegetable folks from the pilot, too!  \nWands: Pays tribute to all of the animals within the Unknown.\nCups: Shows off those that live outside of the Unknown.\nIt's here that I ask for your help to turn this deck into a reality.\nWhat You'll Get\nDepending on your support, you will receive everything from stickers and prints to enamel pins and full tarot decks.

While I've based this Kickstarter on a specific number of decks to be made, shipping could be drastically delayed if the success is beyond my expectations. It may change me getting the final products from a couple weeks to a couple months.\n\nThe other part of that is USPS shipping. Packages go missing or are damaged. To help remedy this, I will be shipping ALL Domestic Pledges that include Tarot decks Priority Mail, which should not only speed up the delivery, but it provides $50 of insurance that can be claimed if the package is lost. I will do my best to work with you to fix these shipping issues the best possible way, from replacing the lost items to filing a claim to sending a new package if additional postage is paid. International Pledges will be shipped via First-Class International Packages that have tracking. Insurance will be optional. \n\nThe last issue could simply be an act of God that takes me out of commission.

I'm a Montreal-based illustrator and storyteller from Spain, who loves exploring and adventures. You might know me from Instagram, where I started the #ChildhoodWeek challenge, or my Once Upon a Unicorn Horn book. \nTo say thank you to all those who enjoy my work and continuously support me throughout my journey, I am very excited to announce this campaign to launch my first art book \u2013 Wonder.\nI want to create a book that illustrates the explorative and imaginative mindset, and inspires readers to seek the wonders all around them to always grow as artists.\nAcross the pages of Wonder, I will share my design insights and discuss the elements of my work that help me to tell enchanting stories. You will discover my detailed thoughts on how and where I find my inspiration and ideas, how I turn ideas into illustrations, as well as my process of understanding concepts and developing them in both traditional and digital media. This book will also contain an extensive collection of my best artwork, including new designs and characters, as well as never-before-seen sketches. \nThroughout its creation, I consider WONDER to be a new piece of art in itself. My aim is to make it feel like a treasure to keep with you at all times. It will be finished with beautiful magical effects, such as glow-in-the-dark accents, and its handy portable size makes it perfect to carry on your own adventures, to read wherever and whenever you want. \nAs this is quite an ambitious project, I am super happy to be working with 3dtotal Publishing, who are experienced in creating many amazing artbooks and educational resources for artists. \nIf this campaign is successful in funding, I hope you enjoy reading the book as much as I have enjoyed creating it! \nBelow are the exclusive items you can receive across the tiers, that are only available during this campaign. Some tiers are limited though, so get yours quick and don't miss out!  \nSIGNED BOOK\nI am offering a selection of signed, first edition copies of the book across a selection of tiers. There will only be a limited number of these available, so make sure to secure yours before they're gone!\nTOTE BAG\nYou can also pledge for an eco-friendly canvas tote bag screen-printed with glow-in-the-dark ink along with your copy of the book!\nORIGINAL ARTWORKS\nTiers 12-16 are limited to only one backer each. These tiers include an original piece created by me, as well as a signed copy of the book, a tote bag, a riso print, and a set of enamel pins. \nLittle Pow: Markers, oil colored pencils and neon pencils on cold pressed Canson watercolor paper.\nWolf boy: Oil colored pencils, neon pencils and oil pastels on cold pressed Strathmore watercolor paper.\nStorm: Gouache, oil pastels, neon pencils and oil colored pencils on cold pressed Strathmore watercolor paper.\nBird Girls: Oil colored pencils and neon pencils on cold pressed Strathmore watercolor paper.\nWonder: Pencil, markers, oil colored pencils, neon pencils and oil pastels on handmade watercolor paper.\nRISO PRINT\nThere are also opportunities to receive an A4 riso print, designed by me, with your copy of the book. \nENAMEL PIN SET\nAdditionally, I have designed four enamel pins for this campaign. These are only offered across certain tiers, so make sure to select the right tier if you would like these pins.  \nAs previously mentioned, launching this book through Kickstarter allows us to thank those who made this book possible by adding stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed three high-quality rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets. The more the campaign funds, the more exclusive items we can give our supporters! \nStretch goals are available to all backers from Tier 2 and above.\nThank you for your interest in this project. I hope you will consider joining me on this journey to help me turn this book into a reality.\nBeatrice \n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you. \n All rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.  \nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will only be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!  \nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in December. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward! \nAs seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time. We've selected an expert printer to work with and a fulfilment company 3dtotal Publishing has an established relationship with, so everything is in place as much as possible to ensure smooth production and delivery by the end of December 2019.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Tier 1 -

This time I'm aiming to fund fees to make my SUMMER inspired pins that celebrate all that is the rollercoaster of this freelance life!\nThe campaign finishes mid-june and I'm hoping to have the funded rewards ready to start shipping END of JUNE / START of JULY (please check delivery times for specific rewards) But these designs aren't just for when the sun shines they're for wearing to remind you to take it easy ALL YEAR ROUND!\nDetails of the pin:\n50mm High Pin\nLettering reads 'self care factor 50 - AVOID BURNOUT'\nTwo pins with rubber clasps to secure on reverse\nEach pin comes with a matching sticker* and mini (A6) print\nIf the project hits its funding goal you can pick the colourway you'd like of any of the pins in the survey after the campaign ends - for now just select the amount of pins you'd like.\nAs a Kickstarter pledger to one of my campaigns you get exclusive prices - but I don't JUST mean the EARLY BIRD REWARDS - once all my items are in my shop each is priced differently, reflective of its manufacturing costs - but to my kickstarter pledgers the pins cost just \u00a38 each! Because you're part of the process AND you get to say you helped make the pin its my way of saying 'thanks!' - if that isn't enough already you'll also get a matching *sticker & mini print with each perfectly packaged pin! \n*If we surpass \u00a31650 all pledges will come with a free sticker sheet with all the designs instead.\nAll of the pins in this campaign are on the larger side, and they all use a few colours, so they're priced \u00a31 more than my previous campaigns, but I'm still doing my best to bring you alotta flair on a budget!\nThe NEW Fish & Chips Laser Cut Necklace in MINT\n\n\n\nBy backing this project you will help me raise the funds to get these pins manufactured. The majority of the goal amount covers the production of the pins, these are all very detailed/large/colourful pins, so manufacturing costs are higher overall in this campaign. The amount that remains relates to postage and packaging costs in shipping the pins out to backers.\nFor those Early Birds to the campaign - there are special pledge amounts for those who support this campaign early on. Look for the Early Bird pledge amount - and grab yourself 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 BEACH THEMED pins/bobby pins/earrings at a price especially for you COASTAL LOVERS!\nAt the end of the campaign - backers will be able to choose which designs they would like from the unlocked pins. The STRETCH GOALS LIST and funding targets image below give a hint as to what they will be - the actual design will be revealed as we get nearer to the goals!\nThe LASERCUT FISH & CHIP hairslides \u00a315 each\n\n\nPins from my 2018 Halloween Collection\nIt makes me so happy when people return to pledge to a new collection - and I know lots of you pledged to my Halloween Kickstarter (Shown above) so wherever you see a pin offered in multiple colourways that other option will co-ordinate with my halloween 2018 collection colours - cause we all love a good colour co-ordinating pin collection!\n\n\nOnce the pins are manufactured all post within the UK will be sent out ROYAL MAIL 2nd Class signed postage. For international deliveries there's standard international shipping which can take up to 30days, or in surveys tick for International Tracked shipping for an extra \u00a34.50 which takes 5-7 working days with tracking.\nThis means no tracking numbers will be available with standard shipping (although I always obtain proof of postage).\nPlease note tracked shipping is highly recommended if your pledge is larger than 2/3 pins.\nBeing a visual person my home is on instagram!

Science shows that room temperature should be between 68-72 degrees for the optimum sleep benefits. \nHush Iced can help you get there by preventing you from overheating, even during the nastiest heat wave. \nHush Iced uses the same advanced weight distribution technology as the classic Hush Blanket, but with a lighter, cool-to-the-touch cover. Hush Iced\u2019s proprietary bamboo and cotton blend helps wick away sweat during hot summer months, while still providing weighted relief.\n At Hush, we believe in love at first sleep! If you do not absolutely love your blanket after night one, we will give you 99 more tries or your money back!\n Two years ago, we came up with the idea for the Hush Blanket, a weighted blanket designed for those who wanted to relax and fall asleep, fast. But we noticed one thing, Hush was great during fall and winter, even during spring, but it was admittedly hard to use during the grueling, hot summer months. And we found that was the case with most other weighted blankets.\nWe set out to change that.\nHush Iced was created for use even when it\u2019s hot out, with an amazing breathable fabric and a lighter, cool-to-the-touch cover, so you can stay cool and calm all summer long.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\n We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Hush a reality. \nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or purchase a Hush Iced blanket, if you\u2019re a supporter of Hush, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of! \nCheck out our other weighted blankets in Canada.\n\nYour Hush Iced blankets will be shipping July 2019! We\u2019re able to get them to you so soon because we are backed with great manufacturers who lead the production of our first Hush blankets. \nInternational shipping costs will be paid after the campaign when accurate shipping costs are calculated for your country.\nIf we get enough pledges from each country, we can send your Hush blankets in bulk, which would cost even less in shipping!\nIn addition, not charging international shipping on Kickstarter means it\u2019s excluded from Kickstarter\u2019s commissions -- and we can pass those savings on to you!\nYou will be able to choose different add-ons and update your shipping addresses 1-2 weeks after the campaign ends in the post-campaign survey, which can affect shipping price.

Sets also allowed us to structure stretch goals to optimize how many pins might get unlocked. We never could have imagined it would be this successful!! We are completely floored by how this campaign is performing, and can't thank our backers enough.\nBecause of the campaign's amazing trajectory, we've partnered with BackerKit to allow $40+ backers to add additional sets AND individual pins to their existing pledges after funding (at a discount!).

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

(Uni-pega-saur-us)\nAll of the artwork is done by Megan McKay of webcomic Doodle for Food. When I discovered this comic I just fell in love with the likeable art style and wanted to base a game around it. When I thought of the Grownup hook, I contacted Megan and the game came together beautifully.\nWe also have some stretch goal cards being done by some of the absolute best webcomic talent out there.

If that player chooses to play a card, the player to THEIR right also has the option to challenge, which can set up combos for bigger scores.\n  If a challenge occurs, all players reveal their score at the same time to see who wins. The winning player keeps all played cards as points. First to 12 points wins!\nIf nobody challenges the initial grownup card, that player keeps it as a point without the other players knowing the value. This adds a fun bluffing mechanic to the game!\nA unipegasaurus is part unicorn, part pegasus and part dinosaur.

We need you to help bring it out to the world!\nSTORY OF THE NEW ALBUM\nThe sound of this album crosses from dreamy bossanova up to the most upbeat rocknroll we've ever made. There are hooky guitar leads, and back & forth vocals between me (Keith), Madeline, Rebecca and Kendra. \nWe started tracking right when we got home from our Brazil tour in December. Now we've built up every song with layered harmonies, melodic basslines and driving live drums.\nAfter a lot of upheaval in the last year--the departure of two dear band members foremost--for us, this music reaches a new level of intimacy and courage. The album has aspiring ecosocialist anthems, sinewy love songs, a club jam for dancing in your bedroom, and a groovy party song about getting social anxiety at parties. I think we've made a set of songs far more personal, powerful and honest than we ever have.\nOwn It will have eleven tracks, all new originals. It's the first album I've ever made that I like to listen to on repeat. Finally, I have become a true rock n' roll narcissist.\nFace up to your true self and find catharsis! Own It! Put a nail in capitalism's coffin! Own It! Destroy neoliberal malaise, inside and out! Own It!\nHOW WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT\nYour support will help us:\npress the album to vinyl and CDs\npromote the album with a fabulous publicity campaign\nmake 2 new music videos (inc. one planned for filming in Brazil!)\nhit the road on a two-month tour this Oct.-Dec., across the US and Canada (and hopefully beyond ;), 23 cities and counting...\n(bassist Kendra & me loosening up at a rest stop on tour)\nWe want to do this album as a self-release in large part because we feel we can count on you, dear community of T&W listeners, to help us own this album ourselves. Releasing with a label usually means you don't earn a cent on selling/streaming your album until you've paid back the label's expenses, usually at least a year after the release. \nIf we own this album ourselves, we'll get sustained by it right away, meaning we can focus on live shows and making new songs. Even better, owning this album ourselves means we get to release it on the timeline we want--which means new music sooner for you.\nThank you for anything you can offer to support, and thank you for being a part of making this music come to life.  Let's own it together.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe plan to officially release the album on October 7.

It will have 10 original songs and one cover of a Disney song! It won't just be us, we have other musicians that will be featured on the album for a really full sound and will have the album engineered, mixed and mastered by some amazing professionals. \nCheez-its are the best snack when recording\nThe album is entitled Little Sister, named after one of our original songs. We both have older siblings and the song is dedicated to them and the effect they have had on our lives and our goals.\nRachel, Khris (bass) & Zackary (engineer) at the studio\nThe plan is to get the album out in the right hands, so we will have a big promotion and marketing campaign for it. That's why we are starting our very first Kickstarter! $5500 is the bare minimum we need to get the album done. However, the more we make, the better we can make it and the more people we can reach (our BIG goal is $8,500). \nZackary & Madison\nWe\u2019re very excited to embark on this incredible journey. We\u2019re so close and we\u2019ve worked so hard. This year we are making our dreams a reality and with your help, we will get there! Thank you guys so much for your support!\nAbout Rachel and Madison:\nRachel began singing at the age of two. No joke. She took her talents to the stage imediately by being a part of a performing arts group. Since then she's done over a 1,000 shows. With dancing and acting under her belt, she decided to learn how to write her own songs at the age of 9. With help from her musically talented dad, she learned music theory, guitar and piano. She began writing and performing her own material all across Los Angeles. She also started a Youtube channel and that got a lot of attention from new viewers and fans. She met Madison in 2011 and started Color Me Home with her.\nMadison was always singing and dancing as a little girl. When she was 10, she told her dad that she wanted to learn how to write her own songs. Her words were, \u201cI want to be able to write my own songs. Britney Spears just sings her songs, but I want to sing and write them both!\u201d So her dad told her that you have to learn an instrument and write lyrics. And that\u2019s when the piano came into her life. Her teenage years consisted of writing countless number of songs while learning jazz piano from legend, Arlette McCoy-Budwig. She also played all over Los Angeles and had her own band before meeting Rachel in 2011 and started a duo with her.\nAbout Color Me Home:\nColor Me Home began in 2011 when Madison asked Rachel to write a song with her. Acquaintances at the time, Rachel decided to give it a shot. The first song they wrote together was called \u201cThe Chase\u201d, which is actually the first song off their EP \u201cOver the Moon.\u201d Finding out that they had a lot in common, they met up again... and again. They decided to form a duo and the fireworks exploded! They wrote more songs together and showed each other their solo songs too. That was the start of their first EP, which they made completely on their own, from start to finish. They released the EP in 2013 and played a lot of shows week after week in Los Angeles; from caf\u00e9s and well known venues to street performing on 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. \nIn the last year, they focused on writing songs and putting out quality YouTube videos, taking suggestions from fans of covers they wanted to hear (check them out). Now they are working on their first full length album, which will be released this year! They have already started recording!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have pretty much everything nailed down.
