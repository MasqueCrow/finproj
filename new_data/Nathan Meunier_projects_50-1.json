[{"backer": "Nathan Meunier", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Our intrepid author Paige Turner is back!  In Paperback Adventures, you get to play as the protagonist in one of Paige's wild brainstorming sessions. Conquer a menagerie of pulp novel characters in this solo deckbuilding word game.\nJust like in the original game Paperback\u2014and its follow up, Hardback\u2014you will build your own deck of cards throughout the game, and those cards will have letters to help you spell words every turn. But in Paperback Adventures, instead of testing your wordsmithing wit against other players, you will use your words to defeat a series of AI enemies in \"roguelike\" fashion.\nPaperback Adventures is a solo-focused game. It was designed from the ground up as a strategic, highly-replayable solo word game. There are also additional gameplay variants for cooperative play between two players.\nHere are the stretch goals we've unlocked!\nCommunity Stretch Goals\nPart of what makes Kickstarter great is the opportunity to hear what matters most to backers. Here are some of the additions and changes we\u2019ve made thanks to our backers\u2019 feedback.\nAs the game developed and grew, we wanted every character to have their own cards and unique styles of play, but with the Fowers Games history of small box games we also wanted to keep an affordable price point for the game. So we decided on a modular system that lets you play the game whether you buy one character or several.\nHere's what the Paperback Adventures core box contains:\nRulebook\nEnemy Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\n12 Enemy Cards\n12 Reward Cards\n7 Penalty Cards\n7 Enemy Vowel and \"?\" Cards\n26 Item Cards\n26 McGuffin Cards\n7 Penalty Card Sleeves\nAs long as you have at least one character box, the core box contains everything else you need to play the game. The core box also has space to store the bonus content from each of your character boxes (note: not all content from those boxes), allowing you to set up a new game more quickly.\nSo what comes in a character box? Each protagonist in Paperback Adventures plays distinctly, with different core items, starting items, and a unique 10-card starting deck. Additionally, every protagonist has their own growth deck of 50 cards that offers different paths and playstyles every game session.\nBut a character box doesn't only provide new content when you choose that character. Inside each character box you'll also find a few new enemies and a few new bonus items and McGuffins that go into your core box and add additional content no matter which character you pick for a given game.\nEach character box has bonus enemies, items, and double-sided McGuffins (like this one!)\nThe more character boxes you add, the more variety and wacky combinations you get. \nHere's what comes in each character box:\nCharacter Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\nCharacter Card\n6 Enemy Cards\n6 Reward Cards\n60 Letter Cards\n6 Core Item Cards\n4 Bonus Item Cards\n4 Bonus McGuffin Cards\n60 Letter Card Sleeves\nThe protagonists are not only unique from a gameplay standpoint, they also come from wildly different genres and have their own graphical style and artistic design. Here are the playable characters in Paperback Adventures:\nOur final character is a Pirate\u2014he is currently awaiting a proper name to be voted on by the backers!\nWord-heavy playstyle\nBarrage cards get bonuses for longer words\nCan drain the enemy's life!\nCan copy the effect of an item\u2014effectively using it twice\nCrew cards come back from the fatigue pile\nTry out the Tabletop Simulator demo on Steam!\nIn a single game of Paperback Adventures, your protagonist will face off against nine randomized enemies of escalating difficulty.  To make matters worse, your health total persists from enemy to enemy. Luckily for you, each enemy also offers randomized rewards to help you power up quickly to meet the challenge. \nYou'll need to beat each enemy one by one by spelling words with the cards in your hand. Each card has symbols that either damage the enemy, block the enemy's incoming damage to you, or provide you with mana so you can use your items. You'll also be able to activate the unique ability of one of your cards.\nThe game is divided in a trilogy structure, where you'll battle two normal enemies and a boss for each \"book\" in the trilogy. You can stop a game session after completing one book (~45 min) or even after any enemy through a \"save game\" feature that will keep your current deck, items, and rewards separate in the game's box. To beat the game, you'll need to defeat all nine enemies in the trilogy.\nOne goal from the outset of this game's design was to find ways to streamline the typical deckbuilding roguelike experience found in digital games for tabletop play. Two essential systems deliver the gameplay variation and combos needed for the genre while keeping player upkeep at a minimum: the splay system and the hex and boon counter system.\nYour word is ready\u2014which way will you splay?\n When you spell words each turn in Paperback Adventures, you'll need to also choose which way to splay your word, so that only one edge of each card is showing except for the top card. The only card ability visible will be on the top card, and that's the ability you activate. Here's an example of how it works:\nWhen you splay left, you count all the icons on the left edge of each card. The top card is the last letter of the word.\nWhen you splay right you count all the icons on the right edge of each card. The top card is the first letter of the word.\nThe splay system forces you to make tough choices\u2014do you want more blocks or more hits this turn? Or maybe which card is your top card matters most. To make that decision even tougher (and to keep every battle moving), the top card also gets fatigued for the rest of the battle. You'll get it back for the next enemy, though!\nHex and boon counters allow protagonists and enemies to support a wide range of playstyles without adding too many rules and overhead for players to track. Hex counters affect the character they are on negatively, while boon counters affect the character they are on positively. So these counters are always contextual--one enemy's hex counters might cause accelerating damage, while another enemy's hex counters limit your card draw.\nHere is a link to the current working rulebook for Paperback Adventures\nWe know that some players will want a tougher challenge, especially after completing a few runs. So we\u2019ll be including a system called Plot Twists.\nEvery Plot Twist comes with two distinct challenges, one on top and one on bottom, for the entirety of your run. Here is one condition card unlocked earlier in the campaign:\nEach challenge has a difficulty number assigned to it, with \u201c1\u201d being the lowest difficulty. Before starting a run, you can choose an overall challenge level for your run and then mix and match challenges from the various Plot Twists until the collective difficulty numbers add up to your desired challenge level. This way, you can experience brand new challenge combinations while also making the game better fit your experience and skill level.\nYou can splay the Plot Twists underneath your player tray, showing only the new rules from your chosen challenges so that you can quickly reference them. Those rules will stay the same throughout your run.\nWhile Paperback Adventures was designed from the start as a solo experience, we also knew that people would enjoy playing it with others. We\u2019ve been playtesting and working behind the scenes to bring some two player variants to the table that not only open up a seat for an additional player but also open up new ways to approach the game.\nTwo-Headed Giant\nThis cooperative mode really leans into the idea of co-op play. The two players must work in tandem using the same character, deck, and token tracker. But here\u2019s the kicker: you split your starting items and McGuffins between the two of you. Additionally, you alternate taking turns, which means your items and McGuffins are only available half the time. Anytime you gain an item or McGuffin, you both gain one!\nA lot of the fun in this variant comes from working together to find the best words and setting each other up for big turns. Don\u2019t just take our word for it though; check out this gameplay video where we show off the mode over a couple different enemy fights.\nDouble Trouble\nIn the Double Trouble mode, each player has their own character to play! They team up against a pair of enemies, but they must coordinate their attacks and share certain resources\u2014like the wild card!  (To make this possible, one enemy uses the tray from the unused character.)\n Paperback Playthrough with Aaron of GameEnthus and designer Skye Larsen\nPlaythrough from a Live Stream with Ruel Gaviola on Tabletop Tonight\nBook 2 Gameplay from a Live Stream with Richmond of BramBeard Gaming\nJason Perez with One Stop Co-op Shop\nYou won't get too far in a roguelike without sweet loot. Reward cards for each enemy will give you two options to choose from. You have to choose which set of loot is more important to keep progressing.\nItems provide powerful effects that can be used once per turn, but you'll need mana to activate most of them.  \nExamples of a McGuffin and item with completed art\nMcGuffins are always double-sided, and you'll get to choose which McGuffin will help you more. These powerups provide modest effects, but don't require mana for use. Find the right ones for some spectacular combos!\nEvery character letter card is also upgradeable. When a reward says you upgrade a card, flip the card over and put it back in its sleeve. Some card upgrades add extra icons to the card, while others improve or even alter the card ability.\n\n Shipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager after the campaign.  We ship customs friendly.\n Tim Fowers, co-designer, has piloted many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, and Paperback \n Skye Larsen, co-designer, has finally justified his Creative Writing degree (sort of)\n Jeff Krause, development, worked with Tim on Sabotage and Burgle Bros 2 \n Ryan Goldsberry, illustrator, helps bring all of Tim's games to life\n Noah Adelman, product design, has designed components and storage solutions for many successful games through his company Game Trayz\u2122\n We'd also like to thank Andrew Colin Beck for our logo design, Nate Stebbing for the animation work in our Kickstarter video, and Fernando Cunha for our gameplay animations on this page.\nWe will use a pledge manager to help our backers get their copy of Paperback Adventures as quickly as possible.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

The player places their resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve their goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.\nWith this new edition, we've added some new components to include some more difficult 3-star missions, some new spare rooms and resources, and made some tweaks to the rules & original components to improve clarity and gameplay.\nFor previous backers/customers who got the 1st edition, we have the option on this campaign to order the new components to add to your original game (Backer Level \"Maquis - New Content\").

This deck represents where the Milice patrols will occur during each day.\n\nThe player will choose a location to send their first worker and assign one of their pawns there. They then draw a patrol card, and place a Milice pawn if able. This continues until all of the available worker pawns and Milice pawns are placed. If the Milice find your worker during patrol, they will be arrested!\nYour diligent workers are then free to perform their duties, working toward your two goals.

We feel the second edition is the perfect opportunity to make these adjustments that we overlooked during the lead up to the first Kickstarter. After a lot of deliberation between Jake (the designer) and the rest of the SRG team, we've decided to adjust the day tracker on the main board. As the game morphed from Jake's original print & play (PnP) design to the first edition, the day tracker became a little confusing. In the PnP and first editions, the day track marks \"completed days\". This wasn't an issue for any of the original PnP missions, but some of the newer ones require you to complete objectives on or before certain days.

These three words best describe SK\u00dcLLBOX. Take on the role of sentient, punk skulls who need to use psychotic traps and weird contraband to keep wanna-be heroes from taking their stuff.\nSK\u00dcLLBOX is a punk rock-inspired 62-page zine that contains an entire rules-lite game designed to bring fun and absurd stories to your table. It has a unique engine at its core that can be learned in just a couple of minutes, requires only six-sided dice, and is designed to be played as a fun one-shot or a short yet absurd campaign.\nFor those afraid of a Kickstarter who\u2019ll never deliver, fear no more! SK\u00dcLLBOX is already written, all the art is done, and the layout is well underway. Once this campaign ends, it\u2019ll only be a matter of ironing out some bugs, getting the zines printed, and shipping them out!\nSK\u00dcLLBOX uses a custom-made system with only three abilities: COOL, MOSH, and WEIRD. A skull rolls a number of d6 equal to their ability, succeeding if at least one die is a 5 or higher. Each skull also has its own BOX \u2014 a unique, strange apparatus that gives the skull weird powers to use to bash or ensorcell raiders. There are six total, from the fire-starting Tinderbox to the rockstar Bonebox Musician!\nA session of SK\u00dcLLBOX includes three or more raids. These are organized by the legendary musician-turned-tyrant, Saint-Queen Sophronia. Under her employ are screamo berserkers, warlocks who sold their soul to the ESTABLISHMENT, cubed slimes who don\u2019t know any better, and things so terrifyingly powerful that the skulls will need more than just magyk boxes to bring them down.\nThat\u2019s where the traps come in. SK\u00dcLLBOX features 8 psychotic and weird traps that skulls can build to keep raiders out. Each trap comes with its own story prompt \u2014 a short explanation of a scene that has to be roleplayed out in order for the trap to be used. In SK\u00dcLLBOX you\u2019ll be figuring out the recipe needed to summon C\u2019thulu\u2019s own knife-wielding tentacles while persuading starved cannibals to take their revenge on the heroes that exiled them. And if you roll bonus successes when setting a trap up, you can spend them on bizarre modifications for your delectable torture devices.\nNo skull should go into battle with only a couple of advantages. Here are some more chaotic toys that you\u2019ll be deploying in the fight against good:\nFields of magyk coffee-shrooms; a perfect boost for when things get dangerous!\n  Weaponized contraband that can be found only on the black market.\n  The legendary GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORD, which doubles as a lifeline and your secret weapon!\n This 40-page zine has the following specifications, for your viewing pleasure:\n45+ unique pieces of art, all by the visionary Gospo\n  Perfect binding to lay flat our gorgeous spread pages\n  6 unique boxes for skulls to play as\n  8 psychotic traps for skulls to build\n  11 unique raiders, from the shroom-awakened psionic Lurk to the majestic and regal Irish Elk\n  4 pieces of magical contraband for the skulls to use\n  Lore fit for insane cartoons\n Every single piece of art in SK\u00dcLLBOX is drawn by the same visionary: GOSPO. The whacky-yet-punk skulls were designed for his son, as were the raiders facing off against them. His black and white illustrations shaped not only the foundation of SK\u00dcLLBOX, but defined its flavor, atmosphere, and game mechanics too.\nWe also created a Spotify Playlist so that you can get the vibe of the SK\u00dcLLBOX world.\n  Either use the link above or open the app on your smartphone, click search and scan this:\nIf you want to learn more about what we\u2019ll be doing, make sure to follow our social media links below:\nDiscord\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nReddit\nWebsite\nSHIPPING RATES\nApproximated estimates\nUnited States - $7\nEU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden) - $19\nNorway/Switzerland - $34\nCanada - $12\nAUS - $13\nNew Zealand - $14\nChina/Macao/Hong Kong - $12\nRest of Asia (Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam) - $20\n\nDISTRIBUTION \nHere's the order of events after we fund.\n+ Send the files to the printer.\n+ Get back our proof.\n+ IF everything checks out, we begin the printing process!

Queercore gets a down-to-details firsthand account of the movement explored through the people that lived it\u2014from punk's early queer elements, to the moments Toronto kids decided they needed to create a scene that didn\u2019t exist, to the infiltration of the mainstream by Pansy Division, and the emergence of riot grrrl as a sister movement\u2014as well as the clothes, zines, art, film, and music that made this movement an exciting in-your-face middle finger to complacent gay and straight society.

The whole book works like a giant jigsaw puzzle that never offers a final or complete picture but at least scatters the  pieces around to allow the reader to assemble some truly exciting scenarios. This is very possibly the best and only way that subcultural histories should emerge\u2014namely as incomplete and incoherent, as a magnificent poly vocal roar, as sound, fury, rebel yells and screams. This does not just capture queer punk, it is queer punk.\u201d \u2014Jack Halberstam, author of The Queer Art of Failure and In A Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives\n\u201cQueercore: How To Punk a Revolution delivers a deeply invested history of the forgotten roots of queercore. While to some, punk was inherently gay as fuck\u2014the actual queer revolution came few and  far between bands, scenes, and eras whose intersections were small, yet wildly significant. With voices ranging from Penny Arcade to Brontez Purnell, we hear a vast history from around the globe; echoing everything queer, dirty, and true.\u201d \u2014Cristy C. Road, frontwoman of Choked Up and author of Spit and Passion and Next World Tarot\n\u201cQueercore is the unrelenting polyrhythm of a culture, chanted in varied waves of sensation, by some of its most essential voices. Zigzagging through generations of nostalgia and controversy faster than their own power chords, this is not just a record of queercore (the movement), but a theoretical discussion about the  intersectional ideology of \u2018Queer,\u2019 as well as \u2018Punk\u2019 itself. Reading\u2014not watching or listening to\u2014this book gave me the absolutely necessary opportunity to reinvigorate my own punk, both as performance art and radical protest. This unflinching oral history of how a subculture begins and survives, tenaciously layered in the present, is a bridge over the gap, that I for one, have been waiting for.\u201d \u2014JD Samson, musician, producer, songwriter and DJ (Le Tigre/MEN)\n\nSample writing from G.B. Jones\n\"We really started in the anarchist community. We didn\u2019t really start in the gay community. We were trading with anarchist zines, and meeting anarchists from the States, and that was really our milieu\u2014the punk scene, the post-punk scene, experimental filmmakers and artists. So we met all these people when we were touring and we\u2019d show our films, and that\u2019s how it started spreading. We\u2019d take the zines with us when we traveled; we were kind of like this traveling circus, y\u2019know\u2014here\u2019s the band!, and here\u2019s the zine!, and here\u2019s the movies! It was very much like the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. And I think that\u2019s how it spread so quickly, because people were encountering it so many different levels.\"\nJust a few images* from the book\n*Images will be black and white\nAbout the Contributors\nLiam Warfield is a writer, editor, and educator living in Chicago.\nWalter Crasshole is a journalist in Berlin and English-language editor for the city's 40-year running queer magazine Siegess\u00e4ule.

Your patrons are rowdy  and rude, but they are the only ones around. Your goal is to fill your inn with enough patrons to keep the debt collectors at bay, but to do so  you must manage some painfully particular, peculiar patrons.\nIn The Ugly Gryphon Inn, you\u2019ll be tasked with managing your patrons\u2019 various needs to ensure they all get a good night\u2019s rest. Each turn, you\u2019ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something\u2019s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you\u2019ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there\u2019s no trouble. There\u2019s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!\nA quick note on our Simply Solo line\nWe kicked off our Simply Solo line in May of 2020 with Food Chain Island. Ugly Gryphon Inn is the second in the series. Each game is designed by Scott Almes and focuses on games that are one player only, light on rules and big on replayability. \nAnd now, a look at Ugly Gryphon Inn\nThe Ugly Gryphon Inn offers the kinds of brain-stretching puzzle that Scott Almes brought to our first Simply Solo title, Food Chain Island. While they\u2019re both easy to dive into and endlessly replayable, here the focus is on managing each patron\u2019s needs while preparing for the next round of requests. \nCarefully booking your guests in the right order is key to success, as each patron\u2019s frustrations can have consequences for the sleepers below them. All the while, though, you\u2019ll have to expect the unexpected to make sure each new guest is comfortable. With a horde of disgruntled customers on their way, you\u2019ll have to be clever to run The Ugly Gryphon Inn.\n\nSimply shuffle the deck of patron cards and place them in a face-down stack in front of you. Draw 4 cards and arrange them in a face-up row in front of you. These patrons are considered to be at the bar.\nThe game takes place in a series of turns until you\u2019ve played all the cards from the deck and your hand. Each turn has the following flow:\nPhase I: Patron goes to sleep\nOne of the patrons at the bar are ready for bed. Select a card from the bar area and place it at the top of the inn. The inn is a single vertical line of cards, with each card being a floor.\nI choose to move the Sleepy Summoner into the Inn.\nCheck Rooms for Phase I irks. \nStarting with the Patron you just placed, you check each patron card from top to bottom. You check the statement on their card to see what will irk them and cause them to leave. If the conditions are met, then apply the effects on their card. \n\nPhase II: New Patron(s) Arrives\nAdds one more patron to the bar until you have 4. If there are no cards left in the draw deck, then this is the final round.\nI draw the Charitable Giant and add it to the Bar.\nCheck for Quirks\nEvaluate the quirk icons in the bar. If there are 3 or more of the same type of quirk, then you irk all the Inn patrons that are sensitive to that bad effect! \nIn the Bar there are 3 Fighting icons, which means anyone in the Inn that is irked by Fighting will trigger their effect.\nSince the Sleepy Summoner is not irked by fighting, her effect does not trigger. She'll stay in the Inn!\nGame End\nAfter you\u2019ve run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. If you have 7 or more patrons in the inn - you\u2019ve won! If you have less than 7 or if at any point 8 patrons are in the discard pile, then you have lost the game.\n\nTry the game yourself! Download the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com:\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/ugly-gryphon-inn-kickstarter-preview\n\nAnd Purple Moose Plays did a full playthrough video. Check it out below:\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Ugly Gryphon Inn: More Patrons.\n\nYou\u2019ve finally cleared out the bar and sent everyone off to bed...but what\u2019s that sound? A knock at the door, at this hour? Why, it\u2019s just what you need: MORE patrons jostling for a spot at your inn! It\u2019s gonna be a long night...\nThese expansion cards are shuffled into the starting deck, adding to the available Patrons found in the base game. You\u2019ll need to manage these new needy customers more carefully, as your inn will require one more contented patron to be considered successful.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign. \n\n\nAs you may have noticed, we have a second expansion available! Here's a little more info on Ugly Gryphon Inn: Local Dragons:\n\nYou\u2019ve handled plenty of rowdy customers in your time, from monks and mages to giants and goblins, but there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve never faced: the mighty Dragon. Now your humble inn has drawn the attention of an ancient wyrm. Pay close attention to who leaves and who stays: if your departing Patrons irritate the lurking Dragon, all your hard work is sure to go up in flames!\n\n\nEach game using the Local Dragons expansion adds 1 of 3 possible Dragons to your Inn. As Patrons leave, check their symbols to see whether they provoke the Dragon. If the Dragon is sufficiently provoked -- two matching symbols accumulated -- you\u2019ll lose the game.\nYou may have also noticed a new Food Chain Island expansion, Lost Beasts. This is the next in our line of expansions and is due to release in the next month or so here. It'll be initially available on our site for sale in small numbers, but if you are a Food Chain Island fan and want to combine it with your Kickstarter rewards to save a few dollars, we made a reward level here.  \nWe are waiting to see if Kickstarter approves any on-site add-ons for this campaign (it's still in a beta / invite only process), for the time being if you want to add more wallet games from our library (and we have a whole bunch!), we will do that in a different way.\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"1220impatient\" to get 15% off of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"1220international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nScott Almes is best known for the Tiny Epic series by Gamelyn Games. He's gone even bigger with Heroes of Land, Air and Sea and with our Simply Solo line he's going even smaller. We first met in 2012 when Scott designed a game for our Storyteller Cards, and in 2020 we released Food Chain Island. Looking forward to more games in the Simply Solo line (and we might even tease the next one here in the updates).\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every  month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level  above.)\n\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations  of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge until Feb 2021.\n\nThen, we are starting up a new year long game in March. It's called Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection, you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your adventures.\n\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\n\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).  The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Dragons expansion here).\n\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Ugly Gryphon Inn!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Your objective as a deep-sea researcher is to guide your sub through fathoms of water, descending to the Trench floor, to find mysterious and amazing sea creatures.\nWill you become a renowned research scientist, or will you fall victim to the creatures that lurk beneath the surface?\nINTRODUCTION\nThe goal of The Mariana Trench is to score the most research points by researching deep-sea creatures and the floor of the trench. The game is played in alternating turns until your submarines run out of oxygen. \nMOVEMENT\nMovement from one card to the next represents a distance of 1000 Fathoms. At launch your sub can move up to 2000 fathoms (2 cards) on your turn. \nCOLLECTING RESEARCH AND UPGRADES\nWhen researching the water column, reveal the (research) card next to your sub. Each card displays a deep-sea creature and a submarine upgrade. \nYou may:\n\u2022 Collect the deep-sea creature, or\n\u2022 Upgrade your Submarine\nIf you do not collect the creature or upgrade your sub then leave the card face-up, where either player may collect it on a future turn.\nIf you have hold capacity you may tuck the research card under your sub (to the right), so that the class and size of the creature shows.\nIf you do not collect the sea creature then you can upgrade your sub. Tuck the card under your sub (to the left) so that the upgrade is showing. You cannot take the same upgrade twice.\nYour sub starts with a small hold, which can carry one small creature. To collect large creatures you must upgrade your hold first.  \n\nTHE TRENCH FLOOR\nEach time your sub reaches the trench floor you can conduct valuable scientific research. Take 1 research token from the supply and place it on your submarine. Your sub can only carry one research token at a time. The token is offloaded as soon as you surface beside the research vessel.  Research tokens are worth 2RP at the end of the game.\nRETURNING TO THE RESEARCH SHIP\nWhen your sub surfaces, all the creatures and tokens are offloaded to the research vessel. At the end of the game points are scored for different sets of creatures\nAnd there is more\u2026.\nOK, so we have the game, the expansion, and the play mat, we have a few awesome stretch goals to come too\u2026. But what else?\nOver the past three years I have been hugely fortunate to work in the board game industry, I\u2019ve had games published, I\u2019ve worked as an illustrator and designer on many fantastic and exciting games. \nBut now is the time, the time for me to develop the games I\u2019d like to play, the games I think you would like, games I'm passionate about which I'm itching to throw my creativity and time into. By backing this project, you are giving me the opportunity to exclusively make the absolute best games I can for you.\nWith two more amazing games in the pipeline for next year, I am massively excited for the future, I've got some amazing stuff to share. So, it\u2019s not all about buying this game, it\u2019s about investing in creative freedom and being part of an exciting journey and some amazing new games.\nTris Rossin.\nOwner of Bright Light Games.\n The cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended in the pledge manager.

Each of you has chosen a unique method of dealing with a particularly nasty bit of chaos that has been summoned, and the friendly wager at hand will be won by the player whose approach proves most effective.  \nThe Science and S\u00e9ance Society offers totally asymmetric gameplay in a tight, two player game.

We are only printing copies for the campaign and do not intend to sell it widely afterwards.\n\u00b7 The Science and S\u00e9ance Society is thoroughly developed. It has been rules tested and played at events like Unpub and regular NYC playtest events.\n\u00b7 The Science and S\u00e9ance Society is fun! If you like two player games, or asymmetric games, or just love clever card and dice games, The Science and S\u00e9ance Society belongs on your shelf.\n\u00b7 The Science and S\u00e9ance Society will not exist without this campaign. Your support means it, and future games from us, actually exist.\n\u00b7 The money earned is being spent responsibly to pay for manufacturing and Kickstarter fees. Any profit beyond that goes toward covering the cost of our labor as all other parties involved in the creation of this project have already been paid.\n\u00b7 Note: The number of pledges for this campaign are unlimited. However, since we are a small two-person studio doing fulfillment ourselves, we are capping each pledge level so that we can provide accurate and conservative delivery times. As one pledge level fills up, we will open a new one. These pledge levels are IDENTICAL other than which batch they will be shipped in. \nWe at New Mill Industries will not be using Stretch Goals and our reasoning is simple.\nWe design each game holistically. Every game we offer you is feature complete and needs no additional content to feel that way. Our goal is to provide a product with great components, clean design, thoroughly tested mechanisms, and the best possible price. Stretch Goals are often antithetical to this goal. They can indicate a game that purposefully had content removed just to create Stretch Goals or it creates additional design and testing overhead that delays the final product from getting to you, the backer.While we would love to offer stretch goals that upgrade component quality for everyone, the scale at which we intend to print and the print-on-demand model makes these types of goals not feasible. \nNew Mill Industries is a passion project for us, not our career. We are a two-person design studio and independent publisher who makes games because we love making games.\n\n In the United States, we will be sending the games in USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Small Boxes. They fit like a glove. We're charging $8 for shipping up-front and hoping that USPS doesn't change its rates over the next month.  We're estimating shipping to be $20 for the 5-pack level. \nFor Canadian and other international backers, we're setting the shipping cost to $20 and $25 respectively. We'll be using First Class mail rather than Priority Mail, so they may take a bit longer to get to you, but Priority gets extremely expensive for international shipments. We're planning on sending them as \"gift\" to avoid extra duties and import fees. As the rewards are technically not purchases from a store, we feel pretty good that we'd be in the clear here. We'll even gift-wrap them. The 5-pack level will also be available for all non-US countries at $30.\n\n We plan on printing only a few hundred games, which means we do not benefit from economies of scale, cannot partner with international distributors, and cannot assume the costs if things go wrong for international backers. We will also be hand-assembling your games so they will not be shrink-wrapped. While we would love to say that this is exclusively because it is more environmentally friendly, it also just isn't feasible for a company of our size.\nNew Mill Industries will be producing small print runs of games that feature clean design and quirky themes without all of the excesses of the modern board game publishing industry.\nDaniel Newman is the designer of Dead Man's Cabal, Ahead in the Clouds, Feat On The Ground, and Rolled West. Daniel worked as an architectural model maker for a while but has been doing the stay-at-home dad thing for the last couple of years, as well as helping out with the NYC Playtest group. Daniel does the graphic design and pre-production work for New Mill Industries.\nThe self-proclaimed Purple People Meeter of the Warm Fuzzies Tribe, Tony Miller is the designer of Kabuto Sumo and one half of the design team of Fire in the Library.

It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge. It will ask you when checking out if you would like to add any items. Note: This is all new, so we're really just trying it for the first time. \nAgropolis Button (Pinback)\nAgropolis Button (Snapback)\nAn additional copy of Agropolis\nThe Button Shy Game Haul Bag\nA quick description of each is below.\nIf you want to add more wallet games from our library (and we have a whole bunch!), we will do that in a different way. \nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\n US Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0920impatient\" to get 15% off   of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon  as  everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will also  receive free shipping.\n US Backers only - to order games that ship along with your rewards - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0920us\" to get free shipping   on your extra games. These games will all ship together with your  Kickstarter rewards.\n International Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0920international\" to get free  shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3  wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you  order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with  your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

It is a card game for 2-5 players and takes around 20 minutes to play (30 minutes if you're new!). You can find more information on our BGG site.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the cuteness of the plants - get ready for the countless strategies that await you on Plantopia. The game is designed by internationally acclaimed board game designer Daryl Chow (Overbooked, The Artemis Project, Remember Our Trip, Ramen Ink etc), whose designs revolve around a framework of simple rules to bring you a wealth of interesting choices.   \nThe Garden City Seed Pack is only in bloom for these 25 days, and will never be in season again! Not even in your Flower Leaf Garden Stores! \nPlantopia is designed with both the casual gamer and hardcore strategist in mind. The simple and intuitive rules make it accessible for all, and friends and families will have a fun and fruitful time in Plantopia. Its fast playing time and high gardener count also makes it a great game to bring to your friends' greenhouses.\nBut at its core, it is a tableau-building and hand-management game where you will have to synergize the abilities of all your plants to do well. Kind of like a much cuter Race for the Galaxy with lots more plants!\nThe game is designed to have little to no downtime, yet the unique Weather mechanic brings players together - ignore rival gardens at your folly! You'll need to keep an eye on your fellow gardeners to claim the title of Champion Gardener for yourself.\nCapitalize upon the immediate powers of the Baby Plants while harnessing the scoring combos of the Treevolved Plants. Will you go for the fast-growing Flowers, the card-drawing Cacti, or the weather-controlling Trees? Or a combination of all of the above?

Your goal is to influence the wildlife - and arrange their meals - so there is only one animal left!\nFood Chain Island is the next Button Shy Wallet Game, and the first in what we are calling our simply solo series. These are games that are one player only, light on rules, and big on replayability.  \nLet's get into what makes Food Chain Island so awesome!\nStart by shuffling the cards and making a 4X4 grid island of animals with the sea animals off to the side.  \nOn a turn, you must move one land animal one space in one of the four cardinal directions so it\u2019s placed over another animal that is 1-3 numbers lower in value. In this way, you can move the \u20188\u2019 animal over a 7, 6 or 5. \nWhen you do this, place the card on top of the lower card. This how an animal eats another animal.\nWhen cards are stacked on one another, they are considered to be the number on the top. The stack of cards now moves as one.\nWhen you move a card to eat another, you activate the ability on the card that just ate another. This special effect is mandatory and must be applied. In some cases, the ability will benefit you, and in others it will make the game harder.\nThe sea animals are there to help you out. At any time you may discard a sea animal and perform its special ability. Once a sea animal is used, it is discarded. \nThe game ends when only one animal remains or if you are unable to eat an adjacent animal. \nIf you only have one animal left, congratulations! You are an Ecological Expert.\nIf you have two animals left, nice job! You are an Accidental Matchmaker.\nIf you have three animals left, you just made it through! You are still an Island Intern. \nOtherwise, if you have 4+ animals, you have lost the game and need to keep trying.\nFurther Challenges\nTo make the game more difficult, randomly remove one or both of the sea animals. In addition, you can explore these alternate card layouts.\nYou can print and play the game today! The black and white version, along with unedited prototype rules is available at PNP Arcade.\nLINK: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/food-chain-island-kickstarter-preview\nFor a complete playthrough, check out Matt Upton's video below: \nMore to come as we update this image. :)\nAlso available here is Food Chain Island: Tough Skies, a three card expansion that will make your games just a little more challenging. At the beginning of the game, shuffle and place one card face-up into the play area. Do not use the others. During the game, you must activate, resolve and discard the air animal. The air animal must be resolved before the end of the game. For an additional challenge, use 2 or all 3 air animals.\n\n...\n-What's Eric Playing\nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2020/05/25/food-chain-island/\n-Hey Meepling\nFULL REVIEW: http://meepling.com/2020/05/22/food-chain-island-review-eat-your-way-to-the-top/\n-The Cardboard Hoard\nFULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2020/5/25/the-cardboard-hoard-initial-thoughts-on-food-chain-island\n-Boards and Bees\nFULL REVIEW: https://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/0961/\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Friendly Waters, a 3 card expansion of additional sea animals to help you along the way. You can shuffle these in with the sea animals in the base game, then draw 2 for a normal difficulty, and draw less for an additional challenge.\nWe have a whole bunch of games in our library.\nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of two things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0520impatient\" to get 15% off of your order.

These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nA few notable games available in our library are Tussie Mussie, Sprawlopolis and Circle The Wagons.\nScott Almes is best known for the Tiny Epic series by Gamelyn Games. He's gone even bigger with Heroes of Land, Air and Sea and this time he's going even smaller. We first met in 2012 when Scott designed a game for our Storyteller Cards, and we've been looking for a chance to work together since.\nAnnie Wilkinson was born in Saskatchewan, Canada in 1966 to a family that encouraged artistic pursuits of all kinds -  including writing, drawing, photography and  music. This is our first time working together and it was a wonderful experience. I couldn't imagine a more perfect style for the game. More of Annie's work can be seen at http://www.advocate-art.com/annie-wilkinson\nGraphic Design by Jason Greeno\nRules Editing by Michael Lee\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects).\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's launching very soon, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. We have a Sprawlopolis expansion coming in the next few months, and we're working on many more.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the solo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Food Chain Island!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

We've also upped our staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our staff is also minimized at this time, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

These mercenaries and peddlers of rodent disposal now stand on the precipice of fame and glory, all they have to do is their job, right?\nOBJECTIVE\nThe Ratcatchers objective: To rid the city of as many rats as possible on their way to gathering as much Magical Cheese as possible.\nWIN - The RATCATCHER is victorious if you achieve any one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Ratcatcher collects 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher slays the Nemesis Rat\nLOSE - The Ratcatcher is defeated if the Rats achieve one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Rats consume 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher is reduced to 0 wounds\n\nThe Ratcatcher (Player) Turn: \nDuring your Ratcatchers turn, they\u2019re seeking to vanquish rats & gather Magical Cheese. This can be done using the various skills and actions listed on the Character Board.   \nMagic Cheese Tokens\nUnlock/Upgrade:\nOnce the Ratcatcher can successfully gather some Magical Cheese then the fun of upgrading and customising your Ratcatcher can begin.  \nBy assigning a Magic Cheese you may unlock a chosen ability. Once active place the maximum number of the relevant tokens on the Character Board.\n The Rats (AI) Turn: \nDependent on the type of Rat, the rats will either seek out the Magical Cheese or attack the Ratcatcher. White rats as the most numerous, and though simple in appearance their strength becomes apparent when they swarm towards pieces of cheese. Brown rats are vicious and ill tempered, set on attacking any who come close these rodents must be disposed of carefully. Black rats, are the breeders and with them comes even more rats. Each time a black rat is placed, additional rats are immediately placed. In addition to that each spawn phase Black rats count as a Spawn Point for even more rats! \nPeculiar Rats: \nThe Magic Cheese can have wonderful and miraculous effects, this effect is not limited to humanity only. The rats are eating the cheese and it has had some peculiar effects on them.\nThe Peculiar rats imbue the power of the magic cheese forming a nasty mini boss style adversary that will complicate the Ratcatcher's quest but also offers a variety of tempting rewards should the Ratcatcher be bold enough to catch one. \nNemesis Rats:\nNemesis Rats are true horrors of their species. The Magical Cheese has twisted their mind and body, into something spawned from the most terrible of nightmares. As catalysts of the Rat infection, destroying them is the of the utmost importance and seems the only logical path to freeing the kingdom.\nEach Nemesis on top of having their own unique abilities, also has a varied Rat tracker. As the Rats collect Magic Cheese, this tracker will gain momentum, modifying the common rats, spawning Peculair rats and triggering the spawning of the Nemesis Rat. This makes each variant Nemesis a unique challenge.  \nExpanding the Township:  \nTownship Cards - Tarot Sized Cards\nThe sprawling streets of Brie are the battle zone of The Ratcatcher. Filled with twists and turns it will require a keen eye to find the cheese & tactical choices to stay a head of the rat horde.  \nIf there are fewer than two Magic Cheese tokens in the city, then a mandatory Explore Action is undertaken. This will expand the city using additional township cards. Each new Township card will also add more cheese, opportunities to refill/recuperate & of course, more rats. \n\n WHY PLEDGE NOW:\nAs with most projects using crowdfunding, The Ratcatcher solo adventure board game will not possible to publish without the financial commitment of backers. There are not only many costs to cover, but also the unpredictability of the market as well as gauging demand are all reasons Platypus Industries has come seeking funding via Kickstarter.\nSubsidised shipping\nContribute the games content \nUnlock amazing via stretch goals such as extra content and quality upgrades for everyone!\nAllow the Ratcatcher product line to get a strong start. There are plenty of plans for continued support & expansions, but only if the core set is funded.\nRetailer Only\n\nKeep track of the Ratcatcher's progress using Kicktraq\nAussie games design company set on creating top quality products that are unique, interesting & challenging.  \nThis is the first project to be launched by the company, but not our first game & definitely not our last. \nMatthew Aslin is the one-man show behind The Ratcatcher, Solo Adventure. He dwells in Melbourne, this is the first solo project but as with Platypus Industries it's unlikely to be his last.\n\nBusiness Partners.\nWe are very lucky to be pairing with some amazing and very experienced companies to help us deliver our product in a way that is both high quality, swift & professional. \nFulfilment: QML, Aetherworks, Logistico & VFI \nManufacturing: HJM (China)\nPledge Manager:  \nFAQ - Gameplay: \n Solo mode only: Yes, that's right. This game is for one player only. During this Kickstarter campaign there are no plans for any changes regarding this matter. Although that is not to say future expansions will adhere to this ethos.\n Alternative Languages Rules:  Currently we have a Spanish fan made rulebook. At his time I am open to establishing French & German fan based rulebooks at this stage. These will be community based rulebooks. Dependent on demand we may seek professional translation to be available with the games commercial release. \nCOMMUNITY TRANSLATIONS\n ITALIAN: A small group of Italian backers have started working on translation of the rulebook. If you're keen on helping out, head over to the BGG forum: ITALIAN TRANSLATION\n   FRENCH: It looks like there may be a solution for a French translation in the near future but in the mean time, French fans, can we get a forum going for this?  FRENCH TRANSLATION\n   GERMAN: A small group of German backers have started working on translation of the rulebook. If you're keen on helping out, head over to the BGG forum: GERMAN TRANSLATION\n  FAQ - Pledging:\n Late Pledges: We will be partnering with Gamefound to assist with late Pledges, note that Late/Pledges & pre-orders will NOT have subsided shipping included. By backing at any level you will qualify for Free/subsided shipping should you choose to upgrade your pledge during the pledge manager.\n Stretch Goals: All Stretch goals unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign will be included FREE of charge in every copy of The Ratcatcher. Also where applicable, stretch goals will also be added to the Print and Play pledge level.  \n Multiple copies of the game: There are two options for the purchase of multiple copies, either by pledging at any level a backer will have access to the post campaign Pledge Manager (Gamefound.com), this will allow the backer to add additional copies of the game, shipping will be calculated & charged as a bundle (so you should save a bit of money). Alternatively if you have a few fellow gamers there is the Horde pledge, which will give you a discount as well as discount shipping. Just because it's a solo game dosen't mean we can be social ;) \nFAQ - Shipping:\n What is Subsidised shipping?: This is me covering a portion of the total shipping costs. Platypus Industries will pay $10 AUD of the total shipping cost. This is a little thank you for supporting us during the Kickstarter campaign. \n Shipping black zones: Sadly as much as it pains us to to say. There are certain locations around the world that we will NOT be able to deliver our product. We are sorry if this causes any inconvenience, but we encourage all affected to contact their local FLGS as they may find Distribution/alternative routes to obtain copies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorld economics: firstly, we are not economists. Global economics are alway fluctuating and global event particularly around the global pandemic are making it extremely difficult to predict the condition of the market short or long term. We are well aware of this and will endeavour to work through and communicate any events or situations that effect the delivery of this game. \n\nManufacturing: Communication and detailed specification have been provided to a handful of manufacturers as to get a comprehensive quote and product outline. Discussion regarding samples and proofing are already underway. We are confident moving forward into the manufacturing process for this product. \n\nShipping/fulfilment: One of the most unpredictable facets of Kickstarter delivery. We will endeavour to keep everything manageable but there are plenty of elements that will be out of our control.

On the third time, the game begins.\nPlayers shoot tokens from their camp into their opponent\u2019s camp. Tokens are shot by pulling them against the bungee cord and releasing. Only one token may be shot by each player at a time.\nThe round ends once one player clears all tokens from their side of the board. The gate must be entirely clear (no token may be halfway through the gate).\nRead The Rules\nClick here to view a PDF of the current draft of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare rules!\nIn the times before The Divide, the inhabitants of The Veiled Forest existed harmoniously. The seasons came and went each year, and there was peace among all creatures that made these woodlands their home.\nOne morning, at the very edge of the winter solstice's arrival, all of this changed.\nAs the sun began to shed its light on the forest, the animals living within it stirred and noticed a peculiar change to their home.\nWhere there was once a small grove of trees in the middle of The Veiled Forest, there now was a massive clearing - a meadow that stretched a mile long, causing a dramatic break in the thick foliage that covered the ground just hours earlier. In the center of this meadow stood a sprawling structure: a mysterious wall separating what was now the two sides of The Veiled Forest. And in the middle of the wall stood a lone gate.\nUnable to resist exploring this strange new addition to the land, the creatures stepped through the gate and were immediately met with a blast of ice cold air all around - a much harsher environment from the gentle breeze that they'd just left on the other side.\nUpon closer inspection, the creatures came to realize that on one side of the wall, The Veiled Forest was still experiencing the season of autumn - while on the other side, winter had already permeated the landscape.\nBefore they could make sense of this jarring new reality, the creatures heard movement coming toward them, from each of the two sides of The Veiled Forest. The sounds of rustling trees and the ground being trampled beneath countless animals became louder and louder. Then, out of each side of the woods and into the meadow burst two armies - each army made up of the creatures that resided in that half of the forest when the wall arrived.\nThese two factions hurtled toward the center of the wall, seemingly being drawn to it by a force outside of themselves. It was clear that each faction had simply one goal: to pass through the gate.\nThe cause of this odd, overnight transformation - now called The Divide - is unknown. Perhaps some answers will be uncovered by the inhabitants of the woodland one day. Until then, each year marking the day of The Divide, the two factions of creatures assemble in the center of The Veiled Forest. They continue to do so to battle for the chance to pass through the gate and overtake the opposing faction, in the hopes that by doing so the seasons - and their home - will return to as they once were. \nThey may be adorable, but don't let their cuddly appearance fool you.\nWhile they don't fall under any particular class or hero designation, Rabbits make up the majority of creatures in most battles and, depending on your playing style, can pack a mighty punch.\nLarger than any other hero, the Brute class is determined to use its size to its advantage.\nEasily send opposing forces back through to their camp in any head on collision - but be warned, fitting through the gate doesn't come as easily to these heroes.\nSmaller than all other heroes, the Stealth class is capable of easily maneuvering past foes and traveling to the opponent's camp without getting caught up in the gate.\nBe careful not to underestimate the importance of agility in this battle.\nWith so much action taking place at the gate, the Aerial class has a different plan of attack...\nWhy go through the gate when you can soar over it?\nThe only class that takes the field is Rabbits. Classic Mode is a perfect introduction to Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, and can be enjoyed by beginners, purists, and seasoned players alike.\nIn between rounds, Rabbit tokens are returned to their camps, and the next round begins. The game ends once a player wins 2 rounds.\nPlayers pledge their allegiance to either the Autumn or Winter faction.\nEach player selects one Hero class from their faction to use for the first round. Once both players have chosen their first Heroes, players reveal their selections and place the designated number of Rabbit tokens and Hero tokens in their camp.\nIn between rounds, all tokens are cleared from the board. Each player selects a new, previously unused Hero class from their faction to use before the round begins. Players reveal their new hero selections, and place the designated number of tokens in their camp before the next round begins.\nLaunching each class of Heroes and Rabbits is simple and can be picked up by anyone in seconds. All tokens may only be launched using the bungee in each camp. \nSettling into your preferred style and becoming familiar with the nuances of that method may take time, but the incremental improvements players will achieve with practice will result in a noticeable edge over less experienced opponents. \nThere's simply one edition of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare. \nEach copy will include:\n1 x Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare Game Board\n16 x Rabbit tokens\n4 x Brute tokens\n16 x Stealth tokens\n8 x Aerial tokens\n6 x Hero Cards\n1 x Canvas Storage Bag (For Components)\nStretch Goals\nWe want to be clear that our highest priority is to make and ship the highest quality version of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare within our estimated timeline. Therefore, we are focusing all of our efforts on achieving that goal and are limiting the stretch goals through the duration of this project.\nWe're happy to let you know that we're discussing the possibility of printing the game's logo along with Milo (our sugar glider hero from the Winter Faction) and Elyse (our bat hero from the Autumn Faction) on the canvas storage bag.\nOne of the most effective ways to get the word out is for as many backers as possible to reach out to your favorite writers, blogs, news sites, etc. that you go to for Kickstarter and/or gaming news.\nOnce you've reached out to your favorite site to let them know about Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, just go here and click \"I got the word out!\"\nThe second way we're asking you to help out in growing our community is by heading over to our Facebook announcement post for the game and clicking \"share\" (in addition to liking the post).

Due to challenges we faced at the time with finding a longterm viable manufacturing solution for the game, Storm the Gate only saw one production run. We quickly sold out of stock on our site, and Storm the Gate was no longer available.\nSince then, we\u2019ve received more emails than we can recall that have asked when Storm the Gate would be made again. It's taken years for us to find a team that we trusted with making the game at a level of quality that meets our incredibly high standards, and in the meantime, we've had a blast modifying the design and building out the new world that Woodland Warfare exists in.\nWith the launch of Storm the Gate: Woodland Warfare, we are beyond excited to finally be able to bring back a refined version, with more features and depth than the original.\nThe Antsy Army \ud83d\udc1c is a special group within the Antsy Labs community that has agreed to receive infrequent SMS messages and be the first in the world to find out when we launch a new product (including any further expansions to Fidget Factory). You'll also be included in special promotions and events that are exclusive to the Antsy Army.\nWhen the Antsy Army receives an SMS message, each \ud83d\udc1c will have the option to tap the included link and share the news on their social platforms.\nBy being a part of the Antsy Army, you're a part of a team that can make a huge impact in getting the word out and achieving something that can only be done by a larger community.\nEssentially:\n\ud83d\udc1c + \ud83c\udf43 = \ud83d\udeab\n\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c + \ud83c\udf43 = \ud83d\ude03\nWant to join the Antsy Army \ud83d\udc1c?\nJust text ANTSY to 900900\nTerms and Privacy Policy can be found here.\nYou may receive up to 4 msgs/mo.

When someone is about to go home, and I say \"How about a game of X before you leave?\" They smile and sit down. They can't resist because they know:\nThe game is fast (like 10 minutes to play)\nIt's quick to teach (like get started in 30 seconds)\nThere will be tension and exciting moments\nIt ends the night on a satisfying note of getting in one more quality game\nThis game series exists because I want there to be more games like that. We've focused on easy to teach before, but these are SUPER easy to teach.\nBut there is enough strategy that after the game your mind will wander back to a couple of key turns, and you'll wonder if you should have played just a little bit differently.\nAnd they have those turns...\nThat turn in GPS where the spinner lands on the spot that helps you but not your opponents. \nThat turn in Sequoia where you have to decide if it is worth fighting for the best spot or better to grab multiple spots where there is less competition. \nThat turn in Mountain Goats when you bump the leader off the mountain right before they win. \nAnd Holy Toledo, these games are just $15 each. \nThese games were designed for adult gamers, but they are playable with the whole family, including kids as young as 5 with some coaching.  They're also great options when your non-gamer friends ask to play a game, and you want something that you can teach and start playing quickly.\nIn Mountain Goats you work to move your goats to the top of 6 different mountains where they can score points as long as they stay there. You can share spaces with other goats on the way up, but there is only room for one goat at the top of each mountain. If someone else's goat moves to the mountain top, they will kick you off and you'll have to start your trek over.\nIt's a game about timing. You need to not just get to the top of the mountain, but get there when no one else is in position to knock you off.\nIt's a game about keeping your eye on your opponents. Maximizing your score, but also making sure you don't let anyone else score too much.\nThere is the fun chance to knock each other off the mountain. But it doesn't feel too mean because you can only knock back goats that are in a scoring position, and it isn't a huge setback. It is just a normal part of the cycle of the game.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Mountain Goats. \n\n\nIn Sequoia you are trying to grow the tallest trees in 11 different forests. After your 10 turns, if you have the tallest tree, then you get the victory points from that forest. Second place gets a small consolation prize.\nEach turn, you get to grow two of your trees. Which trees you choose will determine if you win or lose. Do you keep fighting in a forest with competition, or start growing your tree somewhere else? You'll have to wrestle with the dice to grow the tree you want.\nSequoia is a game of choosing your battles.\nThe dice will always give you choices, but they will be hard choices.\nTies in each forest are decided by extra tie-breaker rounds that can lead to epic finishes.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Sequoia.\n\nYou're launching GPS satellites into space. They need to orbit the earth in the correct order. But your launch windows are limited. You can only launch satellites where the spinner points each turn. It is your job to pick the best satellite for each launch to get your birds in order before your opponents.\nGPS is a game about how fun it is to spin that spinner. And it is a very satisfying spin.\nIt is a game about rooting for the rocket to land on your number.\nGPS is a game about putting yourself in a position where the spinner is most likely to help you.\n Read a draft version of the full rulebook for GPS.\nYou won't be paying for any extra air in your boxes. The games set up big, but they store small. There will always be room to shove one of these into your game bag.\nIt is a little bit shorter and a little bit wider than a box that holds two decks of cards side by side. It is also about twice as thick so the lid will stay in place much better.\n1. For the purpose of shipping, the 3 small games pack (GPS + Sequoia + Mountain Goats) will count as just one game.\n2. DO NOT manually increase your pledge amount to cover the shipping cost. It will make both our lives much more complicated when it is time to complete the pledge manager.\n3. If you want to pledge for additional games we publish, just manually increase the amount you are pledging. $15 for GPS, Mountain Goats, or Sequoia. $39 for the small games three pack. $34 for On Tour Europe and USA, QE, Bites, or Loot of Lima.\n4. Shipping prices will be the same during the pledge manager and you will be able to add more games then at the \"additional game\" shipping price.  \n5. The price of GPS, Mountain Goats, and Sequoia will probably be higher in the pledge manager. We want to offer Kickstarter backers the best possible price.\n6. Instead of offering a discount for buying a full case of games, we have steeply discounted the shipping rates for buying additional games. This way you can order the exact number of games your group needs.\n7. This campaign is Canadian, EU, UK, and USA, and Australian friendly.\n8. There are two main reasons the Canadian and European shipping costs more than US shipping. Since we ship fewer games to these fulfillment centers, it costs us more per game to get them there. And, we have to pay taxes when we bring the games into these regions so that you don't have to pay any taxes when they are delivered to you.\nEmail help@boardgametables.com if you want to carry one of these games in your Friendly Local Game Store, if you want to offer them through distribution, or if you would like to localize them for your country.\nChad is the owner of BoardGameTables.com and the designer of Sequoia.  Here are some games he loves that aren't getting talked about enough: Blockers, Capital Lux, Factory Funner, The King is Dead, Nations, Greed, Prospectus, Haggis, and Startups.\nKaty has to answer all your support emails and messages. So please be nice to her. With a wide range of gaming tastes she can be found playing Lisboa one night and a Harry Potter RPG the next. But it gets a little weird when she role-plays as a wizard during the game of Lisboa.\nAnca is the co-artist and graphic designer for On Tour, QE, Bites, and Loot of Lima. She has a poster featured in the Board Game Geek Artist series. Her husband and baby girl are always involved in the projects, from mandatory play testing and prototyping, to artistic suggestions. \nDaniel Profiri is the co-artist for this series. Whenever he's not illustrating board games, he's drawing photorealistic portraits and working on interior design projects. \nStefan Risthaus is the designer of Mountain Goats. He lives in Northern Germany and likes playing and developing games with history as a theme, but also quick fillers and family games. His wife also designs games and is the first and most important play testing person for his games.\nHartmut Kommerell is the designer of GPS. He has forgotten a lot of the math theory he once studied, but still uses the skills to design games and to puzzle around at work. With a 6-headed family, he can always test games with players of any age.\nEstimated delivery January 2021. Our normal math would project a November delivery. We added a couple of extra months because there is a lot of uncertainty right now, and shipping in November/December can add extra delays as everyone else is trying to get stuff in by Christmas.\nAs with all our Kickstarters, we will fully refund your pledge at any time before we ship the game to you. For any reason. No limits. No restrictions.\nRight now some people have some understandable concerns about the health of the economy and small businesses. It is our policy and will continue to be our policy to always keep enough cash on hand to fulfill (produce and ship) all outstanding Kickstarter commitments and preorders.\nThis is a short campaign, so don't delay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything feels a little riskier than it did a month ago.

This offer is only for Kickstarter backers, so don't miss out! \nWatch the Runthrough in the How to Play Section\nEveryone knows Tumble Town deserves to be the best town in the West - so it needs a mayor to match! The Tumble Townspeople are hosting a competition to turn the town tootin\u2019 and boomin\u2019! It\u2019s up to you to impress them with your construction and planning skills!\nIn Tumble Town players are rolling dice, constructing buildings, and competing to make the best town in the West.\n Dice Manipulation & Engine Building: Each building you construct gives you more powers and options. Certain buildings can let you manipulate the dice, making it easier to continue constructing! Other buildings can generate dice or give extra scoring objectives. \n Spatial Puzzle: Place your constructed buildings along Main Street to create your town. The townspeople want a specific look for the town and if you meet their requirements, you'll gain even more votes from the townspeople!\n Added Scoring Conditions: Construct the right buildings and you can gain more scoring conditions as the game progresses! These can include the size of your constructed buildings, the animals and plants near your constructed buildings, or even the types  of buildings constructed by your neighbors. \nCan you build the best town in the West?\n            ULTRA EDITION TIER WOODEN BOX\nUltra Edition Wooden Box Design is Not Finished. Final Version May Look Different.\n Below is a How to Play video:\nRahdo does a Runthrough below: \nTumble Town Overview\nIn Tumble Town, you are a mayor trying to best meet the needs of the townspeople by constructing the buildings they desire. Your goal is to have satisfied the townspeople by the time the building materials run out. You make the townspeople happy by constructing buildings, placing the constructed buildings on Main Street in the best formation, and making the townspeople care about other aspects of their town, like the cacti and windmills. \nEach building plan requires certain building materials (die colors) and has restrictions on what die values are needed. \nEach turn goes through a series of four phases: \n1. Claim (take a card)\n2. Take Dice + Roll\n3. Construct + Use Powers\n4. Place + Discard Extra Dice\nClaim a Building Plan\nYou can choose any of the 12 available building plans. You might choose a building plan based on the materials you currently have to build, the benefit that the building gives you when you construct it, the point value, or for the icon it has. \nTake Dice and Roll\nYou may now take the dice shown on the stack of the cards in the row of the  building plan you choose. \nConstruct and Use Powers\nNow that you have dice and a building plan, you can construct a building! You may use any of the powers from either your constructed buildings or your horse to help you manipulate your dice into what the building plan requires. \nPlace and Discard Extra Dice\nOnce you construct your building, it's time to place the building on Main Street. You can gain points by matching the criteria on Main Street and you can also get points by making alleys between buildings. \nYou may only carry over dice that fit into your Storehouse to your next turn, so if you have more than six, you must choose some to discard back into the supply. \nGame End\nPlayers take turns until the Dice Supply runs out. Once two of the supplies get below two dice, the game end is triggered and all players take an equal amount of turns. \nScores are tallied and Horses revealed; the player with the most points wins! \nSolo Game\nIf playing the game solo, you simply choose an Outlaw to play against and start the game! The Outlaw has quick turns and makes the game a race to get the best building materials. There's three difficulties of Outlaw to try and outwit and only the best of the best can win against the Outlaw!\nThe Solo Missions will give you a point goal and an objective and if you meet it, you move on to the next one. The goals get progressively more difficult as the game goes on. \n Solo Playthrough:\n Rules and Print and Play\nThe rules are here (the rules are not complete nor do they have graphic design):  Rules Link \nThe rules are planned to be translated into French and Italian.

It will be hard to get after the KS ends, as we won't order many extra! \nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Tumble Town is that even if Tumble Town funds, we currently don't know if Tumble Town will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Tumble Town might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. This is especially true for the playmat! \n Help Us Improve Tumble Town \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\n Discounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost.\n EU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU so backers won't have to pay VAT taxes. \nMost importantly, without you, Tumble Town would not get created.\nTumble Town is a game we truly love and want to share with the world. We've worked on this game for years to make it perfect for you. Tumble Town ties together engine building with spatial puzzles to create a truly unique gaming experience. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Tumble Town to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $50, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping is free for retailers in the US, $10 for the EU, $25 for retailers outside the US and EU. \nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach five out of the seven social goals, and we'll add a Best Mayor (name subject to change) card to the game! If we meet all seven goals, we'll include a special promo card in the game, as well!\n Here's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post, Twitter, Twitter tweet, Instagram, Subreddit, Youtube Channel, and Facebook Group.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\n100 dice actually weighs a lot! And shipping is based on weight, unfortunately, so shipping costs are a bit more than our usual for this reason.  \nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at contact@weirdgiraffegames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nWe are currently considering the UK to be within the EU at this time. We know that shipping will change for the UK in 2021, but the ways that that will change are not currently known. Also, we're hoping to ship in 2020 so that is hopefully not an issue! The estimates on the tier levels include buffer months in case several things go wrong, but that may not be the case. \nTo order a second copy of Tumble Town, add an additional $29 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nTumble Town is the sixth project by Weird Giraffe Games.\nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.\nThe Tumble Town team is made of the following people:\n We're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

Help the Bone Collector, a half-blind monk, by exhuming graves and arranging the skulls inside the crypt.\nYou are novice monks, competing to create the best arrangement of skulls. Dig up graves from the graveyard to reveal cards, take cards into your hand to collect skulls, and arrange the cards from your hand into a stack. Whoever better honors the deceased\u2019s last wishes will score more points. The Bone Collector will then declare one player's stack as the most exceptional.\nSkulls of Sedlec is a 2-3 player game (with expansions supporting 1 and 4 players), designed by Dustin Dobson with art by Marty Cobb. It was a runner up in Button Shy's 18 Card Challenge to design a game based on a real-life location.\nFor a complete gameplay overview, check out Dustin's video below: \nTo try the game for yourself, the preview PNP (low color, unedited rules) is available now at PNPArcade.com. A small solo preview is there as well. Check it out here: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/skulls-of-sedlec-preview\nAnd if you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy:\nWe're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists.\nWe release a new wallet game every month. This is game #61!\nOur wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nEach game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey.\nEnough of what we say about the game, how about some reviews? Here are some links to reviews of Skulls of Sedlec (with some solo reviews in there as well).\nhttps://geekdad.com/2020/03/kickstarter-tabletop-alert-skulls-of-sedlec/\nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/03/09/skulls-of-sedlec/\nhttps://openseatgaming.com/2020/03/13/kickstarter-preview-skulls-of-sedlec/\nhttps://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/03/11/0939/\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/skulls-of-sedlec-preview/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/skulls-of-sedlec-dastardly-review-130\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2384509/solo-gaming-skulls-sedlec-meeple-myself-and-i-revi\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is the Monstrance expansion. This expansion adds solo play to the game and will retail for $4 after the campaign. \nThe Bone Monstrance is one of the ornate sculptures that decorate the inside of the Sedlec Ossuary. As a monk, you will toil away at exhuming graves and arranging skulls into stacks. As an artist though, you will need to be very creative to sculpt a truly original piece that will please the royal family!\n\nThis solo expansion celebrates these works of art by allowing you to create six unique features alongside a standard, pyramid-shaped stack of skulls. Each play session adds a condition that will make this undertaking a challenge for even the sharpest skull-stacker!  \nBefore we look at the rewards, here's a quick introduction to Skulls of Sedlec: Executioners. It's a 6-card expansion that shuffles into the game, adds the ability to play with a 4th player and is fully compatible with the the solo expansion, Skulls of Sedlec: Monstrance, as well.\nIn life, the Executioner's duty was to protect society by by delivering the death sentence of the condemned. In death, Executioners wish to be surrounded by their handiwork, the abundant skulls of Criminals that they undid. \nThis 6-card expansion to Skulls of Sedlec adds a new type of skull: The deadly Executioner. Punish your opponents and score big by attaching Executioners to groups of Criminals.  Adding in the expansion is easy, just shuffle in the expansion cards to the base game and play. \nAnd now onto the rewards!\n\nWe have a whole bunch of games in our library. \nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of two things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0320impatient\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as soon as  everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will also receive free shipping.\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship along with your rewards - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0320us\" to get free shipping  on your extra games. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and  place an order using the coupon code \"0320international\" to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions) will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nA few notable games available in our library are Tussie Mussie, Sprawlopolis and Circle The Wagons.\nDustin Dobson has been fascinated with games for as long as he can remember. As a designer, he\u2019s passionate about crafting fun and memorable experiences that connect people, art, and interactive stories together. With a longtime career as a video game artist and producer, he\u2019s proud to have shipped over a dozen titles, including 2018\u2019s game of the year, God of War.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every  month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back the projects).\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's launching very soon, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. We have a Sprawlopolis expansion coming in the next few months, and we're working on many more.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the solo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\n\nThank you for checking out Skulls of Sedlec!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Four new mint making companies have noticed the profit potential of Mintopia City and have moved in, in an attempt to dominate the market and make all of the money. Players will take the role of one of four mint making companies and assert their influence over various locations in Mintopia City to secure their loyalties and earn the market share.\nMint Control is designed to provide a small footprint introduction experience to the Area Control and Action Selection genres of gaming that is fun and rewarding for new and seasoned gamers alike.\nSet Up\nShuffle the Location Cards, and randomly add Locations to the game area until there are at least 5 Influence Token spaces per player.\n                            (10 for 2 players, 15 for 3 players and 20 for 4 players.)\nPut the remaining Location cards to the side, they will not be used in this game. Place the 5 Action tiles near the Location cards, this is the Selection Pool.\nPlace the Mint Tokens near the Location Cards. This forms the Mint Supply, each player then takes 2 Mints from the Supply as their starting currency.\nEach player selects a color and takes the 5 Influence Tokens for that color.\nThe player with the freshest breath starts the game with the Starting Player Token.\nGameplay\nEach round, the starting player will select one of the available Action tiles and place it in front of them. They will then perform that Action, followed by the Perk in its entirety.\nThen in clockwise order around the table, each other player will perform that same Action (but not the perk) until each player has had the option to perform the Action if able.\nAfter every player has had the option to perform the action chosen by the starting player, the next player in clockwise order will choose one of the remaining available Action Tiles. This process continues until each player has selected one Action tile.\nAfter the final Action has been fully processed, if there are not enough remaining Action tiles for each player to choose from the remaining cards, return all of the chosen Action tiles to the selection pool, so that all Action tiles are available in the next round.\nFinally, the Starting Player token passes to the next player in clockwise order, and a new round begins.\nAction Tiles\nWhen an action is selected by a player, that player performs both the Action and Perk. Then clockwise around the table each other player performs only the Action.\nInfluence\nThe Influence Action allows players to pay Mints to add an Influence Token to an open Influence space. The Perk for selecting this Action reduces the cost to Influence a Location by 1, to a minimum of 0.\nEarn\nThe Earn Action gives players Mints to spend on future turns. The Perk for selecting this Action is to gain an additional Mint.\nPresence\nThe Presence Action grants each player the Presence bonus for each Location where they have Influence. The Perk for this Action is gain the eviction bonus from a Location that the player controls.\nOust\nThe Oust Action gains each player one Mint, similar to Earn. However, the perk for Oust is to spend 1 Mint to remove any 1 Influence Token from a Location. Then an additional 3 Mints can be spent to remove a second Influence token from a Location. The second token has no additional restrictions, it can be on the same or a different Location, and the same or a different player.\nScavenge\nThe Scavenge Action does not provide an Action for all players, only the player that selected it. That player can choose to gain 1 Mint from the Supply, or steal 1 Mint from another player.\nWin/Lose Conditions \nThe game ends at the end of the Action in which at least one player has all 5 of their influence tokens on Locations.\nPlayers gain points for each Location they control. The player with the most points, wins!\nIn the event of a tie, the player with the most Mints left over wins.\nThen, the tied player that has the most Influence placed on locations wins.\nThen, the tied player whose age is closest to 42 wins.\nPLAYTHROUGH\nYou are my biggest advocates and I need you to shout from the rooftops so this project can succeed the best it can.

If you're a retailer, please email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThe Mint Series was born of the 2017 BoardGameGeek Mint Tin Challenge where designer Justin Blaske submitted Mint Works, the Minty Fresh Worker Placement Game. Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded on Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product, selling over 30,000 copies -- and it's still reprinting! His second design, Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in the first hour, raising almost $200,000, and expanding into the French market. Most recently, Mint Cooperative funded over $100,000 and gained partners around the world: the Mint Series has fresh new versions in French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.\nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series. Our vision is to make singular modern board game mechanisms approachable by designing games that are simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time.\nThe Mint Series follows the narrative of Mort, introduced in the first game. After much success launching his mint-making company, Mort branched out and provided mints to surrounding towns and regions. Unfortunately, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis  grew jealous of his success, and the Mint Cooperative was launched to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. With peace restored and the villains defeated, Mort now finds himself threatened by other mint magnates trying to steal his success!  It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression, and it is thrilling to continue the saga in this exciting title.\nQuackalope's storytelling expertly explains how the world of Mintopia unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series, we've learned a lot about the game making process, from start to finish.

We've also built relationships that help us choose reliable partners for each stage of our process.\n\nThat said, this is still a production and things can fall behind or get off track, which could lead to delivery delays. While we don't anticipate any problems that would through us off track, it's always possible.

If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nGreat news: shipping costs are FLAT, regardless of which tier you pick!\nShipping costs are not included in the Kickstarter pledge, but we have put together this handy guide for shipping estimates. We charge these costs in the Pledge Manager in addition to the Kickstarter pledge. These estimates are the maximum we will charge you for shipping.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, China, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia) \n A prediction of the timeline:\n During the campaign: Submit final files necessary to create pre-production copies.\n 27 Feb: Kickstarter campaign completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n Early March: Kickstarter Survey sent 1-3 days after the Kickstarter Campaign ends\n Early March: Submit (final) files to the manufacturer\n Mid-March: Pledge Manager opens \n Early April: Pledge manager closes\n Late March: Final Manufacturing begins\n Late May: Manufacturing ends\n Early June: Shipping from China begins\n Mid-July: Arrives in ports\n August: Fulfilment commences\n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nThe reason we are sending out KS surveys BEFORE the pledge manager is that it will allow us to gather all the requested number of games to calculate how many we need for the final print run.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in August-September - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games.

Use BOLD MANEUVERS to reach your opponent\u2019s side of the table! Deploy literal CUTTING EDGE WEAPONRY to CRUSH THEIR TANKS and STEAMROLL THEIR DREAMS of victory! BLOW AWAY the competition with SPECIAL CARDS; no two games will be the same!\nIT\u2019S ALL IN THE CARDS: everything you need to CUT DOWN THE COMPETITION is right here in the KnifeTank deck! Play 1-on-1, or team up with a friend for FOUR PLAYER ACTION! Select your tank, choose your strategy, slice your way to victory!\nHow it's played!\n(the full rules are available for download here)\nPlayers start each game by picking their favorite KnifeTank cards and placing them on opposing sides of a table. Some tanks, like the Chaos and Classic tank, are more balanced, while others may have faster treads, but shorter reach. Pick the style that's fun for you. \nEach player has a hand of five action cards, which consist of 3 different types of actions: Move, Stab, or Special. There are no turns in KnifeTank, players choose an action card from their hand and simultaneously reveal it. All actions are then resolved.   \nMovement\nPlayers move their tanks by placing Movement cards on top of their KnifeTank card. These cards have symbols that indicate the direction and length your KnifeTank card will move. Players aren't allowed to measure Movement cards in advance.  \nHow to use a Movement Card\nStabbing\nOn their turn a player may choose to use a Stab card to attack the enemy. Like the movement cards, stab cards are selected in advance without any measuring on the table. Players line the knife card up with the appropriate symbol on their tank. Most cards can be swiveled in any direction, but some can only point forward or backwards. Once a card is laid down, check and see if any part of it overlays on your opponents tank card. If so, \"roll\" for damage using damage cards indicated in the corner.  \nA \"hit\" happens when your Knife Card overlaps your opponent's tank.\nDamage Cards\nWhenever a tank is hit, players \"roll\" for damage using the Damage cards. These cards have different numbers indicating how much damage might be done. Knife and Special cards will indicate which cards should be used when rolling for damage. If a card has a \"0 1 1\" marked on it, that means the attacker collects a two 1 point damage cards and a 0 card. That player is then allowed to shuffle these in any order they wish then have their opponent select one of the three Damage cards. If the player draws the 0, no damage is done, otherwise they take the damage indicated on the card, \"1\". Players keep track of their hit points by using the damage tracker. Each tank starts off with the hit points indicated on their tank card. When a tank reaches 0, that player loses. Tanks may never exceed 4 hit points.    \n\"Rolling\" for damage\nSpecial Cards\nMixed in with the Movement and Stab cards are a set of Special cards which can add a fun dexterity element to your game. These cards enable you to toss, drop, or flick cards across the table. One card even allows you to blow cards across the table! \n\"And ya know I flick like a missile strike, my precision got you all enraged\"\nSpecial cards add a fun element to the game\nStretch Goals\nI am dedicated to keeping this project on track, so I don't want to do anything that could cause a delay in shipping or disrupt the game's balance. That being said, I think there are a few cool things we can do if the project reaches these goals:\n500- add a \"Fish Tank\" card to the orders.\n1,000 backers- add one more tank and 5 new action cards (1 special, 1 knife, and 3 movement cards)\n1,500 backers- foil packaging and an upgraded box\nIf we reach these goals, I would try to work with my backers here on Kickstarter to collaboratively design these new cards. These new tanks and action cards would not only be made possible through this community, but would be based on feedback from comments and polls as well.  \nreviews\nRead Gareth Branwyn's in-depth review on BoingBoing.net\nLaughingSquid.com\nKickstarter United\nOn a personal note, this is my 10th Kickstarter project and I've backed over 600 other projects.

See below for the full box contents.\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is a stand-alone multi-player sequel to the original solitaire game Deep Space D-6.\nIn Deep Space D-6: Armada, you and up to 3 friends will work together to complete missions, fight enemy fleets in ship to ship combat, and ultimately defeat an evil federation. \nYou'll get stronger as the game progresses, building the perfect starship from over 50 station modules, hiring heroes from a pool of more than 30 unique units, and finding resources to help you dismantle your opposition. \nArmada is a complex and deep game made simple and intuitive through visual and user experience design. If you've played Deep Space D-6 before, you'll be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Armada. If you're new to the series- I hope you're ready for tough decisions and tactical planning! \nDeep Space D-6: Armada is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of three phases:\n\n1) Planning: Players perform actions to travel between planets and prepare for upcoming tasks such as upgrading their ships or hiring Heroic crew.\n2) Encounter: Players complete Away Missions or combat enemy fleets at their current location (together or alone).\n3) Resolution: Event and Threat Detected cards are drawn and hazard effects are resolved. \n Learn more about the game in upcoming updates:\nThe Starships (Update #2)\nStations Modules and Weapons (Update #4)\nCrew and Special Abilities (Update #6)\nTeam-Up encounters (Update #8)\nRule Book\nWant to know more? Check out the prototype rulebook. This is a work-in-progress rulebook and is subject to change. \n PHASE 1: Planning\nTravel, repair, upgrade ship, hire crew.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 2: Encounter\nShip-to-ship combat and Away Missions.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 3: Resolution \nDraw new event cards, spawn enemies, resolve hazard effects.\nPLAY\n\nCreating a science fiction world where the primary color wasn't black proved to be a large challenge. As a lover of classic science fiction, I was drawn to the bright colors and \"loudness\" of pulp era sci-fi. A true test of Armada's visual direction came from designing the board- or lack thereof. \nA space themed game without the empty blackness of space almost felt wrong, and for some people they probably won't be able to get over it! So Armada uses free floating planet tiles making whatever surface you play on the core color of the \"board\". Still want that dark sci-fi feel? Play on a neoprene star field map. Want to feel like you're floating in space? Try a glass table! \nFor the art, I've enlisted in the help of Gareth Davies. Gareth's unique art style creates a vibrant science fiction world while keeping things minimal and clean. \nFor the components themselves, I aimed for a classic board game look with a slight vintage feel. There are over 50 custom dice in this game!  We're taking advantage of new manufacturing technologies, but don't want to go overboard with component gimmicks. \nGet the full game as a $2 add-on!\nJUMPSHIP is a hidden identity party game for 5-10 players. You can get a copy of the mini-version for $2 with your Armada pledge. Just add $2 to you pledge. See the update for more info (Not available by itself. Limit 1 copy per copy of Armada).\nNo stretch goals. Tau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later.\nBut with your help and community feedback, I've been able to redesign and upgrade the shield and hull trackers! They look like this now:\nOther upgrades:\nA dedicated solo scenario meant for quicker play.\nCustom plastic insert for the hero dice.\nBlack Core cardstock on all cards.\nDrawstring bag for beacon tokens.\nPrinted player pawns (instead of stickers)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. Thanks to the funding progress of this campaign, I've been able to lower shipping rates.\nGames will be shipped though fulfillment partners primarily in Canada, China, the EU, the US, and Australia. This should reduce custom fees and VAT. Shipping rates are partially subsidized. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies by adding $48 for each additional game to your pledge. There will be no extra shipping charge for extra copies. \nFor larger orders (cases of 6+) or retailer pledges, please inquire by sending a message to the creator.\nTabletop games are becoming more and more popular every year. We as consumers (and designers too!) employ platitudes and conjecture comparing the increased complexity and immersion of board games to the capabilities of video games. If we are to make these comparisons, we must also recognize the dangers of any consumer-focused game mediums. Publishers have a responsibility to be morally accountable for any practices that manipulate fans, deceive consumers, or incite misbehavior among those that partake in our hobby. Deceptive pricing schemes, endless boxes of collectible miniatures, nickel & dime expansion structures, undisclosed kickbacks, even player toxicity- these are just a few areas of growing concern within the emerging tabletop industry. Please take a moment to consider how your purchasing habits and use of games reflect on the industry, whether it is my games or someone else's. \nNever forget that tabletop games are a place for communion, self-expression, can have positive effects on our health and mind, and can lead to wonderful careers and societal impact. As an independent publisher I'm committed to creating games that respect players, and delivering them with practices that are healthy for the community. \nHave fun and play nice. \nJoin the Armada today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is my most ambitious and largest game to date. Though the game is already designed, we continue to balance and add new features. There is also a non-trivial amount of art assets to be completed. These things will take time. \n\nThis will be my 6th Kickstarter game project. I've been all over the place- let me tell you. From last-second funding escapades to projects far exceeding my own projections and everything in between. This means I've also seen failures and made mistakes. I've been late to hit deadlines. I've been unresponsive when I needed communication the most. I take full responsibility for my actions and hope people will be fair in judgement and understanding. I am fully aware that being an individual does not necessitate leniency in a market full of large companies and publishers with impressive capabilities. Let's just do our best to be reasonable and keep the spirit of independent self-publishing alive!\n\nTauLeaderGames has a 100% delivery rate but every project still has inherent risks. October 2020 is my best estimate for a project of this scope based on my past experience. While this timeframe includes room for errors and overages, it doesn't encapsulate every possible obstacle.

We have another set of three fun and engaging pocket-sized games for you, each with all the rules printed on a folding box to allow you to bring game night with you almost anywhere! All three games make up the third wave in our F.L.O.A.T. series. It is our goal to release card games that are Fun, Lively, Original, Approachable, and Tiny. These games could find a home on a lunch table or gaming table, at game night or at date night (maybe check with your partner first on that one).\nEach game contains 18 cards and a folding \"hook box\" that has the rules printed directly on the inside. The cards and boxes are made of 320 gsm black-core card stock (sturdier than stock for Magic: The Gathering) with a protective UV coating as well. Keep scrolling for info on each game, reviews, how to play videos and more. We hope you join us on this campaign and look forward to making these titles a reality!\nClick the image above to read the full rules!\n We start off with the Winner of The Game Crafters' Hook Box Game Challenge, Cards of Olympus! \nCards of Olympus is an 18 card deck builder/manipulator; that's right deck building in just 18 cards! Players take on the role of Gods looking to take the charge of the throne of Olympus by building a powerful alliance of Gods and Heroes. Cards are double sided and split top and bottom with each card featuring a Mortal, Hero, God, and Monster. All cards are shared, with players gaining resources and abilities from the half of the cards that faces them. Acquire Tribute and Drachma to use special powers, guide your mortals and heroes to godhood, or add new cards to the deck an insure you gaining an additional leg up on the competition. Any upgrade in your characters helps your future hands but negatively impacts your opponent's; keep a close eye on each others' moves to make sure you come out on top!\nWith amazing artwork by the immensely talented Beth Sobel, this game begs to be played anywhere you take it!\n\"...a clever way to make a small, deck builder card game. Hopefully you can check it out and get it to your table.\"- Brody Sheard, Meeple Mountain\nClick the image to view the Rules and Free B&W PnP\nIn A Wizard's Shelf, players seek to prove they are the most esteemed wizard in the land by filling their shelves with similar types of ingredients and completing spells. Players draft cards from center stacks in an attempt to build out their shelf tableau and unlock new scoring mechanics. Players can also use abilities from spells to change up the game and their collection of ingredients.\nWhen all the cards are drafted players tally up points based on their unlocked scoring and adjacent similar ingredients. Players also lose points if they match up items of the same color.\n\"All in all, I think this is another solid entry in the wallet [hook box] game line, and if you\u2019re looking for a title that will challenge you a bit spatially and you\u2019re into a bit of magic, you might want to check out A Wizard\u2019s Shelf!

All game cards serve a dual purpose, acting as both the planets for scoring and the rocket fuel used to reach the planets.\nOn a turn players will draft cards from a central tableau or combine cards from their hands to reach exact target rocket fuel numbers to either land on or orbit a planet in the tableau. To score a planet, a player will discard cards from their hand and multiply the rocket fuel values together to hit the aforementioned target number. Some cards can also be discarded in order to add or subtract from the fuel value.\n\"I thought this was cool. Its basically an 18-card SciFi Point Salad. You're trying to land on a planet (or orbit it) for varying scores & cards double as both rocket fuel and victory points.\" Glenn Flaherty, Boardgames and Bourbon (Via Twitter)\nA Note on Stretch Goals: In previous campaigns we've had a few promo cards that could be unlocked via stretch goals. This time around we wanted to backers to know exactly what they are getting when they back the game and be sure they are receiving the 100% intended experience of each pocket sized adventure. Anything added in or adjusted with the games will be done so organically and because it is for the betterment of the base game experience.\n Below are some quick overview GIFs of the gameplay for each game.

Because we are printing in the US we had avoided those delays. Now, however, with the virus growing in the US, we're getting hit with some delays. Our games had been back on track to ship in March but right now I have some conservative estimates from the printer that they will ship in May.

FLOAT Series Wave 3!"}}, {"backer": "Nathan Meunier", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Spire's End is a solo and cooperative card game that hearkens back to the game books of the '80s with enemy encounters, interactive story-driven scenarios, and high-end art and design.  It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.\nMy influences for this game are rooted in the nostagia of my childhood. D&D, Planet of the Apes, Land of the Lost, Heavy Metal Magazine, Zork, and Monkey Island, to name a few.\n\nIt's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It\u2019s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery. \nYou move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. \n\nYou have an Ally Deck with 6 adventurers (6 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. From this deck you will randomly pick 2 starting Allies. But be warned, your path is paved in blood. If they die, and they will you will randomly select another Ally to take their place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a six-chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice chucking and more! It will require both skill and luck. \nThe hook is simple. In combat you perform actions at a cost. That cost is your character's hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points, which in turn leaves you weak and vulnerable. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles.\nPlease note: This is a simplistic look at some basics in combat. There are many exciting variables to actions and their outcomes detailed in the instructions deck. Check out Kickbacks, Status Effects, Rest meters and more!\nEnemies will fight in a similar fashion, with a few exceptions. They don't spend Hit Points and their actions are determined by the Action Deck.\nEach enemy you will face has different hooks and mechanics to make them interesting. Some have story branches that trigger in the midst of battle.\n\n\nWhat would an adventure be without pesky trash mobs getting in your way? You can't head out on your first quest without clearing rats out of a cellar, right?\n\nMy goal was to make this game with as few components as possible without taking away from the gaming experience. It's a clean minimalistic approach to an in-depth and engrossing adventure.\nThe focus has always been the story deck. The heart of the game. It represents the spire, and each card is a layer you uncover during your descent. \nFrom the very start I wanted ENORMOUS PLAYING CARDS. These are custom 6.5 x 3.5 inch cards. They are about the same size as an iPhone X and they're glorious. Here's what's in the box. \n\n\n\nThis is not a randomly generated gaming experience. The concept here is to experience a specific storyline with multiple chapter branches and endings. Your choices, enemy encounters and items you discover will influence the overall narrative. There are multiple endings to uncover, some more unpleasant than others.\n\n\n\nHere is a look at the current Card Progression Tree for Chapters 1 and 2 to help illustrate the branching paths. Each square is a card. Black = Story Card, Red = Item Card, Dark Red = Encounter. Your story can splinter out in many different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the complexities of the project I want to be transparent with the progress made and what's left to do.\n\nGreg is an Art Director and Graphic Designer currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. In his free time he's pumping whatever pop culture he can into his veins..or dreaming up new encounters for Spire's End!\n\nBenjamin is a Digital Artist from Berlin, Germany currently working as a freelance concept artist and illustrator. These days he uses every available minute for art and game design.\nErica is co-owner of Oaktown Spice Shop in Oakland, CA. Before starting a retail business with her husband, she was a journalist. She loves to cook and drink wine.\nChristian is co-owner of Hop Merchants Bottle Shop & Taproom, a craft beer bar in North Hollywood, CA.  He's a writer, a gamer and horror film fanatic.\n\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. \nThe shipping rates listed below are conservative estimates NOT the official costs. Please note that these estimates are based on the core game. Any Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign may change the weight and the size of the game, which could influence the final shipping cost. I will work to secure the best prices possible and attempt to lower these costs in proportion to the success of the campaign.\nBackers outside the countries listed above may be responsible for their own customs fees and any additional charges if and when they occur. Please message me regarding countries not listed for more information.\nPlease not that Spire's End is a work in progress, product is still in development.\nWarning: This is a fantasy/horror game that contains violence and disturbing imagery. Ages 16 and up.\nThe incredible art by Benjamin Wieseman sets the mood. The game will contain over 40 original illustrations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first venture into the madness of crowdfunding and it\u2019s incredibly daunting. But with more than 15 years of graphic design and packaging experience, I am merely in a state of heightened panic.\n\nThis project, like many, started with very ambitious goals before it was wrangled into something reasonable for my first attempt. It began as a 12 chapter, 200 card epic. Due to the sheer scope of the game, production costs and the fact that I am just one person, the game is now 6 Chapters, with the hopes to continue later if successful.\n\nThe style guides and templates are set, and the writing for Chapters 1-6 are more than halfway there.\n\nMy aim is to keep things simple without compromising the game as much as possible. That being said, even with \u201csimple\u201d in mind I know that problems lurk around every corner. Game balancing and rewrites take time so I am giving myself a considerable amount of lead time to get this labor-intensive job done properly.\n\nNobody wants this game in their hands more than me. I dream about this thing. I spend my time in the shower planning the next encounter. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get this out before the spire drags me down into the bowels of the underworld.

The royalty reign supreme, but alongside of their control are the plotting citizens, planning to get ahead using any means possible.\nHierarchy is an abstract game of order and power where players each take a random set of 7 cards and play them openly, until they cannot play any more. Cards must be played atop a card of a lesser value, unless either the last card or the new card change those rules. When the active player can no longer play a card, their opponent has won the game and has taken the seat of power away from their opponent. \nIf you haven't heard of us before, here are a few quick notes about Button Shy:\nWe're a small, family based company, with a few helping hands and a great group of designers and artists.\nWe release a new wallet game every month. This is game #56!\nOur wallet games are packaged in a small vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nEach game is hand assembled and mailed from our little workspace in New Jersey.\nFor more information about our games, rules clarifications, or anything else really, join our wonderful community on Discord: https://discord.gg/pf9DPqs\nThe object of Hierarchy is to put your opponent in a position where they are unable to play a card. This might be as simple as them running out of cards - part of the disadvantage of going first in the game - or you invalidating all of their potential plays. Each player will get 7 cards, and whomever is dealt the Imposter will go first. Because the game is one of perfect information, you will always be able to see what tricks your opponent is capable of pulling off. The ability to evaluate both players' cards and to anticipate your opponent's reactions is a key to being successful.\n Each card in the game has a numerical value - the range across the 14 cards is 1-13 with one \"?\" value - and certain cards may also contain text stating a specific card they can be played onto. As a rule, you are trying to play a card with a higher value than the previous card played to the line. However, cards such as the Knight can break this rule, allowing this 6-value card to be played atop the 9-value Dragon card.  \nSeeing what cards your opponent has will allow you to plan accordingly, knowing whether they can counter your play. However, some of the stronger cards in the game have restrictions on when they can be played, so it is possible to position things to where they might be unable to play that key card from their hand.\nAll cards are identical on both sides other than color.\nHere's a little bit about each card.\n (1) The Assassin - Low in power, yet lethal to the unexpecting. \n (2) Leper - A plague to half the population and avoided by Royalty. \n (3) Serf - Easy to ignore but difficult to remove once it enters the fray. \n (4) The Tower - Strong protection from most losing situations but at a high cost. \n (5) Surgeon - Restores a played card to the hand of both players. \n (6) Knight - Unremarkable until tasked with facing down a dragon. \n (7) Usurper - Topples the mighty, toppled by the meek. \n (8) Sorcerer - Makes the text on cards vanish for a turn. \n (9) Dragon - Loves to find a Baroness in distress, yet mighty on its own. \n (10) Baroness - Good power but needs to appear early to make a difference. \n (11) High Priest - Impressive power but a challenge to get into play \n (12) Queen - Incredibly strong card but useless without a Baroness in play. \n (13) King - Strongest card but cannot impact the early game. \n (?) Imposter - A tricky shapeshifter that clones an opponent's played card.\nPlus 2 reference cards and 1 card to start the line of power.\nTo check out the prototype rules and black and white PNP - visit PNP Arcade:\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/hierarchy\n\"For such a compact and \u2018light\u2019 game, the strategy required for success  keeps the game extremely engaging.

This is another level that's good to grab while on Kickstarter, as we dedicate a small portion of the print  run to retail store sales. Grabbing them here will guarantee the availability. Retailers only! \nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Going forward, we're just going to give it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not: you are getting this expansion if you pledge here.\nThe Emissary expansion by Mike Mullins brings solo play to Hierarchy.\nTwo noble families have been fighting over the throne for years, and the people of the kingdom have suffered. You\u2019ve been sent to make sure there is an uneventful transition into a new age of peace. To be a successful Emissary, you must play all 14 cards.\nEmissary comes with 3 double sided Edict cards that give special abilities, as well as three alternate game cards (Impostor, Tower, and Surgeon) to swap in for solo play. \nAt any time, you may discard an Edict card to use its printed ability. You must be able to resolve the card in order to use it. For example, if there are no cards left in the deck, you cannot \u201cReturn a card to the bottom of the deck.\u201d\nIt also comes in three levels of difficulty. In the Standard and Expert difficulties, after you fully resolve the Edict, you must remove the bottom card in the line and place it on top of its deck, extending the length of the game.\nWhile it's not required, we also made a sweet playmat for solo play. If you like to go all out, the playmats are always really nice. \nWork in progress image\nWe have a lot of games in our collection.

As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every  month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. (See the $1 level, that's where the members back our Kickstarter projects).\nOur 2019 $5 packages include an episode of Chain Mail, a card and dice driven, asymmetric dungeon crawler for 1-4 players. Each episode comes with a postcard map, dual monster card, and a new quest. After multiple months you can randomize these and/or attempt multiple quests in a campaign mode.\nIt also includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Tempus Quest pen and paper game where you use time instead of dice. The crew of the Tempus ship get into a new adventure each month.

Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. \nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in  the Kickstarter campaigns.\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines. \n\nOur last two projects are Tussie Mussie and Seasons of Rice. Both are moving along according to schedule. Tussie Mussie is in and shipping as planned (starting in September) and will ship for the next 2-3 weeks. Seasons of Rice is partially here and will start shipping in October as planned.

It's full of pivots and surprises, special abilities and special traps. Plus, you can play as a fighting potato!\"\n- Isaac Shalev, designer of Seikatsu\n\"Dragon Bridge is a quintessential Keith Burgun game - a finely-tuned machine that generates a lot of interesting decisions  with an elegant economy of means.\"\n- Frank Lantz, Director at the NYU Game Center\n\"As a big fan of two player games and the designer's theory for elegant strategy game design, I'm very happy to add his first two player 'clockwork' game into my collection!\" - Miya, KBGames community member \nDragon Bridge is a quick, competitive 2-player card game. Players each control a wizard, moving up and down an 18 tile long grid, casting spells, gaining magic items and luring the dragon to one side or another. Players win either by knocking the other player into the dragon, or by escaping off the opposite side. This is complicated, because the Dragon sometimes switches sides. Players are simultaneously managing blasting the other wizard back, running towards the exit, collecting items, and trying to coax the Dragon in one direction or the other!\nThe strategic questions involve many things: Can I move to a Gem tile to collect a Gems? Should I use my Gems now to defend myself, or should I save up and buy an item? But the biggest and most central question is: when will the Dragon switch sides? Can I keep the Dragon near the opponent, while I escape? Or does the opponent know something I don't?\nWhile many games with this few cards are about card counting or deduction, Dragon Bridge feels like a larger strategy game, while fitting easily and comfortably in your pocket.\nBase Game Contents:\nColorful, clear rulebook\n16 Action Cards\n5 Wizards (learn more about them here)\n6 Green Gems\n5 Magic Items\n3 Bridge Cards\n1 Dragon Card\nSuper portable.\nFeatures:\nAn innovative ruleset that's easy to learn and difficult to master\n100% original art, characters and lore\u2014the first game in the Gem Wizards Universe!\nAsymmetric characters and randomly drawn items make each match different\nPlays like a bigger strategic game, but comes in a tiny box.\nThe game takes place on an 18-tile long \u201cbridge\u201d, with a Dragon on one end. You and the opponent each play a card from your hand each turn, either moving yourself away from the Dragon (usually!) or knocking the opponent toward the Dragon (also usually!).\nHere's a RUN card being played, which says \"MOVE 3\" on it\n I say \u201cusually\u201d because the objective is either to escape (to reach the non-Dragon end) OR to knock the opponent into the Dragon side, but every so often, the dragon actually switches the side that he\u2019s on!\nAction cards often have \u201cDragon Orbs\u201d on them, and when 7 or more Dragon Orbs have been played, the dragon switches sides, gaining a new power (as shown on the gif at the top of this page).\nSome cards allow you to reduce the number of Dragon Orbs that are down, delaying the Dragon from switching sides. Throughout the match, players will also gain magic items that can help give them an edge. There's a lot of mind games and using what you know about your hand to get the dragon to switch sides when you want it to. You\u2019ll have to play strategically and think tactically to come out on top. \nDragon Bridge is a game for 2 players that takes between 15-30 minutes to play. Recommended for ages 10+.\nTHOUGHTS FROM THE DESIGNER\nHi! I'm Keith Burgun, the game designer behind a indie videogames like Auro: A Monster-Bumping Adventure and 100 Rogues. I'm the author of two books on game design, the latest being Clockwork Game Design. I'm also the host of the Clockwork Game Design Podcast, which has had interviews from notable game designers like Raph Koster, Dan Cook, Naomi Clark, Greg Street, Tim Fowers, and many, many more.\nDragon Bridge was designed quite quickly, originally for a game jam, over the course of a few days. The original version worked surprisingly well, although this is less of a surprise when I remember that I've actually been trying to design this game for years. I've made countless prototypes of a long one-dimensional grid game, trying to find a way to make a tiny card game have huge depth. It finally came together this year and I'm really happy with how it has turned out.\nI wrote this article talking about cool design things about the game, so definitely check that out. Actually, you can read all the articles about the game on my site, here. There's a lot of really neat things about it: the Dragon Orbs system, the Green Gems as a basic resource, the way that character abilities all happen \"when you\" do other actions, and so on. One of the coolest things about it is the tiny Action Deck; because of the fact that it only has 16 cards in it, players are cycling through it quite quickly. This makes Dragon Bridge one of the least random card games I've ever played. I also love that you can carry around this tiny game about the size of a Poker deck in your pocket, and yet it's really a \"game you can live in\"\u2014it has the depth to withstand hundreds of hours of play, and the variety to keep things interesting. The expansion, \"A Bridge-Hacking Expansion\", brings even more depth to the game, with a bunch of new characters, magic items, and a new Bridge-Hacking mechanism.\nDOWNLOADS\nA rulebook plus print-and-play PDF is available here.\nTabletop simulator module is available here.\nCheck out this playtest with BrainGoodGames' designer, Brett Lowey - with the expansion, on Tabletop Simulator! \nSHIPPING\nThe game has FREE SHIPPING to the US, $3 shipping to Canada and $7 shipping to the EU/UK (or $5 for the first tier). Backers are responsible if there are any import fees involved. (I know the first reward just says \"Free shipping\" but it's free shipping to the US - sorry, I found this slight error after there were already some backers so I can't edit it!)\nLinks\nFollow me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.\nYou can learn more about Dragon Bridge at the official site. \nClick here to read all the articles on my site about the game.\nFollow me on Twitter here.\nChat with us and give feedback at our Discord channel.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've published many video games before, this is my first published card game, and luckily I have a lot of resources and great people who are giving me lots of good advice on how to do it right.

With an open call for designers, we found a great creative team full of innovative and diverse ideas. We work iteratively off of creativity, which produced a great set of new and fresh games.\nWe are proud to bring you the ten unique and wonderful games that make up Dice & Ink: Volume I.\nJoey Schouten is our developer, and has likely played and studied more roll-and-write games than perhaps anyone on earth. He is currently completing his thesis on board game adaptations of video games as part of the MSc Game Studies, an interdisciplinary study that deals with game design for non-entertainment purposes (such as serious gaming, or educational games). His wide and deep knowledge of the roll and write genre, and an uncanny ability to give meaningful and actionable feedback to designers, make him the person to head up development and scouting for Inkwell Games.\nOdin Phong (sounds like pong) is our Head of Publishing and Logistics, a lifelong gamer with a background in sales, warehousing and management. He brings industry knowledge, entrepreneurial spirit, numbers knowhow, and a growing expertise in the retail games establishment to the team. His contacts in the industry, profit and loss focus, outside the box ideation, and a willingness to undertake the less flashy side of games publishing make him highly qualified to undertake the physical publishing, logistics, and business operations for Inkwell Games.\nCalvin Wong Tze Loon is our Rulebook Editor Extraordinaire. Loves the English language and often uses his acerbic wit to call out injustice. His acute command of the language, and a well honed narrative sense make him invaluable as an editor and fiction writer for our book. Calvin has worked on other great games such as Pasaraya: Supermarket Manager and Fire in the Library.\nToni Catino (Little Island Gift Shops) started designing games when she was in middle school, first with custom Pokemon cards, then with games based on her favorite books and subjects. She loves all things board games, card games, and miniatures, but might love the designing of them just a bit more. Her goal in creating games is always to make something fun, that people will enjoy and want to share with their friends and family, because that\u2019s what board games are for!\nJesse Catron (Coral Relief) is a lifelong boardgamer. His game Salmon Run was published in 2013 by Eagle Gryphon Games, after which he took a hiatus from game design upon the arrival of his 3 children. He lives with his family in Maryland and works as an Optometrist.\nRobin Gibson (Kuiper Kowboys) has been compulsively designing games since he was very young. At any time he has several dozen projects on the go tabletop and video games, but lately his attention has been focused on one-page solo games in the Legends of Dsyx and Paper Pinball series, and illustrating Chris Anderson's Tempus Quest. Robin's major creative influences are only the most obscure video games and cartoons. He's heard that television exists with real people in it, but has yet to see any evidence of this. Robin lives in British Columbia with his wife and a small bird. He works as an educational assistant and homeless support worker.\nRyan Hoye (Icy Dice) began unofficially designing board games 7 years ago when a multimedia art project morphed into a simultaneous movement electronic board game based on Pac-Man. He has officially been doing game design for about 3 years as a creative outlet to balance out a relatively uncreative full-time job. To help foster his design skills, Ryan joined the newly founded Kansas City Game Designers in January of 2016 where he has playtested other\u2019s works and has taken in feedback on his own creations.\nGrace Kendall (Celestial Stories) is a bit surprised to take on the mantle of game designer, but after two years of working on co-designs they\u2019re proud to introduce their first solo game to the world! This celestial storytelling game is a natural fit for Grace, who has been telling stories for years and is often found lurking in the woods (where the brightest stars live). Outside of board games, Grace is a dedicated member of the wizard rock community and spends a ridiculous amount of time writing sad songs about books. When not telling stories, Grace enjoys eating macaroni & cheese and being barefoot.\nNat Levan (PenSylvania) is an experienced game designer known for New Bedford and Nantucket from Dice Hate Me Games, and Supertall and Timestamp from Buttonshy Games, and the 2018 ION award winning American Steel. He loves designing and playing games about cities, history, and overlooked industries. He lives in the Philadelphia Suburbs with his wife, son, and cat, where he has been designing games since 2012.\nJoe Montgomery (Lost at Sea) is a game designer in Seattle who finds his design inspiration from some of the most fantastic and unexplained corners of the world. He loves strange games and is hopeful that his designs will be as thought-provoking as they are enjoyable. Joe is currently working on a card game about constructing massive concrete structures for infamous dictators and a tableau-building game of alien archaeology set in late 1980\u2019s Norway. For the last year and a half, Joe has been bringing these games to the weekly Seattle game designer meet-ups for some brutally honest feedback.\nSarah and Will Reed (Scrapyard Rollbot) are a husband and wife design team. They started getting into board game design when Will wanted to create a board game for Sarah\u2019s birthday. Given the fact he has a vision disability, it was a bit challenging to get the project done by himself. So instead of giving up, he decided it would be a lot of fun to have her involved in the process.That first game turned out to be a game called Scrapyard. More games, such as Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture and Project Dreamscape, followed. Now, years later, Will and Sarah are revisiting the Scrapyard theme for Scrapyard Rollbot.\nBehrooz \u2018Bez\u2019 Shahriari (Flowers over Towers) has been fascinated by games since her first memory: from Prince of Persia and Lode Runner on computers, to multi-day epic games of Risk and pencil/paper games played against classmates in school. In 2008, Bez found modern board games and within a few years had started designing tabletop games. In 2012, Bez moved to London and found a regular playtest group, which allowed for the iteration and continued design/development of her first mass-produced game. Yogi/In A Bind continues to sell well. However, Bez is most proud of her 2nd thing - a game system for which many games have been created and a community continues to develop. Bez continues to self-publish games and started pitching games to other companies in 2019.\nAlexander Shen (Islands of Atlantis) works as a Senior Technical Program Manager at one of those Silicon Valley companies where you have to circle around the parking lot for a space if you show up just a tad too late. In the more interesting parts of the day, he spends his time as an illustrator (IG: @shenbotdraws), maker (IG: @thealexandershen), and children\u2019s book author (IG: @sadiecatandmao).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any Kickstarter campaign, there are always complications.
