Here's their playthrough of the short adventure from the base game:\nRob's Gaming Table has been doing live-streamed playthroughs of several adventures. Here's the short adventure from The Forest of No Return:\nExtended interview with designer Christian Lonsing on our Ulisses Worlds Twitch show. Christian talks about the origins of the Aventuria card game right up through his design thoughts for this current wave of expansions:\n\nThis Kickstarter is a great way to get started! Be sure to check out the New to Aventuria reward level, as well as the playthrough videos above!\nAventuria is not a trading card game! Players have a fixed deck, which is only changed and expanded within a limited framework for certain game modes.\n\nHow to play\nIn Aventuria each player takes the role of a hero from Aventuria. Those heroes come with their own card decks, that offer a unique style of play. The deck can be changed only in limited ways. \nAventuria can be enjoyed in two different game modes:\nIn Duel Mode, heroes fight against each other, while in the cooperative Adventure Mode, heroes join together as a party and go on exciting adventures. \nWhether battling against each other or standing united against a terrifying foe, players draw action cards every round which constantly improve their abilities. But beware, for each round brings new challenges, and you must always watch for surprise attacks from your enemies!\nRegardless of the mode you are playing, you will power up your hero with equipment, skills, and spells, and then use your abilities to attack your foes. On your turn, you may play up to two cards as endurance cards, which are then used to pay for the tools you will need for your adventure. Since you can (almost) never get any cards back into your hand, much of the strategy involves selecting the right cards to keep and the right cards to add to your endurance pool.\nIn Aventuria, nothing is ever certain. Many of your attacks and spells require skill rolls, and your foe may still have the chance to dodge or use armor to reduce the damage you do. When fortune is against you, Fate Points can help turn the tide.\nLearn more about the game on our website!\nWe are Ulisses Spiele, the German based and internationally renowned publisher of games like The Dark Eye, Torg Eternity, Fading Suns, HeXXen 1733 and of course Aventuria \u2013 Adventure Card Game.

Conceived by Alan Bahr, the GallantVerse is a near-future setting, where superheroes have recently come into being.\nThe GallantVerse is a setting focused on heroic and exciting heroes, with a slight science fiction bent and a focus on hope and optimistic heroism! All your favorite comic book angles are here, from mystical occultists, to mutants, to paragons of science and technology, and massive cosmic threats! We're hitting all the notes!\nThis book provides the first major expansion to the world of the GallantVerse. \nOur goal is to fund a hardcover edition of the book to put into retail. We've already had it edited, laid-out and proofed. We just need to recoup our costs, as well as fund the print run.\nThe final book will be 130, full-color, illustrated and professionally printed pages!\nAdditionally, the writing on the GallantVerse is being handled by top industry talent. We're set on paying all our contributors well, and our goal reflects our commitment to an ethical pay rate for our writers, artists, and team members.\nArt by Nicolas Giacondino\nWritten by a slew of award-winning industry writers, such as Alan Bahr, Elizabeth Chaipraditkul, Shawn Carman, Jack Norris, and Darren Pearce, with art by GallantVerse artist Nicolas Giacondino (who also served as a consultant on the South American portions of the GallantVerse), The GallantVerse Campaign Guide is the first major expansion to Tiny Supers, and features:\nThree new archetypes: The Brute, the Stalker, and the Trickster. \nTeamwork focused Hero and Villain Point Mechanics\nNew Traits, such as: Signature Weapon, Improvement Traits, Customization Traits, Affiliation Traits, as well as new Power Traits, featuring powers such as: Astral Projection, Damage Field, Danger Sense, Fate Manipulation, Genius Level Intellect and more!\nTwo new actions to better model super heroic combat: Slam and Set-Up. \nNarrative-focused rules for Bases & Hide-outs. \nArt by Nicolas Giacondino\nThe book also features expansions to the GallantVerse, dealing with Europe, South America, and the archvillain Thule's empire of Atlantis. \nScience, Spells & Superheroes!\nFrance, Germany and England feature in this section, and you'll find out more about Cabinet 13, England's mystical and magical companion agency to the A.C.T.I.O.N. and Sentry Force Dark, Grosse Verdammte Helden, Germany's cybernetic techno-magic heroes, and  the mystic-dimension hopping Department des Dimensions Alternative, France's secret science division attached to CERN.\nCelestial Mantles & Eternal Heroes\nLong before the resurgence of Supers there were heroes summoned forth by the collective will of the people in various regions of South America. These heroes were ordinary people blessed with the power of celestial forces granted by a mantle, which eventually became part of them. As the power of the Mantles grew so did these superpowered heroes, becoming greater than their original purpose and forces unto themselves.\nToday the Mantles have awoken to protect their people. Together with normal Supers they strive to find a way forward in a new world. The way isn\u2019t easy however, as Mantles clash with Supers on the best way to protect South America and what shape the future will take.\nSunken Empires & Alternate Dimensions\nRuled by the dreaded techno-sorcerous despot, Thule, Atlantis exists in a pocket dimension accessible through various fixed points on Earth. The Atlanteans are generally ambivalent to the affairs of humanity, but the same cannot be said for their  leader, who frequently embroils the kingdom in his schemes of domination and revenge. \nTiny Supers is the award-winning, minimalist and bestselling TinyD6 superhero roleplaying game.\nTiny Supers allows you to play superheroes of all types, from paragons and exemplars, to super-science heroes of the future or past, to cosmic guardians defending the far-reaches of the galactic civilizations from untold threats!\nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character archetype based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits or Powers that each grant a single benefit, and you're done!\nTiny Supers uses a simple, fast, and dynamic ruleset to handle actions. The game uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution.\nIf you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third die to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single die).\nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select a superheroic archetype (such as Paragon, Gadgeteer, Defender, Mastermind or more), three traits or powers, and write down some basic information and you are ready to play!\nGallant Knight Games is a tabletop gaming company dedicated to high-quality roleplaying games and card and board games.\nFounded in 2016 by Alan and Erin Bahr, and focused on affordable, accessible and exciting tabletop games, Gallant Knight Games produces the award-winning and bestselling TinyD6 line of games, with titles such as Tiny Dungeon 2e, Tiny Supers, Tiny Frontiers: Revised and many more. \nGallant Knight Games also produces many other bestselling titles, such as: Cold Shadows, the Venerable Knight Classic line, as well as supporting a wide range of rulesets. \nGallant Knight Games also serves as a publishing partner for bestselling indie publishers, such as Old Skull Publishing, Barrel Rider Games, and many more, helping to bring their games to larger audiences!\nAlan Bahr is the award-winning lead designer and founder of Gallant Knight Games.\n\nPlease note: the below shipping costs are estimates based on current shipping prices. Some changes or fluctuation is possible (and likely)!\nUSA Shipping\nBased on our experience shipping in the USA, we've worked to establish a new shipping rate on Kickstarters (this is the debut of that hard work!):\nFor book-only pledges, we charge a flat $8 shipping charge (media mail + packaging and handling costs) for USA addresses. This does include tracking delivered to your email.\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to $15 (priority mail + packaging and handling costs).\nWe do our best to keep shipping affordable by doing our own fulfillment, so we can ensure it's done right. \nEU Shipping\nFor orders in the EU, our friends at Angry Hamster Publishing are handling our Kickstarter fulfillment!\nFor book-only pledges, we charge a flat \u20ac10 shipping charge (the shipping costs + packaging and handling costs) for EU addresses. (We're still exploring tracking and we'll firm up those details.)\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to \u20ac25 (a larger package + packaging and handling costs). These packages are tracked. \nHowever, because they're shipping inside the EU, VAT and Customs fees will not apply!\nUK Shipping\nFor book-only pledges, we use Royal Mail, which is relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, we can't give a firm price as price increases are due to rise on April 1st in the UK. \nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), unfortunately, we can't give a firm price as price increases are due to rise on April 1st in the UK.  Parcelforce would be the service used. \nOur fulfillment team should have updated numbers soon and we'll post those as soon as we can. \nHowever, by the time the pledge manager rolls out \nThe Rest of the World\nFor anyone else, shipping can get very expensive. We do our best, but we'd recommend you look into the options below with print-on-demand.\nIf you still want an offset book, you're welcome to back at the appropriate level, but we can't offer refunds on your pledge because shipping was more than you thought. It can get very expensive (please be aware.)\nIf you need an estimate, don't hesitate to reach out to shipping@gallantknightgames.com\nIf You're Concerned About Shipping Costs...\nHowever, we do always have a Print-On-Demand pledge for our international fans and backers and we do always put our books in Print-On-Demand on DriveThruRPG, so don't hesitate to just get the PDF and you can get the book later! (Any extra offset print run is sold via our webstore, and you can always get it there, but the high shipping concerns still exist!)\nAll of our digital rewards (and our print on demand rewards) are being handled by our fulfillment partners at DriveThruRPG!\n\nREMEMBER: the above shipping costs are estimates based on current shipping prices.

All Gallant Knight Games projects have delivered their digital rewards, and currently two projects have physical fulfillment underway and will be completed before this campaign ends. This project will not impact those. This is a straight-forward project with some nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've already had!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: Not a risk. It's all done!\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG?\nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've elected to minimize our stretch goals to text increases, and we've set a finite limit of page count.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: It's all done!\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, before we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year and ship that reward for you.

You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\nUnited States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union+ (Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address. We will cancel and refund orders from countries we do not ship prior to fulfillment if other arrangements have not been made.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com\nAre you a retailer that wants to jump on the Meeples and Monsters train?

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays\n* Shipping delays\n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2022, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 10% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. AEG is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email kickstarter@alderac.com for further information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Hero Pledge: Game and Upgrades!", "descp": "A copy of Meeples & Monsters and all upgrades.\nINCLUDES:\nMeeples & Monsters Game\nMeeples upgraded to printed\n4 Towers Expansion\nSolo game rules and components", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["3,733 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Production Update and an Important Heads Up", "update_content": "Production Update\nShort version: Things are going really smoothly.

This addition is primarily designed for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, but also functions as a huge collection of inspiring rooms, characters and more! \nEach of these taverns can be enjoyed by any adventurer, and can be scattered across any setting! Ranging from the grim and seedy dealings in the Bloated Bounty to the world shaping Wildaback Tavern, the diversity of each tavern and inn\u2019s culture is a spectacle of its own.\nThese taverns come populated with a slew of characters, some of which can be found at any location. In addition, these buildings house a wide array of monstrous foes, magic items of varying power, and new mechanics!\nThis book is more than it seems. These taverns are laced with their own secrets, hidden histories and locked doors. But more than internal stories, the book itself serves as a guide to the hidden lore of its most prevalent characters. If you\u2019re interested in code cracking, treasure hunting and deep lore, this book is for you!\nFor the most secrets included, it\u2019s suggested you get at least the Tavern Keeper tier, but the main puzzle can be unravelled by anyone with the hardcover! \nOne of our taverns simply can\u2019t be contained inside the pages. Because it changes shape every time you visit! Using dozens of room tiles and a table with descriptions, have your players run through a potentially endless maze of rooms. If you add the arcane haze variant, filling every guest's mind with rage, you can potentially use this tavern as a standalone roguelike board game! \nIf you grab our custom card deck, you can fully immerse yourself in a newly designed game for standard playing cards. Pick your character from the court members, or the joker, and race your opponents on your own trail to victory!\nAdd-ons are a great way to get an extra item or two from a higher pledge, or previous campaign at a Kickstarter rate! All backers will have access to addons, all you have to do is back a tier of this campaign to be invited. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we'll reach out to you and ask you to confirm through the survey which addons you would like to purchase. Shipping costs for addons will be determined after the Kickstarter along with the survey. Addons from this campaign will ship along with pledges. However, backers who select any addon from Stibbles\u2019 Codex (list below) will have the option to receive these select addons earlier - estimated delivery in April 2021.

There are now Print + PDF \u201cone-click\u201d reward levels for those who want physical books along with your digital rewards that are paired up with the existing four PDF-only pledge levels.\nI\u2019ve added a retail tier that is five copies each of physical books only, no cards or counters.\nFinally, there are two tiers for those who are looking to go big. The first one assumes you have the books from both previous Perilous Journeys campaigns, and the original counter and card sets from Five Perilous Journeys...but want to catch up with everything that\u2019s new since then. The second is for those who want everything GB has done for TFT in one click.\nWhat about the CC4 through CC6 stretch goals? As they fall, these products will be added to the appropriate reward levels at no change in reward price.\nThe New to TFT! pledge reward also benefits: As CC4 through CC6 are unlocked, you get those as well in Print and PDF!\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged to a digital level, but the campaign ends before you can come back to adjust...don\u2019t worry: You can switch freely in the Backerkit phase!\nWith that...read on! \nYour session of The Fantasy Trip is in full swing.\nTired and starving, you have nearly reached your goal: You're ready to rescue the dragon and defeat the vile prince. Suddenly, it's time for a fight! The player-characters are ambushed by \"2d bandits, of 30-33 points.\"\nStop playing while you make 2\u201312 opponents? Perhaps make a single bandit, and the players wind up fighting a half-dozen identical foes?\nThe first disrupts the flow of the evening; the second is unsatisfying: People aren't clones.\nThat's why the Character Collections exist.\nReady-to-play characters built as individuals: Each has a brief story, describing something of their past, motivations, and salient details that make them individuals. They're not all combat monsters: Some must resort to duplicity, cunning, seduction, and guile to get by. Others are more \"Thog smash!\" and prefer to handle things with something blunt and heavy.\n(See What is The Fantasy Trip below for more details!)\nGaming Ballistic proudly presents, at a minimum, the first three volumes in the Character Collectionseries, offering up more third-party support for Steve Jackson Games' classic: The Fantasy Trip. These books provide ready-to-play, rules-compliant characters for use as hirelings, rivals, extras, or even pre-generated characters. They're definitely useful for when an adventure or encounter calls for opposition you haven't prepared in advance...or when the GM needs a little creative inspiration.\nMinimum? The campaign begins with volumes 1\u20133...but as the backer-count stretch goals are met, the value of your pledge increases as the campaign adds volumes 4, 5, and 6 to your reward package!\nCharacter Collection 1: Experienced Adventurers provides 20 ready-to-use adventurers of various point values. It's short (only 8 pages), and does not include custom character art in the Print/PDF books.\n\nThe second volume in the Character Collection series contains 40 starting characters, each of 30\u201333 points. Grab them as hirelings for powerful adventurers, people met by chance on the road, or as ready-to-go starting characters.\nRookies features custom-created art for each character - an improvement on the first volume, and the model for all that follow! Character Collection 2 is 12 pages. \n\nThe third volume in the Character Collection series provides 72 bandits, outlaws, untrustworthy, or desperate people from 30\u201338 points. They're probably not your friends.\nAs with Rookies, a custom-drawn image is provided for each character. Character Collection 3 is 20 pages. \n\nThe Character Collection series starts at three volumes: Experienced Adventurers, Rookies, and Bandits and Outlaws. Unlocking the 350-backer goal gave additional add-on content for Experienced Adventurers.

Its first element was released in 1977: the combat game Melee (still available FREE from Steve Jackson Games!). That was followed by the magic game Wizard and a full roleplaying rulebook: In the Labyrinth.\nThe Fantasy Trip is more \u201ccinematic\u201d than \u201csimulationist\u201d \u2014 speed and ease of play are the goal, not an exact representation of every swing and every defense. The background is unabashedly swords and sorcery. Elves are noble, dragons are greedy, and gunpowder weapons exist...but might blow up in your face!\nTFT was off the market for more than 35 years, until 2017 when Steve Jackson regained the rights to his work and set about creating a new edition. The Legacy Edition was officially released in 2019 . . . and Gaming Ballistic is pleased to provide support under official license from Steve Jackson Games for that amazing deluxe edition.\nIf you're new to The Fantasy Trip . . . there's a pledge level just for you! Check out the New to TFT Starter Pack for the core rulebook in hardcover, plus additional support materials (this pledge level only ships to the USA).\n\nThe pledge levels have been expanded to allow easier, one-click selection of a variety of print and PDF rewards.

It is also limited to the USA, due to out of control international shipping. Gaming Ballistic cannot offer the In the Labyrinth book in PDF format.\nIf you want individual books, card decks, or counter sheets...add to your pledge based on the guidelines below!\nAs stretch goals are unlocked for Character Collections, additional books, card decks, and counter sheets will be made available. \nThe \"Five Perilous Journeys\" campaign featured a deck of 63 cards, done in the style of SJGames Decks of Destiny. They were pretty popular.\nGaming Ballistic is thrilled to offer both the original Five Perilous Journeys deck...as well as decks for More Perilous Journeys and each of the Character Collections volumes as stretch goals are unlocked!\nThese physical add-ons will ship from the USA: They might be expensive for international delivery. \nDecks available at this point in the campaign:\n Five Perilous Journeys: 63 cards, $20\n More Perilous Journeys (Dark Lord's Doom and Dragon Hunt) Deck: 72 cards, $25\n More Perilous Journeys (Roc of Sages and Catacombs) Deck: 62 cards, $20\n More Perilous Journeys (The Sunken Library): 62 cards, $20\n Character Collection 1 (Experienced Adventurers): 20 cards, $10\n Character Collections 2 (Rookies): 40 cards, $15\n Character Collections 3 (Bandits and Outlaws): 72 cards, $25\nAs stretch goals are unlocked, more decks become available. \nFor those who like moving physical bits around on their tactical maps, the character artwork is also available as physical counters, printed on cardboard. All of the counters for this project - including the Five Perilous Journeys counters - will be 1\" square and be greyscale printed on a white background.\nDue to issues with manufacturing and shipping, they will not be shipped outside the USA.\n Five Perilous Journeys Set: $50 (5 sheets; greyscale)\n More Perilous Journeys Set: $50 (5 sheets)\n Character Collections 2 - Rookies: $10 (1 sheet)\n Character collections 3 - Bandits and Outlaws: $20 (2 sheets)\nMore sheets will be added as stretch goals are opened. If all goals are met, there will be five additional sheets, making 18 total...over 700 counters. \nBox 'em Up ($5)\nThis project may produce up to 18 different counter sheets. I'm going to offer a custom-printed box for storage. I'm still working the design! But here's a mockup showing the dimensions and box style. The box will arrive folded flat.\nThe pledge levels cover PDFs. \nIf you want to order physical books as well, the prices of individual books as add-ons are shown below. \nPrevious campaigns produced ten adventures to provide hours of solo or group play without having to do all the work yourself. Each of the following add-ons provides you physical copies of the books listed. Match the add-on with the PDF reward level to get both!\n Solo Adventures Physical Books ($40)\nVampire Hunter Belladonna, Dragon Hunt!, and Dark Lord's Doom\nDavid Pulver wrote three solo/programmed adventures for the two Perilous Journeys campaigns.

(Choose the Character Collections + All Perilous PDFs pledge level to get PDFs of each of these 10 adventures).\nMany countries treat \"books\" and \"stuff\" differently in terms of mail postage rates as well as tax status.\nBooks\nFor books, the price you see is the price you pay, with shipping charges a pass-through for postage, materials, and labor. With the exception of the TFT Hardback, books ship to the whole world.\nStuff\nFor \"not-the-USA,\" the contribution to the cost for VAT cannot be ignored: It tends to be closer to 20-25%. This \"plus-up\" for VAT is not included in the prices of the add-ons, and will be added to the shipping charges for these items. Shipping charges are also subject to VAT.\nCARD DECKS ship to the entire world. COUNTER SETS ship to the US only for now.\nCustoms, Duties, DDP, DAP\nWherever possible and practical, Gaming Ballistic will try and ship goods Delivery Duty Prepaid (DDP) and include the cost of customs, duties, and taxes in the shipping fees. \nThat may not be possible for all countries. For those exceptions, the courier or carrier may present you with a customs bill in order to claim your goods. That sucks. But Gaming Ballistic can't control it.\n Fair warning: the only alternative to this sort of cost allocation is to avoid international shipping all together. I'd rather not do that...but these are horrible times for international shipping, and that's the reality in front of all of us.\n\nA project isn't a project without a timeline.\nCampaign Launch: Friday, February 19, 2020 (10am Central Time)\nCampaign End: Tuesday, March 9 (5pm Central Time)\nBackerkit Phase: April, 2021\nProduction: May, 2021\nPDF Distribution: June 2021\nPrinting and Physical Good Manufacture: August 2021\nShipping, Fulfillment, and Delivery: September-October 2021\nEvery effort will be made to beat these times.\nTo help manage post-campaign add-ons, as well as the distribution of the final product(s) to backers, Gaming Ballistic will be using Backerkit to conduct the post-Kickstarter surveys and fulfillment.\nBackerkit is a company whose purpose is to help creators manage these details, including add-ons and shipping costs. When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will last between 10-14 days. \nThe Backerkit survey is vitally important for those wanting physical goods. Get your surveys done early, and choose your Add-Ons at this time - and ALL physical goods are add-ons!\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nShipping is charged in Backerkit,  and not included in pledges. For international customers, taxes are also assessed along with shipping, where appropriate.\nInternational shipping OF BOOKS prints in the UK at Mixam, and Kixto will handle fulfillmen via Royal Mail. This is probably more costly than it  has been in the past.\nCard decks and counter sheets ship from the USA; Counter Sets will not be available internationally. The whole world is also laboring under the effects of COVID-19, which complicates staffing on the shippers' side as well. For the third time: International Shipping of this complicated project (PDF, decks, books) is going to be expensive and challenging. Be prepared.\nGaming Ballistic produces materials aimed at three product lines: The Fantasy Trip, the Dungeon Fantasy RPG (Powered by GURPS), and various versions of the original fantasy RPG. Below you can find a guide to the three product lines, and a quick summary and pricing for each.\n Vampire Hunter Belladonna ($16/$8 PDF): Take the role of Belladonna of Ironskull Castle in this solo adventure. Vampires plague the land, and she's going to deal with them.\n Dragon Hunt! ($19.50/$10): With the Baron and his armies off in a foreign adventure, the dragons grow reckless. This very challenging programmed adventure requires several characters to ensure victory.\n Dark Lord's Doom ($15/$7.50): The Dark Lord Saethor aims to conquer the lands; he's already recruited the orcs and subjugated the elves. He must be stopped! This programmed adventure features a squad of four soldiers. Run it solo, as a group, or with a GM!\n Ironskull Castle ($12/$6): Lady Raell Ironskull is the sorcerous leader of a band of mercenaries with some very unusual help. This mini setting presents her home, Ironskull Castle, and the secrets it keeps.\n Citadel of Ice ($12/$6): An iceberg holds a group of humans, yeti, treasure...and the required dark secrets. Can you raid the rapidly melting citadel before the loot disappears forever, and maybe rescue the stranded people as well?\n Crown of Eternity ($12/$6): The first of the five-book Jok Sevantes campaign. You are hired by the Indhyna League to find the arcane archeologist Jok Sevantes, recover the object he was searching for, and return.\n Curse of the Pirate King ($12/$6): Sevantes leads the way to Costora, home of the long-dead (or IS HE?) Pirate King, and resting place of a fabled artifact. And now the center of a hidden threat. \n Roc of Sages ($12/$6): Sevantes needs the party to help him get parts from the aggressive Viridian Rocs to further his mysterious plans. Plus a few stops along the way.\n Catacombs of Living Death ($13/$6.50): Jok's plans begin to crescendo as the group heads into the plague-ridden land of Athan in search of the Helm of Baat, buried in the Catacombs of Eulogia...which is now under new management.\n The Sunken Library ($19/$9.50): The series climax! Jok is ready to take his collection of artifacts to the Sunken Library of Hrel...and those who oppose him start to take stronger steps.\nGaming Ballistic also provides support for SJGames' Dungeon Fantasy RPG.\nFinally, for players of Fifth Edition, the OSR, or even a bit of the Pathfinder RPG, find out what happens when a GURPS fan takes the OGL, 30 years with GURPS, a bunch of Vikings, and has a lot of fun. Plus: Dungeon Grappling - \"grappling rules that don't suck.\" ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe writing for the first three Character Collections is complete. The layout template is in place and proven; for some of the books the layout is already finished, which includes editing. For others, even the artwork is complete.\n\nThere is a lot of art required to also provide the counter-size graphics present for every character presented in the books. Add-ons are physical goods that require manufacturing and distribution. Given the state of the world right now, this definitely represents a timing risk.\n\nShipping, whether international or domestic, is very challenging. And expensive. Shipping rates and delivery dates are both extremely unpredictable. Most add-ons are not books, meaning they are subject to VAT, customs, and even more delays. Some of these duties and fees may be collected on delivery. Gaming Ballistic has no control over international postage fees and methods. GB doesn't control or influence domestic rates either, but at least they're more predictable.\n\nThere are very few things that would disrupt the project other than mild schedule slips \u2013 though of course things can always go pear-shaped. Gaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress, and do everything possible to deliver the final PDF on or ahead of schedule.\n\nFor manufacturing timing, the book printer chosen operates in both the USA and UK and provides high quality identical printing at both sites. This eliminates a huge variable in timing: the need to ship from a far-flung location, split shipments, and then do fulfillment. For cards and counters, manufacture and distribution is more complicated, and definitely not local for international customers. Lead and manufacturing times are currently unpredictable; we'll do the best we can.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow the Campaign", "descp": "Follow along, get updates, but not receive any rewards.

Your mercenaries will be able to pick up tickets that will see them engage in counterinsurgencies, strike operations, train resistance fighters in the wilds, police unruly populations, and take on the heaviest warfighting jobs available.\nEverything is provided in the set for you to do this, from the initial creation of the mercenary unit to the building of tickets for your Travellers to attempt, with specialised units and equipment enhance a unit's capabilities, and enough adventuring material to kickstart any new campaign.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Mercenary set will initially contain three books in a box set, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks and adventures to expand the mercenary experience, covering new tickets, equipment and rival units.\nBook 1: Mercenaries in the Far Future\nBook 2: Running a Mercenary Force\nBook 3: In the Field\nWipeable Unit Roster Card\nThe writing for the Mercenary box set is complete and you can download the first book included in the set, Mercenaries in the Far Future, right HERE.\n\nMercenaries in the Far Future: A full guide on using mercenary units in Traveller, detailing how they operate and fight across a range of environments and Tech Levels, along with rules on how to resolve missions and related incidents in the life of mercenaries. It also deals with larger-scale conflicts and how the focus can shift from a high-level picture of a theatre of war to a crisis point involving a handful of mercenaries. In short, this volume is all about what an existing mercenary unit does.\nRunning a Mercenary Force: This book shows you how a mercenary force is recruited, maintained, expanded and subdivided if necessary. Four key resources are necessary to this process: Personnel, Credits, Materiel and Influence.\nIn the Field: The tickets presented in this volume are intended for use in any Traveller campaign, and are independent of Charted Space and the Third Imperium universe. Some are standalone incidents which can be placed in any suitable location, whilst others form part of a wider conflict or confrontation. In addition to the tickets presented here these situations provide a backdrop for further mercenary operations and adventures.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe Mercenary box set brings a new style of campaign to Traveller and contains all the core rules needed to make warfighting a way of life for your group. However, there is no one set way to build a new mercenary unit and each is as unique as the group of Travellers behind it. Clearly, there is an immense amount of ground that can be covered, from new 'toys' to equip your soldiers with to specialist mercenary units and fully fleshed out tickets to kick your campaigns off. Kickstarter gives us the very best opportunity to explore these avenues while constantly getting your feedback on how to present them.\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels (Virtual Mercenary, Mercenary Soldier, Mercenary Officer) in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Mercenary in your hands.\nThe Field Commander's Pack\nProspective recruits will be able to purchase a special orientation pack to get them grounded in mercenary life and on their way to earning a fortune - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Mercenary Officer level!\nIn the Field Commander's Pack, you will find:\nA pad of blank Mercenary Unit Roster sheets, ready for your new unit\nSix Mercenary pencils, perfect for your Travellers\nOne Mercenary Officer's pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Enemy Vehicle Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most dangerous vehicles you are likely to meet on the battlefield - and should be on your unit's shopping list\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Mercenary dice\nThe Premium Weapons Guide, a 16 page addition to the Field Catalogue featuring items made available only to the finest of mercenary units\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have lots planned for your Mercenary campaign and, with your kind help and support, we hope we can give you a lot more bang for your pledge!\n\n\n\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is growing quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Mercenary to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have always delivered on our Kickstarter projects and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of previous Traveller projects such as The Great Rift, the Element Class Cruiser Blueprints or Deepnight Revelation, we believe you would hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it, and you tend to end up with more than you originally pledged for!\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure Mercenary does not overrun its projected completion date.\n\nFor a start, much of the work has already been done on the box set, and the first book has already entered the art and layout process - you can freely download what has been completed thus far for free using the link in the description above.\n\nSecond, we have brought in fan favourite Martin J Dougherty, to pen the set.

Players take the role of fantasy heroes seeking adventure, fame, and fortune in the world of Golarion. \nWhat's Savage Worlds?\nSavage Worlds is a versatile roleplaying game system, first published in 2003 by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Savage Worlds can be used with any genre or setting from four-color supers, to gritty sci-fi, to gothic horror, to high fantasy.\nWhat's an Adventure Path?\nAdventure Paths are in-depth stories for the Pathfinder RPG that tell an epic tale over a series of connected adventures. Players will see their characters grow in power from lowly beginnings until they become mighty heroes. \nSo why convert these Adventure Paths to Savage Worlds? \nSimply put, because we love them. Pathfinder fits right into the types of worlds we love to play in, like the Weird Wild West of Deadlands, college horror and hijinks in East Texas University, the monstrous Victorian pulp world of Rippers, the far-flung future of The Last Parsec, the comic-strip heroism of Flash Gordon, or any of the other settings we\u2019re known for.\nSo why not give Savage Worlds fans official rules to stop the insidious Skinsaw cult in Rise of the Runelords, defeat Baba Yaga in Reign of Winter, or explore the scorching deserts of Osiron in Mummy\u2019s Mask? \nThat was our proposition, and we feel honored our Paizo friends have trusted us to re-present their original work for our system. It\u2019s truly an honor and a privilege, and one of the greatest projects we\u2019ve ever worked on.\nWhat are some of the Big Rule Changes from regular Savage Worlds?\nFirst, Savage Pathfinder has Class Edges that give you one or more special abilities that balance out to the traditional Edge cost. Each one is unique and reinforces the class-based tropes of Pathfinder. And of course these serve as Requirements for higher Rank Edges that reflect Pathfinder's high-level abilities.\nSavage Pathfinder also uses our dynamic, flexible power system. Certain Arcane Backgrounds have features that reflect the nuances of Pathfinder magic. For example, sorcerers and wizards have Armor Limitations that inflict penalties on their arcane skills if they wear inhibiting armor, and the rules for resting and recovering Power Points have been tweaked to best reflect the world of Golarion.\nWe've also added new powers and advanced Power Modifiers modeled (but adjusted) from the \"Exalted Powers\" created for Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds. These allow your bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard to fully realize their power at higher Ranks!\n If you want to pick and choose from the items in the boxed set, or if you require duplicates of particular pieces for your players, you will be able to select from the following Add-Ons once the pledge manager opens at the end of the campaign.    \nAdventurers love loot! As the campaign progresses, we'll add \"Stretch Goals\" to make your pledge even greater.

The more you share, the more extras we all get! (Hey, we play too! A LOT!)\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nWow! You're gonna need a Bag of Holding for all these INCREDIBLE rewards you've helped us unlock! Thanks, Pathfinders! We'll be seeing you soon!\n It's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to champion the cause, you can do so using the following channels.\nPathfinder for Savage Worlds is written and in playtesting at the time of this writing (Feb 2021). Your support allows us to create the extras and to help boost the signal to other fans\u2014by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours.\nWe deliver the first PDF a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you to include additional Pinnacle products with your order. Want to add an additional copy of the Savage Worlds rules, Deadlands: The Weird West, or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds? Those will all be available. \nWe'll charge for shipping there in the pledge manager. \nBelow is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. We know this is a painful part of the process, so our goal is to fill each reward level with an amazing amount of high-quality books and accessories which will more than make up for these additional costs (especially once we finalize any additional Stretch Goals!).\nWe also pay for some of the shipping costs ourselves to keep the overall rates as low as possible. No matter what happens between now and the time the packages ship, we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\nClick to see as larger image. Shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in Italy is 4%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping.\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole adventuring party, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package, while you pledge for a digital reward tier. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com.\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Retailers Benefit in the Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Kickstarter\" newsletter here for details on how to participate in this project!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time). Customers of Savage Retailers may request complimentary PDFs of books purchased by emailing Info@peginc.com.\nAny Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at Info@peginc.com\n But...How Does Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Play?\nCheck out these playtests which aired during the Kickstarter.  First we have 5 episodes of our Premiere Playtest for Hollow's Last Hope!\nBefore that, we aired the \"PEG Playtest\" with GM and co-developer Karl Keesler:\nWe also previewed the Quick Chase Deck (still playtesting, folks...)during the Kickstarter!\nAnd talked with Paizo Inc.'s Jason Bulmahn:\nWe brought all the GMs together who ran Hollow's Last Hope to playtest Savage Pathfinder:\nAnd we had the cool opportunity to talk game design with Pathfinder: Kingmaker developers Owlcat Games!\nPlus other Q&A's and discussion about design. Enjoy!\nRemember that PEG Playtest Karl Keesler ran? Here's the first version, which meant further playtesting...\nAnd the LAST Chance Q&A, with pretty much all of Pinnacle on screen!

They wander our roads and cities, mingling with the teeming masses of humanity. Characters in Scion Second Edition begin as humans touched by fate, heirs to great powers and incredible destinies. In the core setting for Scion, characters discover they are the children of Gods, inheriting mantles, accomplishing great deeds, and deciding their own destinies. It\u2019s a game about divinity and humanity, and everything in between \u2014 and now, with these two expansions, everything beyond as well. Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos open new pathways, new origins, and new secrets for Scion Second Edition.\nBut which of these two pathways will you wander down?\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nPerhaps you aren't the descendant of an ancient deity, but instead have been chosen by a Dragon. The myths about Dragons are true, but not the whole truth. Dragons went into hiding after too many of their numbers were slain for their deeds, and have waited for centuries until they could reclaim The World as their own. They blame the Gods and Titans, along with their worshippers, for their downfall. And they will gain power from the Titanomachy between God and Titan, but from the shadows, without showing their claws.\nYou carry inside you a dragon, something you don\u2019t fully understand, but need to in order to control. To claim your heritage, you must seek out clues to the truth, embrace the memory your draconic ancestor bestows upon you, and perform missions you might not understand. You are tasked to be the Dragon\u2019s operative in The World, but you set your own destiny.\nDiscover your heritage, embrace the dragon, and claim your inheritance.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nOr perhaps you've been touched by something different, something alien and ancient. The Mythos is older than humanity, Gods, and Titans, with an unknowable otherness that can shatter them all. This slumbering horror lurks in the shadows, carrying out its cold machinations with little regard for those beneath it until it requires pawns.\nThose that touch the Mythos are forever awakened. The World explodes into full view for them, empowered by these alien beings that alter their very essence, the ability to break Fate and leave the walls of reality weaker in their wake. These human embodiments of the Mythos are not good or evil; such easily definable morality is for lesser beings.\nWhat does one do when their power comes with a cost?\nScion: Masks of the Mythos and Scion: Dragon are two new entries in the Scion Second Edition RPG line, building on Scion: Origin and Scion: Hero. Each of these books adds entirely new elements to the setting, and explores new territory within the World.\nFind your true destiny. Live these secret myths. Embrace your new fate.\nCover design subject to change.\nScion: Dragon builds on the foundation of Scion: Origin, taking the game to the in-between spaces kept dark as the bright light of divinity shines elsewhere. It is a game about playing both sides against the middle as you desperately try to find a foothold in the World, all the while discovering who you are and what you want.\nPlay as long-lost descendants of Dragons, called Heirs, who act as agents and operatives enacting their ancestors\u2019 will as they delve into draconic history and memory. The World knows Dragons primarily through the mythology told to them by pantheons. Some of this is true; some is what Dragons would call propaganda. An Heir may descend from Dragons, but she knows just as little about dragon kind as any other mortal. The truth about Dragons is steeped in mystery, and they prefer it that way. Better to keep hidden than to risk getting wrapped up in the Fate of the pantheons. Better to wait until the Gods and Titans wear one another down than to join the fight directly. Better to amass power for a decisive strike than to play your hand too soon. As the Heir becomes more embroiled in her Dragon patron\u2019s schemes, she learns more of the truth, and must choose if she wants to be a player in their game, or forge her own path.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nScion: Dragon details the stories of Heirs, those chosen by Dragons to act within The World as their agents. It is the story of discovering history, subverting enemies, and espionage. Your Draconic patron seeks to embroil you in millennia old plots and ancient grudges as shadowy manipulators. All the while, you must learn their secrets, and either embrace the Dragon\u2019s goals for you or make your own.\nThe Scion: Dragon is a standalone game in the World of Scion, and is meant for use with Scion: Origin. Inside, you will find:\nCharacter creation system for Heirs; those chosen by Dragons to enact their plots in The World.\nKnacks, Spells, and all the draconic magic wielded by Heirs, powered by the Storypath System.\nSix Flights: Draq, Joka, Lindwurm, Long, Naga, and Serpent Dragons, all suitable for patronage of your Heirs.\nInformation about The World from the Dragon\u2019s perspective, complete with plots and hooks to get your characters deep into draconic intrigue.\nCover design subject to change.\nMasks of the Mythos is a sourcebook for Scion: Origin and Scion: Hero. While the majority of Scion focuses on real-world mythologies and religions, Masks of the Mythos is a step off that path into a more fictitious World. The material presented here is as canonical to an ongoing Scion campaign as every individual Storyguide and group wish it to be.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nThe book includes the information needed to create Mythos Scions and dive into the dread-soaked cursed towns that thrive under the insidious nature of the Mythos. It\u2019s possible for Scions of other deities to fall under the sway of the Mythos and serve their alien needs. The threats and encounters in this book have been balanced to challenge those seeking Demigod-hood, and the Mythos Scions themselves seeking transcendence.\nSome highlights of Masks of the Mythos include:\nAn entire new pantheon: the Mythos\nA trove of new Callings and relics\nExpanded investigation rules\nA detailed tour of the Miskatonic Hollow, including Arkham and Innsmouth\nAn introductory scenario for a new band of Scions\nThe goal of this project is a little different than previous Onyx Path kickstarter campaigns. Instead of funding the development of a single core book or supplement, this campaign is designed to develop two new divergent projects at the same time. Both books are designed to take the Scion Second Edition roleplaying game in new directions and explore previously uncharted areas. With this campaign, we're hoping to fund the development and production of Scion: Masks of the Mythos and Scion: Dragon and open up even more storytelling possibilities in the World of Scion. You can choose a reward tier that focuses on either of these books (or both!), but all support will go towards both projects, which will be worked on in tandem. \nYour support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for these books. We hope to not only deliver beautiful books to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run for each to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the forgotten world of Scion: Dragon and the alien world of Scion: Masks of the Mythos, possibly creating additional content in the form of multi-part Companion books, including additional antagonists and challenges, expanding pantheons, new dragon Flights, setting and system expansions, and more. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore these thrilling worlds.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to new worlds; new settings for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of expanding this game into new directions \u2014 and like our protagonists, forging our destinies. When you back this project, you join our pantheon as we create our story together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($35,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nWith two different main rewards, and different options for adding Scion Second Edition core books to your list of rewards, the pledge options can become quite complicated. To try to help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core rewards and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nClick to load a PDF of the Reward Tier Chart\nPick Your Path: Are you primarily interested in the hidden history of Scion: Dragon, and looking to uncover this secret third faction stuck in the middle of the war between Titans and Gods? Are you ready to embrace the unknown and alien, using Scion: Masks of the Mythos to add a bizarre new pantheon to your game? Or are you hoping to add both new options to your Scion Second Edition game, opening new paths for your story to explore?\nThe Reward Tier Chart divides the rewards by path. Check out the DRAGON pledge tiers if you're only interested in Scion: Dragon. Look at the MYTHOS pledge tiers if you only want Scion: Masks of the Mythos. Or follow the DUAL PATH pledge tiers if you want both books included in your rewards list.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nDecide Your Destiny: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover rulebook? Are you interested in the new book created by this campaign, or looking to add on the relevant Scion Second Edition core book(s) as well? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nImmortalize Yourself: A few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including an option to act as a Art Model, as well as a chance to name an NPC included in a supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions and the FAQs at the bottom of this page for more details.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nMerchant Options: We love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Scion Second Edition new books campaign, we have created two special Reward Tiers just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the MYTHOS + DRAGON RETAIL Reward Tier level will get 5 copies each of the Scion: Masks of the Mythos and Scion: Dragon hardcover books (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store. Similarly, any retailer who pledges at the mighty MYTHOS + DRAGON RETAIL SUITE Reward Tier level will get 5 copies of both books (Dragon, Masks of the Mythos), as well as 5 copies of the related Scion Second Edition rulebooks (Origin, Hero).\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscripts for Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nSCION: DRAGON BACKER PDF VERSION - The digital version of Scion: Dragon, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. \nSCION: MASKS OF THE MYTHOS BACKER PDF VERSION - The digital version of Scion: Dragon, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. \nBACKER PDF VERSIONS - Kickstarter backers will receive a redemption links for an early versions of these books, before they go on sale to the public. These initial \"Backer Versions\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When they have been updated to the final versions, they will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nSCION: DRAGON HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of this book. \nSCION: MASKS OF THE MYTHOS HARDCOVER VERSION - The other main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of this book. \nHARDCOVER BOOKS: Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover versions also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nSCION: ORIGIN PDF and HARDCOVER - Scion is a game about Gods and humanity, and everything in between. It\u2019s a game about mythic Deeds and the reasons people talk about those mythic Deeds. Scion: Origin details the Scions when they\u2019re still (mostly) human, before the Visitation that introduces them to the divine World \u2014 they\u2019re exceptional humans, perhaps, blessed with luck and skill or cursed with ill fortune and strange trials in their lives, but humans nonetheless.\nSCION: HERO PDF and HARDCOVER - Scion: Hero details the children of the Gods when they have been touched by the divine, awakening to the miraculous power their parents wield. But this great power comes with grave responsibility. The Scions must negotiate both the human World and the divine one, acting as intermediaries and shielding the worshippers of their parents from harm. Can they struggle to fulfill their Fate and still remain tied to what they care for most? Note this is not a stand-alone rulebook. Scion: Origin has the necessary core rules for the game.\nSCION SECOND EDITION REFERENCE SCREEN - A sturdy three-panel screen featuring beautiful art from Scion 2nd Edition on the outer side, and on the inside there's a selection of charts and other info to make referencing a little bit easier.  Limited stock remaining from the first Scion Second Edition kickstarter campaign.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nOPTIONAL DISCOUNTED PoD VERSION \u2013  For this Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos campaign, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy of the PDF books included in your list of rewards directly from their PoD partners at discounted cost (as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping; this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the books have gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the books from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply include the necessary Add On amount indicated to the Bonus Support portion of your Pledge \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\n PHYSICAL REWARDS \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books, etc.) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of either the Scion: Dragon or Scion: Masks of the Mythos (Reward Tiers of $50+).

Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list for backers of the relevant Stretch Goal path. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\n[ALL BACKERS] At $146,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Dragon VTT Tokens \u2013 Digital assets for the signature characters and key antagonists from Scion: Dragon will be created and added to the rewards list for all backers.\n[DRAGON] At $152,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Dragon Companion \u2013 Spells and Transformations \u2013 Expanded rules for spells and transformations will be added to the Scion: Dragon Companion PDF.\n[MYTHOS] At $158,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion \u2013 Additional Mythos Creatures \u2013 A trio of unusual antagonists will be created and detailed in the Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion PDF.\n[ALL BACKERS] At $161,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Masks of the Mythos VTT Tokens \u2013 Digital assets for the signature characters and key antagonists from Scion: Masks of the Mythos will be created and added to the rewards list for all backers.\n[MYTHOS] At $167,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion - Demigod Tier Play \u2013  A section on playing Scions of the Mythos at Demigod level, and enemies to oppose Scions of Demigod tiers, such as Dagon and Masks of the Old Ones, will be created and added to the Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion PDF.\n [DRAGON] At $173,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Dragon Scenario \u2013 A new scenario for Scion: Dragon will be created added to the Scion: Dragon Companion PDF.\n\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Scion: Dragon or Scion: Masks of the Mythos hardcover book), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at $30+ reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the hardcover book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nPledge to the campaign at the Scion Supporter reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at one of the the Retailer Tiers for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\n\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed nearly 50 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

Your support helps us create the additional materials we think will add to the entire Deadlands experience!\nArchetype Cards\nOur Archetype Cards allow players to jump into Blood Drive or any other Deadlands game quickly.

They come with Booster Rewards built-in rather than Stretch Goals. We're definitely going to print them on our own no matter what and want you to know that up front, but are asking for your backing so we can order the right amount and most importantly, create the extras that add to the entire experience for all of us\u2014like maps, pawns, and additional Archetype Cards. We play too, and we want all these goodies as much as we hope you do!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is very fortunate and grateful to have a loyal and established group of friends and fans who enjoy playing our games, but it's sometimes very hard to get our products to you. We love game stores and sell to them through our fulfillment partners at Studio2 and through traditional distribution, but we also know many of you don't have a store in your neighborhood, or your local store just doesn't carry our games.\nFor those that do, great! Retailers who want in on our Kickstarters get discounted versions of the rewards including Stretch Goals for them and their customers. If you're a retailer, just sign up to our newsletter for all the details. (And gamers, please feel free to let your local store know!) Retailers also get their rewards when backer orders go out, usually several weeks before they show up in the traditional distribution chain.\nIn sum...\nIf you want Blood Drive and the extras we're offering with it, back this Kickstarter Booster.\nIf you want Blood Drive but prefer to support your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the Digital reward level here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later next year. (But be sure to tell them or they might not order it on their own!)\nDeadlands is the premier Weird Western setting. You can download the free Test Drive, here to see what it's all about.\nIf you missed the Deadlands: the Weird West Kickstarter, you can still get in on the action through the pledge manager, which is still open. Anything you add through that pledge manager will be delivered as soon as it arrives in our warehouse in early 2021.\nYou'll be able to add these items to your Blood Drive order in the Pledge Manager.\nYou can also add on our other Deadlands products once we launch the Blood Drive pledge manager (available sometime after this Kickstarter Booster closes and funds). There you'll be able to add on extras like the Deadlands core boxed set, pawns, the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign, town maps, Action Cards, Bennies, and more!\nSpread the word!\nIt's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to help boost the signal, you can do so using the following channels. Much obliged, amigo!\nBlood Drive is written and in layout. Your support allows us to create the extras and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the book and cards a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website  first, then through DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. \nWe'll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter through the pledge manager, but below is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\n*Prices exclusive of VAT/GST, shown in USD. We will collect and pay customs in the pledge manager. USA backers pay no additional shipping on Add Ons!\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box, but the Book Only tier will likely ship in a padded envelope).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Welcome, Retailer!\" Newsletter here for the basics we recommend for your store!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time).

Opportunity arises when the aging bard Dradoki Bronzeleaf hires the party to escort him to the Broadreach Horizon. The perilous voyage takes the group through titanspawn infested lands, but should they survive, they arrive at the last bastion of uncorrupted wood in the Hornsaw Forest. There they meet the clans of the Broadreach elves and a century of hollow legionnaires dispatched to the Forest of Blood to offer aid and friendship.\nBut a dark shadow looms over the accursed wood. The necromancers of Glivid-Autel sew corruption and death throughout the Hornsaw Forest. Legionnaires, elves, and dwarves go missing. A horrific infection appears, seemingly targeting the legionnaires. The adventurers are called on to stand against these foul machinations that threaten peace, prosperity, and life itself across central Ghelspad. They may find allies in the Broadreach Horizon, the Gleaming Valley, and perhaps even the bloody canopies of the Hornsaw Forest, if they are brave enough to answer the call to adventure!\nDead Man\u2019s Rust is a mega-adventure for fifth edition fantasy, set in Onyx Path's Scarred Lands setting! This book contains:\nA complete campaign taking characters from level 1 to 10\nDetailed write-ups of four major locations in central Ghelspad: the Broadreach Horizon, The Gleaming Valley, the Hornsaw Forest, and the necromancer\u2019s stronghold of Glivid-Autel.\nNew playable options including races, subraces, and subclasses\nNew monsters, magic items, and more!\nThe Dead Man's Rust Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable Onyx Path to create a  hardcover setting supplement  that will sit proudly alongside your existing Scarred Lands 5th Edition books, including the Scarred Lands Player's Guide and the Scarred Lands Creature Collection. The book will be approximately 180 full-color pages featuring  evocative fantasy artwork. Exception funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including virtual tools to aid online play and possibly more character options and location details! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nDead Man's Rust provides a complete mega-campaign, with deadly new threats, interesting and lively locations, and many potential new allies and enemies. This book includes:\n Chapter One: Twilight of the Bard - In Leoni, an elderly dwarven bard asks for help travelling to the Broadreach Horizon, where he wants to spend his final days. The journey is dangerous, introduces suspicious enemies, and presents the potential to uncover a threat that can harm all of the Scarred Lands.\n Chapter Two: The Broadreach Horizon - Arriving at the Broadreach Horizon puts the heroes face to face with elusive dwarves and elf clans, with their own relationships to each other. Rewards await those who help the clans deal with some of their current challenges.\n Chapter Three: The Hornsaw Forest - The party ventures into the forest, seeking a missing squad of Hollow Legionnaires. They will face dangerous threats including titan-worshipping cults, wildlife that has been twisted by Mormo\u2019s blood, and titanspawn that make their home in the wretched woods. The investigation produces rusted remains of legionnaires, providing more questions than answers.\n Chapter Four: The Gleaming Valley - The adventurers deliver the rusted remains of the lost legionnaires to the Gleaming Valley. Investigation reveals that the fallen legionnaires died of a strong disease, originating from a True Ritual. As plans are formed to combat this disease, Glivid-Autel mounts a siege on Citadel, meaning to spread Legionnaires\u2019 Rust deeper into the lands of the hollow knights and hollow legionnaires.\n Chapter Five: Glivid-Autel - The party must infiltrate Glivid-Autel and get inside the Sanctum of Lucian Daine, the foul necromancer known as the Gray Messiah. There they must recover the secrets of Legionnaires\u2019 Rust without joining the necromancer\u2019s undead servants.\n Chapter Six: Peace in the Valley - With the notes on Legionnaires\u2019 Rust secured the party must return to the Golden Citadel and help develop a cure, while repelling attackers from Glivid-Autel.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Scarred Lands: Dead Man's Rust that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Scarred Lands, possibly creating additional content in the form of digital assets, scenarios, creatures, and other game options. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this thrilling world.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world \u2014 and like our fantasy characters, this goal gives us a common cause. When you back this project, you join our party as we create our story together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($15,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core rewards and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nClick to load a PDF version of this chart\nPick A Path: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover book? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Centurion of the Valley tier, which offers 2 copies of the book (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Dead Man's Rust campaign, we have created two special Reward Tiers just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Merchant Retailer Reward Tier level will get 5 copies of the Dead Man's Rust hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store. Similarly, any retail who pledges at the epic Mercantile Master Retailer Reward Tier will get 5 copies of each of the three Scarred Lands 5th Edition hardcover rulebooks (Scarred Lands Player's Guide, Creature Collection, and Dead Man's Rust).\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from the ability to name an NPC included in the Dead Man's Rust adventure, an option to act as an interior illustration Art Model, as well as a chance to participate in an online Scarred Lands game session! We've even got a few slots that include will have Onyx Path's own Scarred Lands developer, Travis Legge, act as a coach, helping you develop, write, and release a supplement as part of the Slarecian Vault Community Content program. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions and the FAQs at the bottom of this page for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Dead Man's Rust. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nSCARRED LANDS: DEAD MAN'S RUST PDF VERSION - The digital version of Dead Man's Rust, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a redemption link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nSCARRED LANDS: DEAD MAN'S RUST HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover version of this book. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nSCARRED LANDS 5E PLAYER'S GUIDE - Available as an Add On reward, the Scarred Lands Player's Guide provides you with all of the basic information you'll need to run a campaign on Ghelspad, the most populous continent of Scarn. Including historical and religious details, class and culture game information, character archetypes and backgrounds, new equipment and enchantments, this book can take your Fifth Edition fantasy game into bold new directions.\nSCARRED LANDS 5E CREATURE COLLECTION - Available as an Add On reward, the Scarred Lands Creature Collection presents more than 175 creatures from the Scarred Lands setting, though they can easily enhance any 5E setting or campaign. Also featuring a host of tools to help you find the perfect monster for any encounter you\u2019re building, appendices of battle maps, encounter seeds and a Challenge Rating index.\nOPTIONAL DISCOUNTED PoD VERSION \u2013  For Dead Man's Rust, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at a discounted cost plus shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. On the desktop, you can select Add Ons after you've chosen your pledge tier. If using the Kickstarter mobile app, simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nThe Scarred Lands 5E Supplement PDF bundle includes Wise & The Wicked, The Blood Sea, and the Spiragos Saga!\n\n PHYSICAL REWARDS \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books, etc.) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of Dead Man's Rust (Reward Tiers of $55+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when Dead Man's Rust becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nUNLOCKED! - At $16,000 in funding \u2013 VTT Tokens & Map Pack: Journey to Broadreach Horizon \u2013 Digital assets will be created to support online play for 1-2 encounters in Dead Man\u2019s Rust, including location maps and necessary character and creature tokens.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at Hollow Knight reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the hardcover book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nPledge to the campaign at the  Adventurer reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Merchant or Mercantile Master) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed nearly 50 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Dead Man's Rust is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects before the estimate, and some of our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive access to the Backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}], "stat": ["27 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Hollow Legionnaire", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Dead Man's Rust.\nINCLUDES:\nDead Man's Rust PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2022"}], "stat": ["157 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Hollow Knight", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Dead Man's Rust.\nINCLUDES:\nDead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2022"}], "stat": ["58 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Hero of the Hornsaw", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover version of Dead Man's Rust.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nDead Man's Rust Hardcover Book\nDead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2023"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["224 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Centurion of the Valley", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and the hardcover version of Dead Man's Rust.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2023"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 155 or more", "title": "Merchant **Retail Reward Tier**", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only ** Contact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of Dead Man's Rust.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2023"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Scribe of Legend", "descp": "As a special reward, you will submit a name that will be used for a Non-player Character (NPC) which will be incorporated into the Scarred Lands setting (via supplemental PDF if necessary).

Do not read its contents. Walk away, live your simple life, and keep these creatures of darkness in the shadows where they belong.\nOpening your eyes to this horrible world, where demons possess dolls, the undead stalk the night, the Devil walks among us, and mummies march from their tombs, is an act of incredible bravery, or perhaps, complete foolishness. Turn away now, before it\u2019s too late\u2026\nNo? Well, in that case, I introduce you to a little game we can play, called \nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! is a dramatic, hammy, and horrifying tabletop roleplaying game encompassing the shock, terror, eroticism, and humor of 1970s horror. This game allows you to play with all the magnificent content from the movies of Hammer, Amicus, and Roger Corman, and promises fun and thrills of the horror movie genre!\nIn They Came from Beyond the Grave! you play humans faced with the horrors of the supernatural. You\u2019ll find yourself pitted against vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and constructed critters, along with demons, slashers, and THE DEVIL HIMSELF. Adventures range from the one-shot exploration of a haunted house, to the multi-era play across the 19th century and 1970s.\nArtwork by Ken Meyer Jr.\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! contains a mix of serious threat, unmitigated ham, and nonsensical farce. We never tell you what is amusing and what is not, but we do provide you with the tools to make a seriously fun game incorporating all the elements of 1970s horror movies. This game provides rules for funny quips and amusing cinematics for incorporation in a story, along with dozens of special powers and story devices.\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! uses the Storypath System, provided in full in the pages of this book!\nThis They Came from Beyond the Grave!  Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable Onyx Path to create a hardcover rulebook, a print-and-play PDF of Quip and Cinematic cards, and a Director screen to aid play. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including more scenarios and additional threats! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nDesign not final, still in progress.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover rulebook with a dynamic cover and full-color interior art. We estimate the book will be more than 200+ pages and will be traditionally printed on high quality paper stock. In addition, we want to create a print-and-play PDF with more than 120 Quip and Cinematic cards to use in-game.\nArtwork by Brian Leblanc\n Chapter One: Archetypes - This is where you\u2019ll meet this game\u2019s playable Archetypes. The Dupe, the Hunter, the the Mystic, the Professor, and the Raconteur each occupy different roles popular in the horror movies listed previously.\n Chapter Two: Character Creation - If you\u2019ve chosen the Archetype that appeals to you and already have the kernel of a character concept in mind, here\u2019s where you go to flesh that character out in full.\n Chapter Three: Skills and Attributes - Your selection of abilities is an important, defining aspect of your character, which is why Skills and Attributes get their own chapter where they\u2019re all detailed for your pleasure.\n Chapter Four: System - The Director will want to read this chapter to get a handle on how to run and play They Came from Beyond the Grave! This chapter breaks down the basics of dice rolling all the way through to Complications on actions, Conditions for characters, and scenes involving clue-solving, drama, and death. The players should scan through this chapter after creating characters just to discover the basics.\n Chapter Five: Cinematic Powers - Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll find some of the best powers and tools for your horror games. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to insert a missing reel to escape peril, produce copious amounts of blood to fake your own death, score points for coming up with a cutting one-liner at just the right moment, or explode with amazing Stunts when you succeed spectacularly, this is going to be a fun read.\n Chapter Six: Monsters - What is a horror movie without a monster? Oh, some of them are human and fragile enough, but this chapter contains everything from Stalking Killers to Dracula, and Possessed Dolls to Abaddon, the Locust King. You\u2019ll find no shortage of enemies to incorporate into stories and base entire plots around right here.\n Chapter Seven: The Director\u2019s Chair - All the advice an aspiring Director could need to run a game to hit a certain tone or mood, including a dissection of the different kinds of horror movies you might wish to emulate. This chapter goes into full detail of what a Director should and shouldn\u2019t do to really get that 1970s horror movie feel across.\n Chapter Eight: This Horrible World - Maybe this is your first RPG, or perhaps you\u2019re struggling to come up with sets, events, and plots for your game of They Came from Beyond the Grave! Whatever the case, this chapter contains everything you need to start the flow of ideas. Both the 1970s and the 19th century, as they appear in films, are detailed lovingly for your use.\n Chapter Nine: Scenarios - Two full scenarios, one involving the machinations of THE DEVIL HIMSELF, another embracing the characters, stories, and mysteries of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s trove of stories, each ready to run directly from the book.\n Appendix One - Here we have the list of Quips present in the Cinematic Powers chapter, but easily locatable near the back of the book. This appendix is especially useful for players lacking a deck of Quip cards.\n Appendix Two - Here you\u2019ll find a helpful list of Stunts and Cinematics, stating their names and costs.\nArtwork by Aaron Riley\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! is powered by Onyx Path's Storypath system, and includes all the rules you need to play as a brave (or foolhardy) hero dealing with supernatural threats, including rules for creating characters with a mix of options to customize your Archetype. It also has ready-to-play scenarios, along with information on the cinematic version of the 19th century and 1970s that you can incorporate into your game with a new spooky atmosphere. And, finally, dozens of antagonists, including a chaotic assembly of horrific haunts that create a host of locations and events for players and Directors to explore.\nThe Storypath system is Onyx Path's rules set designed specifically to allow the sort of rules scaling necessary to seamlessly enable players to play ordinary people as well as mystics and monster hunters.\nThe basics of the Storypath system should be familiar to anyone who has played many other Onyx Path games of action-adventure or heroic exploits, as it is a 10-sided dice pool system, where in order to resolve an action you basically roll a number of dice equal to the character's Skill + Attribute and must roll an 8 or better a certain number of times in order to succeed in the action.\nThat is the very basic resolution system, but we expand on that to further enhance how your gaming group can build their stories. Failing to hit your number of successes, or having more successes than your required amount, are built-in options in the rules. Here is a handy graphic that illustrates what we mean:\nTo further explain the basics of the Storypath system, here is a small PDF download that goes into more detail: SYSTEM PREVIEW PDF.\nHere's a video of THEY CAME from BEYOND the GRAVE! in action...\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of They Came from Beyond the Grave! that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of They Came from Beyond the Grave!, possibly creating additional content in the form of scenarios, threats, and ready-made characters. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this thrilling world.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world \u2014 and like our protagonists, this mission binds us with common purpose. When you back this project, you join our amazing cast of characters as we create our adventure together.\nArtwork by Brian Leblanc\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($20,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick this image to summon forth a larger version of this chart... from places beyond!\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nKey Decision: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover rulebook? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nArtwork by Luis Sanz\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Evil Twins Reward Tier, which offer copies of the rulebook (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this They Came from Beyond the Grave! campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"Dark House of Blood and Shadows\") will get 5 copies of the hardcover rulebook (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nArtwork by Brian Leblanc\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a Signed Book Insert (autographed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle), an option to act as a Art Model, as well as a chance to name an NPC included in the They Came from Beyond the Grave!  rulebook or a possible supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for They Came from Beyond the Grave!

Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For They Came from Beyond the Grave!, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Aaron Riley\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at The Physical Manifestation of Suffering reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the hardcover book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nPledge to the campaign at the The Living Dead reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Dark House of Blood and Shadows) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork by Luis Sanz\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork by Aaron Riley\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for They Came from Beyond the Grave! is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The Living Dead", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Gremlin in the Walls", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF copy of They Came from Beyond the Grave!\nINCLUDES:\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave!

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.\nNight, however, brings a new terror.\nPlayers take on the roles of members of the Chinese family (mostly from Guangdong province), spanning three generations, who face threats of jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and racism by day. It has players balancing the responsibility of maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the dreaded Jiangshi. This is primarily a game about storytelling. Combat is limited, but horror, drama and sometimes comedy are the primary vehicles for driving the game forward.\nJiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a tabletop roleplaying game which combines elements of RPGs with those of traditional board games. The game can be played as a \"mini-series\" or a one-shot.\nEach game takes place over a number of days (usually five), alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place.  Day and night have different threats - in the daytime, the restaurant may experience racism or gang violence, while in the night time, Jiangshi are seeking warm bodies. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. \nEvery morning, the Game Moderator deals out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Each Restaurant card needs from 1 hour to 3 hours to complete. Usually, the oldest member of the family takes charge and starts delegating the tasks to specific players. Each player uses their Resilience slots to complete tasks, indicated by the time and energy they have available to do it.\nOnce the tasks have been completed to the best of the family\u2019s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant\u2019s slots.\nRestaurant Board\nPrior to starting the morning scenes, the first thing each character must do is see how they\u2019re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters. \nSome of the Mung cards are in color which represent good dreams. Other Mung are in black and white, which represents bad dreams. When a player receives a bad Mung card, they place it in one of the card slots on their Character sheet, covering a trait (Item, Skill, Facet, etc.), in numerical order. While covered, a trait cannot be used. To rid themselves of a bad Mung, a character needs to talk about the bad Mung card with another player character during the afternoon or evening scenes. Once they\u2019ve talked about it, they can discard the card.\nArtwork by Sadia Bies\nAfter receiving their Mung cards, players take turns explaining their dreams to each other and the GM. \nDescribe the dream or nightmare based on the image on the cards\nWhat are these visions like and what do they mean, if anything?\nOn subsequent mornings, any remaining Mung cards from previous rounds are kept as recurring nightmares that continue to plague the player character. They will roll the 1D4 as usual for more Mung cards, but instead of adding that number of cards to their character sheet, the result indicates the maximum number of Mung cards that the player character has to deal with this day.\nCharacter Sheet\nThe Character Sheet has several details about the player character that a player can fill out. During the game, Resilience slots may get covered up by Mung cards or Jiangshi cards. A character takes a Jiangshi card when they take stress or physical damage. When a Resilience slot gets covered by a Jiangshi card or a Mung card, that detail about the PC gets removed from play until they are healed. If a PC gets a Jiangshi card on a slot that already has a Mung card, they will remove the Mung card and replace it with the new Jiangshi card.\nOnce they have all 8 slots filled with Jiangshi cards, the player will then become a Jiangshi and they would flip over all the Jiangshi cards to reveal their new Skills. Though this fate can be terrifying, these cards can be healed and removed through game play. \nArtwork by Steven Wu\nPlayers can create Spirit Papers by taking a slip of paper and writing a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. Spirit Papers can only be used once during the night time phases.\nThe GM must count to ten in secret while the family is thinking of their word or sentence. If the time expires and the family has not yet agreed upon what to write on the Spirit Paper, the Spirit Paper will not work.\nIf the Spirit Paper works (i.e. a meaningful phrase or sentence was written with the 10-second time limit), the Jiangshi has been immobilized and players can move onto healing their family member or evading the Jiangshi they\u2019re faced with.\nThe whole group of non-GM players starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the first day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings levy on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.\nWhen a player is determining the outcome of a challenge they are engaged with, they roll all the dice in the Family pool at once and take the highest single value from one of the dice that they rolled as their outcome. Once per scene, a character can use one of their skills to reroll the dice pool to try to achieve a better result. \nTo determine the highest single value from a roll, complete the following steps:\n Clean house! Check for 4\u2019s in the pool: For every die that is showing a 4 in the pool, cancel out a die from the pool that is showing the highest value in the pool along with the die showing the 4, placing them back on the Day/Night Tracker.\n   Check for highest valued D8 in pool: The higher the die roll, the better the outcome.\nMing is rolling the Family pool to cook a feast for visiting dignitaries on Day 1. Ming\u2019s first roll results in the following: 1 2 2 3 4 4 - their highest result is a 2 as the two 4s cancel out the 3 and one of the 2s, respectively! Wanting to impress their guests, Ming uses their Cooking Skill and rerolls the Family pool, ending up with the following result: 1 3 3 4 7 8. Their highest result is 7 because the 8 is cancelled out by the 4. Wiping their brow, Ming's character breathes a sigh of relief and serves a gorgeous noodle dish to the members of the San Francisco city council.\nArtwork by Steven Wu\n\nThis game rewards player characters for failing, because it makes for a more interesting story! When a failure happens, the player who rolled receives an Individual die. The GM will also give player characters a die towards their Individual Pool when something occurs that makes their character happy or hopeful towards their Hopes and Dreams (labeled on their character sheet).\nWhile the main use of Individual dice is to assist other players, a player character may add any number of their Individual dice to their own Challenge rolls. If they do this, ALL of the dice they use in this way are returned to the GM once the Challenge roll is resolved.\nPlaying a Chinese Character\nThis game isn\u2019t just for Asian-Americans - this game can be played by anyone! Just remember that the topics deal with some very real history and politics (Jiangshi aside).\n\nHere are some tips on how to play:\nAvoid using accents\nAvoid exoticizing the culture - mysticism sometimes paints a culture in a very flat and two-dimensional way, so try to stay away from fortune cookies\nTreating the characters with respect is very important, so try to stay away from stereotypes. Not every Asian knows kung-fu, for example. In fact, Martial Arts is a Skill that only some player characters might have chosen for their character sheet.\nDo a little bit of research before playing. You don\u2019t have to have a degree in Asian studies, but just know what you\u2019re getting into.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Game and a Curry brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly. Many of these adventure stretch goals are to be digital goals, potentially collected into another volume later, and will have no impact on the delivery of the main product.\n\nQ: Have you produced all these items before?\nA: Between Wet Ink Games, Game and a Curry, and our production partners, all of these components have been made before and are well within our capabilities to produce using industry best practices.\n\nQ: What if shipping costs increase?\nA: Shipping costs are well beyond our control. We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase.

This manual will dive you into a dark world full of terror and despair. The Undeads come back from the afterlife, and eternal beings crave the nullification of reality. You will face ancient horrors, but you will also come to know superstition and occultism, and you will learn to follow the Moon as the only guide in this nocturnal world.\nIn this ruthless setting, players will play night explorers, resilient survivors who adapted to the Lunar Age, an era where the sun is dead, and life still endures only thanks to the last Primordial beings.\nEmbrace the darkness!\n\u201cThou wilt tip the balance since, on thy conduct, fate lies for what is left of us all. Be steady in front of darkness, do not let thy heart cede, and may the Moon lead thee through the silent lands of the continent.\u201d\nNightfell will be published both in Italian and English.\n If the project is successful, we will consider localization in other languages!\nNightfell takes place in the Known Lands of I\u00f9rmen, during the dark times known as The Lunar Age.\nThe World you are going to face is cold and desolate. There are few inhabited settlements, and most races are now extinct. Nights are gloomy, but days show no sun nor Moon and are even more terrifying. Life in these lands persists only thanks to the faint breath of life left to the Primes, deities who are intrinsic to nature and still stand uncorrupted by the dark beings who have breached the Material Plane.\nThe prophecy of the Fourth Truth is now fulfilled, and the dark dimension of \u00c8nferun now corrupts the World. Adventurers in the World of I\u00f9rmen are usually those embracing the power of darkness to use it against the creatures of the night, or rising as a source of faith and hope for survivors. They will face a hostile environment and try not to let themselves be overwhelmed by entities that will try to enslave their spirit. Eventually, they will have to find a way to counter the destruction of reality.\nYou will face ancient deadly forests and grimdark forgotten territories.\nDuring your night travels in the land of I\u00f9rmen, you will find a lot of abandoned villages from the previous Era.\nThe Moon, called Mirithlen, is a goddess who bestowed her radiance on the pale satellite, lighting the nights up without any aid from the sun (the fallen god, Hollon). You will learn to fear and respect her since she will influence many aspects of your journey. She can give you power and courage, assist you in exorcisms, or you can invoke her name through Lunar Divination to ask her for a blessing. Beware, though, since such blessings can also benefit the monstrous creatures that await in the darkness. Some are even more ruthless during some Lunar Phases and appear only during other ones, giving life to a monster-hunting system hinged on the superstition that concerns them.\nLearn how to survive in a world populated by terrible creatures.\nThe use of magic has radically changed over the ages. In the Lunar Age, the sources of eldritch power by which spellcasters thrive are now corrupted by darkness, and usage of magic is now a dangerous practice. The arcane balances scholars of magic used to study are vanishing, and the real power of magic can quickly wear out the souls of practitioners.\nThe use of spells will cost you the very shards of your soul, making spellcasting a priceless resource. The greater your powers, the more dangerous to handle.\nDecades of darkness and death drew the Material Plane closer to the Black Reflection from a morphological and a climatic perspective. The sun no longer warms beaches, mountains, valleys, and green plains are infrequent. Most woods died or became spectral, cloaked by mist and silence. The presence of the last Primes still grants some life, the cultivation of the most resistant plants, and the persistence of some woods and meadows.\nEverything changed, and there is nothing more to smile about, if not the bright aurora that lights up the skies in those rare nights.\nNightfell is a brand new setting for 5th ed. We'll produce a Corebook and a Bestiary!\nAll mock-ups are temporary and the final product may undergo some changes.\nThe manuals will consist of about 200 pages each. A Bestiary with almost 100 new creatures, with monsters dedicated to lore and others inspired by Italian folklore, each and everyone painstakingly adjusted to fit the setting and its dreadful atmosphere. The corebook will contains rich original lore, entire chapters about the background and the history of I\u00f9rmen, religions, and cultures, and description of iconic places for your campaigns. Along with these contents, there will also be a broad study on ethnic groups, including new original alphabets.\nOne of the new alphabets in the book.\nThe Explored Lands of I\u00f9rmen. Dive into this decaying world!\nThe game will encompass several new, dark fantasy flavored playable races, along with new archetypes for the classes of the most famous role-playing game in the World, new backgrounds for your characters, and three new original classes!\nCreate characters who can face the horrors of Enferun!\nHere some of the new options:\n- Lunar Cultist: Soldiers devoted to the worship of Mirithlen, experts in Lunar Divination, and in averting the perils of the night. You will be able to choose which Lunar Phase to be bound to, to gain powerful gameplay benefits.\n- Master of Tradition: These scholars of the arcane and esotericism are masters of knowledge about creatures and legends, coming as invaluable members to parties of night adventurers.\n- Tefillin: Characters who wish to have a closer connection to the Dark World can choose to let themselves be possessed voluntarily by a ghost, becoming Tefillin. Learn how to use your ghost's powers to increase your abilities.\nThere will be also a lot of new archetypes for existing 5e classes.\nThe Nightfell manual comprehends a first \u201dCorebook\u201d, useful for players and masters. Also, we will present 80 new spells dedicated to moon magic, new items and relics are just waiting to be discovered and inspected in the search for their hidden power, and several new game mechanics that will make Nightfell a one of its kind supplement!\nLots of unique items and relics are there to be found in your adventures.\nHere some of the new mechanics:\n Grim Weapons: as you bring down creatures of the night, your weapons absorb their dark essence. When a weapon reaches its Grim Threshold, it will become formidable in fighting abominable creatures, yet a heavy burden to carry, slowly wearing out your soul.\nYour weapons will deteriorate and acquire a will of their own. Grim Weapons are deadly to the creatures of the night, but they are not for anyone to wield.\n Soul Points: In addition to Hit Points, your characters will also have some degree of spiritual sanity to keep in check. When the horrors become too many to bear, when the strain of the night and the assaults of dark enemies will drop your Soul Points to 0, you will be easy prey to shadows and wraiths trying to take over your own body.\n   Influence of the Moon: learn to practice Lunar Divination and learn about the many ways in which the Lunar Phases will affect your game, starting from the mood and powers of your characters, up to the peculiar characteristics of some creatures.\nNew POSSESSED condition for characters and NPCs.\n You can listen an exhaustive interview with Andrea Back, our Game Designer, talking about lore and our New Mechanics here:\n https://comicsclericsandcontrollers.podbean.com/e/s35e5-asking-about-nightfell-with-andrea/?fbclid=IwAR1X5FeSxOHlg3l5_oSd7KB5jsYguzBYzVlUKCSq-PVqNE4lK85j_QwMhto \nHere are some additions to the product:\n  We'll also produce a Deluxe Edition: The Tome of Shadows!\nThe Tome of Shadows will gather together the Nightfell Corebook and Bestiary, a massive 400+ pages book with a black faux leather cover, black foil design, and black book edges.\nEmbrace the Darkness with Nightfell Tome of Shadows!\n- We have dedicated a stretch goal to the production of the lunar dice. This d8 can be used in your sessions to determine the moon phase, practice the Divination, or even in the creation phase of the character when choosing the birth moon!\nWe are ambitious.

Please note that if you select some add-ons starting from a PDF-only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees.\nIn general, you should be able to select an add-on by doing the following:\n 1. Click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n 2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n 3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nYou will choose your add-ons in the pledge manager after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. You will also be able to change your selection later in the pledge manager. You will receive a BackerKit survey to your Kickstarter mail that will introduce you to the pledge manager.\nThe Funding Goal of the Campaign intents to cover the production costs, including (mainly) illustrations, graphics, game design, translations, and printing.\nWe decided to use any other funds to improve your gaming experience, upgrading the contents, and creating new adventures!

I started as an illustrator for a lot of companies, growing up both as artist and author and now I'm putting all my efforts in Nightfell, to design the best product I can! I've always been a Game Master and I design fantasy worlds since I was a child. Now it's time to gather my experience and try something huge: To build an entirely brand new fantasy setting and a new IP! We already have the lore and the settings, we designed the game features that are right now on playtest, and we created most of the graphics, producing some artworks. We need you to fund Nightfell to upgrade the number of the artworks in the book, to translate and to print it. Our only goal is to improve as more as possible the quality of the project, and the experience of the gamers! We are going to make the best that we can, in order to create something new, something dark, something crazy! We intend to respect the commitment made with you in terms of timing and quality.

Lost to history, this time is remembered in the echoes of myth and legend. The land was once besieged by the Horrors, foul creatures from the depths of astral space that seek to feed on and destroy all that is living and good.\nTheir time -- the time of the Scourge -- has passed. The people of the world have returned to the surface reclaiming the lands that were once their home. Brave heroes band together to explore the wilds of Barsaive, fighting the Horrors that remain and protecting their loved ones from those who would dominate and enslave them.\nEarthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game currently in its fourth edition. After more than 25 years it continues to deliver a setting tinged with a compelling mix of high magic and horror flavored with a dash of post-apocalypse and a generous sprinkling of hope.\nWe have released several products for the Earthdawn line in the past five years: Four core rulebooks (Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, Companion, and Mystic Paths), four sourcebooks (Travar: The Merchant City, Elven Nations, Questors, and Iopos: Lair of Deceit), a GM Screen, Quick Start Guide, and several entries in our ongoing Legends of Barsaive adventure series.\nThe next sourcebook is ready to go.

This book details five specific moments and includes setting information, adventure frameworks, and a look into how these events shape their world. With this book, gamemasters can have their players infiltrate an Iopan spy-ring, become involved in the City of Ash's revolution, negotiate a peace in southwest Barsaive, and determine whether or not the City of Thieves is worth saving. Above it all, the dragons and their children look on to determine the actions that must be taken to prepare Barsaive for the future.\nWhile each of these events could potentially serve as a stand-alone campaign, they can also be linked together in an epic-style campaign designed to take characters across western Barsaive and progress them from Fifth to Ninth circle. Empty Thrones provides information you need to set your own adventures in four locales: Councilor Plaza, a district in Iopos's Clansward; the citadels of occupied Jerris; the fishing village of Freewater on the border of Cara Fahd; and Kratas's port-city of Daiche. With adventures hooks, frameworks, and villains designed to threaten tables of Journeyman and Warden tier, this book provides gamemasters with ample resources to support hours of play. \nThe Malachite Seat of Iopos\nCompilation of Adventures\nOver the past few years, we've released a steady stream of interwoven adventures under the Legends of Barsaive banner. These adventures take place in Haven and explore the complex political situation of this self-governed town outside Parlainth. The secrets  hidden in this lost Theran ruin have gathered the attention of both the Kingdom of Throal and the Empire of Thera, while Haven hosts frequent envoys from Blood Wood. In addition to these external forces, a number of Adventuring Companies have been founded and seek to extend their influence in pursuit of individual goals. Players must both navigate these powers and gather allies in Haven if they hope to influence the future of this outpost.\nWe've reached the mid-point of this series and have decided to make a stand-alone product encompassing everything that has been released so far. Legends of Barsaive: Haven Volume 1 is a 400+ page adventure book that will include the eight modules previously only available in ashcan-style paperback booklets. This product will include an expanded version of the Haven guidebook specifically created for this product, which includes setting specific details for the campaign series. This version of the guidebook is currently planned to only be available in this compendium product.\nFor those who have purchased these adventures individually, we thank you for your support! It is only due to your continued interest that we were able to compile this collection. The adventures contained in this collection are reprinted forms of the first eight booklets. As we move forward, all Legends of Barsaive adventures will continue to be released as booklets.\nWork In Progress Cover Art for Haven Volume 1\nRewards and Add-Ons\nBack this Kickstarter, and you get access to the pre-art draft of the manuscript (it will be linked in a backers-only post shortly after the campaign closes). We offer this to show that the text is complete--the  book just needs to make its way through the rest of the production  process. You'll also get early access to what's inside, and will be able to start using it in your game right away!\nWe're offering the new books in PDF and physical versions. We have reward tiers that include previously released books in case you missed our earlier Kickstarters or still weren't aware the game had returned. All the available books are in print and in stock, so there's no additional wait for delivery.\nFor those looking to fill in holes in their collection that an existing pledge bundle doesn't satisfy, we are also offer single-book add-on options. Prices (and additional shipping charges) are as follows:  \nAdd-On Prices\nIndividual add-on books include the PDF version at no additional  charge. If you are adding physical product to a PDF-only tier, the first  book is $10 shipping (even if it is noted as free shipping above), with added costs based on additional books ordered. The reward tiers include standard (softcover) editions. If you want to upgrade any books in a tier from standard to deluxe, add $40 per book.\nFor all add-ons, please include the amount of the add-on in your pledge. You will be able to indicate specific add-on choices as part of  the survey at the end of the campaign. You can adjust your pledge amount  (or change your chosen reward tier) at any point before the campaign  ends.\nUhl Denairastas, First Minister of Iopos by James Austin\nStretch Goals\n**ACHIEVED!** If we reach $10,000 we will produce an 18\" x 24\" poster of the Empty Thrones cover, with a special addition by our Art Director James Austin. The art is already done, we just need to put it into production. Adding on a flat folded version of the poster will be $4 for backers. By popular request, we will also offer a rolled version of the poster shipped separately in tube packaging for $20.\n**ACHIEVED!** If we reach $20,000 we will produce a set of 46 \"personality cards\". These accessories will feature the prominent (and maybe a few not-so-prominent) characters involved in the events of Empty Thrones. Printed on durable cardstock, they will feature a portrait of the character on one side, and a few key pieces of information about them on the other. Great for showing your players what the person they're dealing with looks like.\n**ACHIEVED!** At $25,000 we will finish up work on the digital version of the Barsaive province map as depicted in the Gamemaster's Guide (and available as a poster-size add-on). This has been on the to-do list for a while but back burnered... and this will devote resources to finishing it up and making it available! All backers will get it as a thank-you bonus at no extra charge.\nAt $30,000 our Art Director will create a map of Iopos. This was not included in the sourcebook (to the disappointment of many fans), but we have heard you. This will be a digital release only for now. A physical version will be considered as a goal of a later campaign. \nNew to Earthdawn?\nOriginally released in 1993, Earthdawn was  named one of \"The Millennium's Most Underrated Games\" by Pyramid  magazine in 1999, and 24th in Arcane magazine's 1996 reader poll of the  50 most popular role-playing games of all time. The game delivers a  richly developed setting flavored with high fantasy, post-apocalypse,  and horror. In 2014 a successful Kickstarter brought the fourth edition  to life.\nLong ago the world was alive with magic, giving rise to strange  creatures and exotic races only remembered today in the echoes of myth  and legend. The level of magic rises and falls over thousands of years.  At its height, foul creatures from the depths of the  Netherworlds--called Horrors--breach the barrier between their native plane and ours, leading to a centuries-long time of destruction called the Scourge.\nEarthdawn is set in the aftermath of the most recent Scourge. The player characters are adepts, heroes  who draw on magical powers to explore the world, recover knowledge lost  to the Scourge, and fight those that who threaten the lives of  innocents--including the remaining Horrors. Each adept follows a Discipline,  defining that defines the focus and scope of their magical abilities.  Some adepts hone their combat skills, some enhance their mental and  social abilities, while others learn and cast spells.\nThe core game engine of Earthdawn is the  Step System. As your character gains power and advances along the path  of their Discipline you roll progressively larger dice, with open-ended  rolls allowing for potentially legendary results. Adepts can further  enhance their magical abilities through the use of karma, adding  additional dice to your rolls.\nThe Earthdawn Quick Start Guide (available free at our web shop or on Drive-Thru RPG)  provides a great overview of the game system, examples of the magical  powers available, and includes sample characters and a brief  introductory adventure.  \nA Denairastas Banner by Reece Firman\nReturning to Earthdawn?\nIf you've been away from Earthdawn for a  while, the new edition should be familiar, but a few things have changed  to open up new design space and incorporate lessons learned over the  years.\nThe core game engine remains largely the same. The specific dice used  in a few places have been tweaked to smooth out some bumps in the  underlying probability curves, but still uses all the common  polyhedrals.\nThe game no longer uses the success level table from previous  editions. Instead, every five points over the target number scores an  additional success. This new mechanic has been incorporated into most of  the game's talents, skills, and spells so that--in general--better  rolls mean better results.\nFourth edition keeps the \"talent option\" approach to Disciplines  introduced in third edition, but has refined the required talents to be  more broadly useful, and improves the choices available at each tier to  allow for better customization options.\nSpellcasting includes the concept of extra threads, allowing  magicians to enhance their spells as they cast them. This gives  lower-Circle spells a longer life and more utility over the course of  the character's career.\nThe timeline has been advanced. It is a few years after the Second  Theran War, with a new status quo in Barsaive. In the wake of the war,  the dwarfs of Throal has have a new royal family on the throne and  withdrawn from provincial affairs. In that void, other political powers  expand their influence... including the Denairastas clan of Iopos.\nThis is a great time to get back into the game, and this project  gives you access to the books we've released so far at a discount. Why  not journey back to Barsaive, and build some new legends?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver this product. The text is written, it only needs to make its way through the rest of the production pipeline. We have already completed and released eight books for the Earthdawn Fourth Edition line along with several smaller products.\n\nOf course, any project includes risk. Unforeseen production delays or other issues may crop up that push the release of the final product beyond the currently anticipated date, but we have already factored some wiggle room into our delivery estimates.\n\nWe have learned many lessons from our previous successful kickstarters. While more books are planned and in development, they will not appear as stretch goals for this project so that we can focus on closing out this campaign and delivering all promised rewards in a timely manner.\n\nWhile there may be concerns given the Covid-19 pandemic, our plans should not be overly affected. Our books are printed and bound in the United States, and as of the launch of this campaign our printer is still operating.

Her loss has taken a very heavy toll on her family-- including her FASA family.

I am trying to get back to things here, with the hope that things get back on track. I know some of you probably need responses about things.

(That is not a dirty word! Get your mind out of the gutter, Troubleshooter!)\n The R&D Mission Book: 128 pages giving a busy GM two missions that start the first ever (we think) Paranoia campaign! You also get the Top 10 Best R&D Experiments (filled with three-act structured mission hooks) and advice on adding a trip to R&D into every Troubleshooter mission.

Back in older editions of Paranoia, a trip to R&D for some rather questionable gear was a standard part of Troubleshooter missions. After the briefing, Troubleshooters went to R&D whether they wanted to or not. (Oh, but they wanted to, at least more than they wanted to be terminated.) In the previous edition, this was expanded to become a Service where Troubleshooters did minor but stressful jobs for any of the eight service groups.\nWe grew up playing Paranoia, and have fond memories of all kinds of R&D devices going boom, ping! and sometimes POW BANG POP WHAM WHIZZ CLICK WHIRR, and then boom! To be honest, we missed that! So when we sat down to think of the next expansion for Paranoia, this immediately came to mind. And it would not leave, no matter what we ingested.\nBy launching a Kickstarter for the R&D sourcebox, we can provide unique offers (like designer notes and create-a-device) while offering all-new ways to torment players. (Err, their characters.) As with our Acute Paranoia Kickstarter, all of the sourcebox content (books and cards) has already been written, edited and made ready for citizens everywhere.\nIt also allows us to explore a first for Paranoia: An actual campaign. How is that possible when most Troubleshooter teams have the shelf life of raw soylent? We extended one plot over four different missions. You can keep characters between missions or create new ones, as players will remember what is going on. And yes, this is all centred on an R&D experiment named Project Infinite Hole.\nPledge Levels\nWe have put together a multitude of ways you can demonstrate your loyalty to The Computer, and eagerness to aid R&D with their critical mission to enhance and improve the already perfect Alpha Complex.\nThe R&D Testing Fun Pack!\nR&D is so much fun that we wanted to offer a big reward: The R&D Testing Fun Pack. (Is the testing fun? Are we testing fun? Is the pack full of tests and fun? Yes.) In this commemorative pack, those backing at Green or higher will receive:\n6 Green Pencils for Troubleshooters that say \u2018Fuel Rod (mini)\u2019.\n1 GM Pen that says \u2018Knowing Rules is Treason\u2019.\nSafety Poster Card with real (read: fake) R&D lab warnings such as \u2018Inhaling Particulates is Theft DO NOT BREATHE\u2019 and \u2018If Alarm Sounds, Push People Down and Run Away\u2019.\nPad of R&D Experimental Equipment Release Forms, ready to inflict on your players.\n25 \u2018Heroes of R&D\u2019 trading cards featuring the most important and/or dangerous people, locations and experiments that are part of this fine service group. Also containing rules for dropping them into missions.\nExclusive short mission, never to be found elsewhere: \u2018Smocks!\u2019. An experiment in armour technology goes missing while the Communists fight the Communists for control of the Communists. Guess who gets to fix both problems?\nAll in a special presentation pack!\nThese items are exclusive to the R&D Testing Fun Pack, and will never be available anywhere else!\nStretch Goals\nR&D is all about getting wonderful, cutting-edge devices to Troubleshooters so they can justify budget expenditures. (Also, fight traitors sometimes.) So why not offer our most loyal citizens some cutting-edge stretch goals? They are rather nifty...\n Anyone backing at the Red level or higher will get all unlocked stretch goals as PDFs! Praise Friend Computer!\nPackage Deals\nIn our Traveller Kickstarters, backers could purchase packages to fill out their collections. This proved such a hit that we are now offering Paranoia Package Deals! You can pick any or all of these, and simply add their cost to your pledge level - we will be in touch after the Kickstarter to finalise which packages you pledged for. We will even ship them out as soon as the Kickstarter is over and all your details have been collated (typically within a month of the Kickstarter completing) so there is no waiting!\n\u00a335 The Card Package: Keep your players\u2019 hands full with four card decks: More [REDACTED] Societies, Mutant Explosion, the RAM Deck, and Perfectly Safe Gear.\n\u00a350 The Mission Package: Run your Troubleshooters through completely safe and relaxing missions: Implausible Deniability, Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues, and Truth or Dare.\n\u00a370 The Box Package: Do you really like boxes? Do you also like Paranoia? Then get this package and receive both the Starter box set and the Acute Paranoia expansion box.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of our Kickstarter projects have succeeded and backers received their rewards. That said, we know there is always room for improvement and we continue to learn how to do this better. For example, we are adding more value to pledge levels by offering all stretch goals to anyone backing at Red level or higher. \n\nAs with our previous Paranoia Kickstarter, everything in the sourcebox (including the 120-card R&D Deck) has already been designed, written, and tested on live gamers. (Only a few gamers were hurt in the making of this sourcebox but, in our defence, they kept using their phones at the table.) This lowers the risk since you do not have to wait and hope somebody in the UK writes this thing. (Note: The first four stretch goals are complete, with art and layout complete, and ready for final proofing and printing. We are waiting to see what else gets unlocked before panicking and screaming at freelancers, \u2018THIS OTHER STUFF NEEDS TO BE DONE NAOW!\u2019) \n\nThe coronavirus continues to plague the world, but we have ensured its effects will be minimal as the majority of the actual development of Project Infinite Hole is already done, and we have several different printers alerted on different continents (China, Eastern Europe and North America) so we can select the best choice if and when the virus flares up once more.\n\nLead designer WJ MacGuffin is keeping a suspicious eye on things here on the Kickstarter page, and he will be answering your questions as fast as his old brain can handle. (He is still running Cerebral Coretech 10.15 Minx, so it might take a little while.)\n\nR&D stands for Rebar & Dust. \nR&D stands for Riots & Destruction.\nR&D stands for whatever you want.

We played a lot of board games, card games and tons of RPGs and wanted to create an easy to learn game that relies on a universal language (uses just symbols and icons for all actions - which are easy to learn). The game is also full of tactics and options and demands a mastering of the possibilities and choices as it can be a game of cooperation, individual play, or backstabbing while you play as the Sandman\u2019s undercover ally.\nEasy to learn and easy to dive in mechanics even for inexperienced players\n  Card use easy to learn and accessible symbols\n  A dynamic, fast, and intense system\n  The game is for 2-4 players\nHOW TO PLAY SLEEP TIGHT\nSleep Tight is a 10-20 minute game that is dynamic and fast-paced in terms of decisions and actions. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It\u2019s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?\nIn Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players\u2019 next move or even worse, the Sandman\u2019s!\n\n A video of the gameplay can be seen here: \nWHY KICKSTARTING A PRINT TO PLAY VERSION\nThis is a sort of a pre-campaign; we would like to polish the rules to their perfection and what better community to do that than the Kickstarter gaming army?

See your players battle dragons, fight to stop an evil overlord, and discover wonders and horrors as a shadowy patron leads you in pursuit of powerful magical artifacts. These exciting  adventures are already written: The funds pay for editing, layout, art, maps, and a high-quality print run.\nEach softcover adventure will sport a unique color cover, and contain black and white interiors on high-quality paper. The binding will be saddle-stitched (stapled).\nThere are three GM'd adventures designed to be played with a referee and a group of your friends. Two are programmed adventures (solos) that can be played with a small group with GM support . . . or played by yourself on the off chance you're asked to spend months alone with little social contact.\nThe Fantasy Trip is an \u201cold school\u201d RPG created by Steve Jackson. Its first element was released in 1977: the combat game Melee (available FREE from Steve Jackson Games!). That was followed by the magic game Wizard and a full roleplaying rulebook: In the Labyrinth.\nThe Fantasy Trip is more \u201ccinematic\u201d than \u201csimulationist\u201d \u2014 speed and ease of play are the goal, not an exact representation of every swing and every defense. The background is unabashedly swords and sorcery. Elves are noble, dragons are greedy, and gunpowder weapons exist but are very likely to blow up in your face!\nTFT was off the market for more than 35 years, until 2017 when Steve Jackson regained the rights to his work and set about creating a new edition. The Legacy Edition came out in 2018 . . . and More Perilous Journeys supports that amazing deluxe edition.\nThe campaign features five new adventures. Three expect you to run with a GM at the helm; the other two are solo adventures.\nRoc of Sages (Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett). Beset by Collectors - assassins from the Indhyna League - the party must journey to the Isle of Greater Zosi to collect items for the semi-corporeal Jok Sevantes. Of course, there are several dangerous stops along the way. Roc of Sages is designed for 4-6 characters of 34-36 points.\nCatacombs of Living Death (Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett). Following the events of Roc of Sages, Jok Sevantes again calls the party to aid him. They must venture forth through a plague-stricken land, and enter the Catacombs of Eulogia to recover the Helm of Baat. Simple enough . . . but things are not always as they appear. Catacombs of Living Death is designed for 4-6 characters of 36-38 points.\nThe Sunken Library (Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett). Set immediately following Catacombs, the players flee the plague-ridden landscape beset by numerous foes. Sevantes' plans reach their climax as his partners must bring all of the previously found artifacts beneath the depths of a lake in Meloria. There, a lost tome sits in the sunken Great Library of Meloria, and matters become treacherously clear. The Sunken Library  is designed for 4-6 characters of 36-38 points.\nDragon Hunt! (David Pulver). Baron Gwalathar's armies marched off to war. Without its defenders, the dragons of the wild sensed weakness, ravaging the realm. The young Baroness Tanith Gwalathar calls for heroes: It\u2019s time for a dragon hunt! This is a solo/programmed adventure for one 37-39 point character or two 35-36 point characters. It can optionally also be run with a GM.\nDark Lord's Doom (David Pulver). Another Dark Lord is on the march, threatening to bring death and destruction to all who oppose, and maybe a few who don't. This solo/programmed adventure features a squad of soldiers fighting in an all-out war to defeat the evil Lord Saethor and his allies before it's too late. Will the Dark Lord's doom fall upon the party, or on the villain himself?  Dark Lord's Doom is designed for 4 characters of 33-36 points each. \nThe writing team have all written for The Fantasy Trip before . . . among a great number of other projects.\nDavid Pulver is the author of the TFT adventures Fire in the Temple and Red Crypt, and several articles for Hexagram, as well as such varied works as Transhuman Space, GURPS 4th edition, and Big Eyes, Small Mouth. He has written over 100 articles for Pyramid Magazine including adventures for GURPS Dungeon Fantasy and The Fantasy Trip. David is a veteran TFT player and GM dating back to 1978 when he first played Melee. He wrote Citadel of Ice, Ironskull Castle, and the programmed adventure Vampire Hunter Belladonna for the Four Perilous Journeys campaign.\nThe writing team of Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett co-wrote The Crown of Eternity and Curse of the Pirate King from the last campaign. Christopher has the distinction of being the most-frequently published freelancer in Pyramid Vol 3, as well as being the author of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 19: Incantation Magic and Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game: Traps. J. Edward Tremlett wrote The Groom of the Spider Princess, The Tome of the Black Island, and Where the Snow Bleeds, and co-wrote Al-Phasmaq: The City of Ships with Christopher R. Rice.\nGaming Ballistic, LLC is publishing these five new TFT adventures as part of the current More Perilous Journeys campaign, supplementing the five already published as part of the Four (Five!) Perilous Journeys effort. Gaming Ballistic is proud to be a license holder for both The Fantasy Trip and The Dungeon Fantasy RPG, and seeks to provide a steady stream of high-quality material to the fans of both games. GB has also published for That Other Game, and you can find those products under Add-ons.\n\nThe campaign is to fund the art, layout, and editing of the books. This includes the cover art, interior art, maps, and of course the look and flow of text.\nHere are some work-in-progress images of the books with what I have done, to give you examples of what you'll be getting. When the campaign funds, Updates will show progress and art as it happens!\nThe Covers\nThe covers for the five new books utilize the same template as those from Five Perilous Journeys. Inspired by the iconic Megahex tiles of The Fantasy Trip, here are two example of the cover layouts. Of course, the images will be added later!\nKsenia Kozhovnikova is hard at work on the covers, and has provided me with this WIP for Dragon Hunt! As the others come in, I'll update them. Her next cover is Dark Lord's Doom, as I already had art direction for that one.\nKsenia did such a great job on Dragon Hunt she's doing all five covers for me.\nMy interior art team is pretty consistent from project to project, though I'm always looking for outstanding new talent. Here's the cover of Citadel of Ice, done by Rick Troula for the last campaign. \nArt, Maps, and Layout\nLayout and editing are underway, and will continue as the campaign progresses. Here's a screen capture from Roc of Sages, which is substantially complete in layout, needing only more fine-tuning of the language. It is representative of both the prior books, and the format of the upcoming products. The maps (see below) will be replaced by Glynn with something more than a rough sketch!\n\nTFT is a tactical battle game, and a roleplaying game. But good maps make for good fights. Fortunately, I've good good help. Glynn Seal, the ENnie Gold Medal cartographer in 2018 for his work on his Midderlands setting, has once again agreed to provide the maps for these five new books.\nHere's an example of his B/W work from Vampire Hunter Belladonna, featuring a tactical hex-map.\nOne more spread! This one from Citadel of Ice, showing a topographical map of the titular Citadel on the rapidly disintegrating iceberg, as well as a tracker who has clearly made a very poor 3/IQ roll.\nI hope that, despite the art and maps being mostly pending, these images give you a feel for what the team shall provide.\nAll the books will be printed by Mixam, who offers outstanding print quality at lightning-fast speed. They will be \"saddle-stitched,\" or stapled, with color covers and black and white interiors. They will feature 100-lb interior paper (150gsm), and 130-lb cover stock (350gsm).\nMixam has printing factories all over the world. Books meant to be shipped to the USA are printed locally; books destined for \"Rest of World\" are printed in the UK, and shipped by Royal Mail.\nWhile shipping is not free (see below!) and will be added during the post-campaign Backerkit phase, local printing and shipping allows Gaming Ballistic to serve the entire world at less-painful shipping rates.\nLESS painful. International shipping is still rough sailing.\nWhile the adventures contain \"print your own\" counters, die-cut counters and NPC/Monster cards will be produced in a separate campaign.\n\"Books\" are easy. Well, easier. They are usually tax-free, the supply chain is simple and well understood, and the chosen vendor is operational during a time of global pandemic. I know with certainty I can deliver the product, how it will happen, and - to the extent one can - the timing involved.\n\"Stuff,\" which includes die-cut counters and the lovely Decks-of-Destiny-compatible cards featured in the last campaign (as well as, of course Decks of Destiny itself!) is more complex. Many plants are shut down, and combining VAT/Tax-eligible \"stuff\" with usually-tax-free \"books\" makes shipping unpredictable. \nSo while there will be counter-type images in each adventure, the full-color counters and cards have to wait until the uncertainty around them is lower. If this campaign is successful, we'll make sure that a future one brings the accessories to life!\nThe More Perilous Journeys campaign is offering the following reward levels.\nAll the New Stuff\nThere are two reward levels that get you all five of the new adventures being offered during the More Perilous Journeys campaign.\n$25 - ALL FIVE NEW PDFs\nPDFs of all five of the new adventures from this campaign.

So, if that's what you want, here you go!\n$20 - JUST THE SOLOS IN PDF FORMAT\nYou want solos? Portable, no-shelf-space-required solos? You got 'em. All three of David's solo/programmed adventures that Gaming Ballistic has produced, and ONLY the solo/programmed adventures, in PDF format.

Both of the new adventures can be run as group adventures with or without a GM.\nPick and Choose\nSometimes, you just want what you want. Based on backer feedback (and no small amount of discussion with Backerkit), Gaming Ballistic is pleased to offer some a la carte pledge levels.\nAfter choosing one of these levels, during the Backerkit phase of the project, you will select from the ten available TFT adventures from Gaming Ballistic.\nThe following reward levels are PDF-ONLY.\n$6 - Choose any ONE PDF\n$12 - Choose any TWO PDFs\n$18 - Choose any THREE PDFs\nThe following reward levels are PRINT-ONLY. No PDF is included with these pledge levels!\n$12 - Choose any ONE softcover print adventure\n$22 - Choose any TWO  softcover print adventures\n $33 - Choose any THREE  softcover print adventures \nThere are no stretch goals for this campaign, which is deliberately being kept simple to prevent scope creep. Scope creep leads schedule slip, and schedule slip leads to suffering, as Yoda said (I believe Yoda said that. Or something like it.)\nThat being said: surpassing the goal does help! As the backer count climbs above 500 backers, the authors get paid more. Happy authors write more TFT books for Gaming Ballistic. Everyone wins.\nA project isn't a project without a timeline.\nCampaign Launch: May 19, 2020\nCampaign End: June 13, 2020\nBackerkit Phase: July, 2020\nProduction: September, 2020\nPDF Distribution: October 2020\nPrinting and Delivery: November 2020\nGaming Ballistic will do everything possible to meet or beat the projected dates.  As always, backers will be kept informed of any progress with regular updates.\n Backers have the opportunity to put any of Gaming Ballistic's products in their cart at the end of the campaign, during the Backerkit phase. You can also \"plus-up\" your pledge to cover the cost of the items in advance, which helps the campaign fund.\nExample: You decide that you want the \"More Perilous Print+PDF\" level, which is a $90 pledge. You are intrigued with The Citadel at Nordvorn, so you select the More Perilous Print+PDF ($44) pledge level and manually enter $134 for the pledged amount. When the Backerkit Survey comes around after the campaign ends, you see the More Perilous Print+PDF in your \"cart,\" and a $44 credit. You add the Nordvorn Print+PDF bundle, which brings your credit balance to zero.\nIf after that, you continue to shop, your will show a balance. As you shop, shipping costs are assessed on the complete order, and then at the end, you pay the balance, which is shipping plus any add-ons you decide to purchase that go beyond the $44 you added with your pledge.\nEach of the books in the campaign can also be had as add-ons. You can also get individual copies of the already published adventures from Five Perilous Journeys if you have some, but not all, of the existing books.\n Roc of Sages.

It consists of three major settlements, many small villages, a ruin, and two primary adventuring zones: The Hunted Lands to the northwest of The Palisade, and the Endalaus Forest, to the north and east of Audreyn's Wall.\nIt is intended for starting Dungeon Fantasy RPG characters of 250 points.\nPDF: $17\nPrint: $35\nPrint+PDF Bundle: $44 \nFar beyond the safety of Audreyn\u2019s Wall, the ambitious noble Dalmar, his wife Freythor, and their lifetime friend and lieutenant Tobias carved a new settlement out of the dragonkin-infested wilderness.

Dalmar will offer up the Konungsgj\u00f6f and petition to be named Jarl of Sk\u00f3gurenda: Lord of Forest\u2019s End.\nSk\u00f3gurenda is in peril and does not know it.

He hopes to ascend, becoming an Elder Dragon. They ruled the world for countless thousands of years. He believes he has found the way to do it.

When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will only last between 7-10 days. The survey have two or three questions in it: shipping address, and reward selection. It is important to get the shipping address question answered promptly if you order physical product.\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nAn important point: the project will ship to the entire world.\nShipping in the USA of physical product will use the USPS media mail, and shipping will be added to your pledge total during the Backerkit phase.\nInternational shipping will try and keep costs down by printing in the EU (Latvia, specifically) and drop-shipping the books to Kixto, in the UK. International orders will thus ship from there via Royal Mail. The rest of the books will be sent to Studio 2 in Tennessee, and US fulfillment will take place from there.\nEither way, I don't control shipping costs, and there's no way around it: International shipping is very expensive, and time-consuming to boot. If you have purchased multiple physical products, Gaming Ballistic will do everything possible to group them into a single shipment to reduce costs, but that might not be possible. Certain countries (such as Brazil) are ridiculously expensive to ship to, and those costs will be passed on during the Backerkit phase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe writing is complete. The layout template is in place and proven; some of the books the layout is already finished, which includes editing.\n\nThese adventures are all new. New art. New monsters. New maps. That means that it's possible one or more of those things could be delayed.\n\nThere is a lot of art required to also provide the counter-size graphics in the back of each adventure. Given the state of the world right now, this represents a timing risk.\n\nThere are very few things that would disrupt the project other than mild schedule slips \u2013 though of course things can always go pear-shaped. Gaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress, and do everything possible to deliver the final PDF on or ahead of schedule.\n\nOne usual source of delay for projects has been eliminated: The printer chosen operates in both the USA and UK and provides high quality identical printing at both sites. This eliminates a huge variable in timing: the need to ship from a far-flung location, split shipments, and then do fulfillment.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow the Campaign", "descp": "It's dangerous to stow away with adventurers!

As science and technology draw humanity closer than ever before, certain factions within the masses display gross negligence, undermining the union's work and endangering the world for short-sighted gains. Despite global telecommunications, new frontiers in virtually every field of study, and an understanding of the universe only dreamed of by earlier generations, humanity faces threats on all sides. \nCan you save it?\nClimate change threatens to destroy life as we know it. Religious fundamentalism breeds terror around the globe. Diseases, once eradicated from the developed world through vaccination, have returned due to anti-vaxxer movements. Totalitarian nationalist governments rise, as the masses succumb to fear of the other.\nThe world stands on the brink of destruction, and it is up to the agents and operatives of the Technocratic Union to save it or be its ultimate downfall.  \nTechnocracy Reloaded peels back the curtain and examines the role of the Technocracy in Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The various future fates presented in Mage 20 are examined, and this book introduces a few of its own.  \nWithin this book you will also find a detailed look at life within the Technocracy; expanded information on the conventions; a wealth of equipment, adjustments, and procedures; a breakdown of the various shadow conspiracies and factions within the Technocratic Union; and tips for running your own Technocracy chronicle. \nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nTechnocracy Reloaded brings the final playable faction of the Ascension War into Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The Technocratic Union has historically been presented in various ways. Its members have been shown as the villains of the Ascension War, misguided willworkers seeking to keep humanity safe through control and manipulation, shadowy masters of modern reality, and as heroes forming the only line of defense against unspeakable horrors that seek to destroy all that is. Each of these perspectives is true, from a certain point of view. \nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nTechnocracy Reloaded gives the Storyteller all the tools needed to explore these viewpoints and more while incorporating the Technocratic Union into their Mage 20 game. Technocracy Reloaded provides tools and resources to equip and portray the Technocratic Union as antagonists in a Mage 20 game, or to allow the players to step into the role of Technocrats, with the full support of the Union and its immeasurable resources at their fingertips.\nThis Technocracy Reloaded Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition of this supplement, designed to match the look and feel of our other 20th Anniversary Editions, and specifically the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. \nWe want to create a deluxe edition with a leatherette cover featuring the title of the book on the spine, 200+ full color interior pages, and a silk ribbon bookmark. The cover will featured an embossed image of the Technocracy symbol. Exceptional funding will allow us to further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play.\nDesign Not Final\nThe Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Technocracy Reloaded.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nTechnocracy Reloaded features all of the rules options necessary to create and play a Technocratic Union operative within the Mage 20 world. The final book will contain the following chapters:\nUnit 1: The Operative's Handbook provides a detailed overview of life in the Technocratic Union, describing the organization of the Union, the Conventions, and the roles that sympathizers, extraordinary citizens, and Enlightened Operatives play in the overall structure of the Technocracy.\nUnit 2: Targets, Assets, Tactics, and Plans provides a thorough exploration of the operational procedures and standard models used by the Technocracy around the globe and beyond in order to protect the consensus, contain and eliminate Reality Deviance, and bring the world closer to the Union's ultimate goal of Ascension.\nUnit 3: Theaters of Operation examines current Technocratic initiatives on the Front Lines. New initiatives are introduced, old procedures are expanded and clarified, and the Union's global goals are parsed out in localized segments, giving the Storyteller the tools to craft Technocratic tales anywhere in the world.\nUnit 4: Internal Matters provides a detailed view of every aspect of life among the Technocracy. Operatives at all levels of indoctrination and from every imaginable origin are discussed. From Enlightenment, to marriage and child-rearing, to interactions with one's old life, every element of a Technocrat's daily existence is granted meticulous attention. Factions within the Union are also discussed here, including secret cabals with ulterior motives, cross-convention initiatives working together to build a better world, and the Conventions themselves all receive detailed and updated write-ups in this chapter.\nUnit 5: Q Division details the devices, procedures, and hypertech used by the Technocratic Union in all operations great and small. New cutting edge equipment is introduced and old favorites are modernized for compatibility with Mage 20. The Enlightened Science behind these various gadgets and gizmos is also revealed, allowing operatives to apply similar effects in the field, if they have sufficient understanding of the principles that allow these gadgets to function.\nUnit 6: Human Resources provides a comprehensive roster of Extraordinary citizens, cyborgs, operatives, progenitor creations, and allies to populate a Technocracy Reloaded Chronicle.\nUnit 7: Mission Control is a complete guide to Storytelling for the Technocratic Union. A number of story seeds, tips and tricks are provided to ensure that the Storyteller can capture the feel of the Technocracy.\nUnit 8:The Parallax View takes a deep dive into metaplot options, discussing every significant Future Fate that affects the Technocratic Union. Options are provided for incorporating, ignoring, or subverting these metaplot options, and entire new metaplot options are introduced. The tools in this chapter permit the Storyteller and players to shape the Union to their own vision, giving you everything you need to carry your Technocracy Reloaded game into the past, present, or future.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nThe manuscript is written, awesome artists are being contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Technocracy Reloaded for Mage 20 fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Technocracy, possibly expanding into Storyteller and player tools and accessories, as well as a possible rules companion. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our own secret cabal.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target, then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick here to summon a larger version of this chart\n\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nFirst decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Extraordinary Citizen and Operative Reward Tiers), or go all in with the deluxe hardcover (Agent Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Supervisor Reward Tier, which offers 2 copies as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Technocracy Reloaded campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Manager) will get 5 copies of the Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Technocracy Reloaded setting or a possible future supplement. We also have a limited supply of deluxe hardcover copies of the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition included in our Deluxe Archivist reward tier. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Technocracy Reloaded.

Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nMAGE: THE ASCENSION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION - A limited number of copies remain of this deluxe edition, funded by a Kickstarter camapign 6 years ago.

All physical rewards will be delivered in one shipment, when the final Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover is completed and distributed to backers.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Technocracy Reloaded, you will have the option of using StorytellersVault.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from StorytellersVault.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nNote - these PDF files are the current versions offered by DTRPG.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $35 OPERATIVE or $60 DIGITAL ARCHIVIST reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from Storytellers Vault once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 SYMPATHIZER reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (MANAGER) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Technocracy Reloaded is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path.

Charlie Foxtrot will contain five one-shot adventures for Battlelords, including pre-generated characters. In addition, there are several short fiction stories to help flesh out the Battlelords' universe. It will also include a small planetary atlas detailing the worlds and locations where these adventures and stories take place. As a whole, Charlie Foxtrot fleshes out this little corner of the Battlelord's universe, creating a sandbox for you to play in... before you blow it up with your shenanigans.  \n*Don't have the Battlelords rulebook? It's included in many of our pledge levels or as an Add-On. Available in PDF or hardcopy. Link to free Quick Start Rules below.  \nThough Charlie Foxtrot is written for Battlelords of the 23rd Century, the adventures, maps, and diagrams presented within can be repurposed for any science-fiction roleplaying game.  \nCharlie Foxtrot Cover (Work-in-Progress)\nWhat is Battlelords?\nBattlelords of the 23rd Century (aka Battlelords) is a military science-fiction tabletop roleplaying game, with a 30 year history in the game industry.   Set in a galaxy of war, an alliance of 15 different alien species desperately attempts to repel the Aknar-Ryn (aka The Arachnids) invasion and root out the nanoswarms of the Atlanteans hiding within their ranks.  Play as corporate mercenaries, soldiers, spies, pirates, or any other occupation you can think of in this expansive setting.  \nBattlelords of the 23rd Century (Kickstarter Edition) Cover Art\nThe newest edition of Battlelords is a beautifully illustrated, hardcover, 540 page book that we successfully launched right here on Kickstarter.  If features: \n15 different highly detailed species to choose from as a character.\nAn expansive, galaxy spanning setting, with limitless potential.\nDetailed setting information for running a campaign for Alliance soldiers, mercenaries, pirates, spies, and corporate espionage agents\nArmor ranges from light body armor, to mechanized battle armor, to the massive walking tanks called Ultra Armor.\nEach suit of armor is highly customizable, with over a 150 options to choose from.\nOver a dozen weapon systems, and hundreds of weapons to equip your character. Arm yourself with lasers, disintegrators, pulse weapons, grav sheers, grenade launchers, frost guns, and Omega weapons, just to name a few.\nDownload the FREE Battlelords Quick Start rules here:   Battlelords Quick Start Rules (PDF)  \nDownload a FREE PDF highlighting the art  in the Battlelords core rulebook here:  Battlelords Rulebook Interior Art Preview     \nOR, if you prefer video the flip through is here:  Video Flip Through of Battlelords of the 23rd Century (Kickstarter Edition) \nWhy is it called Charlie Foxtrot?\nWe cover the etymology of the term Charlie Foxtrot in the intro of the book, but what you need to know is a Charlie Foxtrot is a synonym for a major screwup.  Players participating in the scenarios included in Charlie Foxtrot will make bad decisions, screw up, flub die rolls, and generally make a mess of things. It\u2019s ok. It\u2019s what Battlelord\u2019s players do. Just roll with the bad die results (no pun intended) and worse plans, and let the dark humor of the game come through. Embrace your inner miscreant and relish in your Charlie Foxtrots. \nA Charlie Foxtrot in progress\nThe statement that \u201cNo plan survives first contact with the enemy\u201d is just as true in Battlelords as with real world military operations. It\u2019s probably more true for Battlelords of the 23rd Century.\nWhat's Inside Charlie Foxtrot?\nInside this book you\u2019ll find five scenarios complete with pre-generated characters for Battlelords of the 23rd Century. The scenarios span the gamut of experience from fresh recruit to experienced soldiers, and range from corporate espionage, to military actions against the Arachnids, to flat out piracy. There\u2019s something in here for everybody.  These are scenarios that we've run successfully for years at gaming conventions, and each is designed to be completed in roughly 4 hours of play. \nIn addition, the scenarios can be tweaked to by an aspiring GM to adjust them for the experience of occupation their players. In between several of the scenarios are short fiction pieces that we think help sets the tone for the following scenario, as well as giving the players and GM alike some deeper insights into the Battlelords universe.\nThe Scenarios include: \n Last Resort on the Space Resort - An adventure for starting characters who are just trying to find out what's bugging (and eating) the clientele at a luxury space resort. The resort was built on the skeleton of an antiquated orbital ore processing platform to save costs. The parts of the station off limits to guest are a warren of dark, pipe tunnels, with no surveillance.  What's that growling noise?  This version of \"Last Resort\" is the full version of the scenario provided in our Quick Start Rules (QSR). The version in the QSR has been shortened and includes different pre-generated characters.  This version includes the final act, the main antagonists, and is designed for a different level of character experience than the version in the QSR. It also features an additional map! \n Space Pirates - \u201cI got the access codes from a disgruntled maintenance worker. \u2018Could disable the entire alarm system, he said. Just a bunch of rich, snobby, Alliance big-wigs in their luxury space resort. Just floating around that remote, picturesque nebula, taking in the view\u2026 ripe for the pickings. How hard could it be?\u201d  The Space Pirates scenario is the Last Resort scenario played from the other side, where the characters take on the roles of the antagonists in Last Resort.\n Extract and Deliver - Your mission to extract infamous genius Edvard Bohiggens from his office on a privately owned planet, where Balshrom mega-corp tests weapons. Bohiggens is a former engineer for nihilistic genius \"Uncle Ernie\" Freilberg.  To say Bohiggens has some mental issues is an understatement, but your employer wants access to the genius that Balshrom is currently exploiting to create super-weapons. \n Express Train to Hades - Not all missions in the Battlelords' Universe are \"above board.\"  Your team has been hired to jail break Orion crime lord Rohar McCain from the prison train on the penitentiary planet, Hades.  Hades is an inhospitable hell hole of acid lakes, jagged rocks, and a corrosive atmosphere.  To make matters worse, someone on your team is a traitor. Try not to melt under the pressure. \n Routine Inspection - You and your crew are an Alliance Colony Assistance and Relief Team (ACART), more commonly called \"Colony Inspectors.\" Your job is to fly a circuit between colonies in a given sector.  When you arrive at colony world you verify that the colony is productive and self-sustaining. Your team is trained to provide medical aid, give advice on engineering and agricultural matters, and repair devices that are beyond colonists' ability to fix. Most colonies love your visits and welcome you with open arms and celebrations. The colonists on Colony RB7-1A (aka Transit) don't want you around for some reason.\n Hold the Line - What could be more glorious than being a grunt in the Galactic Army on the front lines during an Arachnid invasion of colony planet?  You thought your job was to \"Hold the Line\" against the Arachnids at the edge of the colony\u2019s main city to allow the civvies time to reach the escape shuttles. That was before your commanding officer gave you orders to leave the position on the line and provide security to a bunch of Galactic X agents who want to go on a treasure hunt in the city.\n\"Routine Inspection\" (Redacted to avoid spoilers)\n\"Extract & Deliver\" (Redacted to avoid spoilers)\nThe short fiction pieces are as follows:\n The Battlelord Arrives - What makes a Battlelord worthy of the title? What sacrifices must they make to uphold their oaths to protect the Alliance? How does the public in general perceive them?  Find out when Battlelord Siti Kurniasari risks it all to help retired Colonel Mika Sorayama defend her small colony world against an Arachnid expeditionary force. \n Final Report - Matrix Controllers possess the ability manipulate energy, minds, and living tissue.  Like everyone else in the Alliance, most are good people. What happens when you push a good person too far and they break? What happens when that person can sculpt flesh and snap bones with a touch?  Trapped on a remote mining facility on a small planetoid in the ass end of the galaxy, security chief Jabori Chukwumereije is about to find out. \n The Rebels - Encountering an Atlantean face-to-face is a life changing event that will make you re-evaluate your priorities. Particularly if it eats the face of your best mate.  Listen as Commander Chen explains how he and his crew of corporate espionage experts decided to join the rebels after an unexpected surprise during a routine snatch & grab mission. \nScreen capture from \"Last Resort\" in page layout\nWhat's in the Pledge Levels? \nIn addition to your choice of Charlie Foxtrot in PDF or PDF & Print, you can also add a copy of the core rules for Battlelords of the 23rd Century.  Some pledge levels also have Battlelords themed dog tags and t-shirts!  When we run Battlelords at conventions, all our players get a double-sided Battlelords dog tag that we designed for that year's events.  The dog tags for the Kickstarter are unique and have never been available before.  At the Colonel and General pledge ranks you'll get an exclusive digital camo Battlelords t-shirt like our convention staff wears.*\n* Final design for T-shirts and dog tags in development and subject to change.  \nAdd-Ons*\nWe have a ton of Add-Ons, so don't despair if you don't see what you want in your pledge level.  In addition to our standard t-shirts and dog tags, we also have out-of-print books (both PDF & Hardcopy) from the prior editions of Battlelords, mega-corp logo coaster sets, and limited edition t-shirts.\nLastly, we also have our coveted Battlelords toe tags. When we're feeling particularly mischievous at Battlelords games, we have been known to hand out Battlelords themed toe-tags to players whose characters died during the game. Now you can obtain one of these rare Battlelords toe tags as an Add-On. Use it to decorate your game bag or if you're the Game Master, hand it out to a player whose character has made a valiant last stand.\nAll of our non-book pledge rewards and Add-Ons were created by Ray Hedman at Phoenix Design Screen Printing and Embroidery. You can find out more about them here:  https://www.facebook.com/phoenixmuncie/   *Final designs for T-shirts, dog tags, and toe-tags in development and subject to change. \nStretch Goals\n$6,750 (UNLOCKED!)- Each backer who orders a print copy of Charlie Foxtrot (Sergeant or higher pledge level) will be able to select a free copy of any prior edition PDF for Battlelords of the 23rd Century. \n$8,000 (UNLOCKED!)- Each backer who orders a print copy of Charlie Foxtrot (Sergeant or higher pledge level) will receive a Battlelords dog tag.

An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen? Here it is, partner! The tri-fold screen is our usual landscape format with gorgeous art on one side and all the charts and tables the Marshal needs on the other!\nThe new GM Screen for Deadlands: the Weird West! Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games. Art not final.\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or Deadlands: Lost Colony or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Boxed Set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items right now, partner, just head over to www.peginc.com and order, but please realize you'll have to pay shipping on that separately.\nIf you want to order everything at once in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Deadlands rewards) everything will be delivered toward the end of 2020. \nAdd-Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Deadlands-specific Add-Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes? Check out their website here.\nLearn more about the Wildcards and Saving Throw by clicking here!\nCheck back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for everyone!\nHelp us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter product before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle product with their order.

Lost to history, this time is remembered in the echoes of myth and legend. The land was once besieged by the Horrors, foul creatures from the depths of astral space that seek to feed on and destroy all that is living and good.\nTheir time -- the time of the Scourge -- has passed. The people of the world have returned to the surface reclaiming the lands that were once their home. Brave heroes band together to explore the wilds of Barsaive, fighting the Horrors that remain and protecting their loved ones from those who would dominate and enslave them.\nEarthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game currently in its fourth edition. After more than 25 years it continues to deliver a setting tinged with a compelling mix of high magic and horror flavored with a dash of post-apocalypse and a generous sprinkling of hope.\nA group of Adepts preparing for battle\nSecrets of the Denairastas\nWe have released several products for the Earthdawn line in the past five years: Four core rulebooks (Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, Companion, and Mystic Paths), three sourcebooks (Travar: The Merchant City, Elven Nations, and Questors), a GM Screen, Quick Start Guide, and several entries in our ongoing Legends of Barsaive adventure series.\nThe next sourcebook is ready to go. The full text is written and through preliminary layout. This campaign is to help cover production costs of paying the freelancers (writers, artists, and other production staff) who contributed to the book, and pay for printing and physical production.\nIopos: Lair of Deceit is a 256-page sourcebook that lays bare the intricacies of Barsaive\u2019s most secretive city and family. It presents the surviving history of Iopos, secrets of the Holders of Trust\u2014the Copper, Silver, Gold, Orichalcum, and newly revealed Malachite Branches\u2014and the current state of Jerris, their most recent acquisition. Even some of the darkest places in Iopos, such as the Thricewoven Flesh Forges and the abominations crafted within.\nPlayers will find invaluable information for infiltrating this city as agents of external powers, and descriptions of daily life for Iopan characters. Gamemasters will uncover the layers of deception in a city that is always watching, plot hooks to bring characters to the lair of the Denairastas, and ideas for groups who join the Holders of Trust and execute their masters\u2019 plan to conquer Barsaive. All of this plus new creatures, Horror constructs, opponents, masks, thread items, and revelations about the Oath of Affirmation.\nRewards and Add-Ons \nBack this Kickstarter, and you get access to the pre-art draft of the manuscript (it will be linked in a backers-only post shortly after the campaign closes). We offer this to show that the text is complete--the book just needs to make its way through the rest of the production process. You'll also get early access to what's inside, and will be able to start using it in your game right away!\nWe're offering the new book in PDF and physical versions. We have reward tiers that include previously released books in case you missed our earlier Kickstarters or weren't aware the game had returned. All the available books are in print and in stock, so there's no additional wait for delivery.\nFor those looking to fill in holes in their collection that an existing pledge bundle doesn't satisfy, we are also offer single-book add-on options. Prices (and additional shipping charges) are as follows: \nAdd-On Prices\nIndividual add-on books include the PDF version at no additional charge. If you are adding physical product to a PDF-only tier, the first book is $8 shipping (even if it is noted as free shipping above), with added costs based on additional books ordered. The reward tiers include standard (softcover) editions. If you want to upgrade any books in a tier from standard to deluxe, add $40 per book.\nFor all add-ons, please include the amount of the add-on in your pledge. You will be able to indicate specific add-on choices as part of the survey at the end of the campaign. You can adjust your pledge amount (or change your chosen reward tier) at any point before the campaign ends. \nEarthdawn (Standard Edition) Core Book Covers\nStretch Goals\nIf we reach $10,000, we will produce a fortieth anniversary FASA pin. These will be produced alongside the books and will ship with your other physical product. Adding on the pin will be $4 for backers and will ship with physical product for no additional charge.\nBecause of the current global pandemic, we understand that finances might be tight and life a little uncertain for our fans. As a result, we've decided to hold off on any additional stretch goals for this campaign. We have ideas, but have decided to push them off until a later campaign.\nNew to Earthdawn?\nOriginally released in 1993, Earthdawn was named one of \"The Millennium's Most Underrated Games\" by Pyramid magazine in 1999, and 24th in Arcane magazine's 1996 reader poll of the 50 most popular role-playing games of all time. The game delivers a richly developed setting flavored with high fantasy, post-apocalypse, and horror. In 2014 a successful Kickstarter brought the fourth edition to life.\nLong ago the world was alive with magic, giving rise to strange creatures and exotic races only remembered today in the echoes of myth and legend. The level of magic rises and falls over thousands of years. At its height, foul creatures from the depths of the Netherworlds--called Horrors--breach the barrier between their native plane and ours, leading to a centuries-long time of destruction called the Scourge.\nEarthdawn is set in the aftermath of the most recent Scourge. The player characters are adepts, heroes who draw on magical powers to explore the world, recover knowledge lost to the Scourge, and fight those that who threaten the lives of innocents--including the remaining Horrors. Each adept follows a Discipline, defining that defines the focus and scope of their magical abilities. Some adepts hone their combat skills, some enhance their mental and social abilities, while others learn and cast spells.\nThe core game engine of Earthdawn is the Step System. As your character gains power and advances along the path of their Discipline you roll progressively larger dice, with open-ended rolls allowing for potentially legendary results. Adepts can further enhance their magical abilities through the use of karma, adding additional dice to your rolls.\nThe Earthdawn Quick Start Guide (available free at our web shop or on Drive-Thru RPG) provides a great overview of the game system, examples of the magical powers available, and includes sample characters and a brief introductory adventure.\nNamegivers of Barsaive\nReturning to Earthdawn?\nIf you've been away from Earthdawn for a while, the new edition should be familiar, but a few things have changed to open up new design space and incorporate lessons learned over the years.\nThe core game engine remains largely the same. The specific dice used in a few places have been tweaked to smooth out some bumps in the underlying probability curves, but still uses all the common polyhedrals.\nThe game no longer uses the success level table from previous editions. Instead, every five points over the target number scores an additional success. This new mechanic has been incorporated into most of the game's talents, skills, and spells so that--in general--better rolls mean better results.\nFourth edition keeps the \"talent option\" approach to Disciplines introduced in third edition, but has refined the required talents to be more broadly useful, and improves the choices available at each tier to allow for better customization options.\nSpellcasting includes the concept of extra threads, allowing magicians to enhance their spells as they cast them. This gives lower-Circle spells a longer life and more utility over the course of the character's career.\nThe timeline has been advanced. It is a few years after the Second Theran War, with a new status quo in Barsaive. In the wake of the war, the dwarfs of Throal has have a new royal family on the throne and withdrawn from provincial affairs. In that void, other political powers expand their influence... including the Denairastas clan of Iopos.\nThis is a great time to get back into the game, and this project gives you access to the books we've released so far at a discount. Why not journey back to Barsaive, and build some new legends? \nA t'skrang boatman sailing the Serpent River", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver this product. The text is written, it only needs to make its way through the rest of the production pipeline. We have already completed and released seven books for the Earthdawn Fourth Edition line along with several smaller products.\n\nOf course, any project includes risk. Unforeseen production delays or other issues may crop up that push the release of the final product beyond the currently anticipated date, but we have already factored some wiggle room into our delivery estimates.\n\nWe have learned many lessons from our previous successful kickstarters. While more books are planned and in development, they will not appear as stretch goals for this project so that we can focus on closing out this campaign and delivering all promised rewards in a timely manner.\n\nWhile there may be concerns given the Covid-19 pandemic, our plans should not be overly affected. Our books are printed and bound in the United States, and as of the launch of this campaign our printer is still operating.

The portal, called a Crossing, took you to a world you thought only existed in novels and films: a magical land where dragons roam the skies, orcs and hobgoblins terrorize weary travelers, and unicorns prance through the forest. It is a world where humans join other peoples such as elves, trolls, dwarves, changelings, and the dreaded creatures who steal the night. It is a world of fantasy \u2014 of imagination.\nIt is the Realm. \nIt is Legendlore. \nDrawn from The Realm and Legendlore comics, the Legendlore RPG will whisk characters from our world to a magical fantasy realm filled with dragons, orcs, unicorns, and hobgoblins. With over 60 comics published covering three volume runs, The Realm and Legendlore combined became one of Caliber Comics' most critically acclaimed series.\nIn the Legendlore RPG, players can choose to play as themselves or create a new character employing the 5th Edition Fantasy Rules System.\nAre you ready for a magical adventure?\nArt by Gong Studios\nLegendlore was originally a comic called The Realm, first published by Arrow Comics in 1986 and since procured by Caliber Comics, about four people who fall through a Crossing into the Realm. The Realm is home to fantasy creatures from elves to dragons, and the characters discover they too have \u2018fantasy powers\u2019 \u2013 the jock becomes a Fighter, while the bookish one becomes a Wizard, and so on. They go on adventures and some of them eventually find their way back to Earth.\nThis is the basic premise of the Legendlore RPG. You Cross into the Realm, where you become a hairfoot Bard, or maybe an elven Sorcerer. You can change any characteristics you like. For example if you have hay fever and glasses, you choose if your Legendlore self keeps or drops those. Your identity might not always match your outward physique, but your Legendlore character does. We've also updated the 1980s setting so Realmborn characters represent all ethnicities, genders, and sexualities. No one in the Realm will bat an eyelash at your agender panromantic self.\nYou are not the first from Earth to encounter the nations of the Realm. The Realm has had Visitors before, and each time these Visitors left something with the Realm: whether it be a new word, or even accidental technology. Some Visitors became stranded and formed their own communities out of an immediate need for survival. These communities can still be found in the Realm, though they tend to be pockets of isolation and have their own customs and concerns even if they are within the boundaries of other nations. Sharp-eyed Visitors may recognize aspects of their world turned into phenomena: in the depths of a forest, they may encounter a glider plane abandoned with vines anchoring it to the soil, its metal rusting, its markings faded under a strange sun its paint was never meant to withstand. These phenomena are considered Strange Things throughout the Realm.\nJust as Earth had impacts on the Realm, the Realm can change a Visitor from Earth. Legends are the destinies Visitors may have when Crossing into the Realm: it is part of their Crossing, part of their destiny.\nEach character has their own Legend, which affects the story and is built up through relatively minor actions as well as through more obviously weighty choices. Legends are things like \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d or \u201cRegent of Dragons\u201d or \u201cHeir to the Mountain\u201d: they represent the destiny of You (your character) and mechanically can resemble backgrounds. Perhaps the You you want to be in the Realm is trying to not spread any more violence than absolutely necessary for self-defense. As a Player, you might want their destiny to reflect that commitment to peaceful solutions and to avoid continuing cycles of revenge and violence: thus the \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d Legend. The seeds of that legend are there, but how does that affect You throughout Your adventures in the Realm?\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed in four color gloss, with  more than 250 full-color pages and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nThe Legendlore RPG uses rules based on the 5th Edition of the world's most popular fantasy tabletop RPG system, and comprises three sections (Player, Setting, Game Master) spread across 14 chapters.\nChapter One: Welcome to the Realm \nChapter Two: Crossing \nChapter Three: People of East Azoth \nChapter Four: Classes \nChapter Five: Backgrounds and Feats \nChapter Six: Magic, Spells, and Rituals \nChapter Seven: East Azoth \nChapter Eight: Nations of East Azoth \nChapter Nine: Dangerous Places \nChapter Ten: Allies and Adversaries \nChapter Eleven: Running the Game \nChapter Twelve: Creatures of East Azoth \nChapter Thirteen: Magic Items and Strange Things \nChapter Fourteen: Voices from Afar  \nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Legendlore RPG manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Legendlore RPG possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that main goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Legendlore, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Game Master and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our fantasy family.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($20,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to summon a larger version of this chart\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Digital Traveler and First time Traveler Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Traveler to the Realm Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Purveyor of Books and Librarian of Isliadril Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Legendlore RPG campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Olardellian Trader) will get 5 copies of the Legendlore RPG rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Legendlore setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for the Legendlore RPG. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of the Legendlore RPG, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a reception link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For the Legendlore RPG, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-on-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\n For only +$20, Add On an additional PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list.\nFor only +$10, Add On a PDF copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list.\nLegendlore started as a comic book, and now our partners at Caliber Comics have made the graphic novels available to the Legendlore RPG kickstarter backers as Add On rewards, to be fulfilled by DriveThruComics.com. \nLegendlore V1 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 1-5; 153 pages.\nLegendlore V2 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 6-7, and the Tales of the Realm mini-series that depicted Lord Darkoth\u2019s assault on the Rainbow Elf Kingdom; 180 pages.\nLegendlore V3 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 8-11; 138 pages.\n PHYSICAL REWARDS\n  All physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nFor only +$45, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. U.S. Residents only.\n For only +$65, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. Non-U.S. Residents only.\nFor only +$30, Add On a hardcover copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list. This reward will be sent at alongside your Legendlore RPG hardcover when that reward is complete and ready to go. To add this option on to your rewards list, your reward tier must include a hardcover copy (and, therefore, any additional shipping charges) of the Legendlore RPG (so, reward tiers of $50+).\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement\n\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Legendlore RPG hardcover rulebook), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 First time Traveler reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Good Friend reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Olardellian Trader) for this campaign.\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\n  After the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the LegendLore RPG is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Richard Thomas\n46 created \u00b7 147 backed\nIn 1986 I became the Art Director of White Wolf Magazine, responsible for the visuals that are such an integral part of our White Wolf...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Good Friend", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Digital Traveler", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG.\nINCLUDES:\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "First time Traveler", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG.\nINCLUDES:\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Traveler to the Realm", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nLEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "Purveyor of Books", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and TWO (2) copies of the hardcover version of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n2\u00d7 \"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Experienced Traveler", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of the Legendlore RPG, as well as a BOOK PLATE signed by members of the creative team.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nSPECIAL: Signed Book Plate\nLEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 180 or more", "title": "Olardellian Trader **Retail Tier**", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only ** Contact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 230 or more", "title": "Librarian of Isliadril", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n5\u00d7 \"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Seasoned Traveler", "descp": "As a special reward, you will submit a name that will be used for a Non-player Character (NPC) which will be incorporated into the Legendlore setting (via supplemental PDF if necessary).

With Norse Grimoire you can improve your Journey To Ragnarok sessions and setting, but you can also power up characters or worlds from any setting you like.\nOur goal is to enhance both the Adventurers and the Players' experience, adding game options and trying to transmit an ancient culture that we love.\nGaldrakver and Samtiningur grimoires\nTo better understand Icelandic staves and the Runes, we decided to focus our research on ancient sources. Poetic and Prose Edda, along with Runic Poems, led our way on the path shaped by Odhinn in his journey through the Nine Worlds. For Icelandic symbols, we browsed through the pages of authentic grimoires filled with cryptic runes and staves, whose Norse echoes, sometimes bounded to continental magic, Middle Age esoteric or alchemical doctrine, unveiling a meaningful world permeated by magic.\nHuld Manuscript\nNorse Sagas and Runic Stones were also valuable sources for our research, revealing a world full of deep meanings and filled with magic.\nNorse Grimoire is born from the collaboration between: \n Michele Paroli, author of Journey To Ragnarok and Historia 5th edition projects, founder and lead designer of Mana Project Studio.\n Marco B Bucci, author of the fantasy comic book series Magna Veritas for Soleil and Nomen Omen for Panini Comics and Image Comics, designer for the board game Dogs of War for CMON Limited and author of the Memento Mori roleplaying game for Raven Distribution. \n Mila Fois, author of many mythologic novels and the Meet Myths book series.\n Andrea Guardino, concept artist and illustrator for Journey To Ragnarok.\nYou can find the full team of this project in the campaign section.\nBooks form the Meet Myths series at conventions.\n\nJourney To Ragnarok Reprint\nSince the Journey To Ragnarok Kickstarter delivery, we received many requests for the campaign exclusives, like the D24 RuneDice, the English edition of the Game Master Screen, and the high-quality hardback prints of Journey to Ragnarok - Adventure and Setting, as only a few hundreds of items were manufactured during the campaign.\nNow we need your help to be able to bring a large-scale retail edition to life, taking the chance to correct a few typos and mistakes, with new editing by the award-winning author and translator Jason R. Forbus (also the founder and director of Ali Ribelli Edizioni | https://www.aliribelli.com/).\nLanguages\nWe are going to produce all the books and items of this campaign in English and Italian language.

We work hard to keep these costs as low as possible.\nAn add-on is an optional item that can be added to a Kickstarter pledge without changing pledge levels. Please note that if you select some add-ons starting from a PDF-only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees.\nExample:\nA backer, who has already pledged 44\u20ac for the Norse Grimoire Hardcover + D24 Die + PDf reward tier, would then need to add 20\u20ac to their pledge to claim an additional Game Master Screen. The total would now be 64\u20ac.\nIn general, you should be able to select an add-on by doing the following:\n 1. Click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n 2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n 3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nYou will choose your add-ons in the pledge manager after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.

But is there more truth to the story than she knows?\nFor those who are new to Myth or who missed the Myth Limited Edition rulebook, this book still includes much of the fantastic world-building from that previous volume, such as:\nLore overviews for every hero class introduced so far\nGuidance for solo play, including multi-class deck construction\nThe Art of Myth\nA full bestiary, including brand-new information about the Lucanines\nWhether you are a veteran hero or are just beginning your journey into Myth, The World of Myth has many wonderful new things to discover. \nThis is a small, straightforward campaign, so we\u2019ve kept our reward levels to a minimum.

Myth is a cooperative miniatures adventure game created by Brian Shotton, Kenny Sims, and Keith Lowe. \nUlisses Spiele purchased Myth in 2018, bringing Brian and Keith along to ensure that all future development would stay faithful to the game\u2019s spirit as we develop new stories. Ulisses is helping to keep the promises of the past while building for the future. \nWe are in the process of completing the remaining goals from the Journeyman Kickstarter, and we are offering World of Myth because we know that many of you wanted a leatherbound book of your own. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, we are getting ready to bring Myth back in a huge way. Be sure to follow the Ulisses Spiele Facebook page and sign up for our mailing list so that you can get the news as soon as it\u2019s available!\nWe are trying to keep the shipping costs down as much as possible by making all the packages simple and identical, but the realities of international shipping do require us to charge enough to compensate for those costs.

It's not like, a really small Cthulhu, but a Lovecraftian RPG powered by a minimalist ruleset! \nUsing the rules in this book, you'll be able to play investigators, doomed heroes, and classic cosmic horror characters of all types, from scientists and librarians, to WWI veterans, to mysterious guardians defending the world from the dark powers of cthonic entities!\nCover Mockup: Art by Tom Brown, Logo by Robert Denton\nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character archetype based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits that each grant a single benefit, and you're done!\nTiny Cthulhu features a myrid of settings set throughout the world and history, ranging from prehistory to the Bronze Age,  Age of Sail, World War 1, modern day, as well as fantasy, superheroes and the science fiction future!\nYou can survive cosmic horror in any time or place! (Lucky you!)\nAdditionally, each setting will have appendices that details how you can integrate other TinyD6 books like Tiny Dungeon 2e, Tiny Supers, and Tiny Frontiers: Revised with Tiny Cthulhu to create robust and unique experiences. \nInterior art by Nicolas Giacondino\nSometimes as the GM, you don't have time to plot lengthy, detailed worlds, but you want that experience. Well, we've got your back, and that support comes in the form of micro-settings!\nMicro-settings are short settings filled with adventure hooks, and designed to put your adventures and campaigns right into the thick of it, with as little work on the GM's part as necessary. \nOur goal is to fund a softcover edition, a limited number of hardcover collector\u2019s editions, and the Tiny Cthulhu dice. We\u2019ve planned several stretch goals which will increase page count, add more art, add more special rules but all of our goals will provide you with more fun and engaging cosmic horror tabletop content (is fun even the right word?)!\nThe interior art is filled with gorgeous black and white art from the very talented Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino, and the cover of the standard edition has been done by Tom Brown! \nAdditionally, the writing on the Tiny Cthulhu is being handled by top industry talent. We're set on paying all our contributors well, and our goal reflects our commitment to an ethical pay rate for our writers, artists, and team members.\n\nThe Illumination of Aldebaran Cover Mockup! Art by Tom Brown\nTiny Cthulhu uses a simple, fast, and dynamic rule-set to handle actions. The game uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution.\nIf you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third die to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single die).\nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select an archetype (such as Investigator, Scientist, Veteran, Socialite or more), three traits, and write down some basic information and you are ready to play!\nInterior art by Nicolas Giacondino\nIf you're familiar with the TinyD6 ruleset, you're probably wanting to know what's new in the game! Well, Tiny Cthulhu features the following:\nMinimalist Corruption rules focused on aiding storytelling. The Corruption rules in Tiny Cthulhu focus on showcasing how having your reality undermined by unimaginable horrors affects the character, and how individuals must commit every fiber of their being when trying to overcome cosmic horrors like these! \nNew enemies, new Environment Traits to aid the otherworldly storytelling, and new rules for magic and tomes!\nSupport for Pulp-style storytelling! A chapter titled Tiny Pulp will feature in this book, having unique rules for pulp and two-fisted action heroism! \nSupport for Noir-style storytelling! Integral to the Cthulhu mythos, Tiny Cthulhu will have a Tiny Noir chapter with minimalist investigation rules, details and help for constructing your own investigations. \nGadgets, Steampunk themes and more are integrated into Tiny Cthulhu!\nOur goal is to give you the most useful genre-book for Lovecraftian horror that we can!\n Micro-settings are unique, small settings that are specifically designed to be used as a tool, resource, or spring-board for your own campaigns. They're light on specific and deep details, but contain adventure hooks, overarching themes and plots, and the sort of building platform you need as a GM to get going!\nThey're short, 4-8 page high-level settings, designed to provide an evocative framework for each GM to launch their own variation and home campaign from.\nAll of the micro-settings come with some story that is designed to be unique to that particular micro-setting.\nOur micro-setting authors are a mix of industry veterans and new voices, each bringing a unique aspect to Tiny Cthulhu . Micro-settings are unlocked by stretch goals, and you can find out more further down the page.\nInterior art by Nicolas Giacondino\nThe book will be 5.5 x 8.5 in dimensions. If we unlock all the stretch goals, the book will be over 150 pages. Without, it'll be closer to 40.\nIf you want to add an extra softcover of Tiny Cthulhu you can increase your pledge by $20 USD. (No extra cost for shipping if you have a physical pledge already!)\nThe custom dice are pictured below. They'll be manufactured by our friends at Black Oak Workshop! They are an ivory color and a larger 19mm size, and best of all, they also glow in the dark!\nIf you want to add an extra set of dice (they come as sets of three), you'll want to increase your pledge by $10 USD. (No extra cost for shipping if you have a physical pledge)\nThe Tiny Cthulhu dice from Black Oak Workshop! (Yes, they glow in the dark!)\n The GM screen is 5x7, trifold, matte GM Screens (they'll be card-stock and light-weight, to fit the minimalist style of the game).\nIf you want more than one GM screen, you can add more for $2 USD each! (No extra cost for shipping if you have a physical pledge!)\nThe handcrafted dice-bags on the deluxe level look like the picture below. As a hand made item, there is always variation and inconsistencies in the fabric, coloring or pattern, but never the quality! These  project specific dicebags (and the accompanying hardcovers) are Kickstarter exclusives and are never sold retail after the Kickstarter is over.\nPrototype Bag!\nOur previous games are all available on DriveThruRPG! We'll also offer copies of them through the BackerKit if you want to combine shipping on any items!\nThe Decks!\nYou might be looking at our stretch goals and wondering what these decks of cards are! We've unlocked 4 decks.\nThe goal of the decks is to provide tools for players and GMs to keep track of rules and objects at the table. As a designer, I'm a big fan of cards as an optional tool to help ease game play, especially when you need to reference items that aren't always on your character sheet.\n Every backer who is getting a PDF of Tiny Cthulhu will get a PDF of any unlocked decks of cards. It's that easy. The stretch goal covers the digital reward for everyone! Yay! More madness!\n But we also want to do print versions. So, any backer can add $10 per deck of cards to get a physical version in their pledge. All you have to do is go to the Manage My Pledge button up top, and increase your pledge by $10 for each deck you want (including multiples if you want.)\nAnd yes, you can add-on for decks that we haven't unlocked yet, as it'll help us unlock them!\nThe cards will be printed using the DriveThruCards service unless we can get 500 orders for them, after which we can print them with a two-piece box in an off-set run from a card printer! We're also exploring other options!\n Mythos Spells deck provides specific spells on cards that anyone with the Spell-Touched Trait can use. Each of these spells also can be used by an investigator that doesn't have the Spell-Touched Trait, but at a higher corruption cost to themselves.\n MythosTomedeck of cards serves a similar purpose, but focused on occult books, scrolls, folios, tomes and more! Each contains a book, a brief description of some potential history, and it's in game effects (generally providing Advantage at a corruption cost to a general topic of Mythos lore, but sometime they have more...esoteric impacts.)\n Mythos Bestiary deck consists of a collection of non-human enemies and beasts that you can interact with, summon, fight and more! These will be similar to our Tiny Dungeon 2e Enemy Deck, but with improvements over what we learned when we made that three years ago.\n Mythos Location deck consists of two parts. One portion of the deck is reference cards for locations throughout the Mythos. These are prebuilt locations that state the collection of traits that define that location. The second half of the Mythos Location deck is a series of cards that have a single Environmental Trait on them. These cards all share an identical back, so if you want to randomly generate traits for a new location, you can!  You can just shuffle them up and deal them out. They also work great as detailed references for that card's listed Trait rules as they'll be printed on the card.\n Cults deck preview coming!\nUp Next!\n We're a small company, and we do our own fulfillment, so we can ensure it's done right. This does lead to high international costs, due to customs and the generally high price of shipping.\nShipping is charged in our post-crowdfunding pledge manager (we use CrowdOx.) \nWe do offer international shipping of course, but we can't offer refunds on your pledge because shipping was more than you thought. It can get very expensive (please be aware.) \nHowever, we do always put our books in Print-On-Demand on DriveThruRPG, so don't hesitate to just get the PDF and you can get the book later!\nIf you need shipping estimates, feel free to reach out to  shipping@gallantknightgames.com.\nAll of our digital rewards (and our print on demand rewards) are being handled by our fulfillment partners at DriveThruRPG!\n Gallant Knight Games is a indie game company ran by Alan and Erin Bahr. This is our 14th GKG Kickstarter!\nSome of our previous TinyD6 Kickstarters (Tiny Frontiers and Tiny Frontiers: Mecha & Monsters) delivered early to backers (4 months in the case of Tiny Frontiers), and Tiny Dungeon 2e was on time! We've hit some hiccups in the last two years by taking on too much, but we've committed to slowing down and delivering great, on time content. \nOur micro-settings are written by some of the most talented freelancers in the RPG business!\nTiny Cthulhu has been in development since 2017 and been in play-testing for over a year! The art is all in and paid for (with the exception of any stetch goals). The goal of this Kickstarter is to pay for the print run and unlock our stretch goals, making this a truly gorgeous book.\nClick the image above to join the GKG Discord!\nYou can click the image above to join our Facebook Group!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Can Gallant Knight Games handle this project?\nThis is Gallant Knight Games' fourteenth Kickstarter, and we learned a lot from our previous ones. We have one late project that's are not out to backers yet, but it's nearing completion (digital rewards are already out) and Tiny Cthulhu will not impact that project. This is a straight-forward project with some nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've always had! This is our bread and butter and we've gotten very good at our TinyD6 line and delivery!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: The draft text of all the rules is 100% done. All the art that isn't tied to stretch goals is in and done. The only text we're waiting on is the \"micro-verses\" and our stretch goals, and as we depend on the backers to determine what needs to be written, those will come throughout and after the Kickstarter.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG?\nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've elected to minimize our stretch goals to text increases, and we've set a finite limit of page count.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: We've already contracted and finished the core art for the game. Isn't it great? We're really happy with our artists. We've got some stretch goals for more art, but our artists are professionals. If there's a delay on the art, we have back-up artists we've already done test runs and are ready to work with.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, after which, we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year and ship that reward for you. If it's after that year, we might not have it, or we might have to ask you to pay new shipping charges (shipping goes up a lot!)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Random Cosmic Horror!", "descp": "You get 3 of the Tiny Supers d6 dice!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, in our pledge manager, and we ship all packages from the US.

A fire is lit \u2014 is it a lamp perched over the inscription on an ancient blade or a roaring conflagration consuming the house in which the howling fiends wait? Things will never be the same after this. You\u2019ve set forth on a damning path. Carry the Vigil. Fight back the shadows.\nIn Hunter: The Vigil, you play out stories following a core cast of characters as they fight their way through the Chronicles of Darkness, a version of our own everyday world filled with monsters. It\u2019s a lot like a TV drama, something like The Walking Dead or The X-Files. Individual gaming sessions, generally running two-to-four hours, are like weekly episodes. Secrets will be revealed, relationships will be tested, and blood will be spilled.\nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nWhen you create a character, you choose between three tiers of gameplay. At tier one, your characters will fight monsters with little to no support. They may find allies along the way, but they\u2019re on their own. At tier two, you play hunters backed by a compact that typically operates on a regional level. Your hunters have more guns and gear to fight the darkness. At tier three, you play cogs in a global conspiracy that has plenty of resources \u2014 and politics to boot. Conspiracies have more information about the supernatural than they let on, but even then...it\u2019s unclear if the lore they\u2019ve acquired is accurate or not.\nThree to five players are recommended to play Hunter, but the game can be played with two people. Each player slips into the role of a hunter. You\u2019ll make decisions for your hunter \u2014 when their best friend betrays them, you plot a scheme for revenge. When another hunter picks a fight, you decide whether your character runs or negotiates with them. Perhaps most importantly, you\u2019ll tell the story of how your hunters, even though they\u2019re terrified, stand up to monsters to uphold the Vigil.\nArtwork by Leo Albiero\nHunter: The Vigil first hit shelves in 2008. It was a popular game line that presented a new take for mortal protagonists compared to the core Chronicles of Darkness rulebook from 2004. It quickly became a fan favorite and spawned several supplements, including Slashers. No longer were ordinary humans going to be swept up in the machinations of the unknown; now it was time for them to take up the torch and fight back against the darkness.\nNow, over 10 years later, Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition is designed with a new premise: There are more monsters today than ever before. The rules found in this book are designed to give players and Storytellers new, flexible tools to identify, hunt, and capture monsters while enhancing the definition of what is means to be a hunter.\nArtwork by Tilen Javornik\nHunter: The Vigil Second Edition is a standalone game that can be played by new or existing players. The lore has been updated to not only reflect the uptick in monsters, but also the fact that hunting monsters is not exclusive to a location, group of people, or time period. There may be more monsters than ever before, but now there are more ways to fight them, too.\nIn Hunter: The Vigil, anyone can be a hunter \u2014 provided you are committed to the hunt. It is a game of personal horror and sacrifice that tests relationships and encourages teamwork within a cell, compact, or conspiracy.\nWill you heed the call? Will you uphold the Vigil?\nThis Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, and Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 250 pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, including...! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nArtwork and design subject to change.\nHunter: The Vigil Second Edition includes all the rules you need to play a hunter in a tier-one, -two, or -three chronicle.\n Chapter One: Flickering Candles provides an overview of a hunter\u2019s world; the history of the hunt; the types of hunters you can play; and three, separate types of gameplay included in this book: tiers one, two, and three.\n Chapter Two: Compacts and Conspiracies are specialized hunter organizations that may be used for tier-two or -three games. In this chapter, you\u2019ll read more about Hunter lore and the history of the compacts and conspiracies, find write-ups for six compacts and six conspiracies, along with rules for tier-three Endowments and how to make them.\n Chapter Three: Character Creation allows you to build and customize a character. You\u2019ll learn how hunters retain one foot in an unsuspecting world and another in the Vigil. Plus, you\u2019ll discover more about the Code and how it shapes hunters\u2019 core identities and beliefs.\n Chapter Four: Rules of the Hunt dives into the rules for gameplay. It also offers rules for specific aspects of Hunter that includes investigation and socializing along with teamwork and Tactics.\n Chapter Five: Monsters Around the World offers a taste of the strange and unusual monsters hunters may come across during the hunt. Sample monsters are presented according to the type of terrain from which they originate along with notes for how these creatures may be modified. Additionally, monster-creation rules, ephemeral-entity rules, and Dread Powers are found in this chapter.\n Chapter Six: Mysterious Places takes another look at the Hunter setting by introducing where monsters live, locations the supernatural has tainted, and which places are actually monsters themselves. It offers new rules to handle each type of location, along with several examples.\n Chapter Seven: The Slasher Chronicle is a sample chronicle setting. Yanked from the slasher-movie genre, the Slasher Chronicle is a horror-movie-themed setting that includes a new slasher-specific compact and conspiracy, rules for building slashers, customized approaches for tier-one, -two, and -three gameplay, new Storyteller characters, and more!\n Chapter Eight: Storytelling offers advice for Storytellers to help build and manage a chronicle while fleshing out rules for Storyteller characters. Additional content includes advice for creating player-facing compacts and conspiracies.\nThe Appendices provide Equipment, Conditions, and Tilts likely to come into play in Hunter. \nArtwork by Sam Araya\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of the Vigil.\nArtwork by Tilen Javornik\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($25,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to access a larger version of this Reward Tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Tier-One Hunter and Tier-Two Hunter Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Tier-Three Hunter Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Leo Albiero\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Vigil Compact and Vigil Conspiracy Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Rare Relic Dealer) will get 5 copies of the Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition Core rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nArtwork by Tilen Javornick\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Hunter setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a reception link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Sam Araya\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nFor +$5, add the Hurt Locker PDF to your rewards list.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 Tier-Two Hunter reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Conspiracy Theorist reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Rare Relic Dealer) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "CONSPIRACY THEORIST", "descp": "You've heard whispers and rumors, and now you're starting to collect data and put the pieces together.\nAs thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "TIER-ONE HUNTER", "descp": "You're self-sufficient.

Where the heroes help guide the world into a brave new era of promise or peril.\nWhat makes Age of Ambition different?\nWe\u2019re at a moment where fantasy, as a literary genre, has realized that societies change, grow and evolve. Fantasy gaming, however, has unfortunately lagged behind, mired in static worlds with no significant technological, magical or social progress.\nAge of Ambition changes that. It presents a world in a state of rapid flux, where magical and technological advancements are challenging the long-standing social order. It\u2019s a world that\u2019s grown beyond medieval fantasy to become something new.\nFurthermore, Age of Ambition casts the heroes as agents of social change. They are inventors and agitators, spies and civic leaders, who help guide the world into a brave and uncertain future.\nAge of Ambition will be a hardcover full-color book estimated at about 280 pages. Its features include:\nA lifepath-style character creation system, including birth omens, life events and careers that connect each character to the changing world.\nA fully-realized fantasy setting, including social dynamics, history, magic, politics and plot hooks galore! Discover a world rapidly leaving the medieval behind and entering a new era of hope and trepidation.\nSupport for a wide spectrum of power and influence, from peasant revolutionaries to the leaders of nations.\nSystems for personal ambitions, social change, inventions, trading goods, leading organizations, magic, combat, social status and more!\nWe have a proven track record of delivering Kickstarter rewards on time or early. The core rulebook is 100% written and it has received extensive playtesting, including several rounds of open playtests. \nAge of Ambition is inspired by a variety of fantasy fiction, including: Joe Abercrombie's First Law series, Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastard series and Brian McClellan's Powder Mage trilogies. \nIt takes place in the fantasy world of Trystell, home to a number of different peoples\u2014from humans and minotaurs, to ogres and gnomes. It is also the moon of a gas giant, with a hostile sister moon that once tried to colonize the world.\nSocially and culturally, Trystell is rapidly advancing from its equivalent of Earth\u2019s Middle Ages, into what might be called the Early Modern era. This is giving rise to new ways of thinking, and to advances in both magic and technology.\nMost of all, Trystell is a world that\u2019s facing its future. It\u2019s beholden to shades of gray and intrigue. No one knows what this new era will bring, but with it comes great peril and great promise.\nSo strap on your breastplate and pick up your pistol. There are discoveries to make, wrongs to right, tyrants to overthrow and new social orders to trial. \n\u201cLove the Saga Machine system... Going to adapt the system to other RPGs!\u201d\n                                                       \u2014James C., DriveThruRPG\nAge of Ambition is a new take on the fantasy genre. The core system, Saga Machine, has been in use for over a decade, including publication in our other roleplaying games, Shadows Over Sol, Against the Dark Yogi and Dime Adventures. \nThis version of the rules has been entirely revised and streamlined. In the playtest and elsewhere it has received widespread praise. We have 4.9 out of 5 stars on DriveThruRPG!\nWant to know more?\nAll backers can access the complete draft text of Age of Ambition today! Even a $1 pledge gets you access to the text.

In The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition, they are all that stands between civilization and the unimaginable dangers just beyond the wild\u2026\nThe game is written, the art is done, the editing is finished and layout is done! The PDF has already been uploaded to DriveThruRPG, and proof copies ordered!\nThis game is ready to go. We just need your help to get the word out about it, and help make sure everyone gets paid!  Gallant Knight Games has already paid for the art, layout, and editing, but making games is more expensive than that. \nThe long term success of a game can often depend on retail stores, gaming groups and more. The goal of our project is to run a focused, tight campaign that will allow us to make a high-quality offset print run of the corebook in both softcover and hardcover. We believe James has created a work of art here, and we want to show case that with the best print run we can do. \nThe day the funds are delivered to Gallant Knight Games you'll get your PDF and we'll put the game to print. This will be a very fast turn around and a very tightly focused project. We're producing one book, and everything else is digital. \nThe Publisher: The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition is being published through a collaboration between Gallant Knight Games and Barrel Rider Games. Gallant Knight Games is an independent publisher lead by Alan & Erin Bahr and is most well known for its Mithral-selling Tiny Dungeon, Second Edition roleplaying game and many Tiny D6 RPGs. Barrel Rider Games is an independent publisher lead by James M. Spahn and is most well known for its Swords & Wizardry: White Box-based products, including the first edition of The Hero\u2019s Journey, White Box Omnibus, and White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying.\n The Author: James M. Spahn is a veteran table top game designer and freelance author within the RPG industry. He has written several independent role-playing games, including White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying, White Star: Galaxy Edition, Untold Adventures Minimalist Fantasy Roleplaying, and 2017 Three Castles Award nominated first edition of The Hero\u2019s Journey. He has served as a freelance author for a myriad of product lines and publishers in the industry, including Cubicle 7 Entertainment\u2019s The One Ring Roleplaying Game and Adventures in Middle-earth. He has contributed to ENnine and Origins Award winning products on both of those product lines. He also contributed to Fantasy Flight Games\u2019 Star Wars and Legend of the Five Rings product lines, as well as several adventures for Frog God Games.\nThe Editor: Carol Darnell has edited roleplaying games for companies like Fantasy Flight, Green Ronin, Angry Hamster Publishing, R. Talsorian, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Gallant Knight Games and contributed her immense talents to dozens of products more. \nThe Artists: The cover illustration for The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Editionis by twenty year industry veteran Jon Hodgson. Hodgson\u2019s credits include providing illustrations for The BBC, Wizards of the Coast, Chaosium, Games Workshop, Paizo, and Cubicle 7 Entertainment. He currently owns and operates Handiwork Games.\nAll interior art is by Nicolas Giacondino, a veteran comic book artist and illustrator in the role-playing game industry whose credits include a range of products in the TinyD6 line of role-playing games, including Tiny Dungeon, Second Edition, Tiny Wasteland, Tiny Supers, Tiny Gunslingers, and Beach Patrol.\nLayout and title design have been done by Mike Brodu, an experienced industry layout artist with years under his belt on games like Planet Mercenary, Savage Worlds products, and more.\nWhy A Second Edition: It its original edition, The Hero\u2019s Journey Fantasy Roleplaying was explicitly designed to be compatible with Swords & Wizardry: White Box and similar games. While this new edition is still rooted in that classic rules set,extensive changes have been made to almost every element of the game in order to further evoke and emphasize the tone and theme of the game. In addition, more modern elements of game design have been seamless incorporated to keep play fast and simple. Some example changes include, but are not limited to\u2026\nNew Lineages: In addition to traditional fantasy lineages like Humans, Dwarves, and Elves, players will also have the option of playing the strange and obfuscated Changeling: A fey creature left as a replacement for a child stolen at birth and raised among mortals.\nNew Archetypes: The original edition of The Hero\u2019s Journey featured thirteen classes. This edition has been streamlined to keep the focus on classic, folklore-infused fantasy and now features only eight classes: the charming Bard, the clever Burglar, the noble Knight, the rugged Ranger, the swashbuckling Swordsman, the stern Warrior, the enigmatic Wizard, and the stalwart Yeoman.\nNew Monsters: Every single monster in The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition has been given a complete overhaul to bring them more in line with folklore, fairy tradition, and classic fantasy literature. For example: Kobolds, commonly known as yipping dog-lizards to many fantasy gamers, are now strange and diminutive elementals that appear old men fading into the stone as they guide and waylay underground travelers. Several new monsters are also introduced, like the savage draconic Lindworm, which craves the taste of flesh and whose wrath can only be undone when its impenetrable scaled armor is peeled away layer by layer. There is no such thing as a \u201cstock\u201d monster in The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition.\nNew Spellcasting: The traditional Vancian magic system which previously appeared in The Hero\u2019s Journey has been drastically overhauled. Now Wizards may cast any spell they know and each spell has a myriad of different potential effects! In addition, particularly brave and reckless arcanists may Tap the Essence and sacrifice their own body when they are otherwise unable to cast a spell. Instead of being a stock list of spells found in so many other classic fantasy RPGs, these spells have been modified and re-written to fit the tone and feel of The Hero\u2019s Journey.\nMyth Points and Magic Items: Unlike many traditional fantasy role-playing games, characters in The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition acquire magic items by performing heroic deeds that become inexonerably tied forever to the weapons, armor, and strange trinkets they carry on their adventures. As characters progress and grow, they earn Myth Points, which can be spent to create unique magic items specifically tailored by the player to their individual character instead simply finding a \u201cbetter sword\u201d in the next treasure hoard. Magics grow and develop alongside a character, becoming an important part of their legend.\nFinally, by partnering with Gallant Knight Games, Barrel Rider Games is able to deliver a product with better production values. In addition, the strength of this partnership combined with the success of this crowd funding operation means that future products can be developed to supplement The Hero\u2019s Journey Fantasy Roleplaying, Second Edition, including The Hero\u2019s Journey Companion, Fairie Stories, several new adventures, and other products in development.\nWe're keeping our stretch goals simple and focused around continued support for The Hero's Journey 2e.\nHere it is in a nutshell: every $1,500 we raise over goal, we'll release a new adventure for THJ 2e*. \nThese adventures will be delivered in PDF to backers, and if we unlock enough (3 to 4 depending on the adventure length), we'll also release a POD coupon for a compliled set, using DriveThruRPG's at-cost POD service. (In a nutshell, this means the backer will be responsible for shipping and printing costs of the product, but GKG/BRG won't take any cut of those, so you get them as close to cost as possible from DriveThruRPG's POD service.)\nIf we can raise $8,000 we'll also do a print-on-demand version of a GM screen, that fits the DriveThruRPG screen (landscape format). Again, the cost of printing and shipping (as well as the screen if backers don't have it), will be born by the backer.\nThe GM Screen has been unlocked!\nThat's it! We're keeping it simple, focused and to the point! If we think of any cool stretch goals while the project is running, we'll be sure to add them and tell everyone! \n *We're going to cap this to 8 adventures at the start of the campaign. It might change later!\n Unlocked Adventures!\nThe Curse of Cormac's Hollow: In the dead of night an ancient pact was made with the Fairie Queen of Winter. Now the price of deseprate promises must be paid, and unless a band of brave heroes can discover the secrets of a mad witch, an abandoned castle, and the terrible truth behind a royal consort, a century of frozen winters will be unleashed on the village of Loughwood in a single night.\nGoblin Promises: Long ago, dwarvish miners and kobold stonekeepers promised to honor the hallowed places deep beneath the earth. But new trouble arises from the chambers of Iarainn Beinn as a tribe of goblins has made raucous market in these sacred tunnels. Unless a promise to accomplish the impossible can be upheld a sinister, slumbering monstrosity will destroy it all in a cataclysm of wrath and fire.\nThe Midnight Siege of Loch Fealias: The townsfolk of Loch Fealis rose up against the brutal and bloody baron that drove them to blood and toil for the glory of his coffers. They came with torches and pitchforks in a righteous rage. And they failed. The baron is preparing his terrible horde to lay waste to all that they love insolence. As the village burns and the oppressed cry out for aid, hope for survival lay in a band of noble strangers newly arrived in Loch Fealias.\nThe Boggart's Boy: The merry halflings of Westwick are celebrating their annual High Summer Revels, but when the pranks of a mischievous boy become twisted by the malice of a dark fey, heroes must delve into the twisted depths of the nearby Thicket and rescue that same child. Should they fail, the boy's soul will be lost forever, and the people of Westwick will never again see a Summer Revel in their lands.\nChivalry and Chicanery: While at a tournament of martial prowess held by renowned baroness, the player characters find themselves drawn into political intrigue when they're offered an invitation at her feasting table. Things turn from dashing to deadly when murder most foul is committed and the heroes stand accused unless they can find the true culprits.\nThe Bride and the Bandit: A noble princess, stolen on the eve of her wedding by a masked bandit! But as the player character brave the Banditswood at the king's bidding to rescue her, they discover far more nefarious things are afoot than a forbidden love and political alliances. Indeed, a great evil festers at the heart of the kingdom and needs only this vow to set all the realm under the rule of evil...\nTroll Knoll: A seemingly unkillable troll is rising from beneath its bridge in the strange, fog-shrouded hill of the Northern Wilds. Travelers are being torn limb from limb and brave heroes who have slain the beast only find it rises on the morrow, eager to slay again. Only by braving its ancient burial tomb and setting its wretched soul to rest can the road through the wilds be made safe again. But none have ever gone into the Troll Knoll and returned alive...\nBeyond the Beanstalk: The great giant's castle in the clouds has crumbled and now threatens to tumble from sky and destroy the village. With the the aid of a strange and loyal ogre, the player characters must find a way to climb into the wild blue, and search the rubble in hopes of finding what terrible creature or incantation was strong enough to destroy a Sky Giant and their magnificent palace.\nGallant Knight Games is a small company, and we do our own fulfillment, so we can ensure it's done right. This does lead to high international costs at times, due to customs and the generally high price of shipping.\nWe do offer international shipping of course, but we will not offer refunds on your pledge because shipping was more than you thought, nor do we pay for VAT or customs fees. \nHowever, we do always eventually put our books in Print-On-Demand on DriveThruRPG, so don't hesitate to just get the PDF and you can get the book later!\nShipping will be charged when you pledge for the project (we are aware the pledges say otherwise.

Like all companies, we've had hiccups, but we continually get better, and we always deliver. We have two projects that are not out to backers yet, but one is currently printing and preparing for fulfillment, and the other is exactly on track and this project will not impact that one. This is a straightforward project with no nuances.\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: That's done! No worries on that end.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG?\nA: We deliberately built this project to avoid being complex.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: All the art is in!\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: That's unfortunately a risk, but Gallant Knight Games has lots of experience with international fulfillment and we're prepared to handle that if it comes up.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: All that will have to happen is printing and shipping. If the worst occurs, we can easily fulfill the project still.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\nGallant Knight Games only holds onto backer rewards for one year from the shipping date. If anything goes wrong, we'll do our best to sort you out after that date, but we can no longer guarantee rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Hero!", "descp": "You get the PDF of The Hero's Journey 2e and any digital stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Hero's Journey 2e PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["231 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "International Print on Demand Softcover!", "descp": "You'll receive the digital PDF of The Hero's Journey 2e, as well as an at-cost code to print a softcover copy at DriveThruRPG.\nThe cost of this softcover, as well a shipping will be the responsibility of the backer.\nThis pledge level is restricted to non-US backers only.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Hero's Journey 2e PDF\nThe Hero's Journey Softcover POD At-Cost Code", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Cunning Hero!", "descp": "You get the softcover of The Hero's Journey 2e and the PDF, as well as any digital stretch goals!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in our pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Hero's Journey 2e PDF\nThe Hero's Journey 2e Softcover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "You're a retailer!

The exertion of power over a flock. Satisfying their Hunger and their Beasts. Elevation of the self. Reassurance of the possibility of redemption. A grand plan they forged or that was bestowed upon them by secret masters.\nWhile some vampire cults span the globe hiding in plain sight, others are fringe faiths with morbid practices and ancient conspiracies lasting centuries. Others such as the incestuous Clan of Death and the malignant Church of Set \u2014 arguably the largest vampire cults of all \u2014 believe in a destiny that will enable them to impose their wills on the world of the living and the dead.\nWhether for power, salvation, or transcendence, all Kindred cults wallow in blood. They shed it in sacrifice, demand it of their followers, and exalt in it in unholy baptisms proclaiming their divine glories.\nThese cults dedicated to blood gods are among the most insidious, damning sects of Kindred, and tonight they approach their apex of power.\nArt by Michael Gaydos\nCults of the Blood Gods is a new style of sourcebook for Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition that introduces the pernicious horror of twisted beliefs.Designed for players and Storytellers, this supplement will include:\nAn in-character breakdown of the rise of esoteric beliefs among the ranks of the undead and how faith drives many of the major aspects of vampire culture.\nA host of religions \u2014 from historic theocracies and globe-spanning conspiracies to fringe cults and mortal beliefs arising in the modern nights \u2014 introduced for incorporation into your character backgrounds or as supporting casts and antagonist groups in your chronicles.\nThe history, structure, and ambitions of the Hecata, the vampire group known as the Clan of Death, as well as a chapter dedicated to playing a vampire among the Necromancers, and the ceremonies for their death-defying Discipline: Oblivion\nGuidance on how to use ecclesiastical horror and construct cults in Vampire, making them a vivid backdrop for your own stories, including new coterie styles focused on cult play.\nFaith-based story hooks and a full chronicle centered on the activities of the Hecata, involving walking corpses, ghosts, ready-made characters, and the secrets of the most twisted family in the World of Darkness.\nNew Loresheets, Backgrounds, and Predator Types for inclusion in your chronicles, encouraging player characters to engage fully with the material presented in this book.\nArtwork by Same Araya\nIn all of Vampire: The Masquerade's history, there's never been a book wholly dedicated to the diverse faiths and cults among Kindred, the ways in which they practice, their relationships with each other, and how to utilize religion in your chronicles as a force of hope and destruction. Cults of the Blood Gods is the book you want, if you're interested in incorporating ecclesiastical horror in your games. This book contains everything you need to have each Kindred in your coterie establish a cult, cleave to a unique faith, and establish domains in the name of an ancient methuselah, being of myth, or even the Kindred protagonists themselves. Not only that, it provides the tools necessary to play members of the Clan of Death, once known as the Cappadocians, then the Giovanni, and now the Hecata, as well as new powers for members of a large number of cults, rules for creating your own religions, and an entire story set in Munich with ready-made characters, so you can play immediately upon receipt of the book.\nThis Cults of the Blood Gods Kickstarter is devised to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to sit proudly alongside Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition core book.\nWe want to create an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d hardcover with a beautifully designed, full-color cover image featuring some of the most shadow-covered parts of the World of Darkness. We estimate the book to be more than 240+ pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, including new chronicles, characters, story hooks, and all further exploration relating to the most persecuted and secretive of Kindred faiths! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nCults of the Blood Gods gives you all the rules you need to play a member of Clan Hecata, or a vampire member of any number of faiths, including the Church of Caine, Bahari, Church of Set, and Cult of Mithras, among many others.\nChapter One: Rise of the Methuselah Cult\nChapter Two: Kindred Religions\nChapter Three: The Cult of Death and Undeath\nChapter Four: Mortal Cults\nChapter Five: Cult Construction\nChapter Six: Hecata and Oblivion  \nChapter Seven: Bloodlines and Loresheets\nChapter Eight: Styx and Bones\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting sneak peek previews of sections of the Cults of the Blood Gods manuscript as backer-only updates.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Cults of the Blood Gods possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Cults of the Blood Gods, possibly expanding into complete chronicles and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our clan.\nArtwork by Amy Wilkins\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($30,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged.

Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Mark Kelly\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Old Anziani Reward Tiers, which offer 2 copies as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Cults of the Blood Gods campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Ancient Premascine) will get 5 copies of the Cults of the Blood Gods hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nArtwork by Ken Meyer Jr\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from an option to act as an art model, as well as a chance to name an SPC or even provide a character to be included in the Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition setting via a future Cults of the Blood Gods supplement. There's an opportunity to help craft an Oblivion Ceremony, decide the fates of familiar characters, or even act as a Consulting Developer, an observer from the shadows, with access to communication channels shared by the developers and writers. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Cults of the Blood Gods.

All backers receiving the Cults of the Blood Gods PDF will automatically have this added to their rewards list.\nArtwork by Amy Wilkins\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Cults of the Blood Gods hardcover sourcebook), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasingly expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path has been able to mitigate some of the increased expense by negotiating new partnerships in a desire to keep as many options as possible available to our customers. Despite these efforts, shipping costs will still reflect an increased expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $25 Proxy Kissed reward tier to get the PDF version of the book from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Hired Muscle reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Ancient Premascine) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: The final project may not yet exist, but that's what this Kickstarter campaign is for - to carry this idea over the finish line. The text for Cults of the Blood Gods is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway. In short, if this project is funded, Onyx Path can assure you that everything in their control will be delivered.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "HIRED MUSCLE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "PROXY KISSED", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nINCLUDES:\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["786 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 47 or more", "title": "LAZARENE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Cults of the Blood Gods as well as a PDF copy of the Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition core rules.\nINCLUDES:\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nVampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition Core Rules PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["67 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "FAMILY HEAD", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) Hardcover Book\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,518 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "OLD ANZIANI", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and TWO (2) copies of the hardcover version of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "ANCIENT PREMASCINE >Retailer Tier<", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only **\nContact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "BLUSH OF LIFE", "descp": "As a special reward, you will submit a name that will be used for a Storyteller-played Character (SPC) which will be added to an upcoming Cults of the Blood Gods supplement (or alternate V5 supplement if necessary).

Originally published by Mayfair Games in 2004, Station Master has long been favored for its high player interaction, clever decisions, and fun gameplay.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to continue Calliope Games' 10 year anniversary celebration than by refreshing and publishing one of our favorite games - so we welcome you to the launch of the new and improved Station Master!  \nStation Master is a train-themed card game for 2-6 players.  In the game, players are working at the station, attaching railcars to Locomotives and boarding passengers on trains, trying to score the most Efficiency Points to win!\nWe have restored this timeless train game, creating stunning all-new artwork based on classic locomotives, railcars, and railroad history.  In addition, we have refined and streamlined the rules for modern audiences, as well as adding in upgrades and new material to create the greatest possible Station Master experience!\nPLAY\n\nCalliope Games has used Kickstarter ever since 2012, bringing to life a library of amazing games: Tsuro of the Seas, Roll For It!, Dicey Peaks, The Mansky Caper, Running With The Bulls, Hive Mind, Menu Masters, Ancestree, ShutterBug, Capital City, ShipShape, Everyone Loves A Parade, SpyMaster, and Tsuro: Phoenix Rising!  We love this community and this platform!\nExclusive Deluxe Box and Alternate Passenger Pawns Not Available In Retail Version After The Campaign!\nWe invite you to be the first to board the train and take a ride! Station Master will be available after release through distribution to retailers, but through this Kickstarter campaign, you can pledge for the Executive Class edition of the game, featuring improvements and exclusives not found in the retail version of the game.  The 36 exclusive Passenger pawn shapes and flip-top magnetic-close box in the Executive Class edition of the game will not be available through distribution after this campaign. \nEvery Tuesday and Thursday as we ride the rails through the campaign, we will reveal a FEATURED LOCOMOTIVE POSTCARD that will packaged in with the Executive Class version of the game! These are actual postcards that can be collected or mailed to a train enthusiast you know!  While not a gameplay element, each set of nine postcards is a wonderful free add-on for this beautiful game!\nMan vs Meeple\nNever Bored Gamers\nSAHM Reviews\nThe Dice Tower with Mark & Randy\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 24 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.\nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.\nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any venture, there are risks... those that are seen, and those that are unseen. The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nNew tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen. To date we've launched more than 20 games under the Calliope brand, many with a good number of reprints, and we have overcome all major production issues in providing our players quality entertainment experiences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Grand Central (Retailer)", "descp": "FOR VERIFIED BRICK-AND-MORTAR GAME STORES ONLY.

This will be an ideal setting for low-level campaigns, designed in the style of Keep to the Borderlands, et al.\nOur Plan\nRichard and I have been discussing for years the pros and cons of modern book publishing in the fantasy genre. This is about exploration into the realm of design and world-building. Backers have the chance to look behind the curtain of how we make a book while helping us answer key questions on the design. Backers have the opportunity to name NPCs, and place their own characters (or themselves) into the world.\nEventually, backers will be called upon to name the setting (within reason) and answer vital design questions through polling, done once a week during the kickstarter process. \nThe Setting\nEach location in the setting will include information on the building, the NPCs who work/live there, and random charts for seeding the environment with rumors, stories, plots, and so on. A toolbox filled with a plethora of useful goodies.\nThat's right. We said plethora.\nRewards\nFive different tiers allowing backers to select from a simple PDF to a print edition, or involvement in the setting, and everything in between.\nBecause we missed a key stretch goal while creating this page, we had the book unlock at $7500.

Imagine being cradled in the arms of death for years, sometimes decades on end, but all the while knowing you will eventually not only arise again, but possibly awaken to an unfamiliar world. Now imagine that your purpose, your entire existence, is bound within this cycle \u2014 that you are chained to it for eternity. You sleep, you wake, your serve your Judge\u2019s will in the lands of the living, and you return to the death-sleep once more. The ancient culture that empowered you is gone, lost to the sands of time\u2026yet you endure.\nIn Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, you play one of these beings. Those who know they exist, from the cultists who serve them to the dark forces arrayed against them, call them the Deathless. We call them mummies.\nThe Chronicles of Darkness, which debuted in 2004 as the new World of Darkness, drew upon the roots of the original World of Darkness and introduced a new look into a shadowy, dangerous world. Players could step into the everyday shoes of mortals, or they could vie for power and control as a vampire, werewolf, changeling, Sin-Eater, and more.\nLaunched in 2013, Mummy: The Curse was the first new game line from Onyx Path, and the first new Chronicles of Darkness game since 2009. With opening fiction by award-winning author Greg Stolze, Mummy presented a step forward in the evolution of the Storytelling system. That evolution continues with Mummy: The Curse Second Edition.\nIn Mummy: The Curse, players take on the characters of the Arisen, humans who were subjects of the greatest magic ever worked by mortal hands, the Rite of Return, in the long-lost Nameless Empire. As part of the Rite, they underwent ritual death, and their souls were eternally bound to their mortal remains. Consequently, while the Arisen can be killed, they will always return, their bodies reforming anew.\nThis Mummy: The Curse Second Edition Kickstarter is structured to enable us to create a hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 250+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, including new Utterances, expansions to the core systems, enhanced rules for immortals and the minor guilds, and all manner of ghostly antagonists! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nMummy: The Curse Second Edition includes all the rules you need to play as one of the Arisen: Decrees and Pillars that reflect the transformation by the Rite of Return, Utterances and Affinities as the powers you wield and the price you pay for them, magical relics and vessels for use or sacrifice, and all manner of antagonists from immortals to Shuankhsen and others besides.\n Chapter 1: The Arisen explains the guilds, their Decrees, and the Judges they serve for eternity.\n Chapter 2: Life When Deathless delves into Arisen society and history, how mummies function together in a group, or meret, and the manners by which they are called into waking.\n Chapter 3: Creating a Mummy presents character creation in a simple, step-by-step fashion, with an example to follow along. It also presents the game\u2019s Affinities and Utterances, being the godlike powers at a mummy\u2019s disposal.\n Chapter 4: Laws of the Arisen presents all the core rules necessary to run a game of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, including rules for combat, investigation, and drama.\n Chapter 5: Immortal Foes covers the people and organizations who hunt the Arisen, from the Lifeless and hungry Shaunkhsen and Amkhata to the immortals and blood sorcerers that sometimes work alongside our protagonists.\n Chapter 6: A World for Exploring opens up Mummy: The Curse to a multitude of settings the world over, from Denmark to Johannseburg and Hong Kong to Cuzco.\n Chapter 7: Creating Timeless Tales gives tips on running successful games of Mummy, and explores the game\u2019s niche of playing across multiple eras and utilizing cult troupe play. This chapter also contains a plethora of story hooks.\nThe Appendices provide Conditions and Tilts likely to come into play in Mummy.\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Mummy: The Curse Second Edition manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our guild.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($25,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this Reward Tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (The Lifeless and The Deathless Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (The Arisen Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Cultist and The Deceived Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Mummy: The Curse Second Edition campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Su-Menent) will get 5 copies of the Mummy: The Curse Second Edition Core rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Mummy setting or a possible future supplement. There's even an opportunity to act as a CONSULTING DEVELOPER, an observer from the shadows, with access to communication channels shared by the developers and writers. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Mummy: The Curse Second Edition. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Mummy: The Curse, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nA bundle of relevant PDFs from the previous edition of Mummy: The Curse, the Scroll of Fading Memory can provide inspiration and ideas for your Mummy: The Curse game.

Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement\nACHIEVED! - At $40,000in funding - NEW ADD ON: Storyteller Screen.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for import additional duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 Deathless reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Memory reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution. \nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Su-Menent) for this campaign! \nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you. \nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.  \nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 40th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Mummy: The Curse Second Edition is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. \n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "MEMORY", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "THE LIFELESS", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nINCLUDES:\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["381 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "THE DEATHLESS", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nINCLUDES:\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "THE ARISEN", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["622 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "CULTIST", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and TWO (2) copies of the hardcover version of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n2\u00d7 \"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "MAA-KEP", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition, as well as a BOOK PLATE signed by members of the creative team.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nSPECIAL: Signed Book Plate\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 135 or more", "title": "SU-MENENT **Retail Tier**", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only ** Contact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "SESHA-HEBSU", "descp": "As a special reward, you will name an NPC which will be incorporated into an upcoming Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition supplement (either enabled by Stretch Goal, possible unplanned future project, or future Chronicles of Darkness supplement, as necessary).

It takes place in 2097, thirteen years after the Last War in Deadlands Hell on Earth. \nHellstromme Industries created a \u201cTunnel\u201d between Earth and a distant star system later called Faraway. Millions of colonists settled on asteroid mining stations and the only inhabitable planet, Banshee, before the Tunnel collapsed and left them stranded.\nNow the humans must fend for themselves against a rogue military, ruthless pirates, angry anouks, the rise of an evil alien presence, and worst of all, the arrival of the Reckoners\u2014made flesh on Earth and exiled to Banshee!\nHolding things together are the Colonial Rangers, an outgunned, outnumbered force of humans and their anouk allies. They protect settlements from rampaging beasts, battle terrorists and pirates, broker peace between the humans and anouks, and strive to keep Hellstromme Industries and a rogue military from fighting a war certain to devastate all life in the system.\nBut their greatest threat is the return of the \"skinnies.\" Thought defeated by the \"Psychic Legion\" before they were recalled to Earth, these alien things summoned a great \"World Storm\" that ravaged the planet, weakened the humans and anouks who resisted them, and turned desperate souls to their psionic embrace.\n The heroes of Faraway join the Rangers in their quest to save the system. Transmuters \u2014or \"breakers\"\u2014destroy their enemies' weapons of war. Anouk warriors and shamans use Banshee's natural energies like magic to defend its native inhabitants and those who would aid them. Gunslingers and sykers take on feral creatures and ruthless pirates.\nThe undead Harrowed sometimes rise from the alien soil, and rumors say those who serve the living planet, whether human or anouk, might rise as living \"Guardians,\" gaining incredible new abilities in defense of Banshee's fading existence.\nDeadlands Lost Colony is the long-awaited relaunch of a line first published in 2000 for the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system. It's been rewritten from the ground up, reimagined, refocused, and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.\nWe've also cleaned up and standardized the rules for certain Arcane Backgrounds, like the undead Harrowed, who can now \"Let the Devil Take the Reins\" in exchange for mischief and mayhem!\nThe Plot Point Campaign\nDeadlands Lost Colony includes a full Plot Point Campaign, pitting the heroes against the exiled and weakened Reckoners themselves! We won't say anything more here so we don't spoil it for players, but the Reckoners are vulnerable for the first time\u2014and they aren't going down easy.\nThe core book for Deadlands Lost Colony is a 192 page \"graphic novel\" size hardback and full-color throughout.\nThe tri-fold screen is our usual landscape GM screen with gorgeous art by Konrad Krogull on one side and all the charts and tables you might need during a game on the other. The screen comes with a killer adventure by John Goff that takes place on the space station called the Widowmaker!\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so that you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or new Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds boxed set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items now, just head over to www.peginc.com and order. If you wait to order in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Lost Colony rewards) it won't ship until 2020.\nAdd Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. If you only want the dice, for example, you'll need to wait until they are for sale on our website after all backers have received their rewards. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Lost Colony specific Add Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nMore Archetype Cards were UNLOCKED as Stretch Goals!\nIf we get more funds than we asked for, we'll add some additional digital and physical rewards! The first are cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! Check back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for the rest of us! (Hey, we play too!) \n\n\n\n Help us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands Lost Colony is written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping.\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website first and later through DriveThruRPG. \nPhysical Rewards\nWe have another Kickstarter running RIGHT NOW, for Wendigo Tales Volume One, in the Fiction category!

Equipped for a twenty-year voyage, she will carry the Travellers on an epic journey from Charted Space to the edge of the Orion Arm. Deepnight Revelation must forge a path through uncharted systems and the territory of unknown alien races. Everything she finds will be new, and if she meets with disaster there will be no rescue.\nDeepnight Revelation\u2019s destination is a mysterious radio source at the mouth of the Great Rift. Described in the ravings of a madwoman as the place beyond everything, Terminus Point holds a terrible secret. Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!

Every story is unique. Every story wildly imaginative.\nWith Slaughter, you will create lovable, fun and ultimately flawed characters\u2026 and then take sinful pleasure in killing them off in ghastly ways.\nYes, this is a game all about the darker side of human - and inhuman - nature. But it also has a sense of humor.\nAfter all, you can\u2019t have Slaughter, without Laughter!\nThe game rules are decidedly simple. Perfect for introducing friends to gaming, or for getting the regular gaming gang together for an evening of murder and mayhem.\nDO YOU LOVE\nhorror movies - with plenty of twists?\nrole-playing games - that are fast & fun\ncreating stories - that surprise at every turn\nIf so, you'll love Slaughter: The Horror Movie-Making Card Game!\nAT A GLANCE\nNumber of Players: 3-6  (One Director and two to five Players) \nRecommended Age: 15+\nAverage Play Time: 90 minute to 3 hours\nHOW DO YOU PLAY?\nIn Slaughter, you use cards to represent the tropes of horror movies.  By mixing and matching these trope cards, you can weave a complex horror movie that will have you guessing right up to the very end credits.\nOut of the box, we provide decks of cards for the two most popular horror movie genres:  slashers and zombie movies. \nOf course, you can mix and match cards and mess with the tropes! Want aliens infecting a space station? Then replace the zombies with xenos terrors, complete with their own special effect tropes, and set them against your poor astronauts!  How about an Aztec vampire hunting people in New York? Make the serial killer have supernatural power and off you go! \nThere are no limits to your the movies your can create.  Just add imagination and off you go!\nYOUR JOB... KILL THE CAST!\nIn most horror games, players spend all their time trying to keep their characters alive.  \nNot in Slaughter!\nThe whole idea is to kill off the movie's cast in gloriously terrible ways!  A unique Death Point mechanic rewards players for killing off their character and cast. And replacing a player's character from the available cast of extras takes less than a minute.  As the movie progresses, and the body count climbs, the surviving cast get more and more desperate and take increasingly bolder risks.\nWHAT'S IN THE KICKSTARTER?\nSlaughter has been in design and production for several years. Now we are ready to manufacture and bring the game to you! \nThis Kickstarter is mainly for the printing and manufacturing of the STARTER EDITION DOUBLE FEATURE BOXED SET. We'll be able to manufacture a collection of amazing expansion decks to go with it.\nBut first, let's explore what's in the STARTER EDITION BOXED SET...\nPrinted rulebook - which is mercifully short. Slaughter has a highly streamlined rule system so play is bloody fast. Most details of how to play the game are on the cards, so there is no need to refer to books of complex rules as you play. You get to stay firmly in the movie at all times!\nBase deck - cards for props, special effects (SFX), injuries, and madness.\n Surviving the Horde deck - cards for running 'zombie' movies, including a wide selection of characters, talents, flaws, hooks, and scenes.\n Death Stalks deck - card for running 'slasher' movies, including a wide selection of characters, talents, flaws, hooks, and scenes.\n10 scenarios to get you started.\nDeath Tokens - to mark each player's progress in the movie and boost characters.\nCharacter Spotlight - heavy card stock mats that let you create a protagonist quickly, and keeps you focused on what matters.\nDirectors' Chair - a foldable mat that lets the Director organise the scenes, monsters and villains. \nCenter Stage - a large foldable mat that organises the cast of extras and cards in play.\nWHAT GAMERS SAY\nSlaughter has been play-tested to perfection.

These are also the best estimates for final shipping costs and we will do everything we can to hold the costs at these levels, or lower. However, we may to adjust based on market costs at the time of shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game has been written, extensively play-tested, the art and cards are laid out. So in terms of 'finishing the game,' it's mostly done and dusted. Zero risk there. In fact, within a few weeks of this Kickstarter closing, we'll deliver the game in PDF form to all backers.\nOur biggest challenge is to print the game, manufacture the box and have it shipped out to distribution points in Europe, Australia and the USA. \nWe've selected a master print house in China for our products since these folks offer the highest-quality we can find. To ensure the quality is up to scratch, we will order a pre-production run - that'll take about 4-6 weeks to get to us. We are mostly checking for print colour saturation at this stage... black and red cards can be tricky to get just right. If all looks good, then we'll give the go head for full-production. If not, we will make adjustments and redo, which may add a few extra weeks to the delivery times. But don't worry, we've assumed we may need a little extra time to get the print just right, and built that into our delivery schedule.\nShipping is another risk. We plan to bulk ship to three markets: USA, Europe and Australia, and then post. In theory, shipping should only take about 3-4 weeks, but in past projects, we've seen this take longer due to storms and other things beyond our control or ability to predict. We will insure the stock against loss and damage during shipping, as well. Just in case. In the worse scenario, we expect shipping may take up to 4 months. That's unlikely: we expect them to be delivered very quickly. We'll keep everyone updated from the moment the game leaves the factory.\nAs noted above, this Kickstarter is run in Australian dollars. That's a demand by Kickstarter since we are an Australian firm. We've listed estimates for the final cost of the game in US$, but there may be some currency fluctuations during the time the Kickstarter program is running. We'll update everyone with the currency impact should this be an issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "StoryWeaver Games\nFirst created \u00b7 12 backed\nStoryWeaver Games is an Indie Pen and Paper Games Publisher.

We're going to make a full colour, one creature per page, hardcover bestiary for the world\u2019s favourite roleplaying game. \n\n\nIt\u2019s going to be expertly converted, beautifully illustrated, wonderfully laid out, and full to the brim with useful content.\nIf we\u2019re extra successful we\u2019ll also include random encounter tables, drop-in encounters with battle maps, and lots of additional digital content. \nWay back at the beginning of the d20 times, when 3rd Edition was the big noise, gamers had two core manuals with which to play. The Player\u2019s Handbook and Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide were available, but there was a pause before we got the official Monster Manual. Into that gap burst The Creature Collection - the very first bestiary of Third Edition monsters! \nNow we\u2019re bringing the Creature Collection to 5th Edition!\nOur aims and campaign are simple: To see how large a 5th Edition bestiary we can create with your help! \nAt the heart of our campaign is The Scarred Lands Creature Collection for 5th Edition. We want to run a very focused, easy-to-understand campaign, and it\u2019s all about the book.\nThe Creature Collection begins at 160 pages, and will feature roughly 140 monsters. Most occupy a full page, some occupy two, occasionally they\u2019re longer. None are split up across pages - they always occupy at least one full page. We think this is vital feature for ease of usage: We want to give you a good-sized illustration for every adversary, along with a good depth of info and tips on using the creature. We also want the book to be a joy to read and use at the table.\nIf the campaign is successful, the book will grow, with additional monsters added as stretch goals are met. You will still pay the same price you pledged at, so it\u2019s worth getting in early and bringing in as many friends as you can! Together we can get MORE MONSTERS!\nWith this campaign our job is to make a single volume, so we're maxing it out at 256 pages. That way we don't break the bank shipping it to you, nor get delayed in delivery. But fear not, there are plenty of additional rewards we'll unlock should we grow beyond that point!\nEvery creature in the Collection is illustrated in full colour and, of course, is fully statted and described, as you would expect.\nThe book will be ordered alphabetically so that if you know what you\u2019re looking for you\u2019ll be able to quickly find it with maximum simplicity. When we reached out to DMs the thing we heard most was the need to be able to look things up easily. We all agree that we\u2019re frustrated by having monsters grouped by type, so we\u2019re using an A-Z navigation option for those times you know the name of the creature you\u2019re looking up.\nIn addition to this, we\u2019ve designed in a bunch of additional navigation aids to make this book super-useful:\nEvery monster has a tab at the side of the page that shows its CR, and they\u2019re colour-coded into groups. That allows you to very quickly gauge what kind of challenge each monster presents to your party.\nThere\u2019s also a series of tabs lower down the page edge that show in which habitat the creature can be found. \nThese tabs each sit in a fixed, exclusive position on the page edge, so when you flick through, you can easily spot what you're looking for. \nThe book will be fully indexed by monster name, and also by CR.\nThe Creature Collection is also available in PDF format. \nThe PDF will be fully bookmarked and hyperlinked. It will be delivered via DriveThruRPG so you\u2019ll have it in your library.\n Accompanying many of the reward tiers is The Digital Pack.\nThis is a set of digital accessories that complement the Creature Collection. Much of the content will be unlocked via stretch goals, so the more pledges we get, the better the Digital Pack becomes, at no extra cost! \nIt will contain digital poster-sized files of any unlocked battle maps from Encounter Pack stretch goals, along with additional battle maps suited to VTT formats and a VTT-friendly version of the Creature Collection if we do well.\nWe\u2019ll include digital files of art of the creatures to show your players, and we may unlock further accessories like VTT tokens and digital \u201cpaper\u201d miniatures. The Digital Pack will be delivered via DriveThruRPG so you\u2019ll have it in your library.\nFor the true Scarred Lands fan, the limited edition hardcover is a wonderful collector's item. Strictly limited to 100 copies, this tome comes in a leather-effect cover (vegan, not dead animal), embossed with the skull of a Spider Goblin. We'll be giving you more details on this exclusive volume during the campaign.  \nThe original Creature Collection was the genesis of the Scarred Lands setting. Scarn and the Divine War grew out of the Creature Collections to become its own vibrant, unique setting.\n\u201cA world known to its inhabitants as Scarn, the Scarred Lands is a place of dynamic heroism, supreme villainy, and incalculable magic. Torn and twisted by battles between the titans and their children, the young gods \u2014fought largely by monstrous titanspawn pitted against humans, elves, dwarves, and other \u201cdivine races\u201d \u2014 Scarn is a world still wounded deeply by the Divine War that took place less than two centuries ago.\nThe Scarred Lands has been a favored fantasy setting since the release of the Creature Collection in 2000. Over the next several years, over 40 titles were published for the Scarred Lands, making it one of the most fully supported fantasy RPG settings ever and the premiere product line of the former Sword & Sorcery Studios\u201d\nThe great news is that while the Creature Collection is a must-have for 5th edition Scarred Lands players, it works just as well for all 5th Edition games! \nWe want your help to decide which creatures to include. We\u2019ve already gathered choices from the Scarred Lands Corebook Kickstarter, from members of the Scarred Lands team, from our writers and artists, and now we want you to help select the next bunch of adversaries. We\u2019ll be running backer-only polls throughout the campaign where you\u2019ll get to choose which monsters are included in this Creature Collection.\nCreatures will be grouped into teams, and they'll battle, the winner being decided by your votes. Don't worry if your favourite Scarred Lands beast gets knocked out! Each creature gets more than one chance of being included in our tournament system! (and it's intended as a bit of fun. We won't wreck the collection so it includes 100 versions of Creature McCreatureface)\n Throughout the campaign we\u2019ll be sharing previews of our monsters! You can get two free chunks here and here, and then throughout the campaign further weekly previews will be backer-only. So if you\u2019d like to get a bunch of monsters for 5e over the next 4 weeks, jump on board!\n We've moved the stretch goal graphic to the top of the campaign to make it nice and easy to find!\nOur stretch goals add pages to the Collection, handy stuff to the Digital Pack, and Encounter Packs.\nHere's an example of an Encounter Pack: The Temple of the Stars. With some details redacted in case you end up playing it! \nWe\u2019ll also expand the Digital Pack that\u2019s available with selected reward tiers with things like VTT tokens, battle maps and more!\nTo Add-On additional copies of the Scarred Lands Creature Collection for 5e including a PDF and an additional copy of the Digital Pack, add the following:\nFor the US: $60 per copy (includes shipping)\nFor The UK/EU: $60 per copy  (includes shipping)\nFor Brazil: $70 per copy  (includes shipping)\nFor everywhere else: $65 per copy  (includes shipping)\nAs part of our campaign, we\u2019re also offering you the chance to grab previous Scarred Lands titles at a great price!\nWe begin with three adds ons: the 5e Scarred Lands Player's Guide in print, and 2 PDF bundles.\nTo get The 5e Scarred Lands Player's Guide in print,  including shipping, simply up your pledge by $30.\nTo get the The 3e Bundle, simply up your pledge by $15.\n\n                              To get The 5e Bundle, simply up your pledge by $15.\n\n\n                              Here\u2019s the details of each Add-On:\nThe Scarred Lands Player's Guide for 5e is a 312 page full colour guide to this fabulous setting.

This is a world shaped by gods and monsters, and only the greatest of heroes can expect to be counted among them. The most populous continent of Scarn, Ghelspad, plays host to vast unexplored regions, hides unsolved riddles from ancient cultures, and taunts adventures with the promise of undiscovered riches hidden among the ruins of older civilizations.\nYet the myths of the Scarred Lands are relatively recent events.

In this revised edition of The Wise & the Wicked, all the same characters have returned (and we\u2019ve added some new ones, too!), all newly updated to 5th Edition rules, for use with the Scarred Lands Player\u2019s Guide.\nThe Wise & the Wicked introduces a rogue\u2019s gallery of the Scarred Lands\u2019 movers and shakers, characters who carry out the will of the gods or the fallen titans. These non-player characters can be friends, enemies, or simply convenient resources for the player characters in your game.\nHere you\u2019ll find a fascinating compendium of characters from the Scarred Lands, but easily transported into campaigns set elsewhere. In addition, find multiple appendices full of new magic items and artifacts, class archetypes and prestige classes, new feats, new creatures and races, and more.\nWe already have 60 monsters converted, edited, illustrated and laid out, so work is well progressed. Our systems are all in place, and we have an extremely experienced, talented and motivated team ready to complete the project should we fund.  We have more writers and artists in the wings waiting on the green light to start more conversions should we fund. And if we do really well we'll expand that team further.\n  With this Kickstarter we want to get this important and useful traditionally printed book into stores\".  And we\u2019re relying on your help! We're also using this Kickstarter to open up our EU and RoW shipping options.\nWe've worked hard to secure a European shipping option for this campaign, so that we can ship from both the EU and the US, reducing costs to you, and making it viable for our European friends to get in on the action without incurring high shipping fees and import duty!\nThis means this campaign is a little different than others from Onyx Path Publishing. Most of the differences occur backstage, but if it goes well then you may well see more EU-friendly shipping in future.\nThe main difference to you, the backer, is that shipping to the EU and so-called \"Rest of World\" is much cheaper than it has been historically, and books will be dispatched from both the EU and the US.\nThe team producing the Scarred Lands Creature Collection and running this campaign is Handiwork Games. We were approached by Rich Thomas of Onyx Path to lend a hand in creating this whole supplement. We are an extremely experienced team of game producers, writers and artists, led by industry veteran Jon Hodgson, who was formerly creative director at Cubicle Seven, and oversaw all creative production there for 3 years.\nFounded in 2012, Onyx Path Publishing is a Pennsylvania-based company dedicated to the development of exemplary, immersive worlds. Working with a group of amazingly talented creators, we explore print, electronic and other forms of media distribution to make our products available to our fans.\nOnyx Path staff are united in our common background with White Wolf Publishing and we will continue to supplement those famous product settings with new releases, while adding to the industry with brand-new concepts for game play. We are lucky to include ENnie, GAMA and other award-winning creatives as contributors to our upcoming release schedule. Their commitment to quality reflects the goal of Onyx Path and the reason for our existence.\nWith over 20 years of publishing experience from which to draw, we are industry professionals who love the art of the game and plan to continue making meaningful, innovative contributions in the years to come.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween us, we have run or co-run a wide variety of Kickstarter Campaigns. \n\nThe usual risks apply here - if we grow the project beyond the initial scope there may be a short delay on delivery while we make extra material. \n\nIf we encounter sudden delays in converting material for reasons unknown, or the international shipping suddenly changes dramatically we may see some delays while we replan. \n\nBut we won't stop work because of any of these things.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Weekly Preview PDFs", "descp": "You'll get free weekly PDFs during the cmapaign, showing off samples of the creatures found in the Creature Collection.

Someone changed you: on a slab, an operating table, an altar. By luck or by fate, you escaped. Hunted by your creators, they hold all the cards, and it seems they might recapture you. Except, what they don\u2019t understand is they\u2019ve stoked the fires of vengeance; what they did wasn\u2019t right. What they don\u2019t know is that now \u2014 you\u2019re hunting them.\nDeviant: The Renegades presents a game where the victims of experiments band together to bring down the monolithic organizations that twisted and warped them.\nA brand new game is added to the Chronicles of Darkness...\nThe Chronicles of Darkness, which debuted in 2004 as the new World of Darkness, drew upon the roots of the original World of Darkness and introduced a new look into a shadowy, dangerous world. Players could step into the everyday shoes of mortals, or they could vie for power and control as a vampire, werewolf, changeling, Sin-Eater, and more.\nNow, some 15 years later, the Chronicles of Darkness and its supporting lines are flourishing, with each game receiving second editions, starting with the 2013 release of the Chronicles of Darkness rulebook.\nIn Deviant: The Renegades, players take on the characters of the Remade, human beings who have been transformed into something else through the action of human actors. No millennia-old curse, moon-spirit\u2019s favor, or Supernal Watchtower changed the Remade into what they are; their state is the result of chanted spells, long surgeries, experimental treatments, bizarre accidents, or alchemical poisons. Their creators \u2014 Progenitors \u2014 have human faces; they are people who saw what lurks in the shadows of the world and wanted power for themselves. Many Remade \u2014 Devoted \u2014 still serve the conspiracies that changed them. The player characters are Renegades, Remade who have escaped the clutches of their creators\u2026 for now.\nThis Deviant: The Renegades Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 250+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including new Forms, expansions to the core systems, enhanced rules for Devoted and conspiracies, and additional settings and conspiracies! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nNOT FINAL DESIGN\nDeviant: The Renegades includes all the rules you need to play as one of the Remade: Origins and Clades that reflect the circumstances of your Divergence and the nature of your transformation, Variations and Scars that describe the powers you wield and the price you pay for them, and conspiracy rules that let the whole troupe flesh out the faceless organizations that serve as the game\u2019s main antagonists.\n Chapter 1: Origins and Clades introduces the various ways Deviants become Remade and how the conspiracies classify and divide them.\n Chapter 2: Setting reveals the world in which Deviants live. Here we examine the Divergence\u2019s effects, how the Broken meet their daily needs, and how they take the fight to the conspiracies.\n Chapter 3: Renegades provides rules and game systems to make Remade characters, their powers and the burdens they carry as a result of their Divergences.\n Chapter 4: Storytelling System presents all the core rules necessary to run a game of Deviant: The Renegades, including rules for explosions, radiation, and corrosive substances.\n Chapter 5: Antagonists covers the people and organizations who hunt the transformed, and who the Deviants hunt in return. This chapter provides systems for creating your own conspiracies, and how they react to the actions of the characters.\n Chapter 6: Settings and Sample Conspiracies tours the world, examining several locations in how the conspiracies and Broken struggle against each other, and one another.\n Chapter 7: Storytelling gives tips on running successful games of Deviant, and explores the game\u2019s niche of transformation and revenge.\nThe Appendices provide lists of the equipment, Conditions, and Tilts that are likely to come into play in Deviant.\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Deviant: The Renegades manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Deviant: The Renegades that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into the book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Deviant: The Renegades, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done: build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our cohort.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($35,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to see a larger version of this reward tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Touchstone and Renegade Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Devoted Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Manticore Companion and Cohort Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!). \nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Deviant: The Renegades campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Node) will get 5 copies of the Deviant: The Renegades Core rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Deviant setting or a possible future supplement. There's even an opportunity to act as a CONSULTING DEVELOPER, an observer from the shadows, with access to communication channels shared by the developers and writers. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Deviant: The Renegades. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of Deviant: The Renegades, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nPRESTIGE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Deviant: The Renegades, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com and cards from DriveThruCards.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\nFor +$10 EACH, add any of these CHRONICLES OF DARKNESS titles to your digital library:\n +$10 for Chronicles of Darkness Core Rulebook PDF \n +$10 for Vampire: the Requiem 2nd Edition PDF \n +$10 for Werewolf: the Forsaken 2nd Edition PDF \n +$10 for Mage: the Awakening 2nd Edition PDF \n +$10 for Beast: The Primordial PDF \n +$10 for Chronicles of Darkness: Dark Eras PDF \n +$10 for Demon: The Descent PDF \n+$10 for Promethen: The Created 2nd Edition PDF\n\nPHYSICAL REWARDS\nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of Deviant: The Renegades (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement  \nAchieved! - At $40,000 in funding \u2013  NEW ADD ON: Storyteller Screen. We\u2019ll create a Deviant: The Renegades Storyteller Screen. Can be added on to any reward tier containing a hardcover book for only +$20.\nAchieved!  - At $45,000 in funding \u2013 NEW SUPPLEMENT: The Clades Companion PDF. As Cephalists embrace wildernesses of the imagination, so we will create a new supplement that moves beyond a purely human experience, introducing Forms designed for Storytellers and players who want to introduce Deviants who were not originally human beings (or at least not ones native to Earth). This includes sapient animals, androids, ephemeral entities trapped in human bodies, and exiles from alternate dimensions and timelines. All backers receiving the Deviant: The Renegades PDF as part of their pledge level will automatically have the Clades Companion PDF added to their rewards list.\nAchieved! - At $50,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add the Beast: The Primordial PDF to the list of title options, and reduce the price to $12 EACH for this Add On.\nAchieved! - At $56,000 in funding \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. As Chimerics are at home with every species of animal, the Clades Companion PDF will be expanded to include a wide assortment of sample animals and Manticores - perfect for Remade with the Manticore Companion Merit or the Animal Transformation Variation.\nAchieved!  - At $59,000 in funding \u2013 KICKSTARTER BACKER T-SHIRT \u2013 Hosted on the redbubble store for a limited time, a Deviant: The Renegades-themed shirt will be priced at a steep discount. All backers will be notified when the shirt becomes available.\nAchieved! - At $62,000 in funding  \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. Coactives have connections to worlds not our own, and so The Clades Companion PDF will be expanded to include full ephemeral entities rules, including guidelines for creating new Numina and parallel worlds using Deviant\u2019s toolbox approach, as well as guidance on how these beings interact with Variations such as Otherworldly Connection.\nAchieved! - At $65,000 in funding  \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Chronicles of Darkness: Dark Eras PDF to the list of title options, and reduce the price to $11 EACH for this Add On. \nAchieved! - At $68,000 in funding \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. Invasives maximize the effectiveness of every tool that passes into their hands, and so The Clades Companion PDF will be expanded to include more equipment, as well rules for high-tech prototypes and shoddy goods and services.\nAchieved - At $70,000 in funding \u2013 DIGITAL WALLPAPER \u2013 An awesome digital wallpaper for your computer desktop featuring art from Deviant: The Renegades. All backers will have this automatically added to their rewards list.\nAchieved - At $72,000 in funding \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. No Clade embodies the strange and dehumanizing effects of Divergence quite the way the Mutant does, and so The Clades Companion PDF will be expanded with new Forms that transcend the singularity of the self and the flesh-and-blood body \u2013 a human consciousness uploaded to a mainframe, a talking mystical item, or an advanced A.I. with a drone for a chassis. Or, introduce Remade who are part of a line of clones or replicants who share memories, such that physical death is little more than an inconvenience; some even have whole wardrobes of new bodies, each one customized to match an urgent practical need (or just the Broken\u2019s current mood).\nAchieved! - At $74,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Demon: The Descent PDF to the list of title options, and reduce the price to $10 EACH for this Add On.\nAchieved! - At $77,000 in funding \u2013 DEVIANT: THE RENEGADES NOVELLA - A short story written to better define the Deviant play experience and the world in which it takes place. All backers receiving the Deviant: The Renegades PDF will have this automatically added to their rewards list.\nAchieved! - At $80,000 in funding \u2013 NEW SUPPLEMENT: The Devoted Companion PDF - We\u2019ll create a new supplement that explores the Devoted in greater depth. This will include new Forms, as well as greatly expanded conspiracy and Devoted rules to give Storytellers and players the tools they need to portray the Renegades\u2019 foils. All backers receiving the Deviant: The Renegades PDF as part of their pledge level will automatically have the Devoted Companion PDF added to their rewards list.\nAchieved! - At $82,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Promethean: The Created 2nd Edition PDF to the list of +$10 Add On title options in the Celebration of Darkness Add On Reward list.\nAt $84,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition PDF to the list of +$10 Add On title options in the Celebration of Darkness Add On Reward list.\nAt $87,500 in funding \u2013 ART BUDGET INCREASE - Additional funds will be allocated to the art budget, adding more evocative art to the Deviant: The Renegades book.\nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 38th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Deviant: The Renegades is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com.

If they are lucky they'll get to a tavern the sells their favourite drink!  \nIncluded in the game is an expansion called \"Under the Table.\" where different drinking establishments are visited,  each with their own unique rules of etiquette and different breweries for drinks.\n We need your help to bring Dwarven Beerfest to life! \n\n\nTo purchase an add-on simply increase your pledge amount by the price of the game you want to add on.  \nSupporting our Kickstarter is easy!

In PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game, based on the wild and irreverent miniatures game of the same name by Bad Roll Games, you and your friends assume the roles of mercenaries who roam the Wasteland. In this bleak and radioactive land, you fight to survive, explore the ruins of what came before, and trade blood, sweat, and tears for the precious bullets that have become the land's currency. Explore the radioactive ruins, fight battle-crazed mutants, negotiate with bizarre cultists, bargain with junkers and scavengers, and unearth fantastic relics from the past. Brutal and filthy, PunkApocalyptic: The RPG offers thrilling adventures steeped in the carnage of a bleak and devastated future.    \n\n As a huge thank you to everyone who has supported so far, all backers of Scavenger and higher get FOUR bonus missions!     \nArt by Matteo Spirito\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG uses a variant of the Demon Lord Engine, introduced first in the horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord. Designed for a short-burst campaign of eleven adventures, with flexible character development, and no-nonsense, streamlined rules, you can bang out a character in no time and get down to the business of kicking ass.\nYou start the game as a fragile survivor, choosing from a list of eight backgrounds such as Muscle or Face. Once you complete your first mission, you assemble a team, and choose a novice path to guide your character's development. Novice paths include the mutated freaks, killers, and scum. The more missions you complete, the more choices you make, picking up an expert path and eventually a master path.\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG includes some variations on the Demon Lord Engine, such as using eight attributes instead of four, with Grit as a healing resource, along with a few other changes. If you know how to play Shadow of the Demon Lord, you'll have no trouble playing this game. And if you don't yet know Shadow of the Demon Lord, well, it's easy, using familiar dice rolling conventions to make it easier for folks familiar with some of the other well-known roleplaying games currently being played today. \nArt by Matteo Spirito; This could be you!\nWant to learn more?

Over 600 backers jumped in with $26,000 in funding in March of 2019. That campaign produced another 128-page, Norse-inspired setting book, with three large settlements, sample villages, and a relationship map to tie all the factional strife together. Those books are all in backers' hands.\nThe Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn campaign also produced a second edition of Hall of Judgment\u2014with a glorious sewn, lay-flat binding just like that of The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn. Running concurrently with the Dungeon Fantasy RPG Monsters 2 and Boxed Set Reprint campaign, it also resulted in Fantastic Dungeon Grappling . . . an eight-page booklet with awesome new ways to get eaten by monsters. Or grapple folks. But mostly get eaten by monsters.\nThree books in a year . . . and now Gaming Ballistic would like to produce three more: two adventure/setting books, and a small character generation supplement detailing new playable races with flavor specific to the Nor\u00f0lond world.\nPlease join Gaming Ballistic to create these new Nor\u00f0lond Sagas, published under a continuing license for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG from Steve Jackson Games. \nThe Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game\u2122, Powered by GURPS \u00ae, GURPS \u00ae, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, and used under license.

All rights reserved.\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth\nThis setting expansion and adventure scenario details the towns of Midgard and Jarngar\u00f0r, and provides a looming threat worthy of a party of seasoned delvers. Targeted at four to six delvers of 300 points or more. Written by Kyle Norton (Dungeons on Automatic).\nThe Ruins of Rosgarth are occupied again, this much is certain. But mining caravans and logging expeditions are being threatened by growing hordes of undead, as well as surging ranks of dragonkin. Wizards and clerics alike are muttering uneasily as they feel magic itself in a state of unrest. The Aesir whisper in the dreams of heroes. Journey into the wilds north of Audreyn's Wall to Rosgarth Ruins. Investigate the source of the danger . . . and defeat it if you can. \nCover work-in-progress. Image is final, but back cover text is still lorem ipsum!\nForest's End \nThe King proclaimed some time ago that for the first time in centuries, the ranks of the nobility would be expanding, with lands available for those bold enough to hold them. The catch? The lands lay beyond Audreyn's Wall, where dragonkin roam, giants dwell, and all manner of creatures make their lairs.\nAnd yet the Dragongrounds, as they are called, are home to countless ruins and dungeons . . . and the boundless and magical wealth of the fallen empire of the Dragon Queens. One thegn, more than bold enough to take up the King's challenge, built a fortified settlement near where the forest meets the sea: Sk\u00f3garenda . . . Forest's End.\nSeveral years have passed, and the settlement has thrived. The thegn is ready to claim his rightful status as lord and jarl. A great feast is planned. What could go wrong?\nForest's End features several threats and three actual dungeons to delve for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG! Written by Merlin Avery. \nSample internal layout with page border and header. Content is from Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn for illustration purposes only.\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk \n This short supplement brings at least 16 different playable racial templates to supplement those from Dungeon Fantasy Adventurers. Including Nor\u00f0lond-specific versions of elves and dwarves, it also provides ties to other cosmology for the setting: dragon-blooded, children of humans and demons, and other hybrids, such as raven-folk and those who are brothers and sisters to bear and boar. With new traits available for every Dungeon Fantasy RPG race, this book allows you to tie all of the \"usual suspects\" in with the Nor\u00f0lond setting and bring some entirely new abilities to your games. Easily portable to other settings. Written by Kevin Smyth, who was deeply involved with writing and proofing the pre-generated characters from Hall of Judgment.\nDraft cover work-in-progress. Back cover presentation subject to change!\nThere are only three goals for the project: The basic funding goal that we need to get the thing done at all, a level where the printing gets to a higher quality, and a goal where the adventures get some extra page count.\nBasic Funding Goal: $15,000\nAt 15,000 we've secured enough funding to pay the authors, the artists, and get the books printed to the following page counts:\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk: 16 pages (the full book)\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth: 48 pages\nForest's End: 64 pages\nNo matter what, the books will be 8x10\" format (like all other Dungeon Fantasy RPG products), softcover, and full-color.\nAt this goal level, physical copies will be fulfilled by Print on Demand or short-run digital printing, with manufacturing location optimized for international and domestic fulfillment (that might mean a short run with a PoD printer here in the USA, with international copies by Lightning Source/DriveThru RPG or\u2014if I can find a good deal\u2014someone like CPI Anthony Rowe in the UK).\nHigh-Quality Print Run: 300 Physical Copies\nAt 300 physical copies (and based on past Kickstarters, that's about 450 total backers, and about $22,000 ... but the goal is based on the number of physical orders) it becomes more cost effective to get a high volume print run from the same printers who did Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn and Hall of Judgment (Second Edition).\nAt this level, all three books will feature upgraded paper (130gsm/87#) and a 255gsm (about 10 point) cover. The scenario books will get a sewn, lay-flat binding; the races book will always be saddle-stitched (stapled).\nIncreased Page Count: $29,000\nIf the campaign hits $29,000, then both The Dragons of Rosgarth and Forest's End will each get a 16 page boost. That gives more room for creatures, extra scenarios, and other goodness.\n Add-ons\nAdd-ons are extras that can be placed in your backpack of holding during the campaign. To add these items to your rewards, simply include the listed cost as part of your pledge.\nThe added funds appear as a credit during the Backerkit phase . . . pledging them early helps the project fund! \nNote that some of the products below are not for the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game, but rather for Fifth Edition, Swords & Wizardry, or my own Dragon Heresy.

This book offers detailed information on the denizens of Asgard, the divine realm worshipped by the people of Nor\u00f0lond and its surrounding regions.\nThe book presents additional options and guidelines presented for Clerics who choose to devote themselves to the worship of just one instead of the pantheon as a whole. Also included are more than twenty new Holy Might abilities available for Asgardian Clerics and Holy Warriors to bring the word . . . or the sword . . . to those that need it.\nThe book is 16 pages long, in 8\u00d710 format, in full color. Written by Kevin Smyth.\nThe Hand of Asgard: $10 in print, $5 in PDF; $13 Print+PDF\nExtra Copies of Kickstarter Books\nIf you're a PDF-only backer plus you want another copy of one of the books, or if you want to add books for gifts, or anything else, once you've made a pledge, you can add individual copies of the books later on in the Backerkit phase.\nAs long as you're part of the campaign (pledge at least $1), during the add-on phase you will be able to get the following prices regardless of hitting stretch goals. (If we hit the 'more page count goal' and it's a pre-order, rather than adding on to an existing pledge, it may cost a few dollars more to get the larger books).\nNordlondr Folk: $10 in print, $5 in PDF; $13 Print+PDF\nRosgarth: $18 in print at 48 pages; $9 in PDF, and $23 Print+PDF\nForest's End: $21 in print at 64 pages; $11 as PDF; $26 Print+PDF\nNor\u00f0lond Area Map\nIsfjall, Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn, Midgard, Jarngar\u00f0r, and Sk\u00f3gurenda.

The maps in the various books keep the focus on the local adventuring areas . . . but what if you want the longer view?\nGaming Ballistic is pleased to offer two options for larger-scale maps. The image below is from the Dragon Heresy RPG, and done in that style. The maps will be re-drawn by Glynn Seal to match other Nor\u00f0lond maps presented in Hall of Judgment and Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn.  \nThey come in two flavors.\n$5\u2014Two-Page Paper Map.

These will be printed on 14 point/300gsm card stock with a gloss lamination, in either 16x20\" or A2 format. Be warned: shipping is separate, and may be expensive, since this will certainly be a large format package.\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn is a setting for theDungeon Fantasy RPG. It details three major settlements, provides a small village generator, and presents two important adventuring locations: The Hunted Lands to the northwest of The Palisade, and the Endalaus Forest, to the north and east of Audreyn's Wall. It is a setting filled with adventuring possibilities, easily tuned up or down in power level as the GM desires to suit any fantasy campaign!\nGood luck, and may the Fates have a bold destiny in store for you!\n The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn (PDF): $14 \n The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn (Print-only): $28 \n The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn (Print+PDF): $35 \nFantastic Dungeon Grappling\nFantastic Dungeon Grappling takes the \"attack roll, defense roll, damage roll\" basic play of Powered by GURPS and makes it work for grappling as well.

Find the waybridge that will transport you instantly to your destination, or journey overland for weeks through treacherous terrain.\nWhen you get there, will you be able to prove your worth and enter the Lost Hall of Tyr . . . or will a conniving High Lady of the Fae thwart your intentions?\nThe digital version is a 112-page PDF, hyperlinked, bookmarked, and in full color.\nThe Print and PDF bundle is for those that want a tangible copy of the original. Printed perfect-bound on 100# matte white paper, copies in the USA will ship from Gaming Ballistic, while overseas will fulfill through CPI (and are slightly thinner).\n Lost Hall of Tyr (PDF): $15 \n Lost Hall of Tyr (Print Only): $30 \n Lost Hall of Tyr (Print + PDF): $40 \nThe Dragon Heresy Introductory Set\nThe Norse-inspired world of Etera gets a full treatment in this self-contained RPG. All you need to play through Level 1-5, including setting, rules, character creation, and a bestiary featuring over 100 Norse-inspired critters.\nThis 288-page RPG is a stand-alone game based on Fifth Edition, but modified to be significantly more interesting. Wounds are differentiated from vigor, armor has Damage Reduction (DR) rather than making you harder to hit, and shields are just way, way cooler.\nBased on real-world combat research, inspired by Norse mythology, and with speed and fun of play foremost in mind, this is Gaming Ballistic's flagship product to date.\nThe PDF is hyperlinked and cross-referenced. The background, art, and borders can be turned off as layers for toner-saving ease of printing and accessibility for those with vision contrast challenges.\nThe print version got an offset print run, and the book is nearly an inch thick, on 85# matte-paper, with a smyth-sewn binding. This is a beautiful book, and showcases how much more you can do in Nor\u00f0lond (called Torengar in the book).\n Dragon Heresy Introductory Set (PDF): $20 \nDragon Heresy Introductory Set (Print Only): $50\n Dragon Heresy Introductory Set (Print + PDF): $60 \nTo help manage post-campaign add-ons, as well as the distribution of the final products to backers, Gaming Ballistic uses Backerkit to conduct post-Kickstarter surveys and collect shipping. Fulfillment is done through distribution and shipping partners.\nBackerkit is a company whose purpose is to help creators manage these details, including add-ons and shipping costs. When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will only last between 14 days. It is important to promptly provide an accurate shipping address if you order physical product.\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nAn important point: the project will ship to the entire world.\nShipping in the USA of physical product will use the USPS media mail, and shipping is  added to your pledge total during the Backerkit phase. Fulfillment of US books is executed by Studio 2 Publishing. Please do NOT add shipping to your pledge total in advance of the Backerkit phase!\nInternational shipping will use a short digital print run or POD done in the United Kingdom or in the EU in order to control shipping costs unless we hit an offset print run (in which case all books are printed in Latvia). International fulfillment is currently executed through Royal Mail by Kixto, a UK-based partner. Currently, moving books from Latvia to the UK is very easy; that is subject to unpredictable change due to Brexit.\nEither way, I don't control shipping costs, and there's no way around it: International shipping is very expensive, and time-consuming to boot. If you purchase certain add-ons, such as a physical copy of Dragon Heresy or Dungeon Grappling, Gaming Ballistic will do everything possible to group them into a single shipment to reduce costs, but that might not be possible. Certain countries (such as Brazil) are ridiculously expensive to ship to, and those costs will need to be passed on during the Backerkit phase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe writing is substantially complete, and will complete during the campaign. The art will be all new, and delays due to timing of completion of writing, art, and maps could occur. An offset print run, which is my target, takes a bit longer and on-the-water shipping can be unpredictable.\n\nGaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress.\n\nInternational shipping is unpredictable and expensive, subject to many variables beyond my ability to predict, let alone control. The add-ons in particular may come from different locations depending on where stock is manufactured or stored, and may still add up to a good deal of money. Gaming Ballistic will work with you to do the best we can, but it may still be expensive.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Rafeindasaga (New PDFs only)", "descp": "This pledge tier gets you a PDF copy of each of the three books in the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth (PDF)\nForest's End (PDF)\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["114 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Allar S\u00f6gurnar (All six Nordlond PDFs)", "descp": "Digital copies (PDF) of all the Nordlond books to date: Four adventure/setting books, and two rules supplements.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth (PDF)\nForest's End (PDF)\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk (PDF)\nHall of Judgment (PDF)\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn (PDF)\nFantastic Dungeon Grappling (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Nordlondr Baekr (Print + PDFs)", "descp": "Print and PDF copies of all three new books.

War and Peace will be given the deluxe treatment in this re-issue.   \nFrom  the rainy opening months of 1796 through the climactic summer of 1815,  the entire decades-long conflict between France, England, Austria,  Prussia, Russia, and  Spain, is re-created in 13 separate scenarios.  Each historical scenario is presented as a separate 2-player game with  an average playing time  of 2-3 hours. Also included  is the Grand Campaign Game that covers the 10 year conflict of Empires  from 1805-1815.  \nOn December 2nd, 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of  France. By placing the crown upon his head with his own hands, Bonaparte  brought all of Europe to the brink of war. For by its very nature, the  act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy  of every government then in existence.  \nTo restore the sanctity of the divine right and position based on noble  birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw  and pledged to remain as war against France until the Corsican usurper  was overthrown and the Bourbon was restored. For the next ten years the  fate of the French Empire rested on the on the abilities of the man: as a  warrior and as a peacemaker. \nNow YOU command Napoleon's Grand Armee!\nWhat you will get with this new version of the wonderful old game is all of the Napoleonic Campaigns in one box plus a newly revised Grand Campaign Game, with all new map, components, modern artwork, and greatly  updated rules with new optional rules for chrome and increased emphasis  on the Operational Arts. \nFrom project lead and co-designer John Gant:\n         \" This  project was about 150 hour of  work and love from me and a couple others to get it ready for One Small Step Games to look at it and that  is on top of the incredible initial labor, and the ongoing work published in the General Magazine and much more including all of  the comments and questions from the gaming audience. It would  have been impossible to have gotten to this point without the labor and  love of  countless people. Any errors or issues with this current  version are  mine alone. I wish to extend respect,  thanks, and appreciation to  everyone who has ever touched this fine  game. Thank you! Seeing the amazing work done this year by the team at  OSS Games to create this definitive version of the game, especially the  work of Paul and Antonio, plus Mark and Jon's  support, has been an amazing fulfillment of decades of work that I have  had the honor to bring to fruition.  I truly hope this new  version  provides countless new hours of enjoyment and enriched  historical  engagement for gamers young and old. \" \nThe Map\nThe map depicts the major terrain features and political boundaries that existed in Europe at the start of the Nineteenth Century. A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regulate movement and positioning of playing pieces and delineate the various terrain features affecting play. The map is scaled so that each hexagon (or hex) represents approximately 40 miles in width. The various terrain features the map depicts are illustrated with their effects on combat and movement explained by the Terrain Effects Chart.\nThe Playing Pieces\nThe die-cut playing pieces, hereafter referred to as unit counters, represent the armed forces and leaders that fought in the Napoleonic Wars. Armies and navies are abstractly and symbolically represented as infantry, cavalry, squadrons, or naval transport units. The large number printed on these units indicates their combat value measured in \"strength points\". Each infantry or cavalry strength point represents approximately 5,000 combat soldiers. Each naval strength point represents six vessels.\nThe Books\nWar & Peace will contain four books: The Rule Book, Campaign Book, Scenarios Book, and the Operational Methods Guide.\nThe Rule book is 20 pages of fully illustrated instructions to play the game. It is replete with examples of play, detailed explanations, and optional rules. Want to check it out? Download it right here.\nThe Campaign book is a 28 page illustrated booklet that explains the complete campaign game in detail, including brief history, setup, and special rules. Want to check it out? Here you go (click here).\nThe 24 page Scenarios Book contains 13 scenarios that allow you to play out individual campaigns rather than the entire war. Scenarios include (click here to see the book):\nTHE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN OF 1796\u201397\nTHE ARMY OF THE ORIENT, BONAPARTE IN EGYPT 1798\u201399\nMARENGO: 1800\nTHE SUN OF AUSTERLITZ \u2014 1805\nNAPOLEON\u2019S APOGEE: 1806\u20131807\nWAGRAM \u2014 1809\nTHE CAMPAIGN IN RUSSIA \u2014 1812\nSTRUGGLE OF NATIONS \u2014 1813\nNAPOLEON AT BAY \u2014 1814\nTHE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN \u2014 1815\nTHE PENINSULAR WAR: 1808\u20131814\nSPAIN: 1811\u20131814\nTHE FINAL GLORY: 1812\u20131814\nThe 4-page Operational Methods book is an illustrated examination of how the game can recreate the famous actions of the Napoleonic Wars.\nPlay Aids\nThere are five player-aid cards included in the game. The large folded cards included all the charts and tables needed to play the game -- one for each player. This player-aid card also contains the Terrain Effects Chart and Notes providing all of the information needed to perform Ground Movement as well as important information explaining the Main Map and optional charts for combat.\nThe Force Pool is used for the Grand Campaign Game to manage alliances, production and more.\nThe two Leader Displays are provided to reduce the number of counters physically deployed on the map. For each leader and Fleet in the game, there is a corresponding box on the Leader Display in which all the units stacked with or accompanying a leader or Fleet may be placed. The leader or Fleet counter itself remains on the map board and is moved normally. \nSequence of Play\n Attrition Phase: The active player rolls one die and consults the Attrition Table whose result may require a strength loss in any hex containing three or more of the active player's strength points. This die roll may be modified as specified in the Attrition rules.\n Alliance Phase: The active player rolls one die to determine if any political alliances are formed or dissolved according to the restrictions of the Alliance rules and special rules regulating the scenario being played.\n Reinforcement Phase: The active player may deploy reinforcements or replacements scheduled for the current turn according to the scenario\u2019s Reinforcement and Replacement rules.\n Movement Phase: The active player may move units and leaders upon the map in accordance with the Movement rules and may conduct forced marches and execute overruns in accordance with those rules.\n Combat Phase: The active player announces all combats he cares to initiate and then resolves them in any sequence desired subject to the Combat rules.\nExamples of Play\nAttrition procedure: During an Attrition Phase, the non-French player has rolled a \"three\" on the die and wishes to determine the effect in a hex in Russia occupied by ten Russian strength points which are unsupplied during the December turn. The die roll (3), is modified as follows: (-1) because the Russian units are in their home country, (+1) because the units are unsupplied, (+1) because December is a winter month, (+1) because the hex is on map board area 4. Thus, the die is modified by a total of (+2) increasing the original result to (5). The player cross-references the modified die roll (5), with the total number of strength points in the hex (10) and reads the Attrition Table result which calls for a loss of 2* strength points, one of which must be cavalry if any are present in the hex).\nMarch: At the start of the French player's Movement Phase. Napoleon and nine French infantry strength points are in Paris\u2013 hex Y16(2), one French infantry strength point is in Rheims\u2013hex AA18(2), and one French strength point is in Verdun\u2013hex BB20(2). Let us assume the French player wishes to have ten infantry strength points in Verdun at the end of his Movement Phase. To accomplish this, the French player moves Napoleon,  accompanied by all nine points from Paris to Rheims, expending three Movement Points from Napoleon's movement allowance. Now, in order to move the infantry from Rheims to Verdun, the French player must attempt to force march the force an additional three movement points. Assuming the attempt succeeds, Napoleon may continue to Verdun still accompanied by the nine infantry points which occupied Paris at the start of the Movement Phase (notice that the infantry which occupied Rheims at the start of the Movement Phase may not accompany Napoleon to Verdun although a leader may be accompanied by up to ten infantry strength points during its movement).\nForce March: During the French player's Movement Phase, Napoleon is being moved accompanied by three French Guard strength points, two French infantry strength points, and one Bavarian (French satellite) infantry strength point. After Napoleon expends three movement points, the French player announces he wishes to attempt to force march this group two additional movement points. He then rolls the die and the result is a \u201c5\u201d. This result is modified to a \u201c3\u201d, for the French Guard strength points, a \u201c4\u201d for the French infantry strength points, and remains a \u201c5\u201d for the Bavarian infantry (which received a \u201c0\u201d on the Forced March Table); Napoleon could then expend one additional movement point accompanied by both the Guard and regular French infantry, and after dropping off all of the regular French infantry, Napoleon could expend one additional movement point accompanied by the Guard strength points. Finally, the French player must eliminate one strength point of regular French infantry because a \u201c4\u201d die roll on the Forced March Table includes an asterisk. Remember, it is not mandatory to expend forced march points as depicted in this example.\nSupply: During the French player's segment, one French strength point is in San Sebastian\u2013hex P10(1), one Bavarian strength point is in Burgos\u2013hex M09(1), one French strength point is in Madrid\u2013hex J09(1). The French point in San Sebastian is within three movement points of Bayonne (a major city in France, the unit's home country) and is therefore in supply. The Bavarian strength point in Burgos is within three movement points of the French point in San Sebastian and since both points are the same color, the Bavarian point is also in supply. The French point in Madrid is not within three movement points of a supply source and is therefore unsupplied. While studying this example, notice that if the hex O11(1) was occupied by a strength point of the inactive (non-French) player, the entire French supply line would be negated and all French units in Spain would be unsupplied!\nCombat Resolution: During his Combat Phase, the French player initiates an attack by specifying that he is committing the force in hex CC36(3) to attack an Austrian force in hex BB35(3). \u201cBattle Markers\u201d are placed to designate the two hexes. During the first round of combat, the attack is resolved as follows:\na. The French force in hex CC36(3) consists of Napoleon (leadership value 3), five French infantry strength points (morale value 2), three French cavalry strength points (morale value 2), and five Bavarian (French satellite) infantry strength points (morale value 1). Thus, the French force has a leadership value of \u201c3\u201d, and a morale value of \u201c2\u201d.\nb. The Austrian force in hex BB35(3) consists of Charles (leadership value 2), seven Austrian regular infantry strength points (morale value 1), three Austrian cavalry strength points (morale value 1), and eleven Austrian landwehr strength points (morale value 0). Thus, the Austrian force has a leadership value of \u201c2\u201d and a morale value of \u201c0\u201d.\nc. There are two types of terrain which will modify the dice roll; the larger Austrian force is being attacked in a Mountain hex, therefore the dice roll is increased by two. The Austrian force is also being attacked from a River hex, therefore the dice roll is increased by an additional two bringing the total modification for terrain to plus four.\nd. Although the French player initiated this attack, the Austrian player who controls the larger force will roll the dice to determine the result. The dice roll will be increased by the Austrian leadership value (2), the Austrian morale value (0), and the Mountain and River terrain effects (4), giving a total of plus six. The dice roll will be decreased by the French leadership value (3), and the French morale value (2), giving a total of minus five. Thus, the net result is that the dice roll will be increased by one.\ne. The combat odds ratio is determined by dividing the strength of the larger Austrian force (21), by the strength of the smaller French force (13), which yields a ratio of 3 to 2.\nf. The Austrian player rolls two dice. The result is an \u201c8\u201d, which is increased to \u201c9\u201d. At the ratio of 3 to 2, this yields the following result: L = 1, S = D1. To implement this result, the Austrian player cross-references his \u201c1\u201d result with the total strength of the smaller French force (13) on the Combat Loss Chart which indicates that the Austrian force loses two strength points. Similarly, the French player cross-references his \u201cD1\u201d result with the strength of his own smaller force and finds the Combat Loss Chart dictates the loss of three strength points.\ng. The Austrian player fulfills his required loss by eliminating two landwehr strength points.\nh. The French player fulfills his required loss by eliminating one French infantry strength point, one French cavalry strength point, and one Bavarian infantry strength point.\ni. The French player finally places a \"D1\" Demoralization marker on top of his force. If the battle continues, during the next round of combat the French morale value is reduced from two to one.\nProjected Contents\nOne large MOUNTED map board in two 22\" x 34\" sections\nFour mounted and die-cut, full-color counter sheets\nOne book of Rules, Fully Updated and Illustrated\nOne Scenario Book\nOne Grand Campaign Book\nOne Operational Methods Book\nOne 3-Panel Charts and Tables Folder\nOne Force Pool Display\nTwo Leader Displays\nDice\nGame Box \nStretch Goals\nWe know that almost all Kickstarter campaigns have stretch goals. This one does not. Certainly we could think up expansions or add-ons to this game, but all that would entail lots of extra play-testing, art development, and associated work that would translate into long (potentially very long) delays in the production of the game. We don't want to do that. We put everything we could think of to make this a top of the line experience, and we're including all of it. So no gimmicks, games, or non-sense to get you to support this campaign. We are offering a solid game for a good discount.  That's the deal. \nTime-frame for Delivery \nWe are planning a fast turn-around for War & Peace. At this point all of  the game development and art-work is complete. The time spent from the  successful end of this campaign forward will be on ushering the game through the press process. Although we hope to fulfill sooner,  we are  estimating first quarter of 2020 for delivery.\nA Note About Shipping Costs\nUS shipping is based upon medium flat rate shipping.\nOur  international shipping price is based upon a 7 pound package (what we estimated the game will weigh) to non-EU overseas  destinations. \nEU shipping is based upon calculating the following 4 items:\n       1. Cost to bulk ship EU orders to the EU\n       2. Per unit VAT fee for that shipment\n       3. Per unit shipping fee of European fulfillment house\n       4. Actual European postage based upon a four pound package\nWe  understand that other companies charge lower shipping amounts in  their Kickstarter campaigns. After researching that, we found that they are doing this by amortizing that cost in the price of the game itself. We  thought about doing that as well, but two factors stopped us. The first  is that what is going to happen in a KS campaign is unknown, and each  scenario we looked at had risk over certain number ranges. Because we  are essentially a small operation, we do not care much for risk. However, we also simply felt it was unfair to others to make them subsidize shipping costs that are not their fault. And that  is why the  shipping costs are what they are.\nA Note About One Small Step\nOSS Games is a small company. We are composed of no full-time staff,  but  rather are a group of individuals who enjoy producing games in our  spare  time. Our MO is to produce small print-run games with  consistently high production values. We try to bring you the highest  quality product possible for a reasonable amount of money. We do this  because we enjoy  it.\nThat said, we are a game publisher, not a PR firm. We limit communication to essential announcements. Therefore, we will not be posting constant updates about everything little thing. Our posts will   be limited to essential milestones, such as the game going to press,  the  receipt of press samples, or when the game begins shipping. The  press process is often one of waiting punctuated by occasional back and  forth on minor issues. If you don't hear from us in the updates  section, this  is simply because we do not have any update that changes  status of the  previous one.\nAlso, because each of us has a day job, we are not  able to monitor  the Kickstarter page at all times.

Storm Knights rise to battle High Lord Uthorion and his army of darkness. A supplemental sourcebook for Aysle, an extended adventure book set within Aysle, and multiple extras and surprises help you continue and expand your table-top role-playing game experience in the evolving world of Torg Eternity. \nNew to Torg Eternity? Scroll down to the section LEARN MORE ABOUT TORG to find out more and get started!\nLimited Offer: Aysle Champion\nWant to add your own hero to the ranks of the Army of Light? You get everything in the Aysle Treasure Coffer Pledge Level, plus we\u2019ll work with you to create an official Core Earth or Aysle Archetype! This includes one custom Perk, Spell, or Miracle, plus art for the character, and the character you help create becomes the \u201ciconic\u201d version of that Archetype.\nThese Archetypes become part of the game and are available as a bonus to all backers who receive the normal digital Archetypes. The archetype is the property of Ulisses and we reserve the right to refuse any names or other features of the character that we consider inappropriate (such as inflammatory or vividly \"against theme\").\nUltra Limited Offer: Aysle Royalty\nAdd your Archetype as a Champion above, plus you earn a seat for yourself or a designated proxy at our very special GenCon event on Friday night. Last year's event was an epic battle that determined the fate of the Mystery Men. What will this year's game hold? Note that this offer doesn't include travel, lodging, or tickets to GenCon. This is a different night and a different adventure than the session for Nile Empire Vigilantes!\nBest Value: The Aysle Treasure Coffer   \nFor the best Aysle experience and the most value for your pledge check out the Aysle Treasure Coffer. It is the most convenient way to get all of the core items in this Kickstarter, plus much more! Note that the base price has gone up a little, but that\u2019s because it features an entirely extra book even before Stretch Goals come into play: Greg Gorden\u2019s new Cosms Collide mega-adventure! The Treasure Coffer also starts with a sheet of Threat Blips, 5 new Threat Cards, the Aysle Possibility Tokens, and the CD soundtrack for The Revenge of the Carredon...and tons more goodies waiting to be unlocked! Any Add-On labeled as \"Treasure Coffer\" comes in the box.\nAysle is a realm of magic, fantasy, and an eternal struggle between Darkness and Light! It's ruled by High Lord Uthorion \u2014currently inhabiting the body of a Viking warlord\u2014and his Dread Covenent of nightmares, necromancers, and nefarious lords. Uthorion attacked from above and below, with maelstrom bridges crashing down in the sea to bring his Viking raiders, and a massive ritual connecting the underground passages of Aysle to subways, cellars, and caves on Earth. Any break in the ground may now be a portal to treasure and danger.\n\nWithin Uthorion\u2019s borders magic is powerful and miracles happen, but technology beyond a flintlock rifle sputter and malfunction. High tech doesn\u2019t belong here, and reality tries to right it and transform items into something accepted by the Ayslish. Storm Knights resist this effect, and may bring modern weapons (and more) to bear against the forces of Darkness.\nHigh Lord Uthorion didn't come to Earth alone. For the last century he had possessed Queen Pella Ardinay, the Lady of Light, and used her to corrupt her forces and undermine her allies: the elves and the last of the dwarves. She was recently slain and resurrected\u2014freeing her\u2014and now she leads the remnants of her armies to Earth in pursuit of her hated foe.\nThe Aysle source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters. Inside you'll find:\nNew Perks, Spells, and Miracles for advancing characters. Includes options only available to Beta Clearance Storm Knights, as they learn more about their own abilities and the nature of reality.\n Magic Gear! A bevy of new items for adventurers, and random tables for discovering items in coffers or on foes!\nAn extensive status update for the default timeline. See the course of the first year of the Possibility Wars and the toll it's taken on Great Britain and Scandinavia. Includes a list of ongoing Delphi Council operations and who's who in the Aysle theater of the war.\nGet the statistics for the Dark Lord himself, as Uthorion takes matters into his own hands. Defeating him comes at a price, as Pella Ardinay found out the hard way!\nNew threats. Angered Elementals erupt throughout the realm as raw magic courses across new lands. Knights and wizards roam the roads\u2014many of them selfish and bent towards the ways of Darkness. The Dread Covenant has its own troops: monsters of legend, giants, undead, Vikings, and the foul spawn of Darkness controlled by Uthorion.\nQuest generation tables, new Eternity Shards, and more!\nRevenge of the Carredon is a massive adventure suitable for several months of gaming. Start off in middle of the war, fighting in the trenches of Oxford. Tolwyn Tancred, the legendary hero who slew Uthorion\u2019s strange dragon\u2014the dreaded Carredon\u2014and returned to save Pella Ardinay is cursed, and heralds the return of the mighty beast she seemed to slay. Embark on a quest to unlock the mystery of the Carredon\u2019s origins and break the curse before Tolwyn is lost forever and Uthorion regains one of his most powerful weapons.\nWhen Cosms Collide! Original Torg co-creator Greg Gorden returns with a new mega-adventure! The Cyberpapacy, technodemons, Mobius' shocktroopers, and others all seem to have business in the realm of Aysle\u2014and the Storm Knights are caught in the middle. Join the action and uncover the mystery of what has so many High Lords moving through Uthorion's kingdom, and if anyone can beat the Dark One on his home ground !\nThe Aysle GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in Aysle. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember. \nAysle Archetypes come within the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Champion of Light, a Core Earther transformed by the magic of Aysle into an armored paladin, the Necromancer, a hero touched by Darkness but who deploys her deadly spells against a common foe, and the Cleric of Dunad, an elf from Aysle who channels the holy power of the gods\u2026and many more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like extra copies of an item or would like to add a product from another pledge tier to your order, you may use the list below.

This allows us to assure that we are US, EU, and Australia-friendly. We also have a partner in China (VFI Asia), which means many locations in Asia and the Pacific Rim are cheaper, though not all customs for those countries may be covered. Other locations will be more expensive based on how difficult it is to ship from those four centers.\nPlease Note \u2013 The Treasure Coffer, Sarcophagus, Survival Box, and Cargo Box are very heavy.

This new edition features mechanics that are both flexible and fast as well as nova powers designed to scale through the degrees of power that novas can reach. While the setting is quite similar to the original edition\u2019s, it has been updated to further enable heroic roleplaying.\n Check out the currently unfolding Trinity Continuum: Aberrant webcomic <at this link>\nThe Trinity Continuum is a vast timeline of adventure, speckled with dramatic points across the past, present, and future, where heroes - or villains - arise. While each setting supplement will explore part of the Trinity Continuum timeline, these points in time aren't dots in a straight line - this isn't a long-form metaplot to be simply read aloud. Instead, they're points of quantum probabilities. Anything can happen, so it's up to you and your cast to make it happen!\nThe Trinity Continuum will grow as the timeline is explored, with possible setting supplements handling everything from ancient Greek battalions to two-fisted pulp daredevils, from dystopian brain tech to galactic imperialism. \nTrinity Continuum: Aberrant is the newest setting ready to be explored on the Trinity Continuum timeline. Set in the near future, Trinity Continuum: Aberrant depicts a world just beyond tomorrow, in the year 2028. The Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting allows for a variety of playstyles, from four-color action and space exploration, to political intrigue and deniable top-secret operations.\nNot Final Cover Design\nThe Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting book will be 7-inch by 10-inch hardcover book, approximately 250+ pages, with full-color interiors. Contents include:\nChapter One: History\nChapter Two: Setting\nChapter Three: Character Creation\nChapter Four: Organization and Paths\nChapter Five: New Rules\nChapter Six: Quantum Powers and Abilities\nChapter Seven: Technology\nChapter Eight: Storyguide Advice\nChapter Nine: Antagonists & Supporting Characters\nChapter Ten: Setting Secrets\nNote: the Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting book requires the Trinity Continuum Core rule book to play. \nThe Storypath system is Onyx Path's rules set designed specifically to allow the sort of rules scaling necessary to seamlessly enable players to play ordinary people as well as mad scientists and seasoned explorers.\nThe basics of the Storypath system should be familiar to anyone who has played many other Onyx Path games of action-adventure or heroic exploits, as it is a 10-sided dice pool system, where in order to resolve an action you basically roll a number of dice equal to the character's Skill + Attribute and must roll an 8 or better a certain number of times in order to succeed in the action. \nThat is the very basic resolution system, but we expand on that to further enhance how your gaming group can build their stories. Failing to hit your number of successes, or having more successes than your required amount, are built-in options in the rules. Here is a handy graphic that illustrates what we mean:\nTo further explain the basics of the Storypath system, here is a small PDF download that goes into more detail: SYSTEM PREVIEW PDF. \nThe main goal of this Trinity Continuum: Aberrant Kickstarter is to enable us to create a hardcover edition of the Trinity Continuum: Aberrant book compatible with the Trinity Continuum core rulebook and setting expansions (such as Trinity Continuum: \u00c6on).\nWe want to create an 7\" x 10\" hardcover with an evocative, action-packed cover image and a Trinity Continuum trade dress. We estimate the book to be between 250-300 pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including scenario and chronicle options, hero and villain write-ups, and more! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done - build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our team. \nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($40,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this reward tier chart\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Elite and Defender Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Hero Reward Tier)? And then do you add the Trinity Continuum Core Rules as a Partner to your pledge (Defender and Partner or Hero and Partner reward tiers)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Dynamic Duo and Super Squad Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!). You can further enhance these options with a Team-up, adding the Trinity Continuum Core rules to your selection.\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Trinity Continuum: Aberrant campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Friendly Neighborhood Retail Tier) will get 5 copies of the Trinity Continuum Core rulebook and Trinity Continuum: Aberrant hardcover books (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Aberrant setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.   \nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Trinity Continuum: Aberrant. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates. \nPDF VERSION - The digital version of the Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful 7\" x 10\" hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nTRINITY CONTINUUM CORE RULES: Contains the complete rules for playing Talents, ranging from core concepts to descriptions of secret societies around the world, as well as introductory material for playing in any of the other Trinity Continuum games. This book can be used on its own, but is necessary for playing \u00c6on, Aberrant, and Adventure!, as well as other settings within the continuum. The material presented here is enough to play a game set in a world very similar to our modern one. Included in the Defender and Partner, Hero and Partner, Dynamic Duo Team-up, and Super Squad Team-up reward tiers. Also available as an Add On Reward (See Add Ons, below).\nTrinity Continuum: \u00c6on: A setting supplement for Trinity Continuum, this book provides complete information on the world of 2123 and all of the wonders it contains. It also includes rules for creating and playing psions, as well as a variety of advanced weapons and other devices. Requires the Trinity Continuum Core rules to play. Available as an Add On Reward (see Add Ons, below).\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Trinity Continuum: Aberrant, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.     \nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run. \n The Aberrant 1E Systems & Setting PDF Bundle contains the following titles:\n     - Aberrant Core Rulebook 1E PDF  \n                   - Aberrant Storyteller's Screen and Companion 1E PDF\n                   - Aberrant Worldwide: Phase II 1E PDF\n                   - Aberrant Player's Guide 1E PDF\n                    - Aberrant: Year One 1E PDF\nNow also includes Aberrant Worldwide: Phase I via Stretch Goal achievement!\nThe Aberrant 1E Factions & Organizations PDF Bundle contains the following titles:\n    - Teregen 1E PDF  \n                  - The Directive 1E PDF\n                  - Elites 1E PDF\n                   - Underworld 1E PDF\n Now also includes Project Utopia via Stretch Goal achievement!\n The Aberrant 1E Mini Sourcebook PDF Bundle contains the following titles:\n    - Expos\u00e9: Aberrants 1E PDF  \n                  - XWF 1E PDF\n                  - Fear and Loathing 1E PDF\n                  - Church of Michael Archangel 1E PDF\nNow also includes reignofevil.comvia Stretch Goal achievement!\nDigital and  PDF Rewards will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Trinity Continuum: Aberrant is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "BASELINE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "ELITE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT.\nINCLUDES:\nTrinity Continuum: ABERRANT PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["362 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "ELITE and SIDEKICK", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT.\nINCLUDES:\nTrinity Continuum: ABERRANT PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: ABERRANT\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["108 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "DEFENDER and PARTNER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT, as well as a PDF copy of the Trinity Continuum CORE RULES.\nINCLUDES:\nTrinity Continuum: ABERRANT PDF\nTrinity Continuum CORE Rulebook PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: ABERRANT\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: CORE Rulebook\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["206 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "HERO", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT.

Backers will receive the PDF or print versions as they choose, or a bundle with both. Additional books in the product line are being offered at a discount as add-ons.\nHenry Hydesworth came into rather a tidy sum when his father met with an accident at the cannery. Bad news being, the old boy hasn\u2019t moved on, and neither has Henry\u2019s mother, so he\u2019s haunted by his parents quite literally. Small wonder he spends most of his time out of the house trying to be a detective. It\u2019s all much more interesting than running a fish cannery with your dead father looking over your shoulder. He\u2019s not very good at it, though.\nHenry\u2019s mother invites a neighbour round for tea, who has a problem. The Fever turned her into a troll, eight feet tall, horns, the whole bit, and with the cats in the area vanishing mysteriously, rumours are circulating that her new form has come with a new appetite. She really needs Henry to prove where the cats are going before the whispers become a scandal and her reputation is damaged. Of course the case has much more going on than a few missing cats, and as Henry tugs on the thread, all sorts of things begin to unravel. Pity Henry\u2019s such a poor knitter\u2026 he\u2019s going to need all the help he can get, from Smedley, his long time friend and also recent troll, from the crew of the USS Spindrift, and from a wide and varied cast of oddball supporting characters. \nWith original art and text by Don Higgins, the story spins out over 128 pages of steampunk hijinks, social gaffes, awkward moments, and the occasional explosion. Will Henry find out how the cats figure into all of this? Will his new disguise fool Smedley? Will Smedley ever tell Henry what he\u2019s really up to? And how does Miss Emily Devereux, the librarian Henry has long admired from afar, figure into all of this? Backers get immediate access to the pre-release PDF galley, as proof the book actually exists, but beware reading too far into it if you don\u2019t want the story spoiled before the official release!\nIn addition to the listed reward levels, we are happy to offer several add-ons to our generous backers. As mentioned before, the tabletop role-playing game is in print, and has four books currently \u2013 Players Guide, Game Master\u2019s Guide, London Sourcebook, and the Big Trouble adventure. As an add-on in the post-campaign survey, backers are welcome to request that any or all of these products be added to their shipment.

The roleplaying game itself has a Players Companion in layout, and a Game Master\u2019s Companion in final edits as of the time this Kickstarter launched. There\u2019s also further adventures in the Akkadian Connection trilogy forthcoming, some standalone adventures, regional sourcebooks for Berlin, Paris, and New York, and an ongoing series of PDF-only Personalities already going, ten-page writeups on significant NPCs with backstory, full character sheets, Adventure Hooks, Connections, and game-ready devices, spells, and creatures with complete stat blocks.

It is a game of ancient ruins on Mars, the steaming jungles of Venus, strange life in the clouds of Jupiter, RAY guns, chromed rocket ships, radium fuel, hot exhaust, and fins. So many fins on things you didn't know you could put fins on. \nThe setting is a kitchen sink sandbox for you to set your games in. Want to be the brave explorer discovering lost civilizations and new wonders? We have that on Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the Jovian Moons, and more. Looking for a daring game of brinksmanship as you battle agents of foreign powers (even alien nations)? Choose whom you want to fight and who you want to fight for, such as the Americans, British, French, Nazis, Soviets, Martian princes, or the enigmatic Europans.\n The Rocket Age first launched in 2013 using the Vortex system (we call that version Rocket Age Classic) and won an ENnie in 2014. Since then we have added four sourcebooks, an adventure path, a fiction anthology, and 13 adventures. In that time Rocket Age has gone from its original publisher to being owned and published by its creator, Ken Spencer and his company Why Not Games.\nWe love Rocket Age and we want to bring it to everyone.  5e allows us to invite more people into the Rocket Age. From the beginning we did not want to do a simple conversion, we knew that to make system and setting work best we would have to adapt both. Where possible we have kept the core of the 5e engine, you can use Rocket Age (5e) with your full collection of 5e products. We have species (instead of races), classes, armor class, hit points and dice, proficiencies, and so forth. Rocket Age (5e) has a plethora of alien creatures to interact with, but we want you to be able to pull any monster out of whatever 5e compatible monster guide you might want. Where something had to be changed in the setting, most notably the availability of psychic powers, we made small changes as needed. The result is a merging of system and setting, not just a welding of one to another.\n Now, eighteen months later nearly two years worth of work has come to fruition in the Rocket Age (5e) Corebook. The game is written, playtested, filled with art, and through the magic of our graphic designer, being turned in to a completed book. We would like you to join us on this final leg of the journey and bring the Rocket Age into a brand new era.\n For our long time fans, Rocket Age Classic is not going anywhere. From here on out all Rocket Age products will be offered in different versions, one for each system. These will not be dual stat blocks, but different books, one for Rocket Age Classic and one for Rocket Age (5e). We don\u2019t like dual stat block books; they just add pages and make it harder to find what you are looking for.\nTo our new fans, this is just the beginning. In the coming months we will adapt the entire catalog of Rocket Age, from Blood Red Mars to Imperial Jupiter.\nFor both old and new fans, there is more of the Rocket Age to explore and we have plans for new adventures, new sourcebooks, new fiction, and more.\nYou can follow us at: www.whynotgames.com, our FaceBook page, and the unofficial Rocket Age fan group on Facebook.\nInside Rocket Age (5e) you will find:\nForeword by Ed Greenwood\n 17 playable species from the bizarrely alien Europans to the ape-like Venusians, including all seven Martian castes. Two species, Ioites and Robomen, are highly varied in psychical form, allowing you to customize your character from an extensive list of species traits.\n 5 New classes suitable for play in Rocket age or any sci-fi or pulp style game. Each has a set of subclasses to allow you to flesh out or customize your character. Will you be an Agent working for a larger organization, an Explorer pushing the boundaries of the known Solar System, a Scientist uncovering the wonders of the material world, a shifty Scoundrel getting by any way they can, or a stalwart Soldier standing between danger and their loved ones?\n A system of psychic powers not tied to species or class, nor using a Vanican system. In Rocket Age (5e) anyone can be a psychic, but what will you give up for the weird powers of the mind?\n 19 new feats for those of you using that optional system. Will you be an Ace or travel with a Boon Companion? Do you Dance it Out or have Resourceful Pockets?\n All the equipment you will need for adventures in the Rocket Age! We've got RAY guns, disintegrators, Martian silthanka, Ganymedian heart bows, Europan pain batons, and much more. Armor, weapons, tools, clothing, technological gear, refurbished Ancient Martian tech, it is all in there!\n Complete and comprehensive vehicle rules for everything from a motorcycle blasting across the sands of Mars to mighty rocket ships blazing beams through the void of space. These rules interact directly with class archetypes and feats, making the entire system integrated from character creation to game play.\n The entire Solar System of Rocket Age covered in detail. Each entry offers not just the history, geography, and culture of a place, a sample NPC to interact with as well as three story hooks tied to that place and the beings from there. With a little imagination and some friends you can play Rocket Age straight out of the book.\n Ancient Artifacts from the lost civilizations of Mars and Venus. These items use esoteric sciences beyond that which even the brightest minds of 1938 can devise, so using them is a bit more than dusting them off and hitting the 'ON' switch. A big part of Rocket Age is the thrill of discovery, and our Artifact Analysis system makes all that possible with a single die roll, but be careful, there might be unintended consequences to powering up that weird bit of ancient tech. Disclaimer: Why Not Games is not responsible for anything that happens when you let lizard monkeys play with ancient artifacts.\n A bestiary of all the strange, exotic, and down right alien creatures found in the Solar System. Ride bahmoots across Mars, run from the thunder lizards of Venus, dodge kilometer long tentacles of the mighty Jovian gasbags, or get a tesselon as a pet. In addition to these nasty critters, there are plenty of NPCs to befriend of battle, including everyone's favorite punch receiver, Nazis!\nWritten by Ken Spencer, the creator of Rocket Age, with a cover by ReOnna Smith, and interior art by Paul Bourne, Brain Eads, Jon Hodgson, David King, Scott Purdy, Peter Saga, and Miguel Santos.\nRocket Age (5e) is fully compatible with Pulp Fantastic from Battlefield press. In fact, Ken Spencer wrote the system mechanics for both. You should check them out while you are here on Kickstarter. They're good people and make great games.\nAll of our stretch goals are in pdf. We are a small operation and producing stretch goals is a challenge, one that we barely made with our last kickstarter.
