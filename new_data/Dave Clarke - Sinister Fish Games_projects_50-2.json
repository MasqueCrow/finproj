[{"backer": "Dave Clarke - Sinister Fish Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Now the campaign is over you can still pre-order via the ACG website!\nScreen printed meeples are unlocked for all Kickstarter backers!\nBuild and manage your own theme park in Dice Theme Park, where the dice are your visitors and you are working to ensure your visitors have the most fun!\nBut you\u2019re not the only park in town, as other Dice Theme Parks are appearing nearby so you\u2019ll be competing for visitors, attractions, and even mascots, all whilst solving your own unique puzzle of how to maximize the enjoyment of each the dice shaped customers that visit your theme park.\nWill you build the most attractive attractions around or will your efforts have your visitors going elsewhere?\nJoin the ride and find out if you have what it takes to run the best Dice Theme Park!\nDesigned by Daryl Andrews (Sagrada, Bosk, Speakeasy Blues) and Adrian Adamescu (Sagrada, Speakeasy Blues), and developed by Dice Hospital co-designer Mike Nudd (Dice Hospital, Waggle Dance), Dice Theme Park is a dice manipulation and worker placement game for 1-4 players, aged 14+, which plays in about 60-90 minutes\nIn Dice Theme Park, you\u2019ll deploy your staff, welcome visitors (represented by dice), draft Attraction tiles, hire mascots, and upgrade your Attractions to give your visitors the best time ever!\nDice Theme Park is the latest in the line of \u2018Dice X\u2019 games from Alley Cat Games, the publisher who brought you the award winning Dice Hospital. \nAs the successor to one of the most popular Dice Manipulation & Worker Placement games of the past 5 years, Dice Theme Park has a lot to live up to so we\u2019ve made this simple image to show you how they compare.\nDice Theme Park is a completely stand-alone game which builds on the feeling of Dice Hospital. \nIf you enjoyed Dice Hospital you\u2019ll be familiar with the satisfying combos in Dice Theme Park but there\u2019s so much more to explore in the brand new gameplay experience of Dice Theme Park\n\nA French edition will be available to buy through this Kickstarter with Supermeeple!\nA French edition with translated rules, and game component text will be made available through this campaign in association with our friends and partner: Supermeeple. \nSimply back the campaign today and then select a French edition when you checkout from the pledge manager, when it launches later in the year. \nPledge levels available in French:\nBase Game Edition\nDeluxe Edition\nThe \"New Dice X games\" bundle\nThe All in pledge is NOT available in French. Dice Hospital, the Dice Hospital Deluxe add ons box, and Dice Hospital: Community Care are all available now from Super Meeple directly or your (French) FLGS.\nPlease note that delivery of the French edition will be 1-6 months later than the English edition due to various logistical challenges, although we will try to keep you appraised of its production and fulfilment timelines as best as possible.\n\nLes pleges propos\u00e9s pour la version fran\u00e7aise sont les suivants :\nJeu de base \nEdition deluxe\nLe bundle \u00ab Les nouveaux jeux Dice X \u00bb\nAttention : le pledge All-In N\u2019EST PAS propos\u00e9 ; le jeu Dice Hospital, ses extensions Deluxe et Soins Communautaires sont disponibles directement aupr\u00e8s de Super Meeple et de ses partenaires pour les territoires francophones.\n\nMerci de noter que la version fran\u00e7aise sera potentiellement livr\u00e9e de 1 \u00e0 6 mois plus tard pour des raisons logistiques, mais nous ferons en sorte de vous tenir inform\u00e9s et de de tenir les d\u00e9lais le mieux que possible.\nDice Cascading is a new mechanism created for Dice Theme Park by Daryl Andrews and Adrian Adamescu. \nIn Dice Theme Park, when you activate your attractions you\u2019ll pip down the dice that were activated, and then move them to an adjacent tile. You can then activate that tile and move the dice again, creating a cascade that can go on as long as you have tiles to activate. \nIt\u2019s combo-tastic!\nEach player starts with the same hand of staff cards, which give you an income, set your turn order, and grant you a special bonus; as you play you\u2019ll pass the staff cards you played to your left at the end of the round and receive the cards from the opponent on your right. \nThis leaves you with a different hand of cards every round. \nTiming is crucial in choosing which staff card to play this round and which to save for later rounds.\nYou\u2019ll be able to customise your park with various upgrades, attractions, and mascot skills. Each game you\u2019ll create a new park with new combos to explore. \nSynergies between attraction tiles, mascot skills, upgrades, and administrators will mean that every time you play Dice Theme Park it\u2019s a new and exciting experience.\n\nPlaceholder artwork and graphic design used for the expansions. For an explanation of how the expansions change the game see the 'How to play' section below\n\nFor the second cross over promo pack, simply back at a tier also containing Dice Hospital ER: Emergency Roll. See below in the DHER section for more details! \n\nThe deluxe add ons box comes with monorail miniatures which are an upgrade on the monorail cards in the base game.  These are really chunky miniature upgrades!\n\nThe deluxe add ons  pack also includes 2 mini expansions. We're still working on the graphic design for these so the images above don't represent the final expansion and only represent the types of components included. We hope to update this before the end of the campaign!\nThe experimental rides mini expansion adds a re-roll mechanic to the game, which is included on the additional attraction tiles, new meeple skills, and an extra administrator.  Using rerolls can be risky, but with great risk comes great rewards!\nThe Innovations expansion comes with 48 new upgrade tokens and replacement staff cards to help use them. The upgrades help with movement, which helps create cool combos, and score additional points. \nInstead of the base game ability on the staff cards, you can use these new staff cards to build an additional upgrade meaning your park will be full of upgrades!\n\n\n* The Kickstarter pack will be available for purchase at an additional cost directly from the Alley Cat Games website and from conventions\nYou have the opportunity to make this Kickstarter pack even better throughout the campaign.

The staff cards you deploy will set your turn order for the round, give you income, and give you special abilities.\nTurn order is determined by the combined value of the two staff you have deployed. If you have the lowest value, you\u2019ll be first to attract visitors and build new attractions. If you have the highest, you\u2019ll be last!\nEach staff member also has an income they bring to your park. You\u2019ll gain income from both staff members and also from some attractions that bring income in your park.\nSpecial abilities on staff members range from increasing pip values on visitors, moving visitors around your park, and even activating attraction tiles an additional time.\nYou\u2019ll have to think carefully about which staff you deploy. Not just because of the benefits they provide, but also because at the end of the round the staff you deployed will be passed to the player on your left and you\u2019ll get the two that were deployed by the player on your right.\nVisitors in Dice Theme Park are represented by dice, and their pip value represents their excitement and energy.  You\u2019ll attract visitors to your park by drafting a monorail car in turn order. The monorails have set pip values but the colours of the dice placed on them are determined by the order they are drawn from the dice bag.\nThe most excited visitors will stay in your park for longer and earn you more points but the values aren\u2019t the only important factor. You\u2019ll also want the visitors who want to visit certain rides in your park. Some will prefer water rides (blue dice), some will prefer horror rides (green dice), and some visitors will be thrill seekers! (yellow dice)\nEach round, in turn order, you\u2019ll have the option of expanding your park with new attractions and rides. The more attractions you have the more you can keep your visitors happy, earning you points, but attractions cost money to build so you\u2019ll need to think about how much money you need when deploying your staff and building your park.\nAttraction tiles also come with amenities such as toilets, If you collect matching amenities, you\u2019ll get a bonus action. This could be changing a die value, gaining an extra die, or even gaining an extra attraction tile for free!\nEach round, in turn order, you\u2019ll draft cards to hire and train the mascots in your park, giving them abilities and jobs like juggler, photographer, and tour guide, creating a unique team of mascots every game.\nHiring a mascot will cost money but you\u2019ll gain special benefits depending on what ability or job they have ranging from increasing or decreasing dice values, moving guests, scoring points, or earning money.\nThis phase happens simultaneously each round.\nBoost attractions with special abilities by using upgrades. The better the tile, the more expensive the upgrade will be\nYou can upgrade attractions with:\n-Special FX give extra points when activating a tile\n-Merch stands earn money from activating a tile\n-Power generators to allow an attraction to be activated an extra time.\nThe deluxe add ons box includes additional upgrades which are explained in the mini expansions section below\nThis phase happens simultaneously each round.\nEach attraction tile can be activated by a specific combination of dice, and brings in points for each activation.\nTo activate an attraction, place an activation token on it and designate some dice that match the requirements of the attraction. Then, score points shown on the tile and any additional points given by bonuses like special FX upgrades.\nAfter an attraction is activated, the dice used in the activation are pipped down one step and you\u2019ll choose one of them to move to an adjacent tile. You can then use that dice again if it matches the requirement of the next tile. This \u2018dice cascading\u2019 creates a unique puzzle in each park and makes it possible to do some very fun combinations!\nThe real puzzle in Dice Theme park is that each attraction tile can usually only be activated once. You can only activate a tile more than once with the special ability of a card or if the tile has a power generator upgrade.\nThis restriction means you have to think 2 or 3 activations ahead to get the best out of your park.\nIn the last few rounds of Dice Theme Park (last 2 rounds of the 4 round \u2018short game\u2019 or last 3 rounds of the 5 round \u2018full game\u2019) you\u2019ll compete with other players to win awards, which give extra points for being the best or having the most of various criteria such as most money, most amenities, fewest dice in your park etc.\nYou\u2019ll have all game to plan ahead for these as they\u2019re revealed during setup\nAfter all activations are completed and awards are scored, you\u2019ll reset your park by removing activation tokens and pass your deployed staff cards clockwise, then you\u2019ll begin a new round until you\u2019ve completed 4 rounds in a \u2018short game\u2019 or 5 rounds in a \u2018full game\u2019\n\nThe solo mode for Dice Theme Park has been designed by David Digby, solo mode designer of games such as Tinners\u2019 Trail, Eternal Palace, and many more games from Alley Cat Games and elsewhere!\nThe solo mode David has designed for Dice Theme Park follows his challenge style designs, similar to Chocolate Factory, which gained critical acclaim after its release.\nIn Dice Theme Park solo play, you will aim to complete a range of goals whilst also hitting a target score. The more goals you complete the lower the target, the more you fail or choose to ignore the higher number of points you need to win!\nEach combination of goals provides a different challenge to complete allowing you to experience the core fun of Dice Theme Park in a highly replayable solo game. Keep an eye out for special announcements on further solo content during the campaign!\n\nThe experimental expansion adds the risk and reward of experimentation, with the ability to reroll dice through new attraction tiles, new meeple skills and a new administrator. \nThis expansion can be shuffled into the base game and can be used with the solo mode\nThe innovations expansion adds 3 new types of upgrades to to Dice Theme Park; Statues, which give big points but must be built on specific tiles; Hubs, which give the ability to move all dice from the adjacent attractions when activated; and Cable Cars, which allow you to create a network of tiles that act as adjacent to each other for movement purposes.\n\nFor Dice Hospital ER: Emergency Roll previews, please go to the relevant section further down!\nJoin our Discord server and arrange a demo of Dice Theme Park with one of our Demo Team\nCheck out the rules yourself!

Tumour. A city built on the ruins of itself. Beneath the sewers the bones of the old city fester.\nThe troll-king Niduk was exiled, driven into the depths to rot and die. Now twisted by hatred and rage he oversees the small domain he has carved for himself, in a forgotten chapel to a murdered god.\nWhy are you here? A lost bet? A doomed quest for silver? Boredom?\nDoes it even matter?\nALT: A digital mockup of an A5 paperback zine. The art shows the face of a troll, furry and black with a mouth filled with teeth that interact with the text between them in an unsettling way. Gold chains adorn the troll's horns and it wears a gold crown. The title reads \"Treasures of the Troll King\".\nThe crown will be gold foil. We don't need to say much more about that, do we?\nM\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday rpg  about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world.  It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules  light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult  \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by  Free League Publishing.\nM\u00d6RK BORG is copyright Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Stockholm Kartell.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an independent production by Loot The Room and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell. It is published under the M\u00d6RK BORG Third Party License.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an adventure designed for one- or two-shot play. You'll need the M\u00d6RK BORG core game to play it, unless you want to convert it to another system. I literally can't stop you doing that and have very little interest in trying.\nThe adventure will be published as an A5 saddle-stitched softcover zine. Internal pages are 135gsm silk and the cover is 250gsm silk with matt lamination and gold foil stamping on Niduk's crown. This is the same specification as The Wretched and will look and feel really nice. \nAs well as the cover art, Johan Nohr has also produced internal artwork for Niduk, the Troll King - the main threat in the adventure. If you pledge, you'll probably get to see that in an update at some point.\n\nALT: A digital mock-up of an A5 zine open to a two page spread. The pages are black and spattered with red and yellow ink spots. The first paragraph starts with a large calligraphic letter G, in red.\n\nThe adventure takes place in two phases - a point crawl through the sewers beneath Galgenbeck in search of the sunken chapel that houses Niduk, the Troll King, and a location-based dungeon in the chapel itself.\nDuring the adventure characters might encounter:\nA pile of forgotten wishes at the base of a wishing well\n The Church of Forgotten Things, a sewer shrine to the discarded treasures of everyday life kept by a strange old man who has forgotten daylight\nThe finger collector, a strange denizen of the sewers who trades in digits\nA forgotten god sealed inside the bells of the chapel, begging for release\nYou'll find a host of weird locations, harrowing creatures, and new Occult Treasures to drop into your game.\nThe dungeon portion of the book mimics the layout of Rotblack Sludge, the introductory adventure found in M\u00d6RK BORG, so it's familiar and easy to use at the table.\nThere are no stretch goals or add-ons and just five standard reward tiers to keep things simple. What you see is what you get!\nFinger Collector is for people who just want the PDF. You'll get an Itch download key and my thanks. \u00a38.\nTroll Hunter gets you the print zine with foil-stamped cover and a PDF copy of the adventure. The Kickstarter edition will be the only one with the foil stamping - future print runs won't have it. \u00a315 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nSupplicant To The King gets you the adventure in print and The God Of Many Faces, a trifold pamphlet adventure. I'll have more details about this in an update during the campaign.  You'll also get PDFs of them both. \u00a320 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nTreasure Hoarder gets you print and PDF copies of Treasures Of The Troll King and The God Of Many Faces, plus a double-sided poster with the cover art on one side and the dungeon map on the other. The poster will be printed at A3 and folded down to A5 when it ships. \u00a333 plus shipping (to be collected later). UPDATE: There will now be the option of two posters. You get one as standard in this tier and will be able to choose which design you want, and will be able to add the second poster through the Loot The Room store after the campaign ends if you want both.\nKeeper Of Occult Secrets is the expensive tier for people who want to help out and have money to burn. Identical to the Treasure Hoarder tier, but I'll write additional content by hand in 66 copies of the zine. This could be new occult treasures, additional encounters, more adventure hooks, or something else entirely.

As a new recruit your abilities and resources are limited so you'll need your wits about you to try and survive. Push your luck to press deeper into the unknown or play it safe and live to fight another day. The choice is yours!\nThe game includes a deck of rooms that you must explore. Some will contain harmless frog swarms, whereas others will hide dangerous frog monsters or even more notorious foes from Hellboy's past! The differently coloured dice represent your limited resources and you must choose carefully when selecting which ones to roll. If you run out of dice or wounds, it's the end of your turn.\n The thrilling Dice Game isn\u2019t the only way to back this Kickstarter because we\u2019re also funding FOUR brand-new expansions for Hellboy: The Board Game. Designed by original developers, Needy Cat Games, each of these expansions builds on the tension-packed, co-operative experience of Hellboy: The Board Game but turns the danger up to 11, thanks to the all-new optional Ragnarok mode.\n\nThat\u2019s right, saving the world just got a whole lot tougher as enemies become stronger and more difficult to defeat. Ragnarok mode can be used to offer an additional challenge to not only these new expansions, but the core game as well. It's perfect if you've breezed through the previous Case Files and want an even tougher experience!\nPlease note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\nYou\u2019ve played through the core game, Darkness Calls and The Wild Hunt. Now it\u2019s time to bring the saga to a close with The Storm and The Fury. Armed with a certain magical sword (no spoilers here, just in case), Hellboy must face his toughest foe yet: Nimue in her dragon form. This is the biggest miniature we\u2019ve made for Hellboy: The Board Game and it\u2019s not going to be easy to take her down.\n3D renders of miniatures.\nThe Storm and the Fury includes new miniatures, an epic Case File, new Deck of Doom cards, new Encounter Cards and a new playable version of Hellboy.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\n\n\nHELLBOY AND THE B.P.R.D.\nBut that\u2019s not all for Hellboy: The Board Game fans because with the storyline complete, it\u2019s time to move onto a whole new chapter inspired by the B.P.R.D. graphic novels. These three new expansions focus on a different element to make your games of Hellboy more unpredictable and action-packed than ever before.\nWith Hellboy gone, the B.P.R.D. faces a range of horrifying new minions as the world descends into chaos. The Hell on Earth expansion introduces new minions to add to your missions. From swarming Crickets, to demons and Ogdru-Hem mutants, you\u2019re going to wish you were only facing the Frog Monsters from the core game. This expansion includes 15 minion miniatures, the Nesting Site Case File and Encounter cards, plus all the minions can be mixed into existing missions using the previously released B.P.R.D. Archives expansion.\nIf only it were just the minions you needed to deal with... but they're the least of your concerns. In Pandemonium some all-new bosses are here to try and end the world. This expansion includes The Flood Case File, Enemy cards, Unexpected Threat Hammerhead card, Encounter cards and Boss Behaviour Cards.\nWith all that, you\u2019re going to need some new heroes and the B.P.R.D. is here to save the day. End of Days includes new playable agents \u2013 Ted Howards, Sledgehammer, Evolved Abe Sapien and Flaming Liz Sherman \u2013 plus the Eviction Notices Case File, character-specific Deck of Doom cards and Requisition Cards. Use these new agents to tackle the new expansions or return to your favourite missions from the original game and play them again with a fresh cast of heroes.\nTest miniatures painted by Studio Giraldez. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nCombined with the original Kickstarter or the core game, these new missions make Hellboy: The Board Game infinitely replayable. Please note, you will need Hellboy: The Board Game in order to play these expansions.\n\n\n Tabletop Gaming magazine plays a prototype version of Hellboy: The Dice Game.\nJames from Needy Cat Games and B.P.R.D. consultant Edwin, talk about what you can expect from the new expansions!

As the leader of a noble house seeking the favour of the Emperor you plan to aid in its reconstruction. Collect the materials you need to contribute to rebuilding the Palace monuments, and commemorate the restoration by creating a beautiful painting of his beloved gardens.\nWill your efforts catch the eye of the Emperor, or will your rival nobles be honoured instead? Only one house will win the Emperor\u2019s ultimate recognition.\nEternal Palace is a highly interactive dice-placement Euro game for 1-5 players. Players assign workers, represented by dice, to locations based on their combined value. You'll visit locations to gain resources, rebuild monuments, and gather painting pieces for your masterpiece. \nDice placement\nThe way dice are played in Eternal Palace is unlike any other game. You'll roll dice and secretly group them behind a screen. Your opponents will know what dice you have but not how you'll use them. Will you use the 3/4/5 to visit locations 3, 4, and 5 or will you group them to visit location 12? Or maybe something in between? Predicting your opponents moves and making a surprise move yourself really elevates Eternal Palace to a game that is truly great! Once the dice are locked in, you can either stick to your decision or use some wisdom to manipulate your dice and go somewhere completely different!\nInteractive and positive gameplay\nUnlike other worker/dice placement games that focus on blocking opponents, the interaction in Eternal Palace is focused around mini races at each location. Get to the top of a location's track first and you'll get a bonus point. The race at each location means you'll always be interested in what your opponents are doing. Should you try to catch up or will you focus your efforts elsewhere?\nGreat table presence\nGaining points has never been so beautiful. Each painting layer you gather in Eternal Palace is layered onto your canvas to create a unique painting, which scores you points at the end of the game. If you win one of the race tracks, you'll gain a unique feature piece and a bonus point.\nHand- cut prototype of the painting pieces in action - the cut will be much more accurate in the production version!\nGather painting pieces throughout the game to paint your masterpiece\n\n*All photographs on this Kickstarter page are photos of the prototype, not a pre-production copy of the games, so dimensions, components and colours are subject to minor changes.\n\n- Rahdo\nThe rulebook will be translated into these languages and will be available as a free download from Board Game Geek by the time the game is fulfilled\n\n\nWe're currently working on a storage solution option for the painting pieces and we're hoping to update everyone on the progress of this by the end of the campaign. \nThe Deluxe Edition is limited edition which is unlikely to ever come into retail stores or mass distribution. If it does, it will be at least 3 months after the base game.\nThe miniatures from the deluxe edition come in grey, but they look great when painted!\nKickstarter pack - Fully unlocked\n\n\n\nFor this Kickstarter campaign we have chosen to focus our stretch goals on making the Kickstarter pack even better to reward our Kickstarter backers even more! They will be revealed below once the campaign is funded.\n\nAll stretch goals now unlocked\n\n\nWant to make Eternal Palace even better? In addition to stretch goals that are focusing on the Kickstarter pack, these social goals will improve the game quality for all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFollow the instructions below to unlock some great component quality upgrades \n\nThe image now has over 75 Thumbs so the box will now be upgraded with a spot UV! Click this image to go to the image on Board Game Geek and boost it even more if you haven't already!\nThis Instagram post now has over 300 likes so we've upgraded the rulebook with a linen finish. Click this image to go to the Instagram post.\nThis Facebook post has now been shared over 100 times so all cardboard tokens have been upgraded to 2mm thickness.\nWe now have over 150 retweets, so we've unlocked linen finish on all cards!\nWe now have 300 more Kickstarter followers so all card stock has been upgraded to 330 gsm\nThe deluxe edition will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers and direct orders for at least a 3 month period. It may never enter distribution!\n- Slickerdrips\nGather resources,  recruit advisors, rebuild monuments, and create your masterpiece to gain the favour of the Emperor.\nRoll your dice to see what values you have to play with this round. The player with the lowest total goes first. You'll be able to see each others dice rolls but you'll secretly group them behind a screen, so you won't always be able to predict what other players will do this round\nGroup your dice to visit higher value locations  or keep them separate to visit multiple locations. You'll even be able to manipulate your dice and change your strategy based on the other players' actions.\nVisit locations to gather resources. Visit with more workers to gain bonus resources. Resource gathering spots (and some other spots in the game) are also a race to the top: be the first up the track to gain a unique feature piece for your painting and an extra point for the end of the game\nPlacing a die here, the blue player gains 1 wood. The yellow player placed 2 dice here so gains 3 wood\nAdvisors give ongoing benefits or powerful one-time bonuses. You'll be able to recruit them at spots 1 & 2 in slightly different ways. At spot 1, draw 3 face down cards and choose from them, at spot 2, choose from the face up cards before your opponents hire them.\nPlacing a die here, the blue player recruits an Advisor\nContributing to rebuilding will gain you favour with the Emperor, and an art piece towards your masterpiece. You'll also claim the monument to take credit for your contribution but timing is important and these monuments will change hands throughout the game so only one person can ultimately take the credit. \nPlacing a die here, the blue player pays 1 wood and gains 1 favour. They also gain the painting piece and monument\nCreating your masterpiece is key to being honoured by the Emperor. The locations you visit will gain you a painting piece, which scores points and brings the game closer to an end. You might even get a unique feature piece to add to your painting if you're the first to 'complete' a location. \nFinishing your painting first and getting the longest 'run' of painting pieces will gain bonus points at the end of the game.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 - a run of 7 painting pieces!\n- Rahdo\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace\nIn the Solo Mode, you'll play against the Master, an AI opponent. The Solo mode plays similarly to a 2 player game but after you've grouped your dice the Master's dice groups are determined by the flip of a card. \nWhen it's the master's turn he will decide where to go, first checking if any of his dice values are the same as yours (in which case he'll try to beat you there) then checking which dice spots gain him a benefit (like going up a track or taking a monument)\nThe master is a worthy opponent, with 3 difficulty levels to suit all player skill levels. \nThe solo mode also has different sets of cards that can be used, which gives the master a different feel every time. This makes the solo mode very variable and offers a lot of replayability!\nThe solo mode is compatible with all expansions, except the turn order expansion\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFull solo rules are in the print and play folder\n\nThe Turn order tokens (included in the base game) give advanced players a way to alter their turn order and perhaps gain an advantage at a pivotal moment in the game! They can be played after dice are grouped but before they are revealed.\nEach expansion adds a unique twist to Eternal Palace.\nLabyrinth\nRace through the labyrinth to gain bonuses. Will you take the longer path to gain additional favour from the Emperor or will you race to the centre?\nExports\nIn the Exports expansion complete export requests at the market by trading goods and you'll gain the benefit of the export. \nYou'll gain the bonus when he export is complete and you'll even be able to visit the fulfil the export request more than once to gain the benefit multiple times\nComposition\nIf you complete specific painting combinations first you'll gain a bonus. Some combination are harder to complete but you'll get better bonuses\n\nThe Labyrinth and Exports expansions are only included in the deluxe edition of Eternal Palace. The Composition expansion is included in the Kickstarter pack (free to all Kickstarter backers)\nThe Labyrinth, Exports, and Composition expansions are also compatible with the solo mode.\n- We're Not Wizards\n Help us make games - We're a small company and we rely on Kickstarter income to survive.

If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and/or physical address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nEU2: Italy, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Turkey, Romania.\nAll other EU countries are EU1\n\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, India and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n April: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n June: Submit Files to manufacturer\n  July & August: Manufacturing\n September: Shipping from China to the UK begins\n October: Arrives in ports\n  November: Fulfilment commences\n  December Fulfilment completed. \n January: Most backers have their copies.\n  PLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in January/February - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.\n\nAt Alley Cat Games we're a multicultural team so we're acutely aware of the importance of appropriate research when representing a culture that doesn't reflect our own heritage, even when the setting is fictional like in Eternal Palace. That's why we paid a cultural advisor and involved them in our research on Eternal Palace at an early stage. We made a lot of changes to the game and took on advice for things such as representation, thematic choices and even colour options. \nIt's also important to point out the one aspect of the game that we didn't change, the easels. These were not commonly used in China during the time period, but we felt that they added a table presence and beauty to the game that would not have been as striking had we meticulously represented painting styles in an accurate way.

In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon.

These videos may include content that are stretch goals and may not be unlocked yet.\nCheck out the videos to see what people are saying about the game.\n\"If you like dungeon crawls and you\u2019re up for a challenge, consider exploring Tiny Epic Dungeons. It\u2019s bigger than it looks from the outside!\" - Jonathan H. Liu, Geek Dad. Click to read the review!\nADDITIONAL COPIES AND ADDITIONAL ADD-ONS ARE HANDLED IN CROWDOX AFTER THE PROJECT.\nSee 'Shipping Details' below for shipping rates and VAT.\nTo keep shipping costs affordable, rewards will be shipped from three hubs: US, EU, and the UK.\nRegion-Friendly Shipping\nAll Tiny Epic Dungeons games and Tiny Epic Dungeons accessories will be Region-Friendly for the US, Canada, Europe, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.\nBased on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees.\n*Items added in CrowdOx after the project, that are NOT Tiny Epic Dungeons related, will be shipped from the US and all taxes and VAT for receiving the product will be the backer's responsibility.*\nVAT\nIn compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will be collected in CrowdOx for EU and UK backers. VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will be a separate line item in CrowdOx. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nWorld(B) = Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Romania, Russia, South Africa\nWorld(A) = All other countries, including the UK.\nThe most effective way to assure that we reach all potential upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!!\nHere are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nThe 6 defining features of a Tiny Epic game!\n\"Tiny Epic\" is an exclusive series of small box games produced by Gamelyn Games and designed by Scott Almes.\nEach game in the series is entirely unique but strictly adheres to two core values: TINY and EPIC!\n\u2022 TINY being the small box used for each game AND the simple, easy to understand, set of rules each possesses.\n\u2022 EPIC being their surprisingly gratifying gameplay. Each is packed with meaningful decisions, layered strategy, and high replayability, traits not typically found in games this size.\nTo learn more about the series, please visit us online.\nGamelyn Games, LLC. is a passion driven game publishing company based out of Arizona.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Most of it is created by our wonderful community and will be (or already is) made available for free download on morkborg.com, but there is also exclusive official material.\nIn this Kickstarter is also the official M\u00d6RK BORG GM screen, and a box full of almost-forgotten gods. \n\n\u2716 Thank you Terra Tenebrosa for letting us use the track The Arc of Descent from the album The Tunnels in the Kickstarter video. If you're looking for feverous, experimental black/post-metal, check it out here. \nThis is what this godless tome will look like\nPunish your ears\nTo get into the proper mood, we created this Spotify playlist. Put it on while reading this Kickstarter, and/or when playing M\u00d6RK BORG.\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday RPG about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\nSome people said this\n\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG CULT (MBC) is our sub-label for selected, approved and curated M\u00d6RK BORG content by the community. Basically, you send us homebrew stuff and if we like it and it follows our guidelines, we make some edits, art and lay it out before publishing it for free download on morkborg.com. Digital MBC content (including that of zines like this) will always be free, but this is a chance to get some of it in high-quality print form. I mean, you can download the content for free and print it at home too if you want. \n\u2716 Since a few days ago, we are also putting the submissions to MBC on pause. When we started this project we had NO IDEA we would receive as much content as we are, and since we're also working on forthcoming books etc, we simply can't keep up with the demand. So we close it down for a bit, until we've cleared the backlog, at which point we can open it up again.  \n\n\u2716 About six months ago we Kickstarted M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, the first MBC zine. It was a much bigger success than we could have imagined and an unbelievable 1792 backers helped us realize the project. Since then we have received a TON of awesome content submitted to the Cult and we want to collect it into a physical zine once more. So, if you're familiar with MBC: FERETORY, you know the drill. This is pretty much the exact same thing. Oh, and there's also the Official M\u00d6RK BORG Game Master's Screen of Doom and the mysterious shrine IKHON. We'll get to that. \nM\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC is published by Free League Publishing, same as M\u00d6RK BORG and M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY was. They will handle printing, distribution and digital fulfillment.\n  All these either are or will be available for free download on morkborg.com\n Adventure: Graves Left Wanting. The PCs find themselves buried alive in the vast, ever-changing cemetery of Graven-Tosk. This dark and weird tombcrawl is suitable as a campaign starter or a post-TPK adventure. By Karl Druid \n Adventure: Sepulchre of the Swamp Witch. In a hidden repository deep in the Slithering Swamp is a witch's altar of glyph-covered roots. They say it can fulfill any wish. Could stopping the approaching Doom be within its powers? Only one way to find out. By Christian Sahl\u00e9n. \n Adventure: Bloat. Villagers disappear. Tracks lead to an underground temple of bacchanalian frenzy, reeking of rot, offal and bile. Find them and sate your hunger. By Greg Saunders. \n Rules: Unheroic Feats. Enhance and personalize your classless characters with these optional advancement rules. By Johnny Carhat. \n Class: Sacrilegious Songbird. You struck a deal with a devil and since that woeful day your soul screams but your throat sings sweetly. And so does your purse. A small price to pay. By Karl Druid. \n Class: Shedding Vicar. Armor is weak, clothes a sin and your very skin an abhorrent vanity. Best to remove it all and walk peeled, clean and glistening wet into the night. By Cameron James. \n Creature: The Merchant. Cursed with eternal life and destined to roam the world trading shards of souls for ruinous relics. You never know when this mysterious monger might appear. Will you make a deal? By Johnny Carhat. \n Creature: The Bone Bowyer. This horrid fey lurks in the tangled depths of Sarkash where it fashions heart-seeking bone bows and blood-dyed cloaks from the flesh of the lost. By Matthew Bottiglieri. \n Rules: Blackpowder Weapons for the Rich and Foolhardy. The world is ending, so let's end it with a BANG. These optional rules are the spark that adds fire- to your fights. Whether it's a pepperbox or a ribauldequin, you can be assured these things are loud and deadly. By Ian McClung. \n\nThese are exclusive to the zine and will not be made available for free download. These will not only be included in the printed zine, but will also come translated to Swedish as a digital appendix to the PDF version. \n Creature: Borg Bitor. Vile, insectoid, parasitic creatures creeping into houses and nurseries come nighttime. There is a baby. There is an egg. Don't let them become one.\n Creature: Rotting Nurse. Many a Galgenbeckian remembers Mikol's infirmary and its gruesome experiments exposed by the inquisition. The head surgeon was jailed but whatever really happened to his accomplices, the nurses? Their lengthy, cruel punishment and vivisepulture. The empty graves. The shimmer from the starless skies. The many-legged horses carrying the bodies away... for what purpose?  \n 250.000 SEK STRETCH GOAL Adventure: Nurse the Rot. As you put Mother Marathuk\u2014the aunt of one of you dregs\u2014to her final rest, the village Tunstal is set in complete darkness, leaving it to its doom unless something is done. \n Rules: Curses and Cures. So you opened the puzzle box, whistled in the old mine or carelessly removed the protecting wards? These curses will be the consequence. Luckily, there are ways to break them, but it comes at a cost. \n\n\u2716 Our goal is to make this zine similar to M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, meaning something quite different from the M\u00d6RK BORG  core book. This is a rough zine, a haphazardly composited collection of ideas and articles, and we want it to feel like something you'd pick up at a concert or an underground art fair. It'll be a soft-cover zine, about 60-ish A5 pages thick, printed on heavily textured uncoated paper in 7 colors (CMYK+3), with some extra things metallic foiling and golden staples or who knows? You know, a typical zine.\nThe zine will only be printed in English, but the things written by Pelle and Johan will be included in Swedish in a digital Appendix.\n\n Introducing: The M\u00d6RK BORG Screen of Doom* \n*not really the name. OR IS IT?\n\u2716 Since the release of M\u00d6RK BORG we have seen quite a few awesome custom-made GM screens made, and now we want to offer you guys our take on it. This will be a beast of a screen; small but versatile. \nA five-paneled A5 portrait wall of death \nPrinted with gold metallic ink on one side and vivid neon yellow on the other. We want the screen to scream in your face when you run the game. \nShould we reach the 325.000 SEK stretch goal, we'll even equip each screen with two pairs of photo corners (for lack of a better name) that can hold A5 sheets with whatever tables or notes you want. So that you don't have to use that sharpie on the screen (I mean you still can, but you don't have to). Think old-school photo album, but for your adventure notes.\n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\n\nThe back has a ton of more or less useful tables. If we reach the Stretch goal you can even change two of the panels to have whatever reference tables, adventure notes and/or profane poetry you prefer.\n The front is all art, five scenes of various locales and important characters in the Dying world, from SHE in the mountains of Bergen Chrypt to the endless graveyard Graven-Tosk beneath the Shadowking's palace. \n The GM-facing side sports a wide array of tables and rules summaries that might come in handy during play, such as an NPC generator, equipment and Powers, combat summary (with an optional hit location table), generic enemy stat-blocks and a d100 list of random junk you can find when looting the cultists' coffers (previously printed in MBC: FERETORY and available on morkborg.com). \n\n\nOne more thing\nForged by the left hand of Nechrubel, bound in cured skin and soot-black wood, the ancient god-vessels known as IKHONs are detested by the Two-Headed Basilisks. Wielding their Powers, unfettering the Profane Profound shackled within is a serious heretical crime and whoever may carry these blackened shrines will be forever hunted by the inquisition. But perhaps it is worth it. \nEarly mockup. Might change. You never know with these things.\n\u2716 IKHON is a mysterious box. A gaol keeping four almost-forgotten folk gods at bay; the Bilkherd, the Becklure, the Old Dead and the dreaded Silkfiend.  Those who dare commune with them are promised great rewards. But life and death go hand in hand and too small a sacrifice could be perceived as an insult. This gift could very well be a curse. IKHON is an\n a6 box with rules on how to unfetter the Profane Profound. While you can never choose which one to summon and how they'll react, (willing) human sacrifice will tip the odds slightly in your favor. Within are\n four tracts, one for each god-creature, detailing their gifts and punishments. Each a 24 page A6 booklet. \n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\nWritten by Pelle Nilsson but torn apart and rebuilt in a stranger, darker form by Fiona Maeve Geist and Jarrett Crader of the MoonRat Conspiracy.  \n Over 40 full-page illustrations by the masterful Paraguayan artist Samuel Araya, whose oil paintings will bring the Profane Profound to blasphemous life. This is but one of them, giving you an idea of the kind of aesthetic this thing will have:\nOne of these mysterious, bene/malevolent deities.\n\nPledge levels and what they include\nWe got some stretch goals, in case we should get more funds than we need to just make the zine, screen and IKHON happen:\n 100.000 SEK We make this thing, simple as that.\n 175.000 SEK No zine is complete without silver foil details! If we hit this Stretch Goal we'll add a bit of shine to one of the pages.\n 250.000 SEK  We include the official and zine exclusive adventure Nurse the Rot (check the Stuff by Pelle and Johan section above for more details). \n  325.000 SEK We equip the GM screen with two pairs of photo corners allowing you to customize it with your own reference sheets for whatever you're running (just print and cut it to roughly A5 size and you're good!). \n 400.000 SEK We'll make two of these additional GM screen reference sheets and have them printed and included with the screen. Exactly what they'll have on them will be revealed.\n 825.000 SEK We print a minimalistic dungeon crawl in the form of a one-page comic, made by \u0141ukasz Kowalczuk. It will be in A2 format (and also PDF) and comes with the zine. \n 900.000 SEK Pelle will make a generator that will let you generate sects, cults, their leaders and beliefs. This will take up one spread in the zine.\n 1.000.000 SEK, the final stretch goal: We turn the Monster Generator from M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY into a digital app, just like we did with scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\u2716 Of course, if you want to supercharge your pledge with additional things you'll be able to tack on these (more or less) family-friendly products after the Kickstarter campaign ends. These will be shipped together with the MBC: Heretic items. \n\u2716 To buy an addon, click the \"Manage My Pledge\" button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in SEK) for all the addons you want. After the Kickstarter ends, there will be a Pledge Manager where you can mark which addons you want for the extra money you put it.\n\u2716 You can also leave your pledge unchanged and add things after the Kickstarter ends.\nNote that addons can incur additional shipping fees as the weight increases, paid for in the pledge manager.\n\nM\u00d6RK BORG CORE BOOK, 250 SEK\n\u2716 The actual game that all this is for. Maybe you want to start your perilous M\u00d6RK BORG journey here and thus need the actual rule book, or something happened to your old copy. Either way, you can get it here! Includes a PDF. \n\n M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, 150 SEK \n\u2716 The previous M\u00d6RK BORG CULT zine, with lots of adventures, monsters, treasures and untimely demise including the mini/solo game Dark Fort which was the original game that later evolved into M\u00d6RK BORG. Includes a PDF. \n\nDEATH TEMPLE SZTUN, 50 SEK\n\u2716 A hyper-linear murder gauntlet of a dungeon crawl. Short (a folded A4 pamphlet, so 6 pages) but sweet (actually not sweet, more bitter and rank). Does not include a PDF.\nCharacter sheet pads, 60 SEK\n\u2716 A pad of character sheets printed on uncoated paper, perfect for writing on or to angrily crumple into a pathetic ball of disappointment. Does not include a PDF but the character sheets are available for free download on morkborg.com so there's no need.\nExtra copy of M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC, 150 SEK\n\u2716 Add a second copy of this zine to your pledge. Give it to a friend. Cut it to pieces. Or just keep one close at hand in case something happens. These are weird times. Includes a PDF.\nIKHON, 180 SEK\n\u2716 We don't recommend it, but perhaps you want to obtain this mystical box and have a peek inside. In that case, you can add one to your pledge. Includes a PDF.\nM\u00d6RK BORG GM Screen, 180 SEK\n\u2716 Add a GM screen to your pledge. Includes a PDF. No witty text here, sorry.\n\nShipping\nThese are weird times. Not only because of covid-19 and the uncertainty it brings but also with Brexit screwing international shipping up in unclear ways. Luckily we are able to ship from a Germany-based warehouse and a US-based instead of the UK this time around, but the current situation will, unfortunately, lead to increased shipping costs and possible delays beyond our control. We have done what we can but at the end of the day, some of these things are outside of even our unholy grasp. \n\nShipping will be added in a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends and will be based on the number of products you add to your pledge. But these are the estimates for the pledge levels as they are in this Kickstarter: \nAdditional costs like taxes and/or customs could, but should not, apply.\n\n\u2716 Due to COVID-19 there is a possibility that American backers will receive their stuff a month later than European backers, meaning it might arrive in August. We are doing what we can to avoid this but can't make any promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced in running successful Kickstarter campaigns and to lower the risks on this one, the majority of the stuff we're offering is already done. The zine is written and most of it is proofread, most of the art is done. The screen is pretty much ready to send to print and Ikhon is well underway. We're in good, reliable hands with Free League Publishing when it comes to fulfillment and distribution, and we will keep you guys posted on any news and updates during and after the campaign. \n\nThe two things that cause uncertainty are Covid-19 and Brexit. The former could possibly affect both our production and the distribution should anything happen, and the latter could, in the worst case, make shipping way more expensive than we initially budgeted for but right now we're running with the latest numbers and estimates from the distributor and have a buffer to take from should things go to shit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAs with all M\u00d6RK BORG stuff we're focusing on top quality printing and materials, to make sure your books and products don't fall apart.

Pre-Order via the Alley Cat Games website now!\nExample game in play\nA close up of the board detail\nThis new edition of Tinners' Trail is a reprint of the critically acclaimed 2008 game by Martin Wallace, which has been redeveloped and upgraded in partnership with Alley Cat Games\n\nTinners' Trail is a thematic Euro game set in 19th century Cornwall. You play as a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your 'work points' and money effectively. Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore, and make a profit(!) but the deeper your mine goes the more expensive the process gets. You'll have the opportunity to improve your mines with infrastructure like ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?\n\n\n\n\n\n* Screen Printed Meeples only included with Expanded Edition\n\n\n\n\nSee the changes below...\n Increased player count - a game that was once only 3-4 players can now be enjoyed by 1-5 players!\n 2 new expansions - the Arsenic expansion, which introduces a new resource, and the Emigration expansion, which sees miners travel overseas.\n Reduced randomness - but still keeping the variability. The board is now set up with tiles instead of the roll of a the dice.\n Improved Auctions - dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.\n Improved artwork and graphic design - with artwork by Ossi Heikkla (Flamme Rouge) and artwork and graphic design by Javier 'Inkgolem' Gonz\u00e1les (Cooper Island).\n Improved component quality - with custom meeples and colour blind friendly colours.\n Lord Wallace solo mode - a brand new solo mode from our solo mode expert, David Digby, designer of the Chocolate Factory solo mode.\n\nThe expanded edition of Tinners' Trail comes with 2 brand new expansions, which add to Tinners' Trail with thematic new gameplay. These expansions require the base game to play and can by played alone or combined. They are also compatible with the Lord Wallace solo mode.\n\nArsenic Expansion\nThe arsenic expansion adds the extra resource of arsenic. Due to the danger of arsenic, it is mined at the cost of PERMANENTLY losing work points but with the reward of a big cash payout.\nEmigration Expansion\nIn The Emigration expansion, you can send your workers overseas to gain ongoing benefits, such as extra income or free improvements.\n\nLord Wallace Solo Mode\nThe solo mode plays just like the 2 player game, but the actions of your opponent are determined by a deck of solo cards.\nEvery time it's Lord Wallace's turn (decided by the work track like normal) you'll flip a card and look at the round number and Lord Wallace's work marker position to find the action that Lord Wallace will perform. Sometimes there will be two options, and Lord Wallace will decide which option to take depending on the price of copper.\nLord Wallace will also have a hand of cards and will use those cards to bid on area tiles.\nOther than that, Lord Wallace will interact with the board in the same way as a normal player, Building Mines, taking developments, and Mining ore. Can you outmatch the esteemed Lord Wallace?\n\n\n\nDownload the (almost final!) rules here!\nDownload a basic print and play file to try yourself here!\nPlay on Tabletop Simulator!\n\nEach player represents a growing mining operation in 19th-century Cornwall, seeking to profit from the rich tin and copper deposits of the region. Over the course of the 4 rounds players will build mines, acquire developments, extract ore, sell their tin and copper, and invest the proceeds to earn points. The player with the most points is the winner.\nAvailable actions\n\nActions are taken by using points from the 'work track', and players further back on the work track take their turns first.\nBetter actions cost more work points so time your actions carefully. You'll need to think about the best action now, but also how many work points it'll cost you, affecting your turn order later\n\nPlan your actions carefully\nThe market value of tin and copper change each round, so you'll have to push your luck at the right time to sell. Tin can be sold at a pretty good price right now, but will it be even higher in the next round?\nA changing market price makes every round (and game) play differently\nDevelopments can increase your mining capacity, remove water from your mines and even add more tin and copper. However, they are limited each round, so you'll have to snap them up quick. The competition is fierce so you might even want to pass a round early to give you the first choice in the next round!\n\nBuilding developments increases your mining efficiency\nUse your profits to invest in the market to gain victory points. The sooner you invest the more points you'll get for your money\n\nThe Arsenic Expansion adds a new resource to Tinners' Trail. Arsenic can be mined without spending work points and it can be sold instantly and gives a higher price the sooner it is sold but Aresnic is very dangerous to mine and you permanently reduce your maximum work points for each arsenic you mine.\nThe Emigration Expansion sees your workers take their mining skills overseas. Cornish miners were in high demand overseas as skilled labourers and if you send your miners overseas you'll receive ongoing benefits such as regular income each round, free developments, extra investments, or even adjusting the market.\n\nIn The Lord Wallace solo mode, you'll go head to head against Lord Wallace as he attempts to establish dominance over the Cornish tin and copper mining industry.\n\nLord Wallace will choose actions based on the card that is revealed and the number of work points he has left. He also takes into account the price of copper and will take advantage of an increase in the market, which will keep even the most experienced miners on their toes.\n\nThe Lord Wallace solo mode can be used alone with the base game or in combination with either or both of the expansions\n\nThe Lord Wallace solo mode was designed by David Digby, who not only developed the expansions and updated gameplay for this version of Tinners' Trail, but also created the critically acclaimed solo mode for Chocolate Factory.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter has ended to manage add-ons and shipping. \nIf you want to add any of the add-ons below to your pledge, please do so in the Pledge Manager. If you want to add extra copies of Tinners' Trail to your pledge, you can do this in the Pledge Manager too\nYou can pledge at the $1 level now to gain access to the pledge manager.\nThese Add-on prices are indicative of the actual prices that will be charged in the pledge manager but are subject to change due to exchange rates.\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and we will send you our rates!\n\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nPlease back at the retailer pledge tier for group pledges\n\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\n\nEU2 - Italy, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Turkey, Romania.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country. More accurate pricing will be in the pledge manager\n\nCustoms Friendly Shipping - With the new Brexit deal we are working with our shipping partners to make all EU packages customs friendly, by paying the customs before shipping. This is still being finalised and we should know more by the end of the campaign. If this cannot be done for whatever reason, we are offering a money back guarantee for EU packages that we cannot fulfil for any reason.\nWe are also working with Asia & Canada partners to offer custom free shipping, though currently this is not the case.\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be slightly different than the amount stated. The above estimates currently improve a surcharge due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, with the rollout of the vaccine we are optimistic that these prices will be lower when fulfilment costs are finalised. If costs are cheaper before the pledge manager closes, we will pass these savings on to you.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia). \nIn very rare cases the shipping price can be significantly higher than the early estimates. We reserve the right to cancel any order and will offer a full refund in these cases.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n February: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n March: Submit Files to manufacturer\n April/May/June: Manufacturing \n June/July: Shipping from Poland to the UK begins\n Late July: Arrives in ports\n Early August: Fulfilment commences\n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in September/October - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always with our campaigns, we cannot prevent \"god-like\" failures such as thunderstorm, hurricanes, pandemics (!) etc.\n\nWe can promise you though that we will do everything in our power to keep everyone updated as well as stick to the original plan as possible.\n\nYou can rest assured that since this is our 14th campaign, that we are a capable and knowledgeable company.

To date, we\u2019ve raised enough as a company to donate over 60,000 games to kids. This campaign will help give even more! \nThe Newest Expansion to Nemo's War is Here! Featuring...\n A COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL & BETWEEN VOYAGES GUIDE: The new Operations Manual shows how to run the ship turn-by-turn and includes many useful appendices at the end, while the new Between Voyages Guide features instruction for setup, ending the game, scoring, epilogues, variants, and more!\n\n A NEW 2-PLAYER VERSUS VARIANT: Joining the riveting solo and cooperative modes where players command the Nautilus, in this game variant one player will play as the Imperialists, bent on its defeat. Includes special cards and 2 Imperial Squadron Miniatures!  \n\n A NEW CHARACTER TILE: Entering our story is Nemo\u2019s son, Nadeen Dakkar, who crosses paths with his father after hearing news of mysterious events at sea!\n\n NEW FINALE CARDS: Spice up your endings with The Trap, Imperialists\u2019 Catspaw, Scientific Espionage, and The Kraken! \n\n NEW STERN MOTIVES, ADDITIONAL NAUTILUS UPGRADES, AND EVEN MORE TOKENS & MARKERS! \nBrave the hazards of the seas, combat vessels around the globe, incite uprisings, chronicle amazing wonders, find mysterious treasures -- your quest knows no bounds in this Ultimate Edition. Combining all expansion content, including the Journey\u2019s End Expansion, both new and returning players will be able to experience everything Nemo\u2019s War has to offer. Play solitaire, cooperatively, or competitively; the choice is yours!\n\nEach turn, you must address the seas\u2019 challenges in a grand adventure, confront the growing pressure of the Imperialist powers\u2019 navies, undertake Actions with the Nautilus and her crew \u2013 all while maintaining Captain Nemo\u2019s spirit to continue.  The Turn Sequence is as follows:\n\nBegin each turn in the Event Phase by flipping an event, Test, or other card from the Adventure Deck. Favorably resolving Tests, and using resources to manipulate your die rolls in this pursuit, will be critical to securing a victory no matter what your motive is.\nRoll high, captains, but be careful: your mission ends in Defeat if you deplete a Ship Resource. Developing an understanding of the probabilities, risks, and rewards for each Test and to what degree will ultimately be the reason for your mission\u2019s success or failure.\nNext is the Placement Phase, where you roll the dice for this round\u2019s Oceans for Ship token placement based on the game\u2019s current Act and your Notoriety. Strategic choices about where to place your ships, what we call \u201cpainting the board,\u201d will be crucial to your plans! Which Oceans to populate (and, through combat, denude) is the vital strategic chess game you are playing with the Imperialist powers who oppose you.\n You also receive the Differential Roll result of the two (selected) white dice rolled in Action Points for that turn. If the two (selected) white dice are doubles, a Lull Turn takes place..\n  Now it\u2019s time to act! During the Action Phase, you spend your Action Points to Move, Attack, Search for Treasure, Incite Uprisings, and more, all to advance Nemo\u2019s goals.\nAlways remember: you are questing for the greatest number of Victory Points (VPs) that you can acquire, as modified by Captain Nemo\u2019s Motive, while avoiding the many ways to suffer defeat. BVPs are earned in several ways (e.g., sinking enemy ships, passing TEST Events, collecting Treasures, inciting oppressed peoples, making scientific discoveries, etc), so choose your actions wisely each turn, and beware: \n Your mission ends in Defeat if your adventures gain too much notoriety, as you become an international Pariah to be hunted down mercilessly.\n\nRepeat these Phases until the game ends with your early defeat or you reveal the Final\u00e9 card that ultimately instructs you: \u201cThe game ends!\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done, read the epilogue to your voyage in the Between Voyages Guide. Your level of victory and motive will change the story of your Journey\u2019s End.\n\nHere's a Preview and How to Play video for The Ultimate Edition from the Game Boy Geek:\nYou can also check out this How to Play from Meeple University with designer & developer Alan Emrich! This video uses an older edition of the game, but it does an excellent job of showing the gameplay.\n\nThe first expansion for Nemo's War.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific local taxes, or other charges. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details.\nAdd-ons, including additional copies of these same items, will increase this cost. Shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager.\nWe are only shipping to the following countries, due to shipping uncertainties and restrictions:\nIf you back this campaign and request fulfillment to somewhere outside of these countries, we will cancel your order and refund your pledge per our Refund Policy (90% of the total you pledged).\n\nWe do anticipate that these products will be available through our online stores around the world so if you cannot participate in this campaign, you should be able to order them through those in the future.\n\nTaxes\nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see the chart below for more information about the tax rates to be charged:\n\n\nIf your country or state is not listed here, you may be responsible for paying your local taxes and import costs (use tax, VAT, GST, clearance, etc) depending on your local laws and customs rules.\nPlease review our campaign terms of service by reading the FAQs in full.

Together, we\u2019ve created a brand-new edition of Don\u2019t Get Got with 120 new missions and an aggressively orange colour scheme.\nIf you don\u2019t own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect. Included in this \u00a320 box is everything you need to play.\nIf you DO own Don\u2019t Get Got, that\u2019s perfect too! Think of this box as a very generous expansion, doubling the amount of missions in the base game and letting you play with up to 20 players. Imagine that! It would be carnage.\nCheck out SU&SD\u2019s glowing review!\nAre you the kind of hotshot who doesn\u2019t have 10 minutes to watch a video? Not a problem, here\u2019s a quick gif-stuffed overview:\nDon\u2019t Get Got is a game of secret missions for 2-10 players, and it takes place while you go about your day. Perfect places to break out Don\u2019t Get Got would be living with housemates, at work, on holiday, at parties, even at gaming conventions.\nEach player receives a cute little wallet full of unique missions, and then you just get back to living your life, except you\u2019re immediately going to start scheming like a mean scheme machine:\nHand out some random missions to each player\nEach mission will tell you what you\u2019ve got to try and trick the other players into doing...\nRead and insert the missions into your wallet\nEach time you succeed at this you get to (a) flip over the little mission in your wallet, which is super satisfying:\nNailed it!\nand (b) reveal your mission to the player who just got got, which is even more satisfying:\nPoint and rejoice\nBut there\u2019s a catch! If you ever get caught (which is as easy as another player asking if you\u2019re trying to trick them), that mission is flipped over to the \u201cFAILED IT\u201d side for the rest of the game.\nFailed it :'(\nThe first player to complete 3 missions wins!\nVictory\nThe writers at Shut Up & Sit Down have had a great time creating new expansions for some of their favourite party games, like Monikers and The Metagame. When Big Potato asked if we wanted to design a brand-new box for Don\u2019t Get Got, we leapt at the chance.\nIncluded in this Shut Up & Sit Down Special Edition are 10 plastic wallets, 1 collectible sticker and 120 missions, all of which were painstakingly entered into a spreadsheet by team SU&SD.\nIn all seriousness, we worked super hard on this, and went through several rounds of refinement and feedback with the original game\u2019s designers. The perfect Don\u2019t Get Got mission makes you smile when you receive it, and represents an interesting, open-ended puzzle as to how exactly you\u2019re going to pull it off. We aimed to deliver that with each and every mission.\n\n\nBut of course not! With enough pledges we will reveal not one, not five, but three stretchy goals that we\u2019d like to offer all of our backers for absolutely free.\nYou took that poor target and smashed it into pieces!\nAs a reward, you\u2019ve unlocked the \u2018EPIC MISSIONS\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions that require so much forethought, even a criminal mastermind would wince at them.\nSurprise extra stretchy goal unlocked! \nWe messed up with the shipping, so here\u2019s something to say sorry \u2014 all the cards from the original Don\u2019t Get Got game. That\u2019s 186 extra missions, carefully placed inside each and every copy of the Kickstarter special edition.\nYou want the rest? Well guess what, you can\u2019t handle the rest!\nOnly joking, of course you can. Introducing the \u2018GAME NIGHT\u2019 pack \u2014 20 Kickstarter-exclusive missions, all designed to be played while you\u2019re playing another board game. How meta are we?\nYou\u2019ve unlocked this year\u2019s hottest fashion accessory!\nFresh from the catwalks of Milan, it\u2019s the SU&SD x Big Potato pin badge. Whether you pin it to your bag, your ear or your fancy lapels, everyone will know you backed the hottest game around (and that you might be up to something sneaky).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt should be a relief to anyone who\u2019s watched team SU&SD finger board game components into their mouths that they won\u2019t be involved in manufacturing or fulfilment at all.\n\nInstead, publishing and manufacturing will be handled by Big Potato Games, who have published over 50 games and distributed to countries all over the world. They have literally shipped out more games than you\u2019ve had hot dinners. We're using Blackbox as our fulfilment service who are the complete bomb and we trust with all of our possessions.\n\nAdditionally, the copy of this Special Edition that you can see in the Kickstarter video is a near-final copy sent to us directly from the manufacturers, so all we need to do is tell them how many more copies to make.

Whatever version of Oceans you pledge for, it will automatically come with a 5-6 player expansion.\nThe Evolution games are known for vivid themes, easy rules, and hidden depth. With many thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever put into a game before, Oceans is our most ambitious project to date.\nAt the game's start, the only food source is plankton, the foundation of the ocean food web. It populates the beautifully illustrated Reef and Ocean boards, shown here as prototypes: \n(Note the fish tokens you see above are off-the-shelf items we used for testing. The actual tokens will be cardboard for the standard edition and acrylic for the deluxe edition. See below.)\nYour goal is to create and evolve species so they find their niche in the growing ecosystem, by giving them helpful combinations of traits. This is a what a species looks like: \nEach species is defined by its population (the fish tokens above), and its traits (the cards above). Through the game It'll gain and lose traits, and gain and lose population depending on what it can eat, and what can eat it. Despite your best efforts, some species will go extinct! It's natural selection at work. \nBecause you can build species from any combination of traits, thousands of species are possible, and they all interact in their own particular ways as the ecosystem builds. Every game creates a one-of-a-kind world, never to be seen again.   \nMany species will be predators, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. But some will eat in other ways, for example by scavenging on the sea bottom or filter-feeding on plankton. Below are examples of trait art - each a watercolor painting by famed nature artist Catherine Hamilton:\nThen there's a whole other side to the game. It's called The Deep. \nHuge regions of deep ocean are unexplored, and what little we've seen of them can seem like fantasy:\nWe had to put this mysterious world into the game. Hence The Deep.\nThe Deep will contain, at minimum, 50 unique, powerful traits, which dramatically boost the range - and strangeness - of species you can evolve. We commissioned scores of illustrations from a variety of fine artists to make them. Here are examples:   \nThrough unlocked stretch goals, at least 32 additional Deep cards may become permanently added to the game. \nBeyond those, there are also 8 foiled Deep promo cards to unlock. These foiled traits are more aggressive and/or complex than the other cards in the game. \nWith all stretch goals unlocked, you'll get more than 90 unique Deep cards in total. They raise the number of distinct species you can evolve from thousands to about one million.\nEach time you play, there are 2 scenario cards in play (chosen at random at the start of the game from a deck of at least 25). Each creates a major ecosystem-shift when activated, altering the whole game. It's another way the evolutionary timeline changes each play.\nThe standard scenario deck can create about 600 distinct Ocean histories to evolve through, but we're also offering up to 13 more scenario cards as stretch goals. With those added, about 1500 Ocean histories are possible. \nWe've packed all this into rules that are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to teach even than Evolution, which was already known for being easy to teach. Nonetheless you'll find tons of hidden tactics and strategies...under the surface. \nNote: Oceans is mechanically quite different from previous Evolution games. See this update for details.  \n For every pledge level, at the end of the campaign, you'll choose between English, French, Spanish and Italian versions of Oceans in the pledge manager. You can pledge for as many copies as you wish.\n North Star Games will publish the English version\n Funforge will publish the French version. Pour voir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici! \n Schwerkraft-Verlag will publish the German Edition. \n Ediciones MasQueOca will publish the Spanish version. You can read their updates about Oceans at their blog here.\n Pendragon Game Studio will publish the Italian version. To read about this campaign in, click here.\nStandard Edition Pledge Level - $45 USD ($5 off MSRP)\nYou get the Oceans Standard Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. \nThe Standard Edition contains:  1 Rulebook, 1 Reference Guide, 2 Player aids, 1 Reef board, 3 Ocean boards (2 small, 1 large), 120 Surface cards (10 of each type), 50-80 Deep cards (1 of each type), 24 Scenario cards, 24 Species boards, 200 cardboard fish with 6 different illustrated designs (see below), 4 Player screens, and 4 Bonus Score tokens. Note exact numbers of some components could change with final game tweaks.\nThe 5-6 player expansion contains 40 additional fish, 2 extra player screens, 2 extra bonus score tokens, and 10 extra species boards.  \nNote: unlike in the prototype pictured above, the final cardboard fish will be illustrated on both sides: \nDeluxe Edition Pledge Level - $70 ($15 off MSRP)\nYou get Oceans' Deluxe Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. The Deluxe Edition improves on the Standard Edition in the following ways:\nIncludes 240 deluxe translucent acrylic fish tokens in addition to the cardboard fish of the standard edition, so you can decide how you want to play. The acrylic fish are more durable, easier to handle, and they refract light beautifully. Our goal is to make them as delicious-looking and as tactile as possible. We'll have done our job if your first instinct is to eat them. Prototype:\nThe final version may look even better, as they'll have smooth, beveled edges.\nIncludes custom-printed, premium food bags for up to 6 players for storing your points, instead of cardboard player screens. They feel super-silky, they have drawstrings, and they help keep your playing area neat and compact. \nIncludes 220 custom Oceans premium matte card sleeves, for sleeving both the core trait cards and The Deep trait cards, plus spares. \nBox Cover Art Painting Pledge Level - $3000\nYou get the Deluxe Edition, all unlocked stretch goals, and Catherine Hamilton's original 12\" x 12\" watercolor painting for the Box Cover. Because the painting is one-of-a-kind, only one backer can pledge this level: \nPledge levels which are no longer available\nThere are a number of pledge levels with backer limits that have been reached, and so are no longer available. To simplify this page, we've removed descriptions of these levels for now. We'll add them back in if any become available again.\nWhatever language you choose for your game, your stretch goals will also come in that language. There are three types of stretch goals: \n Deep Cards: Unlocked Deep traits that will become a permanent part of both the Standard and Deluxe Editions. Each card that isn't unlocked may be available on our website for $2.  \n Foiled Deep Cards: Promo Deep traits that are more aggressive and/or complex than normal Deep traits. After the campaign, each foiled card may be available on our website for $3 if there are any left over. \n Scenario Cards: Promo scenarios that are wackier than the standard scenarios. Some are downright goofy. After the campaign, each scenario card may be available on our website for $1 if there are any left over. \nThe total value of all stretch goals is more than $100.\nYou can order as many of each add-on as you like. Note the non-digital add-ons will add extra shipping cost, which will be charged after the campaign ends in our pledge manager.\nEvolution (English or Italian) - add $40 to your pledge for each English copy, $35 for each Italian copy\nEvolution is an award-winning board game where 2 \u2013 6 players adapt terrestrial species in an ever changing ecosystem with hungry predators and limited resources. The game has been used in the evolutionary biology department at the University of Oxford and featured in the world's leading scientific journal, Nature. You'll be able to choose between English and Italian versions in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nEvolution Video Game (English Only)\nAdd $12 to your pledge for a Steam code (20% off). In the pledge manager at campaign's end, it may also be possible to add-on iOS and Android versions.\nWe've turned Evolution into a video game for iOS, Android, and Steam. It's got lots of new content and modes of play, and a refined interface. The learn-as-you-play tutorial makes it perhaps the easiest way to learn Evolution.\nEvolution: Climate Standalone (English Only) - add $60 to your pledge for each copy\nClimate is a more advanced version of Evolution, where you must contend not only with other species, but also with a changing climate that can swing from scorching hot to icy cold, and major environmental disruptions like drought and meteor impacts.\nEvolution: The Beginning (English Only) - add $25 to your pledge for each copy\nThe Beginning is a faster, simpler, more casual Evolution experience than its parent game. It's especially good for playing with young kids (8 and up) and it works very well for 2 players.\nEvolution Foiled Promo Card Pack #1 (English Only) - add $12 to your pledge for each pack\nThis pack contains 7 copies each of 5 foiled promo traits that that can be used in both Evolution and Evolution: Climate. We normally sell each trait for $5 each (and not all of them foiled). With this pack you save more than 50% on each card. The cards are: Extra Sensory Perception, Cybernetic Limbs, Gigantism, Venom, Unstable DNA.\nEvolution Foiled Promo Card Pack #2 (English Only) - add $17 to your pledge for each pack\nThis pack contains 7 copies each of 7 foiled promo traits that that can be used in both Evolution and Evolution: Climate.

The cards are: Sharp Teeth, Rapid Mutation, Pest, Invasive Species, Pounce, Quills, and Last Stand.\nEvolution Foiled Promo Card Pack #3 (English Only) - add $15 to your pledge for each pack\nThis pack contains 7 copies each of 6 foiled promo traits that that can be used in both Evolution and Evolution: Climate.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself. I've learned a lot from my experiences and from others in the business. The risk could be that I missed something or forgot about something, but that should really only affect me and not you.

It\u2019s a thrilling experience of TALKING and THINKING and HIGH FIVING that anyone can play\u2014but it also has some of that deep word game sorcery, like Codenames, where your decisions feel tense, strategic, meaningful. \nWavelength is designed by Wolfgang Warsch, Alex Hague, and Justin Vickers. Wolfgang is the creator behind The Mind and won the Kennerspiel des Jahres award in 2018\u2014basically the most prestigious award in tabletop games. Alex and Justin make Monikers, which the New York Times called \u201cthe perfect party game.\u201d\nThe game\u2019s stunning art is by Nan Na Hvass & Sofie Hannibal of Hvass&Hannibal.\nLike the best party games, Wavelength is deceptively simple. \nEach round, one team rotates a 3D dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum:\nBullseye = those 3 colored wedges\nThe spectrum is completely hidden by a plastic screen, BUT one player on your team\u2014the Psychic\u2014knows exactly where the bullseye is. Their job is to get your team to guess the location by: \n1. Drawing a card with a pair of words that represent two ends of a spectrum, like\n2. Giving a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries\nSo if the card this round is \u201cHot - Cold,\u201d the Psychic needs to give a clue ON THE SPECTRUM between extremely hot on the far left side to extremely cold on the far right side. And so in the example above they might give a clue like \"coffee.\"\nAfter the Psychic gives their clue, this when the real game begins: your team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on the spectrum.  This is when your team has a chance to think out loud, debate, and ponder extremely dumb questions\u2014all while the other team tries to poison your brain with bad suggestions.  \nAfter your team \u201clocks in\u201d their answer, the Psychic DRAMATICALLY REVEALS the bullseye. The closer to the center you guessed, the more points your team scores!\nOh, and the opposing team ALSO gets a chance for points: before the reveal, they quickly discuss and guess whether the bullseye is to the left or right of your team's dial position and get 1 point if they're right!\nIt\u2019s smart and funny and endlessly social. \nWavelength comes with 168 different spectrums, which combine with the randomized bullseye position in an infinite number of weird and challenging and interesting combinations.\nHere\u2019s the best thing about Wavelength: when your team guesses exactly right, it feels like you all just performed an impossible magic trick together. Success feels AWESOME and unlike any game we\u2019ve ever played.\nEveryone screams and high fives. Other people in the room look over to see what just happened. People hug, sometimes. It\u2019s wild.\nWavelength\u2019s theme may be telepathy, but it\u2019s secretly all about empathy. To win, your team will have to figure out how each of you thinks about the world. And talking through that will lead to some of the most oddly profound discussions like:\nHow ugly is a baby kangaroo?\nIs stealing from orphans forgivable?\nDoes cotton smell good?\nHow hairy is David Hasselhoff?\nIs pizza a sandwich?\nWavelength is the game we\u2019ve been wanting to make for YEARS: an experience right in the middle between a think-y word game and a ridiculous party game.\nThe secret ingredient is that there are NO NUMBERS in the game at all. So instead of rationally debating between an 8 or 9 on a scale of 1-10, you have just this completely unquantifiable feeling of going with your gut. \nBut Wavelength isn\u2019t some loosey goosey opinion game: there\u2019s an ironclad logic behind a great clue that feels exhilarating when your team gets a perfect bullseye.\n  \u201cThe Device\u201d: This is the main interactive element of the game. It's a fully assembled component that includes a 7.5\" rotating wheel with scalloped edges for turning, the 2.5\" diameter plastic dial, plastic screen w/handle for easy reveal, and front and back cardboard panels.\n 84 spectrum cards: Double sided for 168 spectrums, linen finish.\n 3 Scoring tokens: Cute little cardboard heads!\n Custom plastic tray: With space for expansions, debossed text for scoring.\n Rulebook: It's a rulebook.\nOne of the really unique things about Wavelength is that it's played entirely IN THE BOX. The cards, dial, and score tracker all slot into the box\u2019s tray, and you just\u2026pass it around. So you never have to worry about losing components at a bar or under your friend\u2019s table. \nThere\u2019s NOTHING TO SORT and NOTHING TO BAG. Which makes Wavelength a breeze to set up and take down. It literally takes less than 30 seconds to get a game ready. \nThere\u2019s one more thing that makes Wavelength so special: it\u2019s TACTILE. \nYou have this big, juicy 3D plastic dial that feels incredible in your hand. It gives such a satisfying feeling of precise control rather than just guessing numbers.  \nOne of our MANY working prototypes, developed by the brilliant Sarah Pavis\nYou\u2019ll want to turn it for the sake of turning it.\nAnd to randomize the bullseye's location each round, instead of having to fiddle with cards every time, we've designed a game show worthy rotating wheel that the Psychic gets to turn each round before giving their clue:\nThe result is a game that's intuitive and playable for non-gamers and yet still feels fresh to us jaded tabletop veterans after hundreds of plays (yes, we\u2019re obsessed). And because of the near-infinite combinations of bullseye positions and spectrum cards, you\u2019ll want to switch up teams and play again and again and again. \nWe can\u2019t wait to get it to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 6th kickstarter, and we're really proud that we've delivered a solid final product every time.\n\nAnd for Wavelength, we've never prototyped or tested a game this much before. We spent countless hours over the past year on the rules, card set, and physical design. \n\nIn terms of manufacturing, this is the most complex game we've ever made, so we've also put a ton of time into making sure we can get it from idea to execution. Fortunately, we're working with Panda, who manufactures hyper complex games like Scythe. So we're in very good hands there with their engineers and logistical wizards. We've also built in a lot of cushion into our delivery estimate of October, just in case we have an even longer prototyping process. \n\nFor fulfillment, we're working with Blackbox, who we've used to ship thousands of copies of Monikers to backers around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "WAVELENGTH", "descp": "A copy of the game.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8,545 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Wavelength app", "update_content": "Hello!

Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we in turn delayed the retail launch to put our backers first. Coral Island's deluxe version will not be in general retail until backers have had it for many months. Backers are always our priority.\nWorld class manufacturing\nThis is a game of premium wooden components. For this project, we are using Longpack, who manufactured Dice Hospital for us and gave us some fantastic wooden doctor meeples. \nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via our business Royal Mail account. Unlike Dice Hospital, we will NOT be using GamesQuest for fulfilment. If Brexit happens and free trade is no longer possible between UK and EU, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers. It is likely US shipping will be done from within the USA using QML - this ultimately depends on a number of factors, but we will keep everyone informed of course.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n March: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development. \n April: Submit Files to manufacturer \n May: Manufacturing\n June: Shipping from China to the UK begins \n Late July: Arrives in ports \n Early August: Fulfilment commences \n September: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in October - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nESSEN SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at Essen Spiel 2019. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before Essen, but you or a friend are attending Essen, you/they can pick it up from Essen itself.\nOur last medium weight euro - Dice Hospital - was in high demand and hard to find for several months after release.

Both games utilise dice stacking as the predominant mechanic in the game (and needed a serious number of dice), but dice-stacking is explored in completely different ways!\nCoral is a 3D pattern recognition game\nIn Coral, you have your own dice but place them on a shared board. Create shapes in 3D, utilising not only your own dice (the coral!) but your opponents' dice! \nIslands is a fresh take on set collection and drafting game\nUsing dice stacking, move around neutral dice (representing land). During each turn, you will draft one set of cards. How many cards you take dictates how far you can move a die. A single card from the cards you took is kept, to help establish the end-drafting.\nA fresh take on dice stacking and coral themed games\nWe absolutely love dice stacking games such as Blueprints and coral themed games like Reef, but both Coral and Islands are highly interactive takes on these mechanics/themes. There is no \"take that\" and both games are family-friendly.\nHigh Replayability\nCoral and Islands come with more cards than you'll use each game. In Coral, different shape cards are used depending on the experience levels of the players per game, while in Islands, using only 3 of the 6 rule breaking specialists ensures each game is played completely differently from the last.\nSolo mode for Coral\nCoral (but not Islands) has a solo mode! You will play against \"Nature\". See the solo mode below for more details!\nIf you previously backed Dice Hospital, you can* receive The Inspector - a specialist promo card for Dice Hospital for free with your pledge! Importantly, please read how to receive this with your pledge below...\nIt features a new one-time only ability and Sabrina Miramon has captured the likeness of Tom Vasel for the upcoming Dice Tower Kickstarter campaign. This is a special thank you to everyone who backed that previous project. For those who bought Dice Hospital through other means (or who don't wish to back this project) the promo card will be available for sale in the future. Alternatively, if you bought Dice Hospital not via the Kickstarter or our website, you can share this campaign on social media and we will add it to your pledge for free too! Again you will need to message us please :)\n*If you backed Dice Hospital, please send us a direct message via this campaign to ensure you get this promo card; otherwise it is not guaranteed.\n*Please note, that the final number of cards in the Coral mini expansion is still TBC.\nShape-creation in 3D space\nEvery placement matters. \n\nYou will have to consider every angle, perhaps walking around or at least looking from other sides to consider other perspectives - literally!\nReal interaction on a shared board\nYou are 'growing' shapes not only using your own dice, but also other players'. Each die you place could be a blocking move, or - if you're not careful - could actually help someone else grow a high-scoring shape!  \n'Fish tokens' mitigate luck and give you extra turns!\n Fish tokens, collected throughout the game, let you mitigate some of the minor luck in the game.\n\nFish tokens allow you to change your dice, or place both dice at once.  Used judiciously, they reward skilful play!\nA feeling of growth and accomplishment\nBy the end, you've all made a beautiful coral reef, using the translucent dice!\nA complex puzzle in a short playtime\nEvery turn is a thoughtful puzzle. Can you make a shape immediately? Can you make progress towards a larger shape? Is it worth using your fish to place an extra die? \nThe entire game, once you've played a few times, takes about 10 minutes per player. Even including teaching time, a first game with 4 players is usually over within an hour - meaning you can play it a 2nd time, or fit it in at the end of an evening.\nA new way of thinking\nMovement can quickly change what colour a given pile will be allocated to.  It's all about keeping your options open and keeping an eye on what everyone else is doing. \n6 unique rule-breaking 'specialists' for varied games\nThere are 3 piles of land cards you can choose from. Each is tied to one specialists power. \nAn fresh take on drafting\nNormally when you draft in games you take the card and use them immediately or later. In Islands that is still the case, but the cards you discard have an impact on how far you can move the dice. By having land cards underneath specialists (and therefore activating their ability when taken) it can make the difference between a good move, and great move.\nEach is wildly different, so the 20 different setups all feel unique.\nThanks to Polyderon Collider for this awesome gif!\nYou have 2 dice to potentially place. Dice can only cover lower numbers, but 1's are wild.\nYou can spend fish tokens before you place a die to add/subtract 1 from its value, gamble by rerolling it, or even place two dice on the same turn!\nCollect a card if the die that you place lets you complete a shape! You've earned those points!\nYou get a fish if you didn't manage to make a shape. If you were the first to play on a fish square or you bring a stack to the maximum height, you get another fish.\nFinish your turn by rolling new dice so you have 2 ready for your next turn\nAt the end of the game, add up all the values of your shape cards and whoever has the highest total is the winner!\nClick to download the basic rulebook for Coral!\nClick here to land on the page with the Coral PnP!\n*Please note in this video Tom unfortunately should receive a fish token every time he does not score a card (in addition to reaching the highest level of a stack  (3) and landing on fish tokens). This is by far the most normal way to receive fish, and would have made his game much easier to mitigate. \nThanks to Polyderon Collider for this awesome image of \"final game-state\"!\nChoose a pile of cards. \nKeep 1 in a personal area. This affects this turn's movement and final scoring.\nMove a die. The colour of the card you kept determines what colour of die you can choose. Increase its value. \nThe number of cards in the pile determines how far it can move. Dice move over other dice of lower numbers.\nSpecialists let you break rules in various ways.\nThat's all you do on a turn!\nAt the end of a game, look at each colour 1-by-1. Whoever kept the most cards of a colour keeps the tallest piles with that colour on top. Take all the dice in a pile!\nWhoever has the most dice is the winner!\nClick to download the basic rulebook for Islands!\nClick here to land on the page with the Islands PnP!\n\nThe Deluxe edition contains extra mini-expansions for Coral (but not Islands)\nIf you are easily able to visualise the shapes, add the 3D module straight away! \n\nIt's a bit trickier to 'see', and rewards you for exploring the 3rd dimension. It also means that the final boards look even prettier, as it leads to more intertwined shapes.\nThe live coral expansion is all about the coral on the top of each stack! \n\nYou will be rewarded for making shapes or using particular numbers when viewing the board from above, regardless of what the height of each stack is. We are thoroughly exploring this idea and taking it in 2 directions - the fast flowing module is all about quick objectives that sit alongside your usual target shapes and replace a couple of them. \n\nThe deep module offers you far more points per card, but these patterns might take you most of the game to set up. \n\nWe are still making last-minute changes to this expansion. You will see preview cards and full rules in due course.\nWe are finalising the solo mode for Coral. You take turns as normal, whilst 'nature' continues to grow. Nature has no objectives, but simply helps and hinders you as it will.\nYou are trying to make all the shapes selected when you begin. With a few different challenges, this will be a fun way to play with the framework of the game when alone.\nRules will be freely available soon.\nCoral's solo mode is compatible with the 3D shapes expansion but there is no solo mode for Islands.\nFor written reviews scroll down to the written reviews section below!\n*The deluxe edition is Kickstarter exclusive for 6months after being sent to backers! We will however, continue to allow pre-orders on our website, and sell it directly at conventions (once backers have received their copies). \nTo save on shipping costs you can order our other established games to come with your copy of Coral Islands. \nPlease note, we will NOT be using a pledge manager for this campaign, but we can still take orders/pre-orders after the campaign.\nWelcome to Dinoworld, Pocket Pharma and Pocket Sub listed below are the deluxe editions.\nRuthless - a pirate-themed deck-building game. (\u00a323/$29) \nPocket Pharma - a pharmaceutical themed drafting game. (\u00a321/$27) \nPocket Sub - an abstract strategy game of nautical warfare.

If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 10 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates. \nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment, so we can offer shipping within UK/USA at no additional cost!\nCosts elsewhere are shown in the approximate local currency. To double check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the tier and select your country.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nWe do not charge additional shipping after the kickstarter! You will not have to pay anything more!\nTransparency guarantee\nWith every game we have kickstarted, we kept backers informed of all the problems, issues, and - of course - good news as we get the games finished, manufactured and sent to your door. This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we aim for an update twice a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we are in turn delaying the retail launch to put our backers first. Coral Island's deluxe version will not be in general retail until backers have had it for many months. Backers are always our priority.\nWorld class manufacturing\nThis is a dice game and we taking steps to ensure we have good quality, beautifully translucent dice. For this project, we are considering Longpack, who manufactured Dice Hospital for us. Given we are using \"standard components\" we don't anticipate there being any issues during manufacturing, but sometimes things do happen.\nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via Royal Mail. If Brexit happens and free trade is no longer possible between UK and EU, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nFebruary: KS completes, Chinese New Year \nMarch: Submit Files to manufacturer \nApril: Manufacturing\nMay: Shipping from China to the UK begins \nMid-late June: Arrives in ports \nEarly July: Fulfilment commences \nAugust: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction.

We are a capable and knowledgeable company. Customer service has always been our number one priority.\n\nBrexit is a new potential obstacle that we might have to deal with. Worst case scenario, we will have WTO terms for import/export with EU and customs will become an issue. ACG does have the cash reserves to absorb the potential extra cost of the game and - worst case scenario - we will send several cases of the game back into EU.\n\nWe have worked out a plan to hopefully send the games to EU backers before Brexit, but this can't be guaranteed. If we do get the games as planned, EU backers will be sent games earlier.\n\nWe will be selling the games at UKGE - but only if backers can get their games first, or at worst, pick up their games at the UKGE.\n\nWe are a very open company and welcome feedback, suggestions and comments either publicly or privately!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Sea Pen Tier", "descp": "Retailers - back here!\nMessage us for the rates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "Blue Coral Tier", "descp": "Get Coral Islands the base game!\n- Includes all stretch goals!\nShipping:\nUK: Free, USA: $4, CA/EU1: \u20ac5/$8\nROW: Please check your country in the dropbox\nAdd-ons (with free shipping included!)\n- Ruthless: Add \u00a323/$29\n- Pocket Pharma: Add \u00a321/$27\n- Pocket Sub: Add \u00a316/$21\n- Welcome to DinoWorld: Add \u00a329/$37\nPlease note add-ons will come together with your pledge in October!

We hope you\u2019ll come along for the ride!\nThe Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and fun game of keeping up with an ever-changing piece of music, played by a variety of characters on a variety of characterful instruments from the world of The Forest Dragon.\nThe musicians gather at crossroads and campfires across the forest. They produce their instruments, tune up and begin to play! They play tunes both weird and wonderful, with many a twang and bang from their array of amazing musical implements. As the tunes get faster and more complicated, the musicians wrestle to keep up and challenge each others\u2019 musical ability.\nWith amazing art from Rory, Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!\nThe Forest Dragon centres around 3 special cards. On one side they have \u201cBang\u201d and on the other, they have \u201cTwang\u201d.\nThere\u2019s also a deck of 24 other cards, from which players draw a hand of 2 cards. Players must try to match the sequence shown on those special \u201criff\u201d cards with the cards in their hand. They can flip one of the riff cards, or they can move one of them. If they can match a riff they \"bank\" that card. Or they can play a special card that has special effects. \nA round of play takes around ten minutes, and play moves around the table nice and fast!\n\nWe\u2019ve made the game so there\u2019s almost always something to do on your turn, so no one gets left out. And for younger players, you can just play along and have an enjoyable time. For older players though, there\u2019s a lot more strategy - remembering who has \u201cbanked\u201d what card, and deciding which of the possible moves is the best one on your turn adds a lot more depth.\nThere are 8 special cards in the Bang & Twang deck, and these cards form \u201cthe tune\u201d. If you want to change the tune for the next game, you can take out those 8 special cards, and replace them with a different set! This makes gameplay really varied!\nBang & Twang features 6 sets of special cards - 6 \u201ctunes\u201d, and totals 67 cards in the box!\nYou can download a print and play version of Bang & Twang right now! It doesn\u2019t have art - we\u2019ve kept it very simple for home printing, but you can try out the first \u201ctune\u201d, absolutely free! Download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/\nIn 2016 we Kickstarted our first game together. The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9 proved to be a huge success. We raised way more support than we expected, and doubled the size of the game through the campaign! It was an amazing ride!\nThe Forest Dragon was created by Rory when he was 7. He\u2019d been thinking about games, and described the whole thing in pretty much one breath. We wrote it down and slowly over a couple of years turned it into a playable game. And with your help on Kickstarter we made it into a reality. You can buy our first game in selected stores and on line.\nClearly, this isn't really just about making another game. I want my kids, Rory and Ben to continue to learn about hard work, games design, probability, art, layout, writing rules, product design, costings and all kinds of things that are good to learn about. \nMaking a game with them has been a way to show them a creative path, and how the whole world around them is someone's idea put into practice. With this second game, we\u2019re learning about sticking with something, persistence, and all the trials and pitfalls of making that second game. Can we do it? We think so!\nI really want to show the boys the reality of how games get made, and all the different processes involved. With Bang & Twang, we\u2019re learning about what it means to make an \u201cintellectual property\u201d and how we approach a line of games, rather than just one game. \nOur first game was made with print on demand technology that let us order one game for each person that backed us. This time we\u2019d like to try to go one further and make a full print run of the game, and get it deeper into more shops around the world! If we fund, it means we\u2019ll make the game through print on demand once again. And we\u2019ll be very happy with that. But if we can reach some of our stretch goals, we\u2019ll be able to make a more fancy box, and do a whole print run, which will be a big learn for the boys! (Dad has made many such boxed games in his day job, so you\u2019re in safe hands!)\nTo help build towards our goal we had some great Add-Ons. These are extra things you can pledge for. If you decide you\u2019d like an Add-On, then up your pledge by the appropriate amount. You can pledge for them before they are unlocked if you wish - that will help them get unlocked.\n\nIf we do manage to unlock some of these Add-Ons we\u2019ll make some new pledge levels that include them too, for your convenience.\n\nAll prices include shipping.\nBang & Twang Badge Set Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nYou\u2019ll get a cool selection of exclusive Forest Dragon goodies! 4 Forest Dragon badges, a cool round sticker, and a square fridge magnet!\n\nThe Forest Dragon By Rory Add \u00a317 to your pledge\nThis is the game that started it all. The price includes shipping.\nThe Forest Dragon Expansion Box Add \u00a317 to your pledge\n A selection of amazing expansions to the original Forest Dragon game! Includes The Poo Cave, Dogs and Stuff, Robo Realm, Fire Dragon Realm, Quest Givers!\n\nOriginal Game Double Up! Add \u00a330 to your pledge\nBoth the original Forest Dragon by Rory game AND the Expansion Box\nBang & Twang Play Mat LOCKED Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! A neoprene play mat that makes a lovely space to hold the riff cards and the draw deck. It\u2019s 13 inches square making it large enough to use the coasters on too! It\u2019s like a mouse mat but bigger and cooler!\nBang & Twang Coasters Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! These are adorable! Replace the Riff cards you get in your Bang & Twang Box with a set of 3 Bang & Twang Coasters! \nBang & Twang Coins Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! The Bang & Twang coins are something very special - a strictly limited edition set of real metal coins, with gorgeous enamel colours - green on one side, orange on the other. Made by the coin experts at Campaign Coins these are really amazing. They come in a set of three, and are perfect to replace the riff cards in the Bang & Twang box for the fanciest game imaginable!\nBurp & Fart LOCKED Add \u00a315 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! This is basically disgusting. One of our playtesters who is old enough to know better suggested the whole game could be re-skinned as \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d. This will feature the adorable \u201cGreedy Boys\u201d characters sat in a ditch, holding a burping and farting contest. If we unlock this stretch goal we\u2019ll make a whole new base game available as an Add-On. It will have the same rules, but all new, deeply ill-mannered card art. \nWARNING: Will contain pictures of burps and farts drawn by giddy children.\nMany of our fans are friends and family who don't know much about Kickstarter. Thanks for making it this far! We love you!\nKickstarter is a website that allows project creators with an idea to pitch that idea to the audience of the Internet. There's usually a product at the heart of a Kickstarter campaign. In this case, it's the Bang & Twang game. \nIf people like the idea they can pledge money to the project. If enough money is pledged in order to meet the campaign's funding goal by the end, the money is collected from your card by Kickstarter, they take a cut, and the rest is passed on to the creator. And the project is made a reality. If we don\u2019t raise enough pledges no one gets charged. And we go away to think very hard about what we did wrong. \nTo encourage and thank supporters, or \"backers\" as they are known, we are offering a range of Rewards and Add-Ons. These start out at the game itself, and you can get more stuff like artwork, your own expansions and more!\nAnother encouragement to spread the word and convince others to join in, are Stretch Goals. These are milestones which unlock extra rewards. Sometimes they allow backers to buy something new, by upping their pledge. Other times they add something to existing rewards for free. \n\nThroughout the period of the campaign, you can amend your pledge up and down as you see fit. Only once the campaign ends is the amount you pay locked in. So it pays to keep an eye on progress, and pledge for everything you'd like!\nIf you have any questions at all, please drop me (Jon) a line via PM, email, text or whatever method suits you best, and I\u2019ll do my best to explain how to back us! Don\u2019t be shy, we understand that Kickstarter can be daunting if you\u2019ve never used it.\nTo pledge to our campaign you need to hit the Pledge button. You'll sign up to an account, decide how much you'd like to pledge, select what kind of reward you'd like - you can choose to just give to the campaign out of kindness, or you can select what you'd like to receive for your support. We'd love you to have a copy of the game.\nYou can throw in whatever you like above the basic pledge levels - there aren't fixed amounts you have to give.\nYou'll provide some payment details and, if enough people chose to support us, at the end of the campaign your card will be charged. The project creators get in touch a short time after that to collect any additional information they might need.\nFollowing a Kickstarter campaign is a lot of fun. A community of supporters is created, who can all share their excitement and support in the comments section, as well as ask questions or make requests of the project. You'll also receive updates throughout the campaign either here or by email.\nFor our second campaign we\u2019re playing it very safe - the whole of the base game is done. 5 additional Expansions are completely made. With children helping to make the core reward we needed to know they'd be able to finish the project. And they have. We just need money for printing and shipping it to you. We are not spending any time after the campaign on further development, testing or art for the core game. It\u2019s done. This does mean we won\u2019t go much beyond 5 additional expansions, but we feel that\u2019s the best and most honest way to do things. We have not yet completed work on the art and graphics for \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d but should we be lucky enough to unlock that stretch goal we\u2019ll get it done as soon as possible! It won\u2019t take long.\nStretch goals are each unlocked as we reach their milestone in our funding level. If we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ll reveal more as the campaign progresses!\n\u00a31500 This is our basic goal. At this level, we\u2019ll make a print on demand version of the game in a nice tuck box and send it to you with our thanks. \nWe\u2019ll reveal more stretch goals if we do well!\nPraise for the Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it, here are some thoughts about our first game, The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9: \n\"The Forest Dragon is a precious thing, an experience Jon Hodgson and his son Rory will treasure for years to come. And it\u2019s a fine game to boot! We\u2019re so lucky they decided to share it with us.\" - Francesco Nepitello, game designer\n\u201cThe Forest Dragon is as indispensable as wet wipes and snacks, and occupies a permanent place in my 'leaving the house with the kids' bag.\u201d - Gareth Ryder Hanrahan, author, game designer \n\"If you\u2019ve ever experienced wonder while wandering and exploring, the Forest Dragon contains that excitement in a conveniently-carried, child-friendly card game.\" - Jacob Rodgers, game designer\n\u201cIt's very easy to pick up and play the game, with enough depth in the game to keep kids of all ages entertained. At its heart, there's a marvelous whimsical adventure, which had my pair (an 8 and 11-year-old) coming back for more. I knew I was onto a winner when they were picking up the cards and having games without me :) \u201d - Newt Newport, game designer\n\u201cThe most nutritious cardgame I have ever eaten!\u201d - Patric G\u00f6tz, game publisher \n\"Our Forest Dragon card game has (literally) been to the base of Mount Doom and to Hobbiton, entertained plenty of adults and children along the trek and is an absolute joy to play.\" - Scott Purdy, artist\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good game because it was written by a kid; it\u2019s a good game because it\u2019s a good game.\u201d - Jared Earle, writer, photographer\n\u201cIt's an awesome game which my kids love playing! Especially when they beat me at it!\u201d - Gordon Kennedy, game artist\n\n\"With its bright colors, fun illustrations, and easy rules, The Forest Dragon became a fast favorite in our house. It is quick enough to learn to hold my children's attention and fun enough to appeal to adults as well.\" - August Hahn, game designer\n\n\"This game is amazing. I like stealing items from my family, especially my brother. We usually play with the whole pack to make the game really long and exciting, and my favourite bit is the Poo Portal!\" - Milla aged 7.\n\"Both enchanting and hilarious, this simple-but-fun card game is already a favourite in our house. The artwork is delightful. The Poo Cave Expansion is essential. We've played it with small people and with my eighty-year-old parents. It's a winner with everyone. Gutted we missed out on Clarinetto.\" - Claire Longhurst, gamer\n\n\"So good I wrote a review of it\"  - Pookie, game reviewer\n\n\"It\u2019s funny and my wife likes it\" - Adam Littlefield, musician\n\n\"I\u2019ve so far only played it with adults, but they all loved it (and it wasn\u2019t too complicated for them) \ud83d\ude42\" Andrew Peregrine, game designer\n\n\"Fantastic game. My kids have racked up over 200 hours playing this game. A family favourite that never get old! Highly recommended.\" - Wayne McNamara, gamer\n\n\"Such a simple game and great fun to play. That said, I\u2019ve yet to win a game against my eight year old and his friends!\" -Tom Cusworth, gamer\n\"The Forest Dragon is a great game. Attractive to look at, simple enough to play as soon as the box is open, but with enough variety to repay any number of repeat plays. And the monsters are very cool.\" - Matt Cambridge, writer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve successfully made our first game and delivered it to people all around the world. \n\nWe're keeping things very simple.

Everything will be ready to start printing at the end of the campaign. \n\nLike every kickstarter creator, we\u2019re a bit worried about shipping - the price of moving stuff around the world can change a LOT in a short time. We hope we've done our sums right.\n\nWhere we print the game will depend on how well we do. If we fund at a lower level it will be printed in the UK. If we manage to unlock the fancier version it will be printed in Europe, and dispatched worldwide from the UK.\n\nWe want to deliver in a timely fashion, using processes we understand, even if that means a lower final figure.

Each time you play, you'll have to consider a new set of abilities and ways to score.\nPlayable with 150 players!!!***\nBy using a central pool of visitor cards, Light Mode can be played with a ridiculous number of players! Theoretically, you could use the 150 sheets of paper included to run a massive event at a convention!\nOr, if that's not enough, use 2 boxes for 300 players.\n*** - Final number depends on the arrangement with the manufacturer as it may be 150 double sided sheets (light vs danger mode) or two 75 sheet pads of paper for each mode.\nA complex spatial puzzle \nEvery square of your park is a valuable resource. Enclosures must be accessible to visitors. Each path you build should lead directly somewhere. Generators can be cleverly used for multiple enclosures! Special buildings make you think even more carefully about where your pens are. Every placement is critical!\nROLL the dice\nUse each die to draw one of 3 things: paths, a special building, or a dinosaur pen!\nPaths let you connect everything together. In DinoWorld, rather than using whole dice values, you use the pips. So to draw two straights and a T you need two pips for the straights, and another two pips for the T!\nSpecial buildings are different each game and offer you different ways to score!\nDinosaur pens are one of the main way you get points! Draw your fences, make sure you have the required number of generator connections, and then simply draw in your dinosaur! You just need to make sure you have a path leading into each of your new dinosaurs by the end of each round.\nAt the end of each turn, check if you've managed to complete any of the visitor cards next to you! If you have, you take those cards! You'll score them at the end of the game, and you've just denied points to your neighbour!\nThat's it! Ater 9 turns, the game is over. Hopefully, you'll have drawn a beautiful park where visitors can go to see exciting dinosaur clones!\nIn danger mode, the dinosaurs might break free! This time introducing a damage tracker, and a power outage phase.\nFor each dinosaur pen you build, the risk increases. Herbivores increase your threat by one, carnivores are doubly risky!\nYou can use security to mitigate the danger, but risky play (not using security) does have potential reward...\nAt the end of each round, roll the danger dice! Add your threat level, subtract your security and see if any pens are straining the generators too much! If they are, the pens will be damaged and be closer to a break-out!\nDanger mode also adds a variety of public use laboratories, which will give you different ways to mitigate the rules each game, for a limited use per type of lab.\nIn the deluxe and expanded edition of the game, it contains 2 new mini expansions and cards for an automa.\nNotably, this edition will not be available for general retail until 6 months after copies have been sent to backers! We will however may still sell it directly at conventions such as GenCon, UKGE and Essen and our own website.\nAquatic expansion\nFirst, we have the aquatic expansion (3 cards), which lets you fill that lake! The aquatic expansion has fixed numbers for the dinosaurs which are randomised at the beginning of each game. Each card dictates which dice spread is required to build a certain dinosaurs, so some cards may only allow one type of dinosaur to be built with one type of value on the dice, while other cards will allow an even spread of dice for all dinosaurs. \nThese dinosaurs are scored using a set collection mechanic, with the same, and different dinosaurs scoring (almost) exponentially.\nAviary expansions\nNext, we have the aviaries! Choose from a wide selection of awkward and fixed shapes that you will play with each game. Flying dinosaurs breed, so place them early enough that they can be filled! (Final card count 15-20 depending on final playtesting during the campaign)\nAutoma deck for solo players\nThe 1p Automa lets you play solitaire in a brand new way, making some binary decisions for an AI that competes with you for visitors and points. More details below....\nHow does the automa play?\nDesigned by automa creation specialist: David Turczi and further refined by Nick Shaw, you will play against a \"normal\" or \"hard\" automa. The automa has it's own deck with 16 double use cards. 12 can be used with the core game, while 4 can be added if used in conjunction with the aviary and aquatic expansions. The automa also uses an extra die so that each round you will be rolling 4 dice, allocating one to the automa, and the final 3 to yourself. \nHow does it work?\nThe automa will have one card drawn from the automa deck at the beginning of each turn. The card will be double use, with each side giving instructions of what the automa would do (and therefore score), if you choose that side. The side you choose will be dependent on the die you allocate to the automa - hence starving yourself of a particular value, and potentially gifting the automa valuable points if allocated without careful consideration.\nHow does it score?\nThe automa scores by using a set collection mechanic of units written on the cards themselves such as special buildings, dinosaurs and in hard mode, the security and generators. The trick is to allocate a die to the automa with careful consideration!\nA german version of the rulebook has been translated, while a french one is in the works. We hope to offer multiple languages through the Boardgamegeek page soon\n *The deluxe edition will not be available for retail purchase for 6 months after backers get their copies. We will however allow late pledges to allow those late to the party, to get this edition, right until we start shipping them out. So if most backers have received their copies in June, the deluxe edition will only be available the following January. Please note, Retailers who back this campaign directly, will also be treated as kickstarter backers - so there may be a small number of retailers who sell the deluxe version of the game.\nTo save on shipping costs you can order our popular and previous games: \nRuthless - a pirate themed deckbuilding game (\u00a323/$29)\nPocket Pharma - a pharmaceutical themed drafting game (\u00a321/$27)\nPocket Sub - an abstract strategy game of nautical warfare (\u00a316/$21)\nTo add these on, please use our pledge manager when it opens\nThe Pocket games mentioned above are the deluxe editions\nDice Hospital may be available in the future as an add-on, but will be available soon through all good FLGS's. \nAdditionally, we are likely to offer extra pads for people to purchase, again in the pledge manager. We think it'll be around \u00a36-8 if purchased along with a game through kickstarter/pledge manager. \nPlay along with Tom Heath by using the basic print and play files we've supplied!\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 10 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates. \nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment, so we can offer shipping within UK/USA at no additional cost!\n\nCosts elsewhere are shown in the approximate local currency. To double check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the tier and select your country. \nDue to previous shipping issues we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia). \nWe do not charge additional shipping after the kickstarter! You will not have to pay anything more!\nTransparency guarantee\nWith every game we have kickstarted, we kept backers informed of all the problems, issues, and - of course - good news as we get the games finished, manufactured and sent to your door. This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we try to do an update twice a week during a campaign, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over.\nGet it before retail\nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time or even early! Dice Hospital was held up at customs and faced a few manufacturing issues, but we are in turn delaying the retail launch to put our backers first. Backers are always our priority. \nWorld class manufacturing\nFor this project, we are considering Longpack, who we have worked with several times in the past. We are also considering established Polish manufacturers (Trefl and Axel), who might be able to print and deliver the game in only 6 weeks. Ultimately, it will depend on the exact number of backers, and how many we print.\nShipment and Fulfilment\nWe will be shipping most - if not all - the games from our UK Alley Cat Games HQ via Royal Mail. If Brexit has happened before the games are ready to be shipped, we will send some games to EU to be fulfilled from within. As such, the game should be customs-friendly for all EU and UK backers.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nmid-December: Submit Files to manufacturer \nJanuary: Manufacturing\nFebruary: Chinese New Year\nearly-mid March: Shipping from China to the UK begins\nMid-late April: Arrives in ports\nEarly May: Fulfilment commences \nlate May: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies. \nIf we do decide to use a Polish manufacturer, our timeline will be as follows:\nDecember: extra time for tweaks\nJanuary: Submit Files to manufacturer \nearly February: Manufacturing  \nearly March: Shipping from Poland to the UK \nmid-March: Fulfilment commences \nlate March: EU Fulfilment completed. \nearly May: fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always put a worst case scenario on our tiers - as delays can happen.\nThis game has had the attention of a talented team lavished upon it. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always with our campaigns, we cannot prevent \"god like\" failures such as thunderstorm, hurricanes etc.\n\nWe can promise you though that we will do everything in our power to keep everyone updated, and will stick to the original plan if at all possible.\n\nWe have lots of previous experience running projects. We are a capable and knowledgeable company. Customer service has always been our number one priority.\n\nBrexit is a new potential obstacle that we might have to deal with. Worst case scenario, we will have WTO terms for import/export with EU and customs will become an issue. ACG does have the cash reserves to absorb the potential extra cost of the game and - worst case scenario - we will send several cases of the game back into EU. \n\nWe have worked out a plan to hopefully send the games to EU backers before Brexit, but this can't be guaranteed. If we do get the games as planned, EU backers will be sent games earlier.\n\nWe will be selling the games at UKGE - but only if backers can get their games first, or at worst, pick up their games at the UKGE.\n\nWe are a very open company and welcome feedback, suggestions and comments either publically or privately!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Probing Protoceratops (RETAILER OPTION)", "descp": "- For retailers to back here for retailer rates.\n- Please message us for retailer rates.\n- Non-retailers can back here to stay informed.\n- A big thank you from us!\nINCLUDES:\nOur sincere thanks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["120 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "Velociraptor Value", "descp": "- Full game plus all stretch goals\n- Free shipping to UK/USA!\n- Subsidised shipping elsewhere\nAppx: $27, \u20ac24, AUS$38, CAD$36\nPlease select your country for more detailed shipping costs outside UK/USA, or see the shipping section.\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome to DinoWorld full game\nAll stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a329 or more", "title": "Tremendous Tyrannosaurus rex", "descp": "- Full game plus all stretch goals\n- Expansion pack with aquatic expansion, aviary expansion, 1p automa mode.\n- Free shipping to UK/USA, subsidised shipping elsewhere\n- We will not sell this version to distributors/retailers for 6 months after backers receive their copies, although we may still sell it directly at conventions and our website\nAppx: $37, \u20ac33, AUS$52, CAD$49\nPlease select your country for more detailed shipping costs outside UK/USA, or see the shipping section.\nINCLUDES:\nWelcome to DinoWorld full game\nAll stretch goals\nAviary expansion\nAquatic expansion\n1-player automa mode\n6 months exclusivity after release", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,941 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to DinoWorld shipped!", "update_content": "We've just shipped all NON-UK orders!\nAfter shipping domestic (UK) orders last week, we've now shipped all international (non-UK) orders.

PLEASE NOTE MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED.\nMonumental is a massive board game for 1 to 4 players where you\u2019ll compete with your opponents to lead your prestigious civilization through the ages.\nThe game starts with the Classic era (antiquity), will cross the Medieval times to end up in the Modern industrial age. Through all these ages, you\u2019ll have to assemble your military forces to conquer new territories, focus on scientific research to enhance your civilization\u2019s abilities, build breathtaking wonders to harness their unique advantages, and develop your cultural policies to guide your people to victory. The fate of your civilization is upon you!\nEach civilization has its own deck of cards with cultural specificities, as well as an army to explore and conquer the provinces on the board. On each turn, you\u2019ll be able to draw and activate cards, combining their effects to develop your civilization and conquer the world. But you\u2019re not alone in this race, as your opponents will try and outrun you as soon as they can. A game of Monumental plays over different eras, each of them featuring new cards to acquire and use. At the very beginning of the game, you control a small town in some remote country that nobody has ever heard of. Yet by the end of the game, thanks to the many cards that you will acquire, all will admire your monumental city, the jewel of a glorious nation!\nAs war is inevitable, you\u2019ll need to lead your troops to combat when necessary. Fight the barbarians or protohistoric Free Cities to loot their resources, then wage war against your opponents! Each civilization comes with 14 army units - either nicely illustrated tokens (Classic edition) or finely sculpted unique miniatures (Deluxe edition) that you\u2019ll be able to deploy on a richly illustrated modular game board to take control of the world. On the other side of your army, send your explorers to crawl new provinces, exploit new resources or even obtain new ones from various marketplaces in order to reinforce your city production capacity and speed up your evolution. Not a warmonger? Then maybe focus on Knowledge to enhance your cards\u2019 abilities and gain more resources. Build Libraries, Laboratories, Colleges and other scientific buildings to educate your people. Then use this Knowledge to gain powerful cards that will allow you to do more actions in a single turn. Another solution would be to focus on Culture: various actions you take in the game will develop the culture of your empire, which in turn allows you to deploy special Cultural Policies with permanent advantages.\nAnd of course, what would be a civilization without its wonders? The Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, the Great Wall\u2026 all have powerful in-game effects that will allow your empire to rise to glory. Building wonders is another way to assert your dominance over your opponents in Monumental, and a great way to show your greatness to the world.\nThe path to glory will not be simple. You need to find the proper balance between all these possibilities to achieve victory\u2026 and this will take time. But after all, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day!\nEach Civilization comes with a set of cards comprising common buildings along with a unique building and knowledge card. The basic buildings of your city will give you the basic resources: the fort will provide Military, the Library will provide Science and the Work Camp will provide Production.\nA unique Knowledge card as well as 5 Cultural Policies complete the cultural distinction between civilizations. A Warlord card, working along with the corresponding unit on the board, also gives a unique and special conquest power to their owner.\nKnowledge cards that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them.\nIn Monumental, the cards that you will buy and activate in your city are the key to victory. You must find the proper balance between the different types of cards, as each of them will give you special advantages. Managing your deck and anticipating the cards to come will also give you the upper hand over your opponents.\nAs the game progresses through its 3 ages (Classic \u2013 Medieval \u2013 Modern times), so does history allowing you to acquire several types of more and more powerful cards: Buildings to bring you more resources and some occasional special abilities, Knowledges that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them, Wonders which are very expensive but very powerful (and very rewarding as victory points) and, to finish with, Cultural Policies cards which can be activated thanks to culture points given by other type of cards and which will give you powerful passive permanent advantages.\nCITY AND CROSS-TAPING\nBefore the first turn, you randomly draw 9 cards from your deck (out of 14 at the beginning of the game) and place them on the table in a square of 3x3 cards: this is your city for the first turn. Over the course of the game, your city will evolve. You\u2019ll start with basic buildings with limited interaction, but by the end of the game, your city will be full of advanced buildings, breathtaking wonders, and top-notch Knowledge.\nHowever, even if there are 9 cards in your city, you can only activate 5 of them on each turn. This will lead to difficult choices, as all cards can be useful. Your citizens cannot work all the time though, and you need to allow them to rest.\nThis unique gaming mechanic is called CROSS-TAPPING. To activate your cards, you choose a line and a column in your city, and activate (tap) the cards from this line and column (5 cards out of 9). You can choose any line and any column; you simply cannot choose two lines or two columns.\nThis innovative mechanic introduces a whole new way of programing and using the cards of your deck turn after turn as optimization and combos are the heart of the game.\nEXPLORATION AND CONQUEST\nDeveloping your city and your empire will require you to gather resources and to conquer new territories.\nThe territories of Monumental are called Provinces. The modular game board gives the basic setup of each game. This setup will be different whether you use one of the pre-defined scenarios (made for a certain number of players) or one of the scenarios you create.\nAt the beginning of the game, the provinces are all to discover and are occupied by independent barbarian tribes or ancient Free Cities. You\u2019ll have to move your army (thanks to your military points) to conquer them. The conquest mechanism is very simple: one military point allow you to move one unit \u2013 you need to move at least the same number of military units as the defense value of the province (a number given by the terrain difficulty + the existing inhabitants resistance). Each conquered province gives you victory points at the end of the game but it also gives you more required space to build your wonders.\nThe Provinces also contains various resources depending on them. Sometimes you may recruit some workers (as a production token) and sometimes you may end up in a Maketplace (such as Babylon or Rome) where you will be able to grab new resources to bring to your city in order to enhance your future turns capacity of development. All these resources are only opened to your Explorers who moves thanks to military points too but who never take part in any battle.\nTurn after turns your realm will become bigger and bigger, your knowledge and culture stronger and your buildings and wonders more and more impressive.\nDesigned to be extremely modular, Monumental is implementing on one side the power and depth of a deckbuilding system which loads the game with hundreds of potential combos and on the other side the flexibility of a modular game board which allows the players to create an infinity of new scenarios, all of this to bring on the table a game that is super easy to learn but hard to master thanks to an important learning curve and which will grant dozens and dozens of hours of renewed playing pleasure!\nPlease note that we are currently working on the graphic layout of the rules. However, you may already access the prototype PDF file which is absolutely not what the final files layout will be ;). Please note also that, despite the fact that these rules have been thoroughly tested, they may still evolve during the campaign tweaking and fine tuning process.\nPlease click on the pic to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\n                    My name is Matthew Dunstan, and I\u2019m a research scientist and game designer based in Cambridge, UK. I started designing games about 8 years ago, when I was still living in Australia, and to date I have had 11 published designs. Monumental is my second game with Funforge following the release of Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time last year. Monumental is a fitting title for the game, considering it is the most ambitious of my designs to date!\nWhile the origin of Monumental isn\u2019t as old as the Pyramids or Stonehenge, it is still one with many twists and turns, a journey that started over 4 years ago. At the heart of Monumental is a new mechanic I call \u2018cross-tapping\u2019, where you deal cards from your deck into a 3 x 3 grid, and you choose 1 row and 1 column of cards to use on your turn. In this very simple system, you already have all the tools for some very satisfying combos, and every turn you are presented with engaging and interesting decisions.\nI was intrigued by deck-building games, which are interesting by the fact of them offering a random selection of cards from your deck each turn, and then you have to make the most of what you have been dealt. But the interest is not really in the playing of the cards \u2013 once you have a hand your choice of actions is mostly automatic. I wanted this feeling of getting a new set of opportunities each turn, but with some juicy decisions as to how to use these opportunities. What do you need to do right now, and what can wait until later? Do you pull off a small combo now, or wait and hope for something even better? Hopefully this tension and excitement permeates through Monumental from its core mechanism.\nFunforge has done an amazing job bringing my design to life, immersing you in the world of mighty armies, feats of technological advancement and towering wonders. The choices you make in Monumental will ultimately tell the tale of your civilization...what will you be remembered for?\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/monumental\nPledge levels will be available in English or French. You\u2019ll have to choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager, after the campaign completion.\nWe will also deliver Digital only versions (pdf files) in the following languages: German, Polish and Spanish. Please note that these digital files are not yet available and will be provided somewhere between the end of the KS campaign and the delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais. Vous devrez choisir la langue de votre pledge dans le Pledge Manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne.\nNous fournirons \u00e9galement des fichiers uniquement digitaux (pdf) dans les langues suivantes : Allemand, Polonais et Espagnol. Notez que ces fichiers ne sont pas encore disponibles et seront fournis entre la fin de la campagne KS et la livraison des jeux.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign completion.\nWe will collect all information through the Pledge Manager in order to dispatch your pledge to the most accurate of our international shipping hubs.\nHere are the initial estimates for the shipping costs depending on your area of living. Please, keep in mind that these costs may rise depending on the evolution of the campaign (unlocked stretch goals which will increase the weight of the parcel) and on the potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\nUSA: 12-15\u20ac to most states, 40\u20ac to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\nEUROPE: 12\u20ac to France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. 15-20\u20ac to the rest of the UE countries. 20-25\u20ac to the non UE-countries.\nCANADA: 20\u20ac to most cities\nLATIN AMERICA: 45-80\u20ac to most countries.\nASIA: 15\u20ac to China and Hong Kong. 20-30\u20ac to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: 20-30\u20ac to Australia. 35\u20ac to New Zealand.\nFRENCH TERRITORIES: 40\u20ac to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nREST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): 80-100\u20ac to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or custom fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you). As a reminder, if your country is listed into the Friendly shipping badges, you would have no import fees to pay.\nThe decision of making this project a Kickstarter exclusive is the result of a long and precise thinking.\nIn short, we had the choice of offering a \u00ab regular \u00bb game at a \u00ab regular \u00bb price or a fantastic game at a fair price.\nWe decided to go for the second option as we believe that this game deserves the best from our publishing efforts. Notably we have put a lot of hard work for months into the testing process but most and foremost into the production works, hiring dozens of stellar artists to turn each of the card artwork into a masterpiece. This is also true regarding the mini pre-production process for which we aimed to fantastic sculptures and unique (and expensive) design choices. These are just some examples of our commitment into making MONUMENTAL a unique experience for you.\nWe are used to publish games for ten years now and we know fairly well the distribution network and how it works. Should we choose to let this game go to the regular network, it would have been financially unsustainable for us because of the cascading margins of the classic distribution scheme.\nGame Designer: Matthew Dunstan\nPublisher: Funforge\nArt Direction: Philippe Nouhra\nArtworks: Paul Mafayon, Georges \"Gorg\" Bouchelaghem, Fajareka Setiawan, Agri Karuniawan, Asep Ariyanto, Maerel Hibadita, Tey Bartolome, Justine Cruz, Wyn Lacabra, Raph Lomotan, Brian Valeza, Chang-Wei Chen, Andreas Rocha, Marco Gorlei, Hendry Iwanaga, Philippe Nouhra, Charles-Victorien Kaing, Grafit Studio, Ivan Sevic, Roman Tishenin, Piotr Dura, Eugenia Firs, Jordan Albro, Orion Vang, Esmail Zalat, Uros Sljivic, Heng Tang, Tomislav Jagnjic, Alisher Mirzoev, Tuan Nguyen, Alexandre Mokhov, Martin Mottet\nLead sculptor: Charles-Victorien Kaing\nAdditional sculptors: Alfonso Gonso, Nicolas Pessina, Gregory Krasnoperov, Raul Garcia Latorre\nTranslator & rules editing: Antoine Prono, Gersende Cheylan, Claude Amardeil\nPublisher Testing: Philippe Nouhra, Antoine Prono, Claude Amardeil, Thomas Baggi-Sani, Charlotte Noailles, Gersende Cheylan\nLead Community Manager: Charlotte Noailles\nAdditional Community Managers: Claude, Brett, Valentin\nTabletopia integration: Thomas Baggi-Sani\nFunforge would like to express special thanks to David Preti and R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e, you guys are the best! ;)\nFunforge social networks\nOfficial FB page: @MONUMENTALboardgame\nFunforge FB page: @Funforge\nTwitter: @funforge\nInstagram: @funforge\nTo spread the word!

Snacks and drinks are out. Everyone's excited for game night. The new hotness was just set down on the table. The atmosphere is electric. But there's one problem: The shrink wrap is still on the game. You know no one has read the rules. What now? Someone draws the short straw and becomes the one rule-reader to lead them all. An hour later, maybe you're playing. More likely, you've gone back to your group's old faithful. Perhaps you'll get to that new game next time.\n None of us like that situation, but we all experience it far too often. That's why we're creating Dized, the premiere tabletop companion app that will bring tons of helpful content to your gaming sessions. To begin, we're launching with Tutorials and Rules. \n Dized's fully-voiced, interactive Tutorials are able to react to what's happening in your game, so you can learn as you go, turn by turn. Dized acts like the friend that already knows what to do, introducing a game's rules on a need-to-know basis while adapting to the actions of the people at the table.\n If the need arises to refresh your memory, Dized's Rules have you covered. Dized Rules are like fast, searchable FAQs able to respond to all the questions you might have. Gone are the frustrating times where you find yourself endlessly flipping through the rulebook or scrolling through forums searching for a \"quick answer.\" And if something isn't covered, the publisher of the game can be notified and respond in a blink. No game night will be complete without Dized. And with Dized, no game night will ever be the same.\nIt's also important for us to note that Dized will be able to offer content in multiple languages, starting with French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian, Finnish, and Dutch!\nDized is designed to handle every type of game you bring to the table, including highly-strategic board games, family-friendly experiences, tabletop miniature games, collectible card games, chess, Bridge, and so much more.\nWe're giving you a look into the future with Dized Early Access, open to everyone right now. Anyone with an iOS or Android device can experience interactive Tutorials and Rules for the 2017 Spiel des Jahres winner Kingdomino, and interactive Tutorials for award-winning designer Eric Lang's Blood Rage and 2017 Kinderspiel des Jahres Winner ICECOOL. Those are just a taste of what's to come, so check back throughout the Kickstarter for additional content. Please note: the publisher FAQ notification feature is still in development and not part of early access at this time.\n                                    Based on feedback and conversations we\u2019ve had with gamers, families, education experts and others, one topic stands out: everyone learns and plays games at their own pace. There is a desire to use Dized in a way that works best for them according to their gaming experience, with fewer or more details throughout the interactive Tutorials.\nThrough the success of this campaign, we can address this need by incorporating learning algorithms directly into our Tutorial engine. We call this feature Adaptive Profiles. Your profile will learn the types of games you like and understand your level of gaming experience to better deliver custom learning experiences to you table. It ensures every player is on the same level, so everyone can focus on playing the game and enjoying their friends at the table.\nPublishers are on board with how Dized is changing the rules of learning and playing games. Feedback from Early Access tells us players are much more willing to try a new game if they can learn it through Dized. Even better, that leads to adding the game to their collections. That's why so many publishers you know and love are ready to get their games on Dized, which means the library is going to explode with new content.\nWe're happy to say that the Rules Creation Tool is now available for publishers and content-creators! The Dized Rules for a game can be completed in a very short time using this tool. We're also deep into development of the Tutorial Creation Tool (expected to release in 2019) that will do exactly what the name suggests: make Tutorial creation easy and fast.\nPublishers, sign up for the tools here!\nContent-Creators, sign up here!\nCreating the initial content for Dized Early Access took months per title, but we learned a lot about the type of Tools we needed to create. Without sacrificing quality, the Content Creation Tools will dramatically reduce production time for everyone using them and won't require a team of tech experts to use them! With our team, publishers and content-creators using the Content Creation Tools, you can expect the Dized library to expand fast and furious.\nCredits are exclusive to our crowdfunding backers. They will be used to acquire game packs or monthly subscriptions to the Dized service at deeply discounted rates. (See the chart below for details on what\u2019s included in each.) No matter the price of a game pack, 1 Credit will always cover it! Subscription rates are estimated to be $4.99 per month or $49 for a year, so using a Credit will always be the best value. For example, the Champion Pledge Level Credits could be used for 2.5 years of subscription at the price of 1 year. As an early supporter, we want to ensure you\u2019re getting an amazing value. Please note that the Credits system will be implemented as development continues, so it is currently not part of the app.\nSome of the hottest publishers working with us have produced unique promo items for a variety of games. If you back at the Champion Pledge Level, you'll receive:\n We've got some great stretch goals lined up for you, check them out!\n Check out what community members have been saying at different shows we've visited:\nWe've also heard from several industry members, including publishers, distributors and more:\nRead the full review here!\n                                Read the full review here!\n               Read the full review here!\nRead the full review here!\nBack to us for a moment. The Dized team is a passionate group of board gamers, developers, and artists. Based in Helsinki, Finland, but with team members all over the world, we've spent our careers working on several cool board games, tabletop RPGs, video games, and more.\n We also have an incredible group of shareholders. In fact, after our initial pitch a couple of years ago, industry veterans became immediately interested, including the amazing Eric Lang, who became one of our first investors.\nFor Our Previous Crowdfunding Supporters!\nIf you supported Dized during our Indiegogo, we salute you! Without you, Dized wouldn\u2019t be at this next great step in development. The Kickstarter does not impact the delivery of your digital and physical rewards, and no action is required by you. If you choose to support the Kickstarter, the new Reward Credits will stack with your previous ones. Whether you pledge to this Kickstarter or not, we appreciate the immense support you\u2019ve already shown. We'd also love (and be very grateful) for you to help us spread the word about Dized by sharing this campaign with anyone who missed out before. Let's welcome new fans to our amazing community!\nSo Why Kickstarter?\nWe decided to bring Dized to the Kickstarter community for a couple reasons:\nThe reach Kickstarter gives us as a startup company is invaluable. We have an amazing base of supporters already, but the larger the community the better. This includes our awesome Dized users along with publishers. The more people who know about and use Dized means more content!\nOur team is amazingly talented, but scaling up production and introducing features like the adaptive profiles takes time, money, and a larger team (Want to join? Check here!). Achieving a successful Kickstarter will ensure increased support after the campaign, including: New Dized Users; More Publishers; Government Funding; And Much More.\nWe'll be shipping all promo items from our hub in China. Shipping all over the world is $4. Additional shipping may applied through BackerKit if you add additional pledges when the project is funded.\nFor this campaign, we are using BackerKit, an amazing third-party service that assists in ensuring your rewards are well managed! You will confirm your shipping and email addresses are correct through their system to receive your physical and digital rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSoftware Development\n\nDeveloping software, especially something like Dized that has never been done before, is incredibly challenging. Timelines shift, staffing changes, and unexpected costs and delays arise. While we do our best to mitigate any of these issues, the unfortunate truth of developing software is that it is difficult to foresee every possible roadblock. We fully believe in our ability to deliver on this project, as is evident by our Early Access already being available, but timelines may shift despite our best efforts.\n\nPhysical Delivery of Promos\n\nWe're always in touch with the publishers that are working with us on the promos. While we're carefully planning production and delivery so that everything goes smoothly, something might be delayed by the factory or during transportation. Luckily, all of our partners have an excellent track record with logistics, so everything we can do to avoid issues is already being taken into account.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dized\n2 created \u00b7 36 backed\nDized is a platform for everything digital that improves your board game experiences: tutorials, up-to-date rules, exclusive content...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "GUARDIAN", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCredit - Can be redeemed for a game pack or subscription month\nGuardian Badge - In-app profile badge showing your support!\nAll Non-Promo Stretch Goals Unlocked During The Campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["111 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "ADVENTURER", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n15\u00d7 Credits - Can be redeemed for game packs or subscription months\nAdventurer Badge - In-app profile badge showing your support!\nAll Non-Promo Stretch Goals Unlocked During The Campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "CHAMPION", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n30\u00d7 Credits - Can be redeemed for game packs or subscription months\nGame Promos\nChampion Badge - In-app profile badge showing your support!\nAll Stretch Goals Unlocked During The Campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["239 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Dized Kickstarter Relaunching Today!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Dized Kickstarter is relaunching!", "update_content": "We have plenty of big news since our last update!\nKickstarter Relaunch on Monday the 10th\nGoal #1: New Content Published Daily\nGoal #2: More Information\nGoal #3: Previous Campaign\u2019s physical rewards shipped\nLet\u2019s make this happen!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Dized and Crowdfunding blog post is up!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone,\nWe are back from the very successful Spiel 2018 expo held in Essen, Germany.

This is a turbulent time, with bandits lurking in the wilds of the countryside, and pirates roaming the high seas. Evil taints the hearts of men, and many give in to temptation. Many, but not all. Against this tide of corruption stands Solomon Kane. This mortal hero fights his lone crusade, aided by the silent might of the immortal Virtues. Together they fight against the implacable Darkness. This is the fearless opponent who tries to thwart our hero at every turn, and who must be overcome by the players if Solomon Kane is to emerge victorious.\nDarkness has emissaries too, and these Shadows are also attracted by Solomon Kane\u2019s faith. Shadows are not physical beings \u2013 they are the essence of the nameless horror that hides just out of sight, the lurking danger you think you glimpse from the corner of your eye, or the secret dread that sends shivers down your spine. This can drive lesser men to madness, and even Solomon Kane could be overwhelmed, for whilst his faith is strong, Darkness is powerful too. Solomon Kane can see neither Virtue nor Shadow, yet he can feel both, and he has his faith. This tells him that Good must triumph over Evil. It is up to the Virtues to ensure that he is right.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\u201cSolomon Kane\u2026 considered himself the fulfiller of God\u2019s judgment, a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe central figure in the game is Solomon Kane himself. He is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs who roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest. All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa \u2013 even to the shores of the distant New World of America.\nSpace Marine (Warhammer 40K), Warrior (Rising Sun), Vampire (Solomon Kane), Conan (Conan), Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane), Leonidas (Mythic Battles), Bandit (Solomon Kane), Khorne Warrior and Stormcast Eternals (Shadespire)\nHe neither knows nor questions why he is driven to do this. It simply must be done. To Solomon Kane, he is doing God\u2019s work. To his enemies he is a relentless fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon. At least, it does when the Virtues are on his side.\n\u201cHow I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe Solomon Kane core box comes with 4 complete Adventures: one each in 1 Act, two in 2 Acts, and one in 3 Acts. These stories are the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, Death's Black Riders, and the Blue Flame of Vengeance - all based on original tales from Robert E Howard. We unlocked three 1 Act original stories, the Witchfinder General, L'Ogre and Beast of Bordeaux. With 10 Chapters per Act, this gives you 110 Chapters to explore, about 60 hours to play these stories once, and many, many hours of replay value.\nWe have many stretch goals planned for this Kickstarter campaign, adding new miniatures, Adventures, and other surprises. All stretch goals that we unlock during this campaign will be added FREE to every Puritan pledge, and every additional copy of the core box you pledge for.\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOALS\nThe Puritan Pledge contains many, many hours of game play, and stretch goals add even more. However, if you\u2019re enjoying Solomon Kane we will be revealing some additional content during the campaign that you may want to add to your pledge. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n(To find more about All-in bundles, click here)\nRED SHADOWS\nTHE ART BOOK OF SOLOMON\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n(To find more about this expansion, click here)\nHEART OF AFRICA\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAGAINST THE VAMPIRES\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAMERICA - THE NEW WORLD\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nEach player takes the part of one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with a special combination of abilities that reflect their unique role. Together they must help Solomon Kane achieve his mission.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nCourage\nCourage is bold and sometimes reckless. She cannot sit idly by, and encourages Solomon to resolve everything with action!

She helps the other Virtues as well as Solomon, providing vital support to both.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nJustice\nJustice is willing to listen to both sides.

Her speciality is exploring the environment, and avoiding nasty surprises.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\"The battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell. \"\n Allied Mortals\nSolomon Kane is a loner, and only begrudgingly accepts the aid of others in his quest. However, when others need his aid he is quick to come to their assistance, and this means that his Adventures against the Darkness sometimes include companions. \nN'Longa is not included in the Core Box. But you will see him soon!\nN'Longa and Solomon Kane, blood brothers\n Solomon Kane\u2019s only regular companion is N\u2019longa \u2013 a self-styled \u201cmighty worker of nameless magic\u201d. Despite their significant differences in outlook, they get along perfectly, saving each other from death on more than one occasion. It is hard to say which one of them relies more on the other. \nJack is a hot-headed, somewhat naive, but well-meaning young man, whose main goal is to protect Mary and her honour. He falls in with Solomon Kane when the Puritan comes to his rescue.\nMary is the archetypical damsel in distress. If Jack can't save her, then Solomon Kane will always be ready to protect any innocent in peril.  \nThe wrong place at the wrong time, that\u2019s the best way to describe the unfortunate traveller. He really should have waited for daylight to cross that moor\u2026\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n Darkness is the natural opponent of Light. It is a combination of all the secret, unsavoury feelings and deeds which men are capable of. It lurks in the blackness, moulding the essence of the night into its minions, and sending them to plague the mortal world.\nShadows  \nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nThe main servants of Darkness are the mist-like Shadows. They are not really creatures at all, more embodiments of a terrifying idea. One that can drive mortals to insanity and death.\nMortals  \nThrough his many Adventures, Solomon Kane encounters a wide variety of misguided, malevolent, or just plain evil individuals who all do Darkness\u2019 bidding \u2013 whether they realise it or not. These range from simple thugs, through cannibal tribesmen, to otherworldly and magical creatures. Solomon Kane must overcome them all.    \nSolomon Kane and Jack Hollinster ready to confront Fishhawk and his pirates\n Latest Rules Playthrough - The Blue Flame of Vengeance - 3rd July\nPlease note that components and rules used in this video are not final and are subject to change.\nSolomon Kane\u2019s lifelong fight against Darkness is told in a series of Adventures, based on the stories and characters created by Robert E. Howard. Adventures are broken down into 1-5 Acts, depending on their length. Each Act is itself broken down into 8-10 Chapters. A gaming session will typically be a single Act, or part of one. Depending on the time you have available, you may play through a whole Act, or be able to complete only a few of its Chapters. If this is the case, you simply use the game\u2019s save function to remember where you have got to, and you can return to complete the rest of the Adventure another day.\nChapter 1 - \"Skulls in the stars\"\nWhen you play through an Act, you naturally start with the first Chapter. One player reads the narrative text aloud and follows the instructions on the card. The players then do their best to help Solomon Kane overcome whatever challenges the Chapter throws his way, and then they move onto the next one.\nEach Virtue Turn, the controlling player rolls their Fate dice to see what resources they have available to pay for actions. These dice can be donated to other players, or saved for later Turns, as well as buying actions immediately, and deciding how to coordinate these actions and share these resources between the players is a big part of the game. Solomon Kane takes the concept of cooperation very much to heart, and the players need to be discussing and working together throughout the game. Even when it is not your Turn you are involved in vital decisions.\nAllocating dice during your turn\nAfter each player\u2019s Virtue Turn comes a Darkness Turn. This is where the AI deck acts to thwart the players and destroy Solomon Kane. It can move its minions on the board, trigger unpleasant events, or simply sap the will of the mortals to carry on.\nThe Act continues with the players resolving one Chapter card after another, with their Adventure unfolding as they do. After many trials and obstacles, a final Chapter card will tell the players whether their actions have been enough to achieve victory, and whether they have won or lost. Solomon Kane is a pure co-op game, and players either all win together, or all lose together.\nCARDS\nSolomon Kane uses a number of different card types to tell the stories. These are:  \nChapter Cards  \nThese tell the steps in the story. Each Chapter number has a number of different options represented by different cards, some easier to complete, some near-impossible. This is a little bit like going through a choose-your-own adventure book, but instead of simply picking what you want to do, the players have to achieve a particular effect with their actions to decide what happens next. \n(To find more about Chapters, click here)\nChapter cards come in two main types: Story and Scene. A Story Chapter contains the next piece of the tale to read aloud. A Scene Chapter contains the map layout, miniatures, and objectives to play it out on the board.\nDarkness Cards \nThe Darkness deck is what drives the player\u2019s opponent. Each card is divided into several sections, each applying in a different circumstance. This allows the AI to be flexible and to react differently to each situation. Using them is simple: just flip the top card of the deck at the start of each Darkness Turn and do what it says.    \nEvent Cards  \nWhen a Shadow triggers an Event, the next card in this deck is revealed. This is usually bad, though not always. Occasionally the Light shines through the Darkness and a brief reprieve is granted to Solomon Kane and his companions.   \nVirtue Cards\nEach Virtue has their own unique 10-card deck of Virtue cards. These cards list the possible actions for that Virtue, together with the cost in Fate dice to perform each one. In principle, any Virtue can do any action, though only some of the actions will be available at any one time. During the game, players must carefully manage their decks, ensuring that their active cards give them the most useful range of options for the task at hand, and work well alongside those of their companions.\nDiscovery Cards  \nThere are many secrets in Solomon Kane, and whilst the Adventures are based on Robert E. Howard\u2019s tales, they have been greatly expanded. Where Solomon chose one path in the original works he now has a choice. That is, the players collectively have a choice to decide, by their actions, which path to take. Discovery cards hide many of the possible outcomes from the players, and keep the elements of tension and surprise: you must decide before you know for sure what will happen next. This means that even if you have played the Adventure before, there will be fresh elements each time. \n(To find more about Discovery cards, click here)\nMAP TILES\n Each Scene Chapter has a map, made up of 1 or more of the many double-sided tiles from the box. Maps vary in size and shape, each offering a unique puzzle for the players to unpick. \nFATE DICE\n Each Turn, a player rolls 3 Fate Dice to see what energies are available. The fate dice show Bravery, Determination, Fear, Pain, and (of course) Faith.\nEach of the Virtue cards has a number of slots for these resources, and the action on that card can be bought by filling those slots with matching results on the Fate dice. The ability to save some rolled dice for future Turns, and donate much-needed resources to other players makes for a lively discussion. What is the best thing to do?  \nDASHBOARDS\nVirtues\nEach player has a dashboard for the Virtue they are playing. These are all different. They include unique actions, effects of the Virtue\u2019s aura, and spaces for reserved and donated dice.  \nCourage Virtue dashboard with attached Virtue cards\nAdventure track\nThere are four game values that are tracked throughout the game. Three of these are measures of Solomon Kane\u2019s abilities: Strength, Clarity, and Compassion. Each of these is linked to a specific type of test: Strength to Fighting, Clarity to Exploring, and Compassion to Talking. As the game progresses, these tracks may rise and fall. In addition, there is a fourth track: Danger. This monitors the overall Danger of the situation. The more it rises, the more perilous the situation gets.\nEach of the Virtues is linked to one of these tracks. Their actions will often draw upon it, and in the process can lower or increase its value. However, these tracks apply to every Virtue. Even if it is Courage who is most tied to the Strength track, all Fight tests triggered by any Virtue will apply its modifier to them. So, whilst each Virtue looks after its own track, their management of it will impact every player, requiring them to work together.\nMINIATURES\nSame scale, different sizes!\nSolomon Kane includes a huge selection of beautiful 35mm scale miniatures, ranging from the man himself, through dastardly foes and innocent bystanders, to the towering Virtues who aid him. Although nominally 35mm (the height of an average man), the miniatures are all different sizes depending on the individual they represent. This gives us a range from 27mm tall children to the 90mm tall Virtues. Each miniature is a carefully-sculpted masterpiece, full of character. To further enhance this, and to give the painters among our backers even more to enjoy, each sculpt also has its own unique scenic base.\nEach model has its own unique scenic base!\n KANE'S CRUSADE\nThe Mythic Games Ambassador Programme has over 30 Ambassadors across six countries who tirelessly share out games with board game communities. We have already hosted over 60 events and demonstrations while also attending major conventions such as Cannes and UKGE. We have over 50 more events planned already which you can find listed on our Facebook page including attending Paris est Ludique, Origins, Gen Con and Essen SPIEL.\nSeveral hundred public demos organised for Kane's Crusade\nSolomon Kane is a simple fellow, and to reflect this we have only a single core pledge level: the Puritan.\nHowever, we also believe in rewarding our most loyal fans, and those who believe in us the most. For this reason, backers who pledge for Solomon Kane in the first 24 hours have the option of a Puritan pledge with an extra Early Bird bonus!   \nIf you are a board game retailer and are interested in Solomon Kane, please click here. \nPour d\u00e9couvrir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici\nAll pledge levels are available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language you prefer in the pledge manager, after the campaign. This campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations.

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect your address information via our pledge manager, after the campaign ends. The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard core pledge of Solomon Kane. This is based on the costs for our last campaign and the assumption that the final weight will be comparable. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. If the game is significantly lighter than Joan of Arc, then some of the higher end costs may drop.  \n\nUSA: $32\nCANADA: $35\nEUROPE (EU): $32-$40\nEUROPE (non-EU): $40-$65\nLATIN AMERICA: $100-$150\nOCEANIA: $40 to Australia. $80 to New-Zealand\nASIA: $40-$70\nREST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $100-$150\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible. For this reason, rewards are sent to all backers (including any retail backers) at the same time. Due to the unpredictability of the postal services we cannot guarantee the order in which they arrive.  \n\n\nThis is the latest Mythic Games team photo we could find.

Producing thousands of complex products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than originally planned, and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is currently on schedule to hit its planned date. We are confident that Solomon Kane will deliver on time too. \n\nThat brings us to communications: we think they are very important. During this campaign we will post at least one update every day. Afterwards, we will continue to keep you regularly updated with all the latest info in our famous weekly \u201cWhat\u2019s up Wednesday\u201d updates. This means that you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s going on in the adventurous world of Solomon Kane!\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \n\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \n\nIf you apply for a refund more that 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\n\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \n\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\n\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign.

Today, you\u2019re being sent out beyond the safety of its walls on a journey into the uncharted Wilds. There\u2019s a dozen survivors for every mouth the Fortress can feed. It\u2019s time to earn your place within its walls once and for all. \nIn Posthuman Saga you'll be venturing into a weird and wonderful world where unknown threats await at every turn of the road. You'll need to forage for food, ammo and weapons if you want to survive. You'll desperately fight off human and mutant enemies in brutal brawls in which your weapons break and your wounds can lead to mutation. You'll meet a cast of strange and memorable characters and find yourself in unexpected situations during story encounters, which force you to make choices that might have consequences down the line. But don't linger long - you need to complete your mission before others do! Your reputation is at stake!\nPosthuman Saga is a competitive, tactical survival adventure set in the post-apocalyptic world of Posthuman for 1 to 4 players. The game can be played in 3 modes: Solo, 2 to 4 players Competitive or Team Versus; where 2 teams of 2 players, each sharing a map, compete for the favour of the Fortress. It combines euro mechanics with finely crafted story to create an experience that will challenge your system-busting skills while immersing you in a rich post-apocalyptic world.  (For a short overview see Gameplay Overview below).\nKey Features\nStories that blend the grit of post-apocalyptic survival with the quirks of human (and mutant!) nature.\nMechanics that are tightly coupled with theme creating an immersive experience. \nModular map tiles and a variety of decks create a sandbox experience where no two games are alike.  \n3 Game modes: Solo, 2-4 Competitive and Team Versus.\nEach Hero has their own starting items and sets of development cards allowing for a variety of possible builds for each character, that suit different playing styles and winning strategies. \nDeep world building and lore that evolve through the various analogue and digital games set in the Posthuman world.\n\nTo win you\u2019ll need to earn reputation points by exploring a map made up of modular tiles and completing Mission Objectives before other players do...\n...and score Recon Objectives made up of sequences of Scavenge Sites.\nGain map tiles through Map actions and bidding in the Broadcast event. \nEach turn you will secretly select one of four Actions to play.\n While exploring you\u2019ll face story encounters\u2026\n\u2026and combat Encounters. In melee combat you perform the following steps:\n1) If you use a weapon discard a durability token then select one combat card and draw another one at random. (The selected one will exhaust after combat). \n2) The enemy rolls combat dice and adds their Combat results.\n 3) Players then resolve the results on the Combat tracker.\n But above all... try to survive out there! \n                                                                                                                                                                      Now also includes:\nand...\nand...\nPosthuman Saga: Exclusive Deluxe Edition\nNow also includes:\n and...\nand...\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion continues the overarching story presented in the Base Game taking you deeper into the Wilds to track down Mutant Slave Trains carrying human captives and following them to a Mutant Stronghold.\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion adds several new mechanics to the Posthuman Saga Base game along with new ways of scoring and winning the game. Resistance also adds a lot of new content, including 2 new Characters, new Followers, new Mission Objectives, new Event cards and the new Veteran Mutant die as well as a new deck of Level 3 Encounters including over 30 stories. \n      \n    To add one or more Add-ons to your pledge, just add the ammount listed on the add-on(s) to your pledge ammount.

We have learnt a lot from past titles and continue our process of improving our game design, art, product design and component quality. We had a few hiccups in the past with printers and fulfilment partners not living up to our expectations, so we have stopped working with them. Moreover, we are now working with partners that come highly recommended, from our ever-growing network of Kickstarter creator veterans with whom we share knowledge on a regular basis.\n\nWe now have a great manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \n\nPosthuman Saga has been tested by 8 groups in the US, Europe and Asia. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter to test the final content and then, finally, yet another wave of blind testers will be brought in to blind test the rulebook and the finished product. We are also working with two developers, Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Dinosaur Island, Wasteland Express Delivery Service) and Jonathan Harrington (Vengeance) to ensure that the game is as polished as can be when it goes to print.\n\nHaving said all the above there are always things that can come up that will be beyond our control.

You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\nFantastic Factories is a dice placement, engine building tabletop game for 1 to 5 players and takes 45 to 60 minutes to play. Players build a set of factories into their compound and then roll dice to use as workers. With over 35 different blueprints, you can discover endless inventive and creative ways your factories can work together. \nDifferent factories have different worker requirements. Some require a pair of matching dice. Some require a specific value. You aren't stuck with what you roll, though. With training facilities you can manipulate the values of your dice in order to figure out the optimal placement of all your workers! Each turn is a satisfying puzzle to solve. \nThere are over 35 unique buildings!\n                                                                             28 dice (16mm) (4 red, 4 blue, 4 green, 4 yellow, 4 purple, and 8 white)\n50 energy resource tokens\n30 metal* resource tokens (*clarification: represents metal resources in the game but made out of chipboard)\n85 goods tokens\n4 tool label tokens\n78 blueprint cards\n18 contractor cards\n1 first player token\n5 player boards and player aids\n Fantastic Factories comes with over 40 unique blueprint and contractor cards, ensuring each game is a fresh and new experience with lots of replayability.\nPromo Cards\nPledge now to receive 4 bonus blueprints and 1 bonus contractor!\nKickstarter backers will also receive 5 promotional cards FREE! After the Kickstarter campaign these cards will only be available at conventions or through other exceptional means. \nPlease note that the art and components are not completely finalized and may change slightly.\nIn Fantastic Factories, your goal is to build the most prestigious buildings and manufacture the most goods. Players start with 4 blueprints and some resources (1 metal, 2 energy). Players also have 4 colored dice that act as their workers.\nMarket Phase\nEach round begins with the market phase. On your turn you either select a face-up blueprint to add into your hand for free or discard a card to hire the corresponding contractor. Contractors have unique effects that allow you do things such as roll additional dice or gain resources. \nTake a blueprint or hire a contractor.\nOnce all players have taken a turn, the work phase begins. \nExample of some contractors you can hire.\nWork Phase\nDuring the work phase players take their turns simultaneously. You start by rolling your dice. Then you can take various actions in any order. \nYou can place your workers on a set of basic actions to gain more resources or draw cards:\nBasic actions let you draw cards and gain resources.\nYou can build cards by discarding another card with the same tool symbol and paying the resource cost: \nBuilding a Nuclear Plant.\nAnd finally you can activate your cards (yes, even on the same turn you built it!). Training facilities help you get the correct value workers to run your factories. \nSequencing your actions correctly can allow you to maximize your turn!\nOnce all players are finished with their turns, the round is complete, and another one begins with the market phase again. If any players have manufactured 12 or more goods or have built 10 or more cards, the following round is the final round.\nSolo Game\nFantastic Factories supports playing solo. You still get to build awesome combinations of factories and strategize where best to place your workers. The only difference is you will be competing against a simple but efficient opponent known as \"The Machine\". The Machine is easily managed and guided by dice rolls and can be adjusted for varying levels of challenge. More details can be found in the rulebook. \nFantastic Factories is that perfect mix of approachability and strategic depth. The mechanics and rules are simple but the creative combinations of factories and numerous ways you can manipulate your dice make each game feel new and fresh. We've played the game more than 300 times, and we still enjoy playing it. \nWith simultaneous play, each game takes an hour or less so you know you'll be able to get it to the table time and time again and even play games back to back. With so many viable strategies to pursue, you'll be exploring the depths of Fantastic Factories for many games.\nSome of you may be waiting for the game to hit retail stores instead of pledging now. We would love to be in retail but getting the attention of distributors largely depends on the success of the Kickstarter campaign. There is a very real possibility that Fantastic Factories may never be available at retail outside of retailers who choose to back the Kickstarter. We know there's always risk in backing a Kickstarter so as a thanks for joining us on this journey, we've priced the pledge levels below our anticipated MSRP and are also including promo cards that will not be widely available through retailers that receive the game through distribution.\nRetailers\nInterested retailers should back at the retailer pledge level. We plan on charging standard retailer pricing and delivering the games well before normal distribution (if we even end up with a distributor). After you pledge, we will reach out with details about pricing. If you choose not to purchase for any reason we can refund your deposit pledge. Beyond the initial pledge there is no money due until just before fulfillment at which time you can specify your desired quantity and we will invoice you. The MSRP of the game will be $40. If you are a retailer and have any questions you can send us an email at retail@fantasticfactories.com.\nCheck out this 3 player full playthrough by JonGetsGames: \nYou can also see Jambalaya go through the first few rounds of a SOLO game:\nFantastic Factories is available on both Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia.

You can find the latest rulebook here. \nWhat are stretch goals? Meeting our funding goal allows us to place an order with our manufacturer for the minimum order quantity. However, the more quantity we order, the cheaper it is to manufacture each individual copy. We reinvest these savings into upgrading the components of the game. That means the more funding we receive, the better the game will be for you! Sharing this project with people you know helps us improve the game.\nPlease note that our stretch goals for the game itself are component upgrades ONLY. We do not believe in additional content or gameplay as stretch goals because we have thoroughly play tested the game with all the content that we believe is necessary for a balanced game and the best possible gameplay experience. No more. No less.\nDigital Puzzle Book Stretch Goal\nWe'd like to release a printable PDF that includes a curated selection of One Turn Puzzles and solutions.\nOn July 6, if there are 50 or more puzzles on the BGG forum AND 200 or more thumbs up collectively on the puzzles, we will release a PDF puzzle book complete with final art and layout. We will also credit each puzzle creator in this book. There are already 10+ puzzles and 20+ thumbs up in the forum right now.\nBut there are only a few short days before the campaign ends! That's why we are extending the deadline of this stretch goal to July 6th. That's still only a short week and a half away so don't wait too long to get involved.\nWhen we were selected for the PAX South Indie Showcase in January 2017, we were faced with a conundrum. How could we possibly demo our 1 hour game to the masses on the show floor of PAX?\nAnd that's how we came up with the Puzzles. They are literally snapshots of a single turn in Fantastic Factories, taken at the moment right after you've rolled your dice. The challenge is the same as your final turn in the full game: make as many points as possible, given these dice, resources, and buildings in your compound.\nHere are a couple of them, see if you can figure them out!\nInstructions: Manufacture as many Goods as possible by assigning the dice (with values as shown). Each building card has an ability on its bottom half that you may use, but you may not use the same building twice.\n(Note: you can ignore the build costs in the top left corner of the cards. These cards have been pre-built for you)\nAn Introductory Puzzle\nDojo flips a die to its opposite side. Warehouse requires 3 dice, and those dice must sum to 14 or more.\nSee solution.\nAnother Puzzle!\nManufacture as many goods as possible!\n See solution.\nSolve More Puzzles, and Create Your Own!\nDiscover (and try to solve) more puzzles on our forum on Board Game Geek (some of them are challenging).\nAlso, check out this post to find out how you can create and share your own Fantastic Factories One Turn Puzzle for others to try to solve!\nIf enough people submit puzzles by July 6, then Joseph and I will put together a printable PDF of the best puzzles (with solutions) so you can bring them to game night!

They have a great reputation as experts in shipping and will be assisting us with coordinating shipping games across the world. As a result, shipping will be EU, AUS, and CAN friendly with no additional VAT being charged separately to backers. \nShipping is one of the most expensive parts of bringing a Kickstarter game to life. We estimate that shipping within the US will cost $12 per game, but we wanted to subsidize the shipping and split the cost with our backers. That means US backers will only be charged $6 for shipping for a single copy and we will cover the other $6. For non-US backers, we will still subsidize the shipping costs for $6 but the shipping cost to backers will vary by region. To see the shipping cost to your region, select the pledge level and then select your region.\nTwo Pack Bundle\nWe know that even with the subsidy that shipping can still be a lot. That's why we are also offering a pledge level for 2-game bundles at a significantly lower shipping price per game. For example a 2-game bundle being shipped to the EU would save you $11.\n3+ Copies\nIf you want to order more than 2 copies of Fantastic Factories, you can select the Two-Pack Bundle pledge and pledge an additional amount:\nFor Continental US/EU/Norway/Canada/AUS/China you should pledge for the Two-Pack Bundle and then add an additional $31 for each extra copy you want (this amount includes the additional shipping). \nFor Alaska/Hawaii, add $37 per extra copy.\nFor Puerto Rico, add $36 per extra copy.\nFor New Zealand, add $36 per extra copy. \nFor Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan, add $33 per extra copy. \nAnd for the rest of the world, add $40 per extra copy. \nWe are not offering any group buy discounts outside of the shipping savings.\nFor example, if you live in Belgium, the Two-Pack Bundle is $56 plus $15 shipping (total of $71). If you would like 4 copies of the game, you would add $31 for each additional copy so your pledge should be for a total of $133.\nIf you are currently pledged at the Retailer pledge level but are not a retailer, please switch your pledge to the Two-Pack Bundle and adjust your pledge amount for the quantity you want.\nWho are we?

But there's potentially more we can do: Essen? a podcast? live playthroughs? Check out the stretch goal section to see what we're going for next and comment in the update post to have a say in what the next one should be!\nHi everyone, I\u2019m Tom. For the last two and a bit years, I\u2019ve been making videos where I play through and talk about as many board games as I possibly can, and I'd love to keep doing that for another year! The channel is entirely independent, and funded by the viewers, and I need your help to keep it that way. Put plainly, the channel can't continue without funding. But if we're carrying on, it wouldn't hurt to add even more content, right?\nYou can find my channel at youtube.com/c/slickerdrips, and if you'd like to see the kind of videos I make, here's one of my playthrough playlists:\nOr to get a quick list of the kind of games I love, here's my top 10 games of 2017:\nI love making these videos. It's fantastic to be able to talk so much about the hobby I love, and at the same time I hope to give you an idea of how these games play all the way through. At the moment I'm coming up to 200 different games covered on the channel, and to give you some idea here's what the last year of videos looks like:\nIt was very tempting to keep going past the year mark to fill up that last row\nAnd then on top of the playthroughs I make preview videos of games I'm interested in for conventions like Essen Spiel and the UK Games Expo, of which I also make the huge geeklist of games, appear on the Gaming Rules! podcast, try to spread the word about as many upcoming games as I can, and sometimes I do things like this which I can't really explain:\nLast year I raised \u00a32,500 in my first campaign, and thanks to this funding from the viewers, I was able to not just carry on but increase the number of videos in the last year. Now a bigger obstacle has emerged - time! For over two years now, I've been spending almost all of my evenings and weekends making these videos. Again, I love doing it, but at the same time there is no time to spare to take it any further, or even sustain it as it is now. That's where I'm hoping you come in.\nThe channel is completely independent, entirely funded by the viewers. I don't turn on YouTube ads and I've never accepted money from publishers to make any of the videos. I think this is an important thing to keep, and with your support I can keep making these videos independently. \nThe money raised in this campaign will still absolutely contribute to the buying of games to keep featuring the latest and greatest games on the channel, but this time it will also give me the time I need to keep going - and after that, maybe we can talk about equipment, static cameras, podcasts, more Rachel?\nBaked in to the funding goal of the channel are extra things I've been wanting to do but just haven't had the time to film like:\nGames of the Week - this was a monthly show I did where I talked about all the new games I'd found out about that month, quickly talk about the new playthroughs, and anything else I'd stumbled across really. I'm always pleasantly surprised when someone asks me to bring this back, and honestly I never intended to stop doing it! \nLive monthly Q&As - I've dabbled in this when electronics haven't gotten the best of me, and now I want to make this a regular monthly thing where we can have a good old online get together \nTop 10 - I do them for conventions and at the end of the year, but I'd finally work out and film my thoughts on my top 10 favourite games! \nCollection videos - I have a lot of games in my collection that I keep around because they're so good, but they can only be filmed so fast! I'd make a series where I briefly talk about each of them, what they're like, and why we've kept them around \nT-Shirts! - okay, this one isn't about filming, but it's been Rachel's goal for quite a while now and we've finally made a t-shirt that we're both excited about! Scroll down to see more!\nAnyway, if you contribute to the channel, it's only fair you get something in return so here is a selection of rewards:\nThis tier means you're happy without any rewards, but you do get my deepest gratitude and thanks - and thanks to a year of research the thanks will be 10% more thankful than we ever thought possible.\nYou've got the thanks, you're going home with them, they're safe, but if you pledge at this tier you'll also get to vote on some of the games I'll be filming! Every month a mixture of unfilmed games are put to the viewer vote, and you'll get to directly influence what ends up on the channel.\nIf one vote doesn't seem like enough votes, this could be the pledge level for you - this lets your voice be heard for TWO of the monthly game votes, and if my calculations are correct (and I believe they are) that's 24 votes! \nWith the extra time to make videos, I'm adding another monthly vote and if you're at this level YOU get to participate in them too! That's three votes per month. I daren't do the maths on this one, but believe me when I say it should satisfy all but the votiest of voters. Anyone backing at this level or higher will also get the new channel microbadge on BoardGameGeek! \nYou get everything from before, but as an extra thank you on top you'll also get this exclusive Kickstarter 38mm button badge! Marty's been busy in his spare time, and has been spending it this year becoming a sheriff in the wild wild west:\nThe slickest they is\nJust like last year, the badge is drawn by my girlfriend Rachel and I'm incredibly thankful she did!\nAbsolutely everything from before, PLUS your name will go up in lights! Well, LED screen lights most likely - your name will be featured at the end of every video as a \"producer\" of the show! Again, I really want this to feature the names of the viewers that helped make the show happen, and not to advertise things.\nEverything from the \u00a330 tier, and your name will be featured at the very very end of the videos as an \"Executive Producer\" of the show, plus your powers as an Executive Producer give you a special vote to pick an unfilmed game from my collection to jump right to the top of the filming queue\nEverything from the Executive Producer tier, with an extra special bonus. You'll be part of the inaugural Marty's Deputies! He won't be asking you to fight crime, he can handle that pretty well by himself, but he will be asking you to join this exclusive little club. Extra benefits include a private group where deputies can talk amongst themselves (and myself!), participate in the exclusive deputy fourth monthly vote (with options decided by the deputies too!), and receive an even more limited extra special, bigger Deputy badge:\nMarty painstakingly handcrafts these badges which is extremely difficult with paws in general, let alone glass ones. That's why I've been asked to limit this to 7 Deputies, and I don't want to fight the law on this one.\nThis is what it's all about really! I've got some ideas I'm excited about, but just being able to carry on is the focus first. But then again, wouldn't it be lovely to talk about Essen Spiel? Live playthroughs? More Rachel appearances? A PODCAST?? There are more ideas and possibilities swimming around, but let's leave it there for now! A convention in the US of States? Static camera? Shh, I said leave it there for now!\nEssen Spiel is the bustling hub of board games, and running backwards and forwards through the halls for days on end gives the channel the biggest boost of the most in demand games. So much so that all these months after the last Spiel I'm still filming some of them! Hitting this goal will mean I can go there again to bring back everything I can and then get to filming it all!\nThis year we've only gone and made a t-shirt! Show the world that Sheriff Marty is in charge:\nAnd here's what it might look like in real life! (Rach really wanted to try a vest first but it wasn't quite right)\nI didn't want to make a lot of extra tiers to put shirt options in there, but if you'd like the very first slickerdrips shirt, just visit this thread and see all the info!\nPhew! Well, I think that's the campaign page everyone! If you read this far, thank you very much and I hope you'll join me on this journey!\n---------------------------\nPICTURE CREDITS:\nElection and Thumbs up icons by Pixel perfect from www.flaticon.com Director icon by Freepik from www.flaticon.com \nPadlock icon by Dave Gandy from www.flaticon.com\nFilm icon by Lucy G from www.flaticon.com\nSecurity badge icon by Icon Works from www.flaticon.comSheriff Icon by Those Icons from www.flaticon.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI don't anticipate any problems with achieving the rate of videos I'm projecting.

Timing your devious blame strategy becomes evermore important here with precious airlocks in a chaotic state of repair, the potential to spend your last hours stuck in the brig or quarantine, and oh yes, a mad ship's computer that might just kill you all.

Here\u2019s the gist: Someone on your spaceship has caused your mission to fail, but who betrayed the crew? You\u2019ll need to be good at sussing out the fibbers, but also need a knack for burying your own dark secrets. One thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 you can\u2019t trust anyone until you\u2019re safely secured in that life pod. Timing is everything, which makes Blame Space a tense and engaging game.

If you back the physical version, then you'll get them in physical. Otherwise, you'll get them in PDF printer friendly or full color according to your tier.\n* I'm working on designing new bosses, also the artwork. So the skull is not the new boss looks like.\nAbout Map Maker physical edition:\nThe Map Maker PNP version had succeeded as a KS project. The digital files had delivered to all backers. As much as I know, they did love the game. \nYou can check the first shot of this game by the link below.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/onepagegaming/map-maker?ref=creator_nav\nThe full color version of the game was fascinating. But as a none token PNP game, the game sheets are used to record gaming progress which means you have to throw it away after playing. That's a waste.\nSo, I redesigned the layout and make the game sheets permanent by recording onto other paper. \nSince the game sheets become permanent parts, we don't have to print out hundreds of them. Then we get the chance to use industrial printer to produce high quality pages which home printer could not comparable, and meanwhile we can control the weight of the product (less game pieces) which keeping lower global delivery cost.\nTherefore, we launched this campaign - the first game of envelope series.\nAbout Map Maker:\nIn the fantasy world of sword and sorcery, a map would be the most important thing for an adventure or a dungeon delving which could show you the direction and the danger. \n At this game, you become a map maker to explore and find out the depth and the boss of each dungeon. Then, write the information down to complete the map. \n The game is divided into two phases, dungeon delving and boss fighting. At the dungeon delving phase, you roll the dice and choose the encounter according to your hero's stats for each level you descended, then resolve it. Continue the progress until you meet the boss. At the boss fighting phase, you fight the boss following the instruction in boss sheet. Each boss has unique features, skills and actions that you have to use different strategy to fight. \n Game components: \n1 Wild map \nWild map\n1 Event sheet\nEvent sheet\n 1 Dungeon sheet \nDungeon sheet\n 4 Hero sheets \uff08Fighter, Thief, Mage, Cleric\uff09 \nOne of the hero sheet\n6 Boss sheets  (Skeleton King, Black Dragon, Spider Queen, Goblin Joker, Orc Chief, Adventurer Hunter) \nOne of the boss sheet\n1 Quick guide\n1 Rule book \uff08PDF Version\uff09\n Besides, writing tools and 8 or more six-sided dice need be prepared by player.  \nWhat does the envelope look like?\nPlease notice that  these are samples, not the last version of the product.\nThe printer friendly looks like:\nWild map\nMap detail\nDungeon sheet\nHero sheet\nBoss sheet\nObject of the game: \nDelve into the dungeon deeper and deeper until you fighting with a boss. You win the game by defeating the boss. After that, you write the depth, the name of the boss and map maker(your hero) on one site at the wild map as your choice. \n After completing all 6 sites on the wild map, you finish the map making and the mission is accomplished. \n Game Play: \n1. Name your hero \n Give a name to your hero on the Hero Sheet which will be wrote to the Wild Map if you win the game.\nHero sheet\n2. Record the course \n Mark the level you delved in. \nDungeon sheet\n3. Roll the basic dice \n Roll the dice and put then onto the encounters as their basic dice.\n 4. Choose and resolve the encounter \n Use different attributes to resolve different encounters.\n To do this, you roll 1D6 as a combat die for your hero, add the result to relevant attribute. If you have already unlocked the skills and decide to use it, conduct the skill according to the skill description and modify your score. The result will be your final score. \n Then, you or any other player(could be start player) roll 1D6 as a combat die for the encounter and add the result to its Basic Die. That will be the score of the encounter. \n Compare these two scores, if yours is equal to or higher than encounter's, you win the combat. You get 1 experience for this attribute(add 1 attribute). \n 5. Boss fighting \n If you proceed to the end of dungeon, or get basic dice rolling result higher than Boss Encounter Score while dungeon delving, you immediately encounter the Boss. \nOne of the boss sheet\n There are 6 bosses have been designed for this game, and each one is unique. That means you have to fight each boss by different ways. Follow the instruction of each Boss sheet to implement boss fighting until death or wining. \nFor the details, check the game rule book please.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pnimo1plfj5nfa6/Map%20Maker%20Rule%20en%201.1.pdf?dl=0\n About One Page Gaming: \nWe love the Role Playing Games. We love the board games. We love the tabletop games. \nHowever, nowadays, the games are become bigger and bigger. The larger box to store, the bigger place to play, the longer time to game, the thicker book to hold, also more miniatures, more tiles, more cords, more tokens, of cause more and more money. \n We are not saying the big game is not good. Actually it is fun. But sometimes we do not have a whole afternoon or evening for a large and long time game. We also tired to spent 20 minutes to set up before gaming and another 20 minutes to clear it up after playing. Or we just can't find such a big table. :) \n Sometimes we really just want to grab a piece of pager and a pencil, perhaps with the addition of several dice to play for a 20 or 30 minutes. If you get such mood frequently, then One Page Gaming is for you! \n The aim of One Page Gaming is to develop Print and Play game of one or two A4 page size and publish via internet. The gamer need nothing more to play with printed pieces and prepared writing tools and dice. Take them anywhere and play the game whenever you want for less or more than 30 minutes. Without setting up and clearing and have fun at anytime.\nAbout the Envelope Series:\nThe major conceptions of this series are:  \n1. The game is consisted of several pages which be packed in an envelope that easily to carry.  \n2. The game sheets are designed to be permanent by the way of recording game progress on other paper. So you can use the game sheets over and over.\n3. To reduce the game pieces extremely, the envelope may be designed as a game part.   In this game, the wild map and the map detail will be printed on the front and back of the envelope.  \n4. As well controlled product weight, the global air mail system will be used for delivery to keep lower shipping cost.\nAll in all, easy to carry, easy to play, easy to store, easy to the price. That's the Envelope Series.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first shot of Map Maker already succeeded as a KS project.

Sprawlopolis is growing and YOU are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center, it\u2019s you.  \nIn Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice.\n\nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.  \nIn this game, you will try to keep Parks away from the edges, line up lots of  Commercial blocks in a row or column, and create roads that connect your Parks.   \nBut not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.  \nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible.   \nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.   \nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap, so each road will cost you points in the end.   \nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.   \nCan you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\nSprawlopolis is the next game in our ongoing Wallet Line.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

This project will be no different. We don't believe in updates for the sake of them, but we try to do an update twice a week during the campaigns, and once every 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over as a minimum.\nDelivered on time \nLab Wars and Cauldron Master, our first two games, were delivered on time and before retailers received any copies. In fact, Cauldron Master was delivered 2 months before our expected delivery date! Dice Hospital is completely on schedule and will be fulfilled in a few months time. We are running this campaign since we are simply waiting for the manufacturer to manufacture Dice Hospital.  : )\nWorld class manufacturing \nFor this project, we are using Longpack which has produced a wide array of games including Unfair, Robinson Crusoe, Queendomino and our previous project: Dice Hospital. The game, being card-based, will be simple for them and we have already seen the white box for this game! Longpack's communication has been great, and they also come recommended by other world renowned creators.\nShipment and Fulfilment \nGamesQuest will ship the games from China to the UK, however, when they arrive in the UK at that point we will take over and handle the fulfilment of Pocket Pharma in house as we have a UK business Royal mail account. We used this method very successfully with Lab Wars and Cauldron Master. Since the price of the game is so low, it will be internationally customs-friendly. \nIf this campaign gains over 1500 backers, we will bring on board an international fulfilment partner to help us out. This will most likely be GamesQuest based in the UK who we already have a fantastic relationship with.\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\nmid April: Submit Files to manufacturer \nmid May: Manufacturing completes \nearly June: Shipping from China to the UK \nlate June: Arrives in port \nmid July: Fulfilment commences \nlate August: Fulfilment completed and most backers should have their copies. \nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back to October for completing fulfilment, as the above is an optimistic prediction.

Use their unique abilities to bolster your magical powers or hinder your enemies in this game of luck, strategy, magic, and creatures of legend. \nAre you ready for Trick or Treat?\nEmber: the popular card game of creature conjuring has just run its final campaign. Trick or Treat sees 30 brand new cards that focus on \"take that\" mechanics and the addition of Gloom creatures. It also contains all the reworked and playtested Halloween expansion cards, which were requested the fans!\nEmber: Trick or Treat Cards (Details are Placeholders)\nEmber and its expansions may now be over, but the battle rages on. With almost 300 unique creature cards and a slew of spells, familiars, and artifacts, the game can be enjoyed by everyone.\nMissed out on this Campaign?\nDon't worry - you can still pick up a copy of Ember at our website. \nARRIVAL OF THE GLOOM\nTrick or Treat Cards (Backgrounds & VP Details are Placeholders)\nThe Gloom cards are a deck of cards which are shuffled and three are dealt to the table. Anyone can Conjure these cards and use them to their advantage. Each one has powerful endgame changing effects - some modify the VP of Burned creatures while others have wholly more malevolent powers designed to allow you to put those Archmage cards to good use! But be warned, the power of Gloom is powerful and unpredictable and it can easily be a double-edged sword. \nGloom magic is recommended for advanced Ember players.\nHALLOWEEN PROMOS\nEmber Halloween Cards (with old-style art)\n You can download the Halloween Cards PDF by clicking here.\nA Selection of Gorgeous Creatures from From the Ashes + Promos\nWHY BACK TRICK OR TREAT\nIt's more Ember!\nIt's got a slew of new art by a fabulous all-female art team.\nIt's all about the endgame (the final piece of the puzzle I felt needed work right from the very beginning). Now you can really shake things up with a single Archmage card (more on that on my weekly videos).\nI've always been a huge fan of making the final score that bit more uncertain and now Trick or Treat gives you just THAT! Now you can manipulate the final VPs of Burned creatures. If that wasn't enough, some of the new creatures are reactionary: when a player does something - you get to do something. It means you can wield absolute power in each game, BUT you might pay a high price for such blatant use of magic. \nEmber is a fast-paced game of creature conjuring. There\u2019s no analysis paralysis here; you use the cards in your hand to conjure a creature based on the creatures you have in play / creatures available on the table / creature to suit your strategy.\nFrom the Ashes Cards\nIt\u2019s a hand manipulation game. It\u2019s easy to fob off Ember \"as another luck game\", and it might start that way, BUT\u2026 the creatures you collect will allow you to mitigate the \u201cluck of the draw\u201d and to further your chances of conjuring more powerful creatures (by drawing more cards that you need or stripping your enemies of their creatures' powers).\nTrick or Treat capitalises on that giving you even more chances to attack your enemies, to weaken their creatures and to strengthen your hold over the game. It's all out war in the Halloween expansion!\nIt\u2019s not Magic the Gathering - it\u2019s not a game where you hold back cards while you wait for the one you really need - it\u2019s fast and furious - it's opportunistic - it also features countless creatures from mythology - all in glorious technicolour!  \nEmber is played over multiple rounds, split between two phases. The Draw Phase and the Conjuring Phase.\nDuring the Draw Phase you will discard one or more cards from your hand to draw more cards to aid you in your creature conjuring efforts.\nAn Average Hand of Cards in Ember\nIn the Conjuring Phase you will discard two or more cards in your hand to conjure just one creature from the Pool (the randomly determined set of creatures and magical items available to you in any particular game of Ember. The more creatures you have, the more random each game will be). Each creature has a unique ability, so the creature you most need might not necessarily be the one with the highest Victory Point score.\nThe Pool of Available Cards (From the Ashes)\nPlay continues with players discarding and drawing cards, BUT the strength of Ember is that you can use your creatures' powers at any time, thus aiding your own conjuring attempts or thwarting your opponents. Card powers range from allowing you to draw extra cards to being able to deflect one of your opponent's abilities to another target.\nHummingbird Phases: Ready to Exhausted.\nThe game ends when one player reaches the agreed Victory Point score OR they accumulate a number of Ember Points - cards that are added to the Pool when all the creatures in one VP Rank are conjured (to be revealed in Stretch Goals).\nA Selection of Gorgeous Creatures from From the Ashes\nDuring the Endgame, each player takes it in turns to use their creatures' abilities, to Burn (turn face down and make powerless) or Regenerate creatures with Archmage cards and to generally do everything they can to gain those final few Victory Points. Once everyone has passed, the game ends and the final scores are totalled. Final scores may be affected by Tutor cards (in From the Ashes). \nThe winner is the wizard with the highest score in VPs.\nDownload the Rulebook\nDownload the Complete Card List (we've not included the Second Edition - yet - to avoid spoilers!)\nArchmage Stewie Showing Off the Cards\nEmber: The Wizard Playing Cards\nThe Wizard cards make up the majority of the Draw Deck and allow you to Conjure creatures, one creature for each of your turns. \nEmber: Trick or Treat consists of just one tuck box of 30 cards of the highest possible quality with all new art. You are getting:\n15 x Gloom cards\n15 x Halloween-themed cards that add a whole \"take that\" element to Ember. Now there's more revenge when someone makes you discard a card (or three). Get your own back!\nThe new cards are also standalone, so if you have a Wizards deck, you can play Ember with these cards. Exciting! It's guaranteed to be a very different game to anything you've played before. \nWe've started with 30 cards, but our Stretch Goals plan for A LOT more!!! I'll be showing you more of the cards over the campaign so stay tuned!\nWHAT DO I NEED TO PLAY EMBER?\nAll you need to play a standard game of Ember is: \n1 x 55 card The Wizards deck\n1 x 55 card From the Ashes starter deck.\nThe Wizards is a deck of 55 playing cards which make up the four elements of magical energy you need to Conjure creatures in Ember. It also includes three powerful Archmage cards.\nFrom the Ashes is a deck of 55 creatures, artifacts, elemental dragon gods, and magical tutor cards.\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nEmber: Trick or Treat Components\nCUSTOM WOODEN BOXES\nThe wooden boxes are custom-made exclusively for Ember.

Beat writer's block and procrastinator's brain!\n Comic Turns is suitable for all ages from 7 upwards. It contains no words, meaning it can be played anywhere with speakers of any language, as well as being accessible for children and adults with low literacy or difficulty reading. There is great potential for Comic Turns to be used as an educational aid not just for making comics and creative writing, but for literacy, language learning and discussion.\n   All the images of the game shown in the video and pictures are of the prototype deck. The manufactured decks will be high quality 300gsm card in a lovely gloss-varnished tuckbox. The cards are standard Poker size 63x88mm\nI've included four different ways to play in the deck: A warm-up activity to get the creative juices flowing, and three games - two collaborative and one competitive.

I want to encourage players to submit their own ideas for games to the Comic Turns website, as well as adding more sets of rules myself over time, so that Comic Turns is constantly evolving, and there are always new ways to use your deck of cards. \nPlay by the rules, make up your own rules, or play with no rules at all!\n      The rules will be made available in multiple languages on the Comic Turns website. At the moment I'm looking at having them translated into Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Italian, Japanse, Swedish and Turkish. Maybe even more!\n   I am a comics artist from London, UK. I work freelance, and make comics both professionally and as an indie creator making self-published work.  \nBack in 2009, I was the V&A's Comics Art Resident, spending six months in this world class museum making artwork, teaching workshops and holding open studio events. This was when the idea for Comic Turns was first conceived, as a deck of comic strip playing cards called Hand of Fate...\nI have been teaching workshops and courses on making comics to children, adults and teens for the past ten years, working with schools, libraries and museums across the UK, and  abroad! As an educator, seeing how much students and other educators loved Hand of Fate and found it great for learning and teaching comics was part of what made me really want develop it as a game for all, and to get it out to a wider audience. Hence this Kickstarter for the product it became: Comic Turns. \nI love any activity that involves making stories with others and creating collective hive minds: role playing games, collaborative art and writing, storytelling and teaching. I hope you will join the Comic Turns hive mind with me and make it buzz!\n  \u201cIt's an amazing game to play as it allows you to think of a lot of plots and comics. Rating 100000/10\u201d Aisha, 12 \n\u201cFun, interesting. I liked the way that you could put anything anywhere and you can still make a story.\u201d Chisomo, 12\n\u201cIt was very fun and I really enjoyed it. You can play it alone or with friends which makes it even better. 10/10\u201d Aravind, 11\n\"Every now and then you see an idea that's so brilliant you stop and think 'I wish I'd thought of that!' One such concept is Comic Turns.\" Lew Stringer\n\"Comic Turns is a fantastic enigmatic multi purpose little deck. It's a great game, a mix of Cards Against Humanity, Story Cubes, and dominos. It's also a great prompt for writers, like Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies cards.... Whatever you use them for, the images and the endless combinations and juxtapositions possible with them are fascinating.\" Leah Moore  \n\"I've used Karen Rubins's fantastic comic cards for over 6 years now with everyone from children to grannies and in workshops all over the world from Russia to Mexico, so I can confidently say that everyone loves them! The cards allow you to put the tools of storytelling straight into the participant's hands. Making up stories is so easy when you can bounce off these cards and they inspire even the most novice of storytellers to pick up their own pens and have a go at creating their own visual stories.\" Karrie Fransman\n\u201cOnce upon a time there was a clever comics creator named Karen Rubins... Karen came up with all kinds of wizard ideas to entertain visitors and herself. One of them was a limited edition special deck of playing cards that had comic panels on each card showing varying actions and happenings that you could use to tell a variety of stories... Despite advice from a respected fellow creator in the comics business to produce this excellent object for a wider spread of buyers, Karen let much time go by before realising the error of her ways.\u201d David Lloyd\nReview by Chris Michelotti of Foolish Panda Games: \"This is a fast and fun game to bring out for kids to develop both creative thinking and their ability to tell stories.\"\n  Review by Dice at Dusk's Eddie Stanton: \"It pushed me to create a decent story, I really liked that about it.\" \"It's a great way to keep those creative ideas flowing through your head.\"\n   \"An elegantly simple story telling card game suitable for all ages,\" says Richard from We're Not Wizards. Listen to a whole podcast interview where we talk about Comic Turns among other things. We're Not Wizards Podcast\n    \"It was fun. I liked that you can make your own story.\" BarbarianLeaf, \"You could have loads and loads and loads of fun.\" GamerLeaf, from Getting Geeky with Gamer Leaf's Family Friday podcast.\n  To make Comic Turns a reality I need to raise money to manufacture the game and get it into the hands of backers. That is all I am asking for my main goal. Any additional funds will be spent on improving the product, and making it more accessible to more players \u2013 through a dedicated website, rules translations, getting tables at more shows and cons than I can currently afford by myself and manufacturing more decks. I'd also love to develop expansion decks! Comic Turns is about making stories together, so it would be great to fund it together too. Let's make this campaign into the best story we can! \n     Free shipping within the UK is included with all pledges. By keeping the game a small size we can send it quite cheaply and easily anywhere in the world. Our shipping is from within the EU so EU backers can benefit from low shipping charges and no taxes to receive your items. Shipping for all rewards is \u00a38 (approx $11USD) or less for worldwide shipping, and \u00a35 (approx \u20ac6) or less for postage within Europe.\n   Wow! We've made the funding total!

Some of the word games also involve speed, memory, set collection, or just force you to think about words in an entirely new way.\nSome of the games are about language. They encourage you to invent stories or phrases.\nSome games are completely abstract! Some are about matching things quickly, one is about creating sets of patterns as you use numbers for auctions, a few are about using the alphabet as an arbitrary order for symbols (i.e. letters) to be arranged into.\n  (borders will be red in 2nd edition and some letters redrawn)\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n48 cards, each featuring a common letter, a less common letter, a number (that tells you how often the lower letter appears) and one of 6 borders. This is the core!\n7 bonus cards, with the card back, and either just one of 6 borders or a fully blank front.\nAn informational sheet about the deck.\nRulesheet for WIBBELL - a fast realtime wordgame that tests your ability to make words under pressure.\nRulesheet for GRABBELL - a speedy, frantic pattern-matching game.\nRulesheet for PHRASELL - a creative game that tests your mastery of the language.\nRulesheet for FAYBELL - a storytelling activity.\nRulesheet for ALPHABETICKELL - an abstract game that tests your analytical skills.\nRulesheets for COUPELL - a highly co-operative 2-player word game.\nA sturdy-and-compact-yet-fancy box with actual shiny cold-pressed gold foil.\nThat's 6 games, and all of them are made with love and thorough attention to detail. They have been thoroughly tested.\nBut which ones are the best?\nThere are 6 'core' games and each year - until I retire - I will add another game to that list on BezDay (1st August). No game will be for everyone but they will all be worth trying. They will be focused on over the preceding year, with blind-tested rule sheets and professional proof-reading as a final touch. \nA website will be rebuilt. Everyone can submit their game ideas and I consider it my duty and pleasure to continue designing for the deck, test all the submitted games, help with development as needed, and let everyone search through and vote on hundreds of games.\nWhether you want solitaire games, educational activities, quick games for the pub or deeper games to play over an hour, they already exist. And more will be coming.\nThere are enough games and infinite possibilities. I will do my utmost to help guide you towards those games that you will enjoy the most. By contributing to this KS, you are helping me on this mission: to make the best curated game system ever.\nThe first-edition deck\n  Nearly 2 years ago, I Kickstarted Wibbell++.\nI made something good, which I'm very proud of.\nAs planned, I spent the following year developing the graphics and drawing the lettershapes. With the help of my backers, I created a 1st edition box that has been enjoyed by countless people around the globe!\nI have shown it to hundreds of people around the world - in one single convention, I played over 200 games of Wibbell! And I went to 11 conventions last year and hosted many more events/gamenights. I have the luxury of hindsight and have had time to consider each and every aspect of the deck\nNow I want to make something even better.\nI will be using all the feedback I've gotten over the past 6 months.\nThe box will be a compact 2-piece box that is a near-perfect fit for the deck. I have a sample that I've literally jumped on and generally mistreated. It still functions perfectly as a box.\nThe tree was a lovely way to celebrate the birth of the game system, but I'd like a stark, bold version of the card back on the front of the box. \nAfter the KS is funded, I will start showing you thumbnails, then sketches, then more sketches, then final art for the outer box sides, inner box sides and back of box.\nI will do my utmost to make this a beautiful box that you are proud to have displayed on a table, or bring out of your bag.\nI am redrawing S, G, O and maybe Y to help make these letters as readable as possible.\nThe rules - instead of being on cards - are on rulesheets. This allows me to use 11-point text for the main rules and explain things with greater clarity. There will also be space for more diagrams and even helpful tips/strategies to get you started.\nThe borders will be a brownish red and the numbers slightly fainter, to better focus attention on the letters.\nSome borders will be swapped.\nAfter observing thousands of games, a few rules are changing slightly. For 1st edition owners, these will of course be up on the website.\nThe cards will be 320gsm linen-finish. This feels nice when you're playing with it.\nThe box will be literally shiny, with cold-stamped gold foil.\nYou could consider it a 'deluxe' version. \nI think that you should definitely back this KS. But I'm clearly biased. \nHere's some quotes from some less-biased folk.\n(Click on any of the quotes for a link - each quote is from a reviewer or someone online. None were ever paid by me. Some review copies were sent. Unlinked words are my own.)\n    2-7 players, 10-15 minutes\nShout words quickly, but make sure to use\nA letter from every card or you lose.\n\"It gets increasingly difficult as soon as you start getting your cards.\" - Cassie Elle\n\"There's a really devilish little strategy\" \"It has that word-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue feel, where you're all pent up\" - Ding & Dent\n\"It's about your speed of thinking rather than just being the 'smartest' person.\" - Toucan Play That Game\n\"Super fast.\" \"Super portable.\" \"Setup is super simple.\" - What's Eric Playing\n\"The race-based tension of Wibbell can re-energise tired gamers.\" - Games Night Guru\n\"stunningly brilliant\" - Creaking Shelves\n\"Wibbell is the first word game I enjoyed in a very long time. It is fast, fun and has a great catch up mechanic.\" - Big Red Barrell\n  2-7 players, 2-3 minutes\n  \"A quick thirty-seconds-to-a-minute action game.\" - The Offline Gamer Podcast\nYou grab cards as quickly as you can - but each card you grab must match a letter or border with the previous card. Whenever you want, slap the table and eliminate yourself.\n\"Everybody except the last person is going to get 10 bonus points. But they get all the cards on the table! So you're trying to do some math: how many cards are on the table? When should I slap my hand?\" - Bower's Game Corner\n\"The winner is the person that manages to pick up the most of those cards and survive the ruthless audit on their work that will be conducted by the player to their left.\" - Meeple Like Us\n\"quite a lot of fun...because of the race element, and the mess, and the clever use of the borders\" - Board Deck & Dice\n\"A really fast, simple, fun little dexterity game.\"- Cardboard Cultist\n\"Grabbell is simply ludicrous, in a good way.\" - Games Night Guru\n  2-4 players, 15-30 minutes\nFirst you use the cards to inspire 4 story elements.\n\"EP might be Exploding Possum or Elemental Parka or Everyday Person\" - Meeples Like Us\nThen you take turns to tell a story involving these elements in that order.\n\"The first player flips over the top card of the deck and creates a starting sentence using the top letter of the card. In addition, a separate word must start with the bottom letter of the card. As example, if the card flipped had the letters \u201cE\u201d and \u201cM\u201d the player could start the story with \u201cEarly morning mist surrounded the city.\u201d He/she would also come up with a word for the letter \u201cM\u201d such as \u201cmurdered\u201d. The next player would flip a card and come up with a sentence using the top letter of their card and would need to include the word \u201cmurdered\u201d into their sentence. This activity does not involve winning or losing and is more about simply having fun.\" - Board Game Doctor\n\"Just enough rules and restrictions to give it some structure and challenge, to make it a game, but leaves you in the driving seat.\" - Creaking Shelves\n  5-15 players, 15-25 minutes\nFirst the judge uses a card to inspire any topic they wish.\n'The judge then flips over two more cards and the other players have to think of a 4-word phrase about the topic beginning with those 4 letters (in any order). For example with the topic 'fox' and the cards RD/WN, Joe came up with \"Night-Wandering Red Dog\".' - BGG comment\n[RH] and [SL] could be \"'Rebel Halflings Love Sauron!\u2019, \u2018Red Hot Shire Loving!\u2019, \u2018Second Lunch: Rarely Hot\u2019, and so on.\" - Meeple Like Us\n \"You don't get a designated turn, where you think of what you want to say and then say it. But I personally actually like that because people are just shouting stuff out, and then crazy stuff is just popping out of your head...\" - Bower's Game Corner\n\"Andrew's 'Someone Call Nurse Fatima' had no relevance to the subject, but he won the round anyway. It's that kind of game.\" - Games Night News\n\"Again, super quick and super easy to play but still packing a considerable amount of fun into the svelte box\" - Meeple Like Us\n\"Does what the best party games do: let you appreciate your friends\u2019 wit and humour.\" - Creaking Shelves\n\"It makes a great after-dinner game and is hilarious and revealing by turns.\" - Games Night Guru\n2-5 players, 20-30 minutes\nAlphabetickell is all about choosing cards that fit at the start or end of a line of letters (not in the middle). Originally designed by Andrew Dennison in 2015, I developed it and eventually removed the speed component. (There is no video because the turn-based nature changed it enough to invalidate previous comments and interviews.)\nAt a basic level, it's a simple game suitable for families.\nIf you delve more deeply, there is a lot of analysis involved - based on memory of the cards gone, knowledge of other players' desires, and understanding the uneven distribution and probabilities involved.\n\"part luck, part strategy and part knowing your ABCs.\" - Big Red Barrell\n\" It is\u2026 not as easy as it sounds.\" - Meeple Like Us\n\"It's simple but offers some fun strategy, like so many of the games in Wibbell++\" - Cardboard Cultist\n\"Once again, the fact that so many little decisions are buried in here, makes this a treat!\" - Creaking Shelves\n\"Very good fun at 2-player.\" - Toucan Play That Game\n  2 players, 30-45 minutes\nA 2-player co-operative game. You help each other make longer words, by working on each other's rows of cards and trying to stay in perfect balance.\nAt the end of the game, your scores need to be exactly equal!\nAs it wasn't included in the 1st edition deck, it's been overlooked slightly. In the 2nd edition deck, full rules will be included of course.\n\"It works really nicely.\" \"Perfect restaurant game [or] on an aeroplane\" - Rahdo Runs Through\n1 player, 10-20 minutes\n Puzzell will be the 7th 'core' game, with full development, blind-testing and proof-reading completed by 1st August 2018.\n\nYou must lay out all the cards but are only allowed to lay cards when creating 'runs', i.e. fragments of the alphabet. There are 20 setups to beat, and any will setup might play differently when you shuffle and play again.\n  IN CONCLUSION\nIt's unlikely that all 6 core games will be perfect for you. Hopefully you'll enjoy all those you get a chance to try, but maybe you'll find yourself hating the physicality of Grabbell, or hating the deep cognitive load of Coupell. Maybe you don't like activities - you only like games. Maybe you don't like mixing games with creativity. Or maybe you don't like the somewhat abstract nature of Alphabetickell.\n\nEven Wibbell itself - the most universally enjoyed game in the deck - has some who hate its rowdy nature.\nI do believe, however, that there will almost certainly be a game here for you.\n\nIf your sensibilities align with mine - enjoying lighter games, word games, party games - then this deck will bring you to gaming Nirvana. If you prefer heavier games, it's possible that another designer (such as David Brain, who has done some sterling work on this deck) is already working on games for your tastes.\n\nAnd you'll be able to keep the whole thing in your pocket.\nThanks for reading.\n - Bez ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have completed 3 physically mass-produced projects for KS projects and hope I've proven my capability to do a 4th. I always do my own art/writing. In this instance, I have less artwork to do, more developed skills for writing rules, and more connections in place for blind-testing/proof-reading.\n\nThe games are 100% rules-complete and thoroughly tested.\n\nSome assets (rule diagrams, box art, S, G, O) need to be drawn. I hope to be able to involve backers in the creation of the box art. In the past, only 0-8% of my art has been done before a KS so I am much further along and expect a correspondingly swift turnaround.\n\nI have a printer lined up - Fabryka Kart, who printed my 1st edition deck. They have given me plenty of samples and I am intimately familiar with the new box. \n\nI know they are able to deliver in a relatively short timeframe. The decks will come from Poland without any ships involved.\n\nI will post the game myself - packing and sending the envelopes as I'm able and then sending via Royal Mail from London, UK. This will take a couple of weeks so I'll have to ask you to be patient during this process.\n\nThe main challenge will simply be the continued focus and organisation of time in the face of whatever life throws at me. A more terminal risk is that I might get run over by a bus. But if I did, I hope you'd sympathise and you'd be sadder for the loss of my life than the loss of your game. \n\nThe main risk is the postal service. Some packages take longer than others and some are unreliable - specially when going overseas. \n\nAlso, since I am personally fulfilling all orders, it will take me longer than usual to fulfill. \n\nI hope that everyone will get their copies in June/July. But it may even be that a few folk get it in August. \n\nMy plan is:\nFeb - KS\nMarch/April - art/completion of everything\nMay/June - printing/delivery to me (UK)\nJune/July/August - folk get their games\n\nuntil I retire - I keep making games for the deck and helping others with their own ideas\n\nUltimately, your realistic worst-case scenario (given my track record) is that they come a little later than you hope, or you are the last person in the world to get your copy. \n\nA couple of months after everything is sent and things have had time to make their way around the world (even if the postal service in your country is being especially nosy) I will put out an update and start re-sending stuff that failed to arrive. You will get your stuff. \n\nConversely, the benefit is that you will get a brilliant package that has games made for it for many decades to come. And you're directly supporting someone trying to help make the world a happier place via games. \n\nI think that's a pretty good risk-benefit ratio.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "All support is appreciated", "descp": "Maybe you already have a first edition deck and don't particularly want to upgrade.

Featuring lots of dice, custom doctor meeples, awesome isometric art and plenty more! \nWhat's in the box!\n Explanation of some of the components:\nDice - these are your patients!\nAdministrator cards - player objective cards that give points based on dice discharged. YOU will get to decide which famous medics feature on them.\nAmbulance cards - used for drafting dice. See how to play section\nEvent cards - optional use cards for players who like slightly more randomness in their games. More advanced/strategic players should not play with these. \nBlood bag tokens - given to the player who chose the hardest to treat dice - which gives more flexibility when treating patients\nMedical report cards - For solo play only - see solo variant section\nScoring and round tracker - to keep tally of points per player with the player markers. Features a neat \"dial\" piece which you rotate to indicate which round you are on too!\nMini expansion pack add-on for base game:\nYou can now add \u00a312 to your pledge if you wish to receive the mini expanion pack to your base game pledge instead of the full deluxe contents :) Message us once you've added it on!\n Please note: the deluxe edition also comes with a plastic customised insert to hold all these components easily. Please see below for explanation of each component in the deluxe edition. \nEach ambulance holds and fits 3 dice\n Explanation of contents in the deluxe edition\nDice Tower: this is an \"assemble your own\" flatpack Hospital illustrated Dice Tower! Unlike the image which suggests it is plain - it is most definitely not plain! It will be illustrated by our illustrator as a hospital. It will also be easy to flatpack and put away back in the deluxe add-ons box. Think the Colt Express train, or Kingdomino castles.\nAmbulances: Plastic ambulances that hold the dice when drafting them. You will be able to see the values easily and has a slot for each die.\nStickers: Used to number the ambulances so you know which ambulance should hold which dice and determines initiative for the upgrade section of the round.\nBox: the deluxe edition add-on comes in it's own box (which will have a slightly different illustration than the base game).\nThe reward levels available\n  Experimental chemistry expansion pack\nWhat it adds to the base game\nThis mini expansion pack offers a new style of upgrade tiles and specialists. While retaining the euro-style control of the base game dice manipulation, the expansion offers an alternative way to manipulate tiles. Essentially the tiles and specialists upgrades may change the value of the dice by going down a step (clinical trials), re-rolling dice (experimental drugs), and swapping values (transplants). This gives a much more versatile feel to the game and actually introduces really interesting levels of strategy that even we find to be novel each time we play it when combo'd with tiles/specialists from the base game! Please see below for how to play the base game and overviews. \nYour face (or friend/family) in the game\nThis can be anyone that gives you permission to use their face in the game. It will be at least for the first print run, but may be forever depending on circumstances. Importantly, their face will be in every single copy of the game! Children can be added, but we will need to draw them as adults since it won't fit well with the game otherwise.\n Since we have hit \u00a330,000 - this is:\nFree promo card! (purchasable afterwards)\n  We've now hit the \u00a3125k stretch goal which means each colour meeple will receive a different print of a doctor/nurse on it!\nWatch the preview from the Dice Tower! \n  Worker placement and dice manipulation mechanics\nAs far as we are aware this is the first game to combine worker placement-like mechanics with dice manipulation. It is also the first to use dice as patients were the pip value represents the die's health levels. Something our playtesters loved! \nBeautiful art with isometric style rooms\nWe asked famous board game artist Sabrina Miramon to illustrate Dice Hospital by drawing isometric rooms to give that 3d-like effect as well as the characters. The final product is something, we think, of beauty. Not only that, Sabrina did a great job recreating each room type as realistically as possible!\nDoctor meeples!\nWe asked playtesters what they wanted most as a stretch goal and they said doctor meeples. So we said, what the heck, lets just do it anyway! The result is really cool doctor meeples that you use as your workers to activate your rooms.\nOne of very few hospital games accessible to most gamer types\nWe feel Dice Hospital appeals to both light gamers, euro gamers and medium-heavy weight gamers. The beauty of the game is the simplicity of choices which allows accessibility to light gamers, but the very much forward planning and \"thinky\" requirements which will appeal to euro gamers and medium-heavy weight gamers.\nCo-designed and developed by an established designer\nMike Nudd, an established designer in his own right, worked with original designer Stanislav Kordonskiy to design the game. Given Mike's breadth of experience having designed the popular dice placement game Waggle Dance and CCG Game Vampire: The Eternal Struggle it ensures the game is mechanically sound, fun and balanced so that it's replayable time and time again!\nPrototype copy of Dice Hospital\n    Download the basic rulebook. Final version (with graphics design work and editing) coming soon.\n  FRENCH AND GERMAN RULEBOOKS NOW AVAILABLE! \nDOWNLOAD FRENCH VERSION HERE\nDOWNLOAD GERMAN VERSION HERE \nOther languages are planned as well as using final graphics design for the non-english rulebooks. \nWatch a 3 minute overview thanks to Slicker Drips\n        Players start with their own hospital board, 3 randomly dealt dice (pip values 3/4/5) and 3 starting nurses \nEach round sees randomly rolled dice placed on ambulances from low to high - which is placed by the first player, with tied (but different coloured) dice being decided by the last player \nStarting from the first player going clockwise players pick ambulance cards. The lower the number ambulance card the more likely you are to go first for an upgrade (and a bloog bag token and the first player token). The trade-off is that lower value dice are harder to treat.\nStarting with the player with the lowest value ambulance, each player then gets to decide which one of the face up upgrades they take for their own hospital.\nSimultaneously, players then activate their hospitals by moving their own nurse meeples onto action spots on their hospital and manipulating the dice. The more dice discharged (value of 7) in a single round the more points scored. \nOne of the best features of the game is the ability to combo rooms with specialists when you have built up an awesome hospital!  \n   A more detailed playthrough is shown thanks to Slicker Drips which can be watched in the solo playthrough section below. Essentially, the game becomes a lot harder, something we purposefully did. Essential differences are:\nMedical Report cards \nThese are cards supplied with the base game, which players are dealt at the beginning of the game. Players are randomly dealt 6 of these cards of which they are laid out face up in a 2x3 configuration. Only the bottom 3 cards are accessible in the first instance. The medical report cards state which dice you must discharge to gain that bonus written on the card. Once the player has discharged those dice that match a medical report card (or multiple if possible) those cards are discarded, scored on the tracker, and the cards directly above drop down to become available. At the end of the game, any medical report cards that remain unscored score negative points equal to that stated on the cards themselves\nDice drafting is from the bag, not the ambulance draft \nAs of now, we feel that this is the best system as it gives the most amount of difficulty since you have no control over the dice you receive. The 3 drawn dice are then rolled, with 1s and 6s re-rolled and placed into your wards. However, we are testing whether easier variants may be played that is not this strict. Right now, we are testing 1 die of your choice being drawn with the other 2 being random. We are also testing to see whether dice discharged are not put back in the bag as in the multiplayer variant so that players my gauge what dice are left in the bag.\nDrafting of specialists is limited \nWe say this because only 1 of each type of upgrade is revealed each turn. While you can pick whichever upgrade you wish, since the rate at which you go through the deck, is lower than that of the multiplayer version, specialists may only be useful at certain times of the game. We are, however, testing an easier variant where the duplicates of the tiles and specialists are removed making control of the dice much easier to anticipate - especially for more experienced players.\n  Download a basic and printer friendly version of the print and play file\n Please note, the print and play file is not the final art of the game, since we wanted to make it printer friendly. Each room and specialist will see unique art too. It is more to give an indication of how the game plays instead!\n    Solo playthrough with Slicker Drips\n    What reviewers thought of Dice Hospital\n  Some of the reviewers who have or will review the game\n   Please note in this review 1s are incorrectly described as going to the morgue and 6s are discharged. Dice must go to 0 to be sent to the morgue and 7 to be discharged. Otherwise, Rahdo gives an excellent description of the game! \n          Add on Cauldron Master - our last game to your pledge!\n  Please message us once you have added on Cauldron Master\nCauldron Master funded on kickstarter earlier this year and is running low on stocks of an initial 1000 copy print run. It is a light, fast but deep set collection, push your luck and slightly social deduction game that has proved popular with families and gamers who like a nice easy game to start their game night. Please note: if you'd like a copy simply add the amount to your pledge AND message us telling us you've done so.\nWe want to offer excellent rates to our retailer friends as well as wanting to make life-long partnerships. To that end please back us at the \u00a31 tier, message us and we will send you our excellently priced retailer rates!\nDice Hospital has been rigorously tested\nSince Stanislav made the original version of Dice Hospital (known firstly as \"Stat!\") in 2015 the game has been rigorously tested, blindly playtested and tested some more! Alley Cat Games signed up the game in winter 2016 and got Mike Nudd involved in early 2017 to develop and design the game further. \nWe have spent a huge amount of time and effort locally playtesting and lots of hours with blind playtesters rigorously testing the game and rulebook for us - this is testament to the 1000 member Dice Hospital facebook group in which we've had over 50 different groups playing the game and sending us detailed feedback. \nWe believe we have got to place now where the game is excellent, balanced, replayable, and most importantly: FUN! \nSome of our various blind and local playtests!\n  Transparency guarantee\nJust like our previous games which we kickstarted: Lab Wars and Cauldron Master, we kept backers informed of any problems, issues, and of course good news we had along the way to fulfilling the game to backers. \n Delivered on time\nAgain, our last two games were delivered on time and before retailers received their copies. In fact, Cauldron Master was delivered 2 months before our expected delivery date!\nWorld class manufacturing\nFor this project, we are using Longpack which produced a wide array of games including Unfair, Robinson Crusoe, and Queendomino. We have already received an early prototype of an early version of the game from Longpack and the standard of this was very very high. Their communication has been excellent as well as having been recommended by other world renowned creators.\nOverview of manufacturing and fulfillment \nWe will give ourselves a month or two to prepare the final artwork (custom and legendary medics) as well as the rulebook. Taking us to the end of December at worst. \nAt this point (late Dec-early Jan) we will submit the files to Longpack for approval. \nIt'll then take a 2-4 weeks to produce a pre-production copy of the game for our approval - reaching late Jan-early Feb. \nIt'll then take 8-10 weeks to manufacture the games, taking us to early April. \nThey will then be loaded onto ships bound for the USA, UK and Australia. Each will take approximately 4-6 weeks to reach their destinations taking us to May. \nThen fulfillment to you will take 1-4 weeks once they have reached their destinations and passed through customs! Meaning (hopefully if all goes to plan) it'll reach backers in June. This is what we call moderate case scenario - where worst will be August - hence why the date we have put on the expected shipment date as August. \nSince the game is quite large and heavy we will be providing subsidized shipping. We will be using the infamous \"Stegmaier\" method of shipping to different regional fulfillment warehouses around the world. We will be using ShipNaked/Funagain in the USA, GamesQuest in the UK and AetherWorks in Australia. \nUSA, UK and most EU shipping will also have the extra benefit of being tracked (wherever possible.) \nAlso as stated above, a small minority of non UK and US countries will need a to pay a little bit extra for orders with the expansion pack. This is because the combined package goes over the \"dreaded\" 2kg limit making postage much more expensive. We've kept prices as low as possible and taking into consideration VAT for EU countries. For full details click on the tier and select your country.\nSince we have had issues in the past with the following countries: we will be using special couriers which are tracked and insured against loss and theft. The price here is the price we pay to send it to you. Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Columbia, Peru, Puerto Rico are in this list.\nPlease read the FAQ for full details\nWe wanted to make the game as visually appealing to everyone as possible, while also making sure our colour-blind friends could also enjoy the game without having to ask what colour each component was. Please read the FAQ below for how we accomplished this. \nWho we are - Alley Cat Games\nWe are an independent company that has 2 kickstarter games under our belt with this being our third. Caezar also works as the official kickstarter campaign manager for Sierra Madre Games, with their first kickstarter launch: Bios:Genesis 2nd edition, raising $309,000. We have recently expanded our freelance network (of note, hiring Sabrina Miramon at our offices as our Art Director and Brett Gilbert as our co-lead developer) and have offices based in Hertfordshire, UK. We plan to release 4 games in 2018 having already signed up/ close to signing up 4-6 games. We are also in talks to take multiple multi million dollar licenses which we hope to conclude by the end of 2017 in preparation for 2018. We're looking forward to having you join us on this exciting new adventure!\nThe Alley Cat Games team\n  Support us on BGG.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games. Some of you may recognize him from the first Kickstarter campaign.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who did an outstanding job!\nTo Olivier Nkweti for his great work on miniatures.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nTo all the backers of the first campaign who helped us make this dream a reality.\nTo you, previous and first-time backers, who will allow us to keep on dreaming!\nThank you all!\nWe wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe re-printing of the base box does not pose any issues. \n\nWork on the new expansion has already begun and we are confident in our ability to meet the announced deadlines.\n\nWe will, of course, be keeping you updated about the state of the project through each and every stage. \n\nREFUNDS\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll prices shown in \u20ac (Euros) are based on the conversion rate in effect at the start of the campaign (09-25-2017) which is $1 = \u20ac0.84\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

At The Ludoquist you will sit back and enjoy a locally roasted coffee or locally brewed beer, along with a nice meal or snack. We will have a menu of games that you can choose from, or you can just browse our 700+ games collection. If you're unsure what you want to play, we can help you choose and teach you most of our games if you don't know the rules.\n\nWe're going to be on the High Street, so you'll be welcome to curl up on a sofa for a coffee, cocktails, or food. If you want to play games with us, there will be a \u00a33 charge to play as long as you want. We will be open 11am till 11pm most days, and from 10am at the weekend.\nDo you mean Monopoly and Backgammon?\nWell, yes. We'll have lots of copies of all the classic games - Chess, Cluedo, Mahjong, Scrabble. But we'll also have lots of modern games, where you work with your friends to save the world, or against them to rob a train. You might like the idea of lying to your friends about who the village werewolf is, or rolling dice to see who the best monster is. Into Game of Thrones or Star Wars, Harry Potter or Fallout? We have games that cover all those too.\nWe're going to try to have the very best copies of games - so we have Small World Designer Edition and the Catan 3D Edition. We're hoping to get special editions of Scrabble and Monopoly, as well as a great marble chess set and clocks if the Kickstarter goes well. You can see our current list of games here.\nYou mentioned food and drink?\nWe're very focused on making sure that when people sit down with us, they're not just playing great games, but eating and drinking well too. Our coffee is Volcano Works, roasted in Brixton. We'll be using their Mount Blend. We'll be selling craft beers, brewed in Croydon, Brixton, and maybe even farther afield!\n\nFor food, of course we'll have cafe snacks - brownies and cakes - but we will also be providing proper healthy meals. We'll have specials of the day focusing on what we describe as Bowl Food - stews, curries, pastas - which can easily be eaten with a fork and not take up precious gaming space. We're also planning to have pizzas for nice easy meals.\n\n\nYou keep saying we?\nWe're a family cafe. Nick is a complete gaming nerd, and would be happy surrounded by boxes of games piled high and nothing else. He's going to look after all the game aspect of things, teaching and training. Carrie isn't so much a gamer, but is a brilliant cook, and understands food, drink, and hospitality. Faith, our daughter, understands all the social media thingummy wotsit bits (and made our video above). Between us, with our different interests, we plan to make a place that is excellent in every part.\n\nAnd it's going to be in Croydon?\nYes, Croydon. We love Croydon. It's full of vibrant startups and interesting street art. We've got Boxpark, Matthew's Yard, tech hubs, workspaces...we've fallen in love with Croydon. Particularly the bit we're going to be in, just off the 600 year old Surrey Street market on the High Street.\n\nAnd Croydon is *really* easy to get to from all over - we will be 25 minutes from Victoria or London Bridge, 30 minutes from Brighton or Shoreditch. Buses also converge on us, with 5 routes stopping just outside our door. We'll be a 5-10 minute walk from East Croydon and West Croydon train stations, right about here. \nSo, tell us about the venue\nWe're taking over a pizza restaurant which is in great shape. We need to decorate it a bit, and move things around, but nothing structural. \nThere will be shelf after shelf of games to play - over 700 of them -  and we'll also have a little shop area. We're really excited that we're going to have a small reading area for when you're waiting for your friends. We'll have a bunch of graphic novels, old fighting fantasy books, and RPG manuals to read onsite. \n To start with we're going to have 3 bespoke hexagonal tables as a homage to Catan, which started the modern board game revolution.\nThe cafe as it currently is\n Why Kickstarter?\nWe've been working on The Ludoquist for a long time. We have premises selected, and our contractors are about to start work on them. We've got all the permissions and licences we need (including for alcohol). We're ready to go.\nBut we want The Ludoquist to be fabulous, and that's where you come in. Kickstarter funds will enable us to fill the last gaps in our collection, and do some final flourishes on our fitout. Finally, of course, we want to allow our fans to show their support and create a starting membership.\nWhat do I get out of it?\nWell, you get the warm feeling of helping an exciting project get off the ground, and helping to build our community. All backers will be immortalised on our website, and will get early access during our training week.\nOf course, we also have various rewards for our backers. You can combine awards by simply adding the appropriate amount to your pledge. If you want a 'Limited' reward - royalty, or naming parts of the cafe - please ensure you select that reward and then add appropriate amounts to that.\nUnlimited Rewards\n Limited Rewards\n There are only a small amount of these, and they have to go on a first-come first-served basis. Mainly these are a bit of fun. If you want a 'Limited' reward - royalty, or naming parts of the cafe - please ensure you select that reward and then add appropriate amounts to that if you want add-ons (Eg Mugs, T-shirts, etc).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are very close to being ready to go.

Think of it as a sneak peek into the next version of Wits & Wagers, which we plan to release nationwide in Fall 2018 as a replacement for both Wits & Wagers Party and the original Wits & Wagers.\nHow can one game replace two games, you ask? By combining the best of both into one game that does it better than either. To get the word out, we're offering a limited-edition, over-sized playmat at a highly subsidized cost (we won\u2019t make a profit on this campaign). You can get everything you need to play Vegas Wits & Wagers through this Kickstarter. \n  Before we introduce Vegas Wits & Wagers, you should know what Wits & Wagers is. \nWits & Wagers is a party game we published in 2005. It was a hit, sold millions of copies, and became the most award-winning party game in history:  \n  Wits & Wagers is a betting game masquerading as a trivia game. You don't need to know the answers to win, because you can win by betting (fake) money on other players' answers. This transforms the game into a high-rolling, push-your-luck nail-biter. Gameplay is simple as pie:\nRead a fun question...everyone writes down a guess.\nPlace your bets...which guess is closest?\nFeeling confident? Bet on yourself.\nThink others know better? Bet on them.\nNo idea? Bet on any guess and hope you get lucky.\nAfter 12 years and thousands of plays, we've figured out how to make it better. A lot better: \n  Vegas Wits & Wagers improves what everyone loves about Wits & Wagers: the betting. The centerpiece is a stupid-big play mat:\n  Its size makes it a show-stopper. It will turn any gathering into a Vegas casino, everyone standing excitedly over the mat, praying for their bets to pay out. It has a powerful table presence and you'll see from the reviews below we're not the only ones who think so.\nCompare it to the play mat for regular Wits & Wagers:\nIt's made of a luxurious, thick neoprene that's hard to damage. You can swaddle a medium sized dog in it when the need arises:\nPLAY\n\nThe size of the mat isn't the only cool thing about Vegas Wits & Wagers:\n  Cool Thing #1 - Wonderful Ways to Wager\nThe mat gives players options for betting that make the game feel particularly casino-ey. \nCool Thing #2 - Two Games for the Price of One\nThe mat's reverse side is the mat for Wits & Wagers Deluxe: you get two games for the price of one (Vegas and Deluxe). \nCool Thing #3 - New Questions\nEvery stretch goal in this campaign is a pack of specially-themed new questions. See the Stretch Goals for details.  \nCool Thing #4 - Covers for Unused Betting Areas\nThe covers to make it super-clear where you can't bet (which varies with player count). The game is now drunk-proof.\n    We have a bunch stretch goals to unlock. Our lucky number. Every stretch goal is a specially-themed pack of new questions for the game. Here are the first 4:   \n          Our own Bruce Voge III takes us on the Vegas grand tour:\n       You might be able to tell this next guy really likes the game. \n  If videos aren't your thing, check out this written 5-star preview from MeepleGamers or this review from The Gaming Gang.\n  Shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge at checkout\nThe prices listed above are for single copies. We've also added pledge levels that allow you to get two copies of Vegas Wits & Wagers ($50 pledge level), or two copies of Vegas with two copies of Wits & Wagers Party ($80 pledge level). For these levels, the shipping is doubled. \nThere's a way to save on shipping if you're in the US and you don't already own Wits & Wagers Party: pledge the $25 level, and then buy Wits & Wagers Party at your local Target (Target also offers the game online).\nThe estimated delivery date is November 2017, but bear in mind this is an estimate. And If you back the $40 level, your copies of Vegas Wits & Wagers and Wits & Wagers Party may arrive at separate times.\nWhy no international shipping?\nVegas Wits & Wagers is physically heavy, and ships in a large tube to keep the huge mat crease-free. The tube also requires that Vegas and Wits & Wagers Party must be shipped in separate packages and from separate locations. These factors make international shipping prohibitively expensive (as you can see from the table above, even getting these games to Canada costs more the games themselves). In addition, Wits & Wagers is a North American-centric game with many questions that only people in North America would have any idea about. These factors have lead us to decide to offer this game only to North American backers.\n   Vegas Wits & Wagers\nEnormous Honking Play Mat\n30 poker chips, in $500 and $1000 denominations\n7 Dry Erase Answer Boards\n2 Elvis Betting Tokens\n1 Dry Erase Pen\n2 Betting Space Covers\n1 Full-color Rules\nAs many new trivia questions as we can unlock in the stretch goals\nIf you choose the pledge level that includes Wits & Wagers Party (you'll need it to play Vegas Wits & Wagers), you will also get:\nWits & Wagers Party \n210 Questions \n50 Poker Chips \n6 Dry Erase Answer Boards \n6 Dry Erase Pens 1 Permanent Answer Board (with a \"1\") \n12 Betting Tokens (6 in $100 denominations, 6 in $200 denominations)\n1 Full-color Rules\n    This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNorth Star Games has been publishing board games for almost 15 years.

Rounds are played just like the base game with alternating turns, round by round until each epoch is triggered. However, the Queen is less restrained by resource or route requirements making her a powerful force to reckon with! Players may face the Queen alone, or cooperate to defeat her (while still competing for the highest individual score).\nThe game's solo play is streamlined and elegant like the automa mechanics found in games such as Between Two Cities, Alhambra, Viticulture and Scythe.

I unveiled my prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. I am grateful for Feudum's wonderful reception back in November of 2016 and thrilled by its ever growing community.

His distinctive style of populating his art with monsters, reptiles and robots conjures up memories of children's picture books, albeit slightly skewed.

For a limited time, you can still pre-order the game. Just click on the \"Pre-Order\" button above!\nBuilding a city is no easy task. You would think so many races working to toward a common goal might make things easier, but everyone is just out for themselves, and too many dissonant voices cause only chaos.\nStill, building the legendary city of Gloomhaven is the task before you. Can your race use the resources of your opponents effectively enough to hold the most prestige when the city is complete? Can you leverage your influence and construct the building projects that will benefit your race the most?\nFounders of Gloomhaven is a competitive 2 hour city building game for 1-4 players. It is not an expansion to Gloomhaven, but a stand-alone Euro project that features a unique mix of tile placement, action selection, hand management, worker placement, and blind bidding.\nAll 18 stretch goals are included in all copies of the game!\n  In Founders of Gloomhaven, you will have control of a number of resources that you can place on the board as tiles.\nYou must combine your own resource tiles with those of your opponents to create more advanced resource tiles, and then deliver these resources to prestige buildings to earn points.\nThis is all accomplished through your decks of action cards. On your turn, you can play a card to take a variety of actions:\nTrade: Placing resource tiles or buying access to others' resources.\nRecruit: Hiring adviser cards to add to your deck, giving you more influence and extra powerful actions.\nUpgrade: Building advanced resources to increase your income and scoring opportunities.\nConstruct: Erecting personal buildings like houses and bridges, which will give you more control over the board state.\nYou can also call a vote, which will retrieve all the cards you have played, but doing so will allow all other players to collect income, and then it will trigger a blind vote on which new prestige building gets placed on the board and where it gets placed.\nPrestige buildings offer the major scoring opportunities in the game, so you would do well to control the vote whenever possible by spending influence, making sure the building which scores the resources you control is built.\nInterested in trying it out? No problem! One of my main Kickstarter goals is to give everyone the chance to really get in there and play the game before they back the project.\nThere are two main ways you can sit down and give the game a test drive.\nFirst of all, if you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, you can follow this link to the Founders of Gloomhaven module. There's no automation to the file, so you will still need the rule book handy.\nAlternately, you can download the print-and-play files to construct your own physical copy of the game. Currently we just have a high-ink version, but there will be a more printer-friendly version very shortly.\nHigh-Ink: [Double-sided 11x17 cardstock (2 pages)], [Single-sided 11x17 cardstock (8 pages)], [Map board]. (There are two copies of each tile so you can tape/glue them together to give the cardstock more weight and avoid any bleed issues.)\nLow-ink: [Full file - includes map] (Print it all single-sided, then tape/glue together the front and back of each tile.)\nKeep in mind that in all these versions, the art and design is not final and is subject to change.\nOr if you just want to watch someone else play the game, we have you well-covered there, too.\nIntroductory game play through from Rahdo:\nTwo-player full game run through from Tom Heath:\nThree-player full game run through from JonGetsGames:\nFour-player full game run through from Heavy Cardboard:\nSolo full game run through from Rolling Solo:\n      New to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.  \nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the city!\n$10 for shipping is included in the base price, which means there is no extra shipping charge for the US, Canada or China. All additional shipping fees for other countries are added automatically when you pledge.\nIn addition, the game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, Singapore, and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAlso note you can pledge for additional copies of the game by manually increasing your pledge amount, and you only have to pay the extra shipping fee for every three copies of the game. And don't worry if you can't do the math - the pledge manager will sort you out after the project ends.\nI am no stranger to slaying rats, destroying skeletons, and defacing board game components to honor and commemorate my wonderful Kickstarter supporters. This time around, however, instead of destroying things, I want to build.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar to the campaign, I will toil away in a variety of city-building video games and erect a grand structure in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come. You can watch the videos linked above to get a feel for what this will look like.\nThe main reward level will get you a copy of Founders of Gloomhaven, plain and simple, with no further effort required. All stretch goals are included.\nThere will be no add-ons, no Kickstarter exclusives, just the game delivered to your doorstep before it comes out in retail, at a significant discount off the expected retail price ($60-$70, depending on stretch goals).\nNot only that, but pledging to the Kickstarter gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. You will get weekly updates on the progress and development of the game.\nI love bringing games to Kickstarter because it gives me a chance to collaborate with this community, taking suggestions from the game's fans and using them to make the game better.\nFounders of Gloomhaven has been in development for over a year, and I am really excited to get it out into the world. As with all my designs, I believe it offers something unique and innovative to this great hobby, adding an incredibly high level of player interaction to the city-building genre and melding many disparate mechanics into a cohesive and engaging design.\nOnce you have played it, I hope you will feel the same way.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games.

Those who backed Gloom of Kilforth know that at Hall or Nothing Productions we deliver art like no other game does.  With nearly 300 utterly beautiful and unique images in Gloom of Kilforth, how many can we unlock for 1066, Tears to Many Mothers?\nNorman Swordsman, Local Resources\n  In 1066, Tears to Many Mothers each round players take turns to play cards and build their armies by deploying units, characters, tactics, attachments and playing events, all based on actual historical figures, weapons and occurrences that shaped the fateful day.\nBut whilst racing each other, players must also defeat a variety of historical objectives that their respective leaders had to conquer on their way to the Battle of Hastings, such as Harold having to overcome the Vikings at Stamford Bridge, or William mustering papal support before his perilous crossing of the channel to England.\nThe Battle of Hastings is fought over three Wedges of troops (as the real battle was), represented by three Wedge cards. Players compete for Wedges by trying to inflict 10 points of damage on each one. Careful hand management is required for victory, and the first player to claim two Wedges wins the game!\nRules in progress, full solo rules to be added later\nDownload a copy of the WiP latest rules HERE\nNorman Maceman, Norman Crossbowman\n    1066, Tears to Many Mothers was a runner up in the 2014 Golden Geek Awards, it was even nominated in the Origins Awards 2015 for 'Best Historical Board Game' - and it hasn't even been officially released yet.\nThe game and all the cards contained in it are fully playable solo, and an 'AI' bot with varying levels of difficulty for the enemy player has been developed in partnership with an expert team of solo players from the One Player Guild on boardgamegeek.  Some cards even have solo specific effects too:\nCastle on the Hill, and Stable Boys cards with their solo specific rules\nThe solo rules in progress can be found on boardgamegeek - they haven't been finalised yet but it will give you an idea of how the solo game plays.

Featuring 3 game modes Solo, Co-Op and Treachery for 1-5 players with or without an Evil Overlord.\n            Solo Survive the dungeon and its random boss encounter for victory, there is no resurrection in this mode.\n\nAdventure (Co-Op) Play co-operatively with your friends to complete quests, bury the head, defeat the cave serpent and destroy the spider\u2019s lair. Adventure mode can be played with or without an Evil Overlord. Letting the Chaotic evil person in your group try to kill you all. Up to 4 players and an Evil Overlord.\nTreachery (VS) You each control a hero and the dungeon and monsters that you pull on your turn, pitting them against your friends, setting off traps, looting your opponents whilst you try to keep the dungeon at bay. Each hero killed will gain you promotions, become the war chief to win. 2-4 players. \n You get to pick from one of the 4 castes:\nBerserker - Unleash powerful attacks use frenzy to increase your chance of performing multiple attacks. Charge your enemies and even attack multiple foes.\nShaman - Use tribal magic to summon spirits, transform into a raven or a feral bear, use your spiritual shield to protect you and your raiding party and blood wield your enemies.\nCultist - Inflict fear on your enemies, life drain monsters and even summon undead warriors to fight for you.\nHeadhunter - Use ranged abilities, poison arrows grind down large monsters, flaming arrows leave fire behind, improved aim and headshot abilities.\nThe ability cards require energy to use, you gain energy by rolling the attack and defence dice.\nWith enough energy you unleash devastating attacks on your enemies and that energy turns into experience, gain enough experience and you can level up your abilities.\n  The dungeon is randomly built from a deck of cards you draw from each turn as you and your band of Orcs explore. From corridors to room cards you never know what the next draw may bring. Will you encounter traps and spider nests, or luck upon a healing fountain or energy shrine? Or perhaps you will find resurrection runes to aid you as you travel deeper into the dungeon.\nYou may come across a room card that uses multiple cards to build one room. Simple build the room as detailed on the card drawn.\n  When you die your loot is stolen by the monster that killed you until you slay them to reclaim it. If you were killed by a trap your loot drops to the floor, anyone can claim your loot.\n  You may respawn on any of the resurrection tiles in the dungeon, resurrection tokens are limited. If at any time a player dies and cannot resurrect the mission has failed.\n  You encounter bosses in quests or randomly after a set time in solo mode, each boss has its own unique ability cards they will use to decimate you and your friends so beware.\n  The dungeons are filled with monsters of various levels, so be careful. They may make attacks of opportunity, or you could even get the attention of other players monsters, causing them to attack you instead.\nSlaying monsters gain you teef which allow you to buy goods from the sneaky goblin. Helpful items like poisonous trap kits and Dwarven toes could be yours - if you can pay for them. Remember, in Ravage Teef = Money!\nMonsters that are level 2 or higher have their own critical hit abilities allowing them to perform great feats in combat.\n  The game comes with 8 quests for Adventure mode, from burying the head of Zurbag to saving the sneaky goblin from a deal gone south.\n\nBut everyone knows Orcs are always looking for more adventures, right? Who knows, maybe there will be more to discover as the Kickstarter campaign goes on... \nRead the rulebook now\n                                                                                            You can download the rules here. Rules may be subject to change prior to printing.\nFour extra character ability cards, one more for each of our heroes. You are only allowed to have 5 cards on your character board so you would need to choose your abilities at the start of each game. So this will now make 6 ability cards per hero.\n     Play Ravage now on Tabletop Simulator in 2 modes.\n    You can play the single player Delve mode of Ravage, survive the dungeon and its random boss to win.\n       Play \"The Serpent's Pit\" quest in Adventure mode for 1-5 players, with or without an Evil Overlord.\n      Read the full review\n   Featured on Podcast Episode 24 - Polyhedron Collider\n          Read the full review\n  Ravage has been in the making for the past 3 years and has been in the playtest zone at the UK Games Expo in both 2015 and 2016, as well as played with multiple play test groups and on Modiphius game nights.\n   Undead Viking - Review\nBoard Game Brawl - Preview \nPrototype Version - Played at Board in Exeter\n    You can help choose a boss which I will complete with the help of my backers, during the campaign.\nThere are no mini\u2019s planned for this Kickstarter, as this is my first campaign and didn't want to bite off more than I could chew. This keeps the price lower for everyone. Adding in miniatures would drastically increase the funding needed to raise for the project. However, if this Kickstarter is successful then I see Ravage having minis at a later date, maybe as add-on packs for the game as it currently is.\n   A copy of the game with all stretch goals included\nA copy of the game with all stretch goals included in a wooden chest with a foam cored interior for the game in setup and play trays and a limited edition signed print and original artist sketch. See the Deluxe Chest section further down the page.\n                I will be using Modiphius\u2019s expertise for shipping as they have created several amazingly successful Kickstarters in the past including Achtung Cthulhu, Mutant Chronicles and Siege of the Citadel. They will be handling the shipping via GamesQuest.\nThese are the estimated shipping costs. Rest assured we will try to lower them as much as possible, throughout the Kickstarter.\n      For multiple copies of the game the pledge is \u00a330 per game, for the extra shipping costs please refer to the chart below. We are continuing to work with our shipping partners to try and add more countries to the list as the Kickstarter continues.\n    The deluxe limited edition wooden chest (35x25x25cm) comes with a foam cored interior designed and built by the game creator. It is able to handle sleeved cards and has trays that are laid out to make setup quick and that can be removed and used during play to organize your game. It includes a hand painted emblem of one of the Orc castes or your choice and a limited edition signed print and original artist sketch.\nThe deluxe chests are limited to 32 and no more will be unlocked or made available during the Kickstarter.\n      I wanted to draw dragons\u2026 I have been freelance illustrating for about the past 3 years, working for Modiphius (Winning Silver Ennie Award for the Cover of Terrors of the Secret War), Pelgrane Press, Rain Studios (War of Kings / and Terra Tiles Misty Moorlands and Coasts and Rivers). These were great to work for but none of them offered that high fantasy theme I relished. Dungeon crawlers hold a special place for me since firing up Dungeon Master on the Atari ST and playing Heroquest, so I started creating my own game. I tried to make it a game I would have chewed my right arm off to be involved in, and I have loved working on it. Fast forward 3 years, I have designed a game, created all the illustrations, graphic design, and swore a lot at Indesign as I crafted the rulebook and its layout. I can still draw dragons. I am just hoping to continue doing it for my own company Beardy Brothers.\nDragons sold separately\u2026 Here is an interview I did with Crazy Eights on Gaming Trend about Ravage.\n  After playing Ravage with the Modiphius crew back in 2016 at the UK Games Expo am delighted to have Modiphius Entertainment onboard co-publishing Ravage and helping advise on my Kickstarter and arranging distribution of games during and after the Kickstarter.\n  Picture shown with an earlier prototype.\n  I see Ravage as an expandable game with new expansions, including new locations, encounters, new mechanics and maybe hero packs maybe Gnolls and Kobalds and minis all depending on the success of this first Kickstarter I would love to delve more into Ravage and you can help shape the way the world unfolds.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ravagedungeonsofplunder/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/schofie404\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ianschofield/\nWebsite: http://beardybrothers.com/products/ravage-dungeons-of-plunder/\nBoardGameGeek: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182510/ravage-dungeons-plunder", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production is being handled by Whatz Games who also produce Welcome to the Dungeon, King of Toyko and Heroes of Normandie.\n\nAll the art has been created with the exception of the Stretch Goal additions and additional quests.

Since the dawn of time, numerous civilizations have risen over the fallen ashes of others, and yet every one of them had once shone brightly in its own moment of glory!  \nThe Flow of History is yet another innovative civilization game from Taiwanese designer Jesse Li (Ponzi Scheme). Players develop their nation using a unique bidding/price-setting mechanism to purchase new cards, but what is paid to the supply might also be harvested into the pockets of other players later, which puts a twist on your strategy for bidding, and also cleverly simulates economic inflation in the game.  \nThis game includes the value you have come to expect from a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game.\n  Michael Mindes, founder and CEO of Tasty Minstrel Games loves to fly over the Pacific Ocean, and by that I mean he loves to travel to East Asia and find games that he loves. A little over a year ago, Michael attended SmooxCon, which is like a ProtoSpiele for all of Taiwan. With the help of his friend Smoox, he was able to speak to game designers, publishers, and other industry folks. During this time, he was able to get in on some playtesting, and that was when he was able to play The Flow of History for the very first time. Even though the entire game was in another language, and he was soundly beaten, he knew that he had to publish the game and expose its awesomeness to a larger audience.\n\nTasty Minstrel Games is committed to not only publishing amazing and excellent games, we also want those games to look amazing and excellent as well. Our past Kickstarters for Orleans, Yokohama, and Chimera Station have set a high mark for Deluxified\u2122 components, and we will continue that with The Flow of History.\n\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make and deliver them to you the backer. For this reason, TMG will only make a Deluxified\u2122 version through crowdfunding. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales in Limited Quantity.\n  Want to learn how to play The Flow of History?

In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff. \n\nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis every day and questions will be answered at those times. \nAfter the campaign has concluded, the comments page will continue to be monitored on a regular basis, but with less frequency as before.  Any questions posted will be answered when they are seen. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers.\n\nAfter the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will still monitor the comments section of the campaign at regular intervals in case there are any situations that need our attention for another 30 days. At that point we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal support lines.\n\nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

Ember: Mage Nights sees a reprint of the wizard playing cards (in order for Ember to be a complete and playable game once more) and also includes thirteen Spell cards that offer even more replayability. With all new luck-mitigating rules and ever more game-play additions, this may be the final expansion for Ember, but for the players, the quest is only just beginning!\nWIZARD CARDS: The Wizard Cards are a reprint of the original core game Wizard cards in a brand new box. These cards are completely reworked to make them crystal clear and to remove any of the vagaries that surrounded some of the original cards.\nWizard Card - Clarified\nMAGE NIGHTS - THE SPELLS: Mage Nights contains thirteen brand new spell cards that go in the Draw Deck and allow you to either use those powers as wild cards in conjuring, or to perform spells like the mighty Fireball, or to heal damage done to your creatures with Cure Light Wounds.\nHere's a summary of the promo cards you've unlocked (and the unicorn which is to come)...\nFive Fabulous Stretch Goal Promo Cards\nIn Ember, you are an apprentice wizard competing to conjure the most powerful magical creatures of legend out of mystical true-fire. Each creature has a unique ability which can aid your efforts or hamper your opponents. \nThe Game is played over multiple rounds, split between two main phases: The Draw Phase and the Conjure Phase. \nDuring the Draw Phase, you use the cards in your hand to conjure new creatures from the Pool of creatures available in the game.\nEmber Pool of Creatures and Artifacts\nYou Conjure creatures based on the Wizard cards in your hand. Like traditional playing cards, each Wizard card has an element and a number value from 1 to 13. \nEmber: Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and an Archmage card\nEach turn you may Conjure one available creature from the Pool. Each creature has a unique ability which further allows you to manipulate the game.\nEmber Creature Cards\nIn your turn, you decide to conjure the Hummingbird VP 2. It has a conjuring cost of Two Matching Wizards (two cards of the same number). You discard that combination of cards from your hand and take Hummingbird from the Pool and put it in to your play area. \nIt goes in the Ready position, which is oriented face up. You may use its ability at any time (the Hummingbird's power allows you to take the top card of the Discard Pile). Whenever you use a creature's ability, that creature is Exhausted and needs to recover (by being turned 90 degrees to the right at the start of its owner's turn).\nThe game continues until one player has reached the designed Victory Point goal for that game. At that point the End Game begins where all players use their remaining powers to manipulate the game one final time before the scores are tallied and the winner is the player with the highest Victory Points! \nNew Rules: Mitigating the Luck\nTo stop players from Conjuring the most powerful creatures in the first turns, only the first 6 VPs are revealed at the start of the game. With each new turn, the First Player reveals a new set of VP cards.\nThe Pool of Creatures at the Start of a Game\nCheck out our Solo Play rules  \nCheck our Eric Miller's Solo Play Monsters and Minions rules.  \nEmber has changed.

Jane Austen\u2019s novels about love and the conventions of 19th Century society are more popular than ever and have been constantly re-adapted for the big screen and television. Although modern life is very different from Austen\u2019s era, the passions, misunderstandings and social awkwardness still ring true; dating can be a ruthless game.\nPlay-testing at Christmas\n  I first read Jane Austen\u2019s novels while living in Hampshire, not far from the village of Chawton where she grew up. The sheer number of colourful characters who were looking to tie the knot while navigating the obstacles of polite society seemed like a game, so I felt compelled to make one!\nRather than focus on a single novel, I thought it might be fun to have all the characters in the same world, where they could meet up, and maybe even hook up. What would the formidable Mr Darcy make of the equally formidable Emma Woodhouse? Imagine if they got married and Mr Knightley went off with Fanny Price! And so Jane Austen\u2019s Matchmaker was born.\nMr Darcy has it all, but his aloofness makes him less charming. Will he see beyond Miss Bennet's lack of fortune? You decide!\n  In Matchmaker, you take characters under your wing and try to find them suitable partners. Some characters want to fall in hopelessly in love but others are more pragmatic - or just plain mercenary!\nYou'll discover your characters\u2019 motives with the roll of a dice. Each character has a preference which makes them more likely to prefer a particular \u2018trait\u2019 - Charm, Virtue, Rank or Fortune.\nMaking a suitable match \u2013 for example marrying one of your gold-diggers to a rich suitor \u2013 will earn you more prestige. The player who earns the most prestige wins the game.\n    You can gain even more prestige by earning the approval of patrons. Mrs Norris only approves of people with a good fortune whereas Lady Bertram is more impressed by charm.\nIn addition to making matches, you can invite characters to prestigious residences to boost your prestige still further. Make sure you invite the right sort of guest, they don't approve of riffraff at Mansfield Park!\nThe original Matchmaker card game was intended for social play (3 or more players) but I received many requests for a 2-player variant. Jane Austen's Matchmaker: Chapter 2 was designed with this in mind.\nWhether you play head to head or with up to three other players, you must assess each proposal and your chances of coming out on top, before you accept or decline.\n   You can download a low resolution pdf of the rule book here.\n      I commissioned UK illustrator Emily Hare to create the likenesses of the eligible ladies and gentlemen for the original game. For Chapter 2 I wanted to add a supporting cast of the matriarchs, well-wishers and oddballs that make Jane Austen\u2019s stories so memorable, from the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourgh to delightfully awkward Miss Bates.\nI also wanted to include the residences that feature so prominently stories \u2013 Pemberley, Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey to name but a few. I think Emily has done a fantastic job bringing the people and places of Austen's world to life.\n    \u00a37,000 Linen finish cards - ACHIEVED!\nFor smoother shuffling and a luxurious game experience.\n\u00a38,000 Black core cards - ACHIEVED!\nThe most resilient type of playing card for improved longevity.\n\u00a39,000 Deluxe box adornment\nSpot varnish on box to make Matchmaker the perfect gift for any Jane Austen fan.\n\u00a330,000 Exclusive cards\nMeet Lady Susan from the eponymous novella (and the film Love & Friendship).

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

Can your Orc's work together long enough to complete them all?\nTreachery (VS) You each control the dungeon and monsters that you pull on your turn, pitting them against your friends, setting off traps, looting your opponents whilst you try to keep the dungeon at bay. Each hero kill will gain you promotions, become the war chief to win. \nYou get to pick from one of the 4 castes:\nBerserker - Unleash powerful attacks charge at your enemies, frenzy and attack multiple foes.\n Shaman - Using your tribal magic transform into a raven or a bear, summon spirits and blood wield your enemies.\n Cultist - Inflict fear, life drain your enemies and even summon the undead to fight for you.\n Head Hunter - Use poison and flaming arrows to destroy your enemies and even take headshots.\n  Each hero has a set of weapons and ability cards that require energy to use, you gain energy by rolling the attack and defence dice, once you have enough energy you can unleash these devastating attacks on your enemies and that energy you used turns into experience, gain enough experience and you can level up your abilities.\nThe dungeon is presented in a deck of cards, cards are drawn each turn for you to explore the dungeon, they include hallways or room cards, for you to construct your dungeon randomly every time. You will encounter traps as you traverse through the dungeon it's not a safe place to be, as you and your friends will discover.\n    If you die your loot either sits by the trap that killed you or runs around the dungeon with the monster that killed you until slain, anyone can claim your loot.\nIf you have enough resurrection tokens, you may resurrect on any of the resurrection points in the dungeon, these are limited so take care. If at any time a player dies and cannot resurrect you will fail your quest.\n  Monsters are a plenty, and they are all heading for you, each monster has a critical success ability, you can also aggro monsters and they will take attacks of opportunity. Slaying monsters gains you teef, which you can spend on trinkets and traps with the sneaky goblin and remember Teef = Money\n    You encounter bosses in quests or randomly after a set time in the solo mode, each boss has its own unique ability cards they will use to decimate you and your friends so beware. \n  The game comes with 8 adventures for co-op mode, from placing the head of Zurbag to saving the sneaky goblin from a deal gone south. But only you can help decide if there are going to be even more adventures that need to be taken. More adventures are available through stretch goals for the Goblin Trinket and Pledge Hammer reward tiers.\n  Download the rules: You can download the rules here.

These were great to work for but none of them offered that high fantasy theme I relished.

We have put August as a definite date backers will receive their games no later by.\n    For an in depth overview download the basic (non graphic designed or professionally proofread as of yet) rulebook below or here!\nBlind Bidding and Social Deduction - Use your witches to blind bid for player order. The lower the number, the more likely you will get to pick first. But, lower numbered witches pick up less valuable and fewer cards than higher numbered witches. So you must play your witches at the right time, for the right resources, while gauging which of the other witches may be sent out. Since used witches are discarded face up - you can figure out which witches are left in each player's coven to deduce what they might play next...\nTie-breaker mechanic - Whoever receives the \"Favour of Hecate\" card wins in tie-break situations. This therefore requires greater thought given into deducing the witch each player will play.\nSet collection - The core mechanic of the game. Collect sets of the same ingredient cards to create even more powerful potions for higher spell points. However, with the limited capacity in each of the Cauldron Cards you must decide where to place ingredient cards carefully, to score maximum points in future rounds.\nPush your luck - As above the Cauldron Cards add an element of element of push your luck as you try to maximise your score. It works by allowing players to place ingredient cards in different capacity Cauldrons. Place ingredients in larger cauldrons while waiting too long for the same ingredient type may hinder creating other potions.\nSecret objectives - *New addition added after reviewer copies sent* Each player is given a recipe card which gives three extra ways to score secret bonuses. Either they are a combination of different ingredient card types or singular and specific ingredient cards that can be in the cauldron. This also adds an interesting element of deduction to the game since players must tell others they have scored bonus points, but the other players do not know until the end of the game how they scored them!\nDownload Cauldron Master for TableTop Simulator!\n  Want to play a game yourself OR even, with us?

Whenever we've encountered problems or hurdles (there were very few but obviously unforeseen delays are inevitable), we've let everyone know. We want to build your trust to believe in us to make games of the highest quality and fun that are delivered on time. \nDelivered on time\nOur first game Lab Wars raised $65000\nWhen we developed Lab Wars our number 1 priority was making a great game that was delivered on time. Being backers ourselves, there's nothing more frustrating than a kickstarter delivered significantly late. We promised February 2017 and 96% of lab wars backers received theirs on time. Although hitches may happen, given that more of the artwork is done this time round compared to lab wars, and having simplified the logistics and shipment process we're confident we can deliver on time for no later than August 2017.\nWorld class manufacturing\nWe are using Whatz Games, based in China, who produced our last game: Lab Wars, but also was responsible for manufacturing well known games such as King of Tokyo and the Valeria Series. We've had lots of compliments from our previous backers who complimented the quality of the production and material. So we're sticking with Whatz again to make sure Cauldron Master will be just as good!\nOverview of manufacturing and fulfilment process\nIf successfully funded early we will: \nsend all the artwork to the manufacturer towards the end of the campaign (end of March) \nWe have been told this will be ready for the process to begin early april \nManufactuing completed the end of April. \nThe games will then be airfreighted to UK and pass customs for mid-May. \nWe'll then start shipping them out towards the end of May for backers to receive in June. Fulfilment will be handled in-house in the UK as we have a business Royal Mail account which allows us to be very competitive and ship internationally. We did this for 25% of lab wars backers ourselves and went smoothly. \nIn the event of delays we have put a precautionary delivery date of August in case of problems or hiccups, however, given that the artwork is 95% complete the process of sending over to the manufacturer and approving the work should be relatively straightforward. \nGoing to the UK Games Expo 2017?\nIf as planned we receive the games mid-may and you are going to the UK Games Expo you can collect them from us from the UKGE and receive a refund towards your shipping costs too! \n  As mentioned above, this project is internationally friendly!\n  The price you pay, is what we pay to ship to you\nRemember: Since we have a business account with Royal Mail we can ship internationally very competitively.  \n  The team behind Cauldron Master\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always, there may be hiccups in the manufacturing and shipment process.

Gather your squad of Giant Killer Robots (GKRs), build your deck, and face your rivals in the ultimate fight for fame, fortune, and sweet salvage rights. Scheme, strategize and strong-arm your way to victory as you dominate the media landscape, one billboard at a time. \nTHE ROBOT RUMBLE STARTS NOW!\n      GKR: Heavy Hitters is a standalone, customizable tabletop game for 1-4 players, combining high-quality collectibles with dice-rolling, mech-building and tactical play! Pilot your Heavy Hitter (the biggest, baddest robot on the board) and a squad of three Support Units through the ruins of an old city, competing to either wipe your opponent off the map or reduce four skyscrapers to rubble.  \nKEY GAME FEATURES\nA unique hex-based tabletop gameplay experience\nx4 Giant high-quality Heavy Hitter miniatures up to 139mm tall\nx12 highly detailed Support Units  standing up to 47mm tall.\nx10 Buildings that break up the landscape and alter the way you play, every time\nx193 cards with unique artwork from Weta Workshop artists\nFour corporate Factions, each with its own weapons and abilities\nFour Pilots with special skills\nFive distinct phases of play\nTwo ways to win!\nTHE WORLD OF GKR\nThe story goes like this...Big plague. People died. Governments fell over. Things got bad, real fast. Fortunately, the corporations saved the day! Under their command, things got a whole lot better. But what to do with all those abandoned cites? There\u2019s money to be made in the salvage rights. But which corporation gets them? Enter the Giant Killer Robots League.\nAIM OF THE GAME\nThere are two ways to win GKR: Heavy Hitters. Defeat your opponent through brute force, or reduce four buildings to rubble by Tagging them with advertising. Winning is a careful balance of managing energy, repairing damage, earning new Pilot skills, gathering and using sponsor-endorsed upgrades, and moving into positions that give you tactical advantage for your unique weapons.\nCHOOSE YOUR PILOT\nPart superstar athletes, part celebrity spokespeople for their corporate Factions, these guys have been chosen as much for their ability to drive Heavy Hitters as for their ability to drive ratings. Pick your Pilot carefully! Each will unlock special skills and upgrades on the Achievement board to help you strategize your way to victory. \nCHOOSE YOUR FACTION\nGKR: Heavy Hitters features four unique corporate Factions. Each has a squad of GKRs ready for you to take control, including one Heavy Hitter and three Support Units with a whole heap of special abilities. As Pilot, you get to pick one Faction to fight for. Which will you take into combat?!\n   DEPLOY PHASE\nThis is your chance to deploy your Support Units to the field. The Combat, Repair and Recon Units come with attack and defence capabilities unique to your Faction. \nMOVEMENT PHASE\nNext, move your Heavy Hitter and Support Units into a tactical position on the battlefield.\n  COMBAT PHASE\nTime for the smackdown! In the Combat Phase, Factions attack and defend against each other with the roll of the dice. Rather than turn-based order, weapon speed determines who strikes first.\n  Every Heavy Hitter has an arsenal of Primary Weapons, Secondary Weapons, and Orbital Strike. Primary Weapons are broken into 3 classes: Energy, Missile, and Ballistic. Use your cards wisely! If you sustain damage, you lose cards. If you lose all your cards to damage, you\u2019re OUT!\n TAGGING PHASE\nThis is your chance to assert advertising dominance on the battlefield. Place four Tags on a building and you demolish that Building. Demolish four Buildings, and you win the game!\nFor each Building you Tag, you also earn a Sponsor Card. Use \u2018em throughout the game to give you a tactical advantage through hacking, counter-hacking, or even a spot of corporate espionage.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of a Sponsor Card. They can tip the balance between sweet victory and humiliating defeat!\nRESET PHASE\nThe final phase of the round is the Reset. Draw new Faction Cards, replenish your energy and get ready for another round of robot rumble!\n\nUpgrade to plastic Dashboard available in Stretch Goals!\n         No game is complete without putting it through its paces in the playtesting arena.

As the R&D Lead Designer, Matt has more than 30 board and card game releases to his name, working with iconic properties such as DC Comics, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Naruto, Street Fighter, Cartoon Network, and many more. \nOn home turf, we\u2019ve been able to call on the talents of the incredible Weta Workshop crew: from model makers, painters and motion graphics artists, to marketing and management maestros, graphic designers, and behind-the-scenes image-makers.\nWe\u2019d like to thank everyone who has poured their time and effort into GKR: Heavy Hitters, including all the people we\u2019ve met on our playtesting sessions across New Zealand, Australia, and North America!\n Backers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand, and the USA will not have to pay any extra fees!                                                              \nShipping of the GKR: Heavy Hitters Kickstarter will be coordinated by our dedicated Consumer Products team here at Weta Workshop in Wellington, New Zealand. We have more than 15 years\u2019 experience shipping collectibles, merchandise, and other types of consumer products all over the world! For this Kickstarter, our planned fulfilment centres are located in the USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. Your order will ship from the closest hub to your country. \nFinalized shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends, through our Pledge Manager. Revised estimates for shipping our GKR: Heavy Hitters Core Box follow. \nPlease note that these are estimates ONLY. We will be charging shipping based on the EXACT cost required to ship you the game, the applicable Stretch Goals, and Add-Ons. \nUSA - $35\nCANADA $40 \nEU - $40 (excluding EEC countries) \nNZ - $25 \nAUSTRALIA - $40 \n *All prices are in USD, and include all Tax, Duties, and Customs. \nTo all our New Zealand backers: We\u2019re hoping to give you the option to pick your game up in person from the Workshop. Watch this space as plans are taking shape! \nRegions where additional fees may apply (all prices quoted in USD): \nNon-EU EEC Countries - $40 \nAsia - $50 (China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, & Vietnam) \n Rest of the world - $110 \nPLEASE NOTE: There are different import laws and customs entry rules for some countries that may prevent your goods arriving. Please check your country\u2019s rules and regulations relating to the importing of goods. \n If your wallet\u2019s feeling the burn on those shipping costs, rest assured \u2013 we hear you (and your wallet). Here\u2019s the deal, though: those shipping costs are pretty colossal because GKR: Heavy Hitters is a pretty colossal game! I mean, check out this size comparison\u2026 \nHapsi soda can used for scale reference only\n  And rest assured \u2013 we\u2019re packing a whole lotta goodies in the final package. Including many Kickstarter exclusives that you won\u2019t be able to get anywhere else! We reckon you\u2019ll be stoked with the final product and we can\u2019t wait for our box, to land in your mailbox.\n\n\nCancellations and Refunds Policy\nWe know that sometimes, situations change. Maybe you\u2019ve spent all your pocket money getting the rust off your Recon Unit. Maybe you bet the house on King Wolf winning Division One. Whatever the reason, if you find yourself seeking a refund, here\u2019s what we offer:   \nYou may cancel your order at any time during the funding phase. We recommend you have a quick read of the Kickstarter terms and conditions before you pledge \u2013 they can be found here.\nAll pledges are binding at the closure of the GKR: Heavy Hitters Kickstarter. After this time, no refunds or alterations will be available.\nIf you receive a damaged item, you may return it for a replacement. All replacements are subject to availability and proof of damage. If no replacement is available, we\u2019ll refund you in full.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe estimated delivery for GKR: Heavy Hitters is December 2017. This may be our first Kickstarter, but rest assured, this isn\u2019t our first rodeo: we\u2019ve created and delivered high-quality consumer products for more than 15 years. We have fantastic relationships with our manufacturers and distributors, who - like us - have very high standards when it comes to quality and meeting deadlines. \n\nIn this industry of manufacture and logistics, there\u2019s always the possibility of unexpected delays on matters like production, shipping and customs. Best laid plans, and all that. While we can\u2019t foresee every bump in the road, here\u2019s what we do know: We\u2019ve put many, many months of planning and love into making sure that the manufacture of GKR: Heavy Hitters goes as smoothly as possible. We guarantee you that this product has our full attention, with a dedicated team on board every step of the way. In the extremely unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the game, we\u2019ll refund all pledges in full. That said, we\u2019ve got no reason to expect that this will occur. \n\nIf we do hit speed bumps along the way, we\u2019ll get the message out to our backers openly, honestly, and immediately.\n\nOur goal is to share the world of Giant Killer Robots through a fantastic game that\u2019s an absolute blast to play.

There are options for competitive, cooperative, and solo play!\nAt the start of the game, each player drafts his or her own team of four heroes and uses tactical movement and cardplay to overcome the dungeon's monsters and acquire treasures. Rival teams may compete with one another to slay monsters, or even battle one another for complete domination. \nOnly one Dungeon Alliance will prove victorious!\nDungeon Alliance may be played with or without player-vs-player combat at the players' discretion.  \n    Initial Goal - Funded!!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Soundly Defeated... and Unlocked!\n  Every copy of Dungeon Alliance includes:\n17 Hero Miniatures\n16 Colored Snap-On Bases\n25 Dungeon Tiles\n12 Board Frame Pieces\n17 Hero Cards\n51 Starting Deck Cards\n32 Generic Starting Cards (Basic Game)\n76 Upgrade Cards\n8 Reference Cards\n16 Solo / Cooperative Play Cards\n23 Encounter Cards\n64 Encounter Tokens\n40 Wound Tokens (Wood)\n208 Miscellaneous Tokens\n4 Draft Bonus Charts\n1 Dungeon Die\n12 Quest Cards (NEW!)\n12+ Campaign Tokens (NEW!)\n  We have now unlocked the Stretch Goal for the Deck of Many Treasures! Here are some details on how it will work:\nThe Deck of Many Treasures will be a separate deck of cards.\nWhenever a Hero opens a Treasure Chest or Locked Chest, he or she will have the option of either just receiving XP as normal, or \"digging deeper\" into the chest for an additional reward.\nIf a Hero pushes their luck by digging deeper, they will draw one of three types of cards:\nMagic Item: The Hero discovers a one-shot magical item that they can choose to use once per game. This card goes into the Alliance Deck, and is discarded immediately after use.\nTrap!: The Hero springs a trap. The Hero will have the opportunity to disarm the trap (rolling the Dungeon Die and using any special cards that help) to earn XP. If the Hero fails, they suffer the effects of the trap.\nMimic: The treasure chest springs to life and attacks! If the Hero can defeat the Mimic, he or she earns bonus XP. Otherwise, it will attack any Hero who approaches it for the rest of the game.\nWe can't wait for you to enjoy this exciting new feature that has been added to the Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion! As a Kickstarter Backer, it's yours for free the day you receive your game!\n  Thanks to the feedback of the Dungeon Alliance Community, we have added 12 Quest Cards that create an alternate source of XP during the game, as well as a way to earn Campaign Points that players can use to increase the strength of their dungeon parties over the course of several adventures!\nQuest Cards also provide a Win / Loss Condition for solo and cooperative games for those players who prefer an extra level of challenge!\nQuest Cards\nWe have included these new components and rules to the base game of Dungeon Alliance at no additional cost to backers! If the Kickstarter Campaign reaches its first goal, every copy of the game will include these new components.\n  Every Kickstarter backer receives the Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion for free! For a limited time, this expansion will only be available to Kickstarter backers. \nThe Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion includes the Hero Figures, Hero Cards, and Starting Deck Cards for four new Heroes, and also includes several new Upgrades. As we reach Stretch Goals, we may add even more elements to the expansion! But no matter how big it gets, it's all yours for FREE right now!\nBartholomew, Sonja, Kulldrak, and Taio\nYou will receive everything that ends up in the first expansion, except for the printed expansion box and rulebook. The rulebook will be downloadable to all backers in PDF format.\n  Every Kickstarter Backer will receive exclusive Epic Hero versions of the heroes from the game. Players who have drafted many cards for their favorite heroes can switch their Hero Cards out for these alternate art versions as a sign of the heroes' progress.\nAlthough these exclusive cards do not change the gameplay of Dungeon Alliance, they add a new level of immersion to the game. These Epic Hero cards are a special thank-you to our backers and will never be available after the Kickstarter campaign (except for charity events).\nAt the start of the campaign, there will be 5 Epic Hero Cards available for free to all backers. As we reach stretch goals, we will commission more art to add more free cards to the exclusive set!\nUPDATE: We have accomplished our first four Stretch Goals, and so now all 21 Epic Hero Cards have been unlocked and are included in the Kickstarter version of Dungeon Alliance!\nEpic Melinda, Jypzy, Petra, Taio, and Holgar\n    Our Dungeon Champion Pledge Level ($120) includes a full set of painted miniatures.

This allows players to customize the type of team they'd like to play.\nYou will receive the Hero Card, Hero Figure, and 3 unique Starting Deck Cards associated with each of your heroes. Together, all 12 of your Starting Deck Cards form the basis of your personal Alliance Deck. Because of this, each player begins with a completely different Alliance Deck at the start of the game.\nBuild Your Deck\nAs you defeat monsters and overcome challenges, you will earn Experience Point Tokens (XP). You can flip these XP Tokens face down to purchase Upgrade Cards for your Alliance Deck.\nConquer the Dungeon!\nDuring each cycle of the game round, you will activate one of your heroes to move and attack monsters on the dungeon map. You will then have the opportunity to spend XP to purchase new upgrade cards that will go directly into your hand.\nAfter each of your opponents has moved a hero, you will each control one monster on the board to strike back at the heroes. The players control the monsters so that the monster attacks will be both strategic and meaningful.\nThere are four play cycles to each game round, after which the current round ends and the next round begins. At the end of the fourth game round, the Alliance that has acquired the most XP Tokens wins!\n    Our two main packages, Dungeon Ally ($80) and Dungeon Champion ($120), ship anywhere in the world.

The miner who makes the most money at the end of the day is declared the winner!\nIn the Move Phase, players move, ram and block each other for the best spots to dig. Rammed carts drop precious ore that can be swiped if you're quick and cunning!\nIn the Dig Phase, players take turns digging for, stealing or swiping dropped ore. Once they have the ore, they can sell it to the bank or rush to the Contract Agents to fill valuable contracts!\nHow to win!\nIn ORE-SOME you'll be playing Lewis, Zoe, Jessie or Doc Francis - miners pushing and pulling unreliable minecarts around a maze-like mine - competing to gather the most ore, fill the most contracts and ultimately earn the most gold in a single day!\nSetting Up\nFirst you'll build the mine.\nPlayers will take turns placing mine tiles. There's normal tiles and a special tile for each player where you'll earn double if you dig there but no-one gets to place their own special tiles!\nEverybody Move!\nEverybody rolls a dice. Then you take turns moving your cart 1 to 3 tracks depending on the roll. \nDon't like what you rolled? Hidden Springs, Whack the Lever, Oil Slick or Uphill can help you get where you want to be. \nSo can slamming into walls or, even better, other players!\nBe careful! Any time ore drops from your cart it stays where it is and someone might swipe it before you can get back to it! \nWatch your back! If other players hit you - you're shunted! You'll end up where you didn't want to be and if your cart's really full you'll drop a piece of ore too!\nDig!\nAfter moving, everyone takes turns working the tile they've ended up on.\nOn your turn you dig for ore: two on a normal tile, four on your special tiles! Keep your hands steady if your cart is bursting, the dropped ore rule still counts!\nYou can also (once!) pick up any ore on your tile - whether you dropped it or not!\nYou can also hand in contracts or sell to the Bank. \nIf you want to hand in contracts - you better have the right ore and be in range of the contract agents! They roam the mine looking for the player with the most ore, the least ore, the closest cart or the youngest player so you might need to hold on to that ore an extra turn or two. Or play it safe and sell to the bank for less cash...\nDraw!\nAt the end of your turn you can discard any cards you don't want and then fill your hand back up to five.\nAnd More!\nWe've not even talked about Dynamite, Cave-ins, Jackpots, Pickaxes or Scraps, our adorable pup who'll ride around in your cart - protecting you from thieves and sabotage!\nY'all might want to have a read of our beautiful rulebook:\nClick to read!\nor watch the guys from Man vs Meeple talk you through it:\nIf we exceed the funding we need to make ORE-SOME a reality, we're ready to put that extra funding to work making it the best game we can.

This is Ember.\nThese are three of the FREE promo cards you can get with the Stretch-Goal related mini expansion \"The Darke\". Find out more about The Darke expansion as we move into this final weekend.\nBrand New Rules: The inclusion of Rules 1.6 mean that Ember is a very different game - but don't worry - all cards are fully compatible with previous versions, the 1.6 rules see a very tense and exciting game filled with random creature powers that can utterly change the way Ember plays.\nDownload the new version 1.6 rules here. \nLIGHT AND DARK supercharges your game with twenty new cards across two exciting packs - each packed with game-changing mechanics. There's a lot to deal with in Light and Dark!\nPRISMATIC PACK \u00a35. The Prismatic pack boosts your creatures' abilities and adds a whole new collection of magical monsters to Conjure. \nSPECTRAL PACK \u00a35: Introduces ten creature cards that curse and hinder your enemies with dark magic. Conjure these creatures and steal the Victory Points for yourself, while the cards curse your enemies with powers that range from stripping the cards in their hand to making their creatures weaker. Beware, for what you reap so may you sew, for the owner can choose to Conjure the creature in their turn and send it right back at you! \nEVERYTHING PLEDGE: For those that have missed the chance to back Ember so far, here's the Everything Pledge. This is for The Core Game, From the Ashes, and BOTH Light and Dark Packs. You're getting almost 200 super high quality cards for just \u00a332 - that's a bargain!\nIf you want ALL the cards ever produced, there's a Kitchen Sink Pledge, which includes every promo card we ever made, along with every expansion and starter set! Bonus!\nSo, if you were ever on the fence about Ember, there has never been a better time to stick your wand in and pick up a copy!\nVenture ever deeper into the dungeon to unlock our exciting Stretch Goals.\nThe Conjuring Cards are a selection of high quality postcard-sized sheets which list all the Conjuring Costs for all the creatures in the game - utterly invaluable when you're playing Ember.\nAll backers will get the above 2017 promo cards with any pledge level. That's already 24 cards for the price of 20! PLUS...\nAll backers will also get 5 mini postcard Conjuring Cost crib sheets - far more invaluable than you could possibly imagine right now!\nAnd, if that wasn't enough, all backers currently get FIVE \"Darke\" mini-expansion cards. Five cards and counting...\nEmber is a fast-paced fantasy game with elements of creature collection and take that! It's a game of strategy, of acting and reacting to the creatures your enemies' Conjure. \nDuring Ember\u2019s hundreds of playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:    \nThat Ember is an intro game that can be learned by all ages in just a few minutes.  \nMultiple ways to play: Ember has a variety of different ways to play based on your play-style. Casual Play, Hardcore, or even Battle Mode. \nA simple, yet surprisingly strategic game.  \nThe beautiful and highly evocative art.  \nThat you can mix and match cards to suit your strategy (don\u2019t want an end game? Fine, just take out those cards. Hate the Take That element? No problem, just remove those cards, too. Ember is designed to be enjoyed in multiple ways with a variety of different rules to appeal to every gamer type. \nThe often tense and tactical endgame (where anything can change).\nFantastic Quality. Check the reviews - everyone's impressed! You can't get better quality cards and it really does show! Printed by one of the world's top manufacturers, these 310g black core card stock cards are of sensational quality\nSeal of Approval: Over the Saturday and Sunday of UK Games Expo 2016, almost 97% of participants who played a demo game of Ember went on to purchase a copy - that speaks volumes about the quality and how much fun Ember is!\nThe Game has Changed! With new rules, Ember is forever transformed from a game of simple creature conjuring into an action packed arena where every choice you make can affect the game play and result in blazing victory or crushing defeat. We're not joking, version 1.6 of the rules sees massive changes to the way the game plays... but don't worry, it's still fully compatible with the core game, or you can just play with the old rules - the choice is completely yours!\nPlay Light and Dark any way you like! It's a completely customizable game with as many house rules as you care to dream up!\nThe Prismatic Pack contains the cards of light, the healers and protectors of the Emberverse. The cards are all designed to protect play, to mitigate card effects and card loss. All the standard cards have two powers - a first in the Ember universe.\nThree of the Prismatic cards provide 0 VP (Victory Points) on their own, but their VP are instead dependent on the cards you have in play.\nThen you have Iridia, the Elemental Prismatic Dragon, whose powers focus on protection, of increasing your powers, and defending your forces against the powers of the Spectral.\nEach Elemental Dragon has an legendary power which can be used if you control all three parts of that dragon, in this case, Irridia's ability allows you to give a creature you control +1 VP whenever any other player modifies a creature with a +1 VP or -1VP token. Powerful!\nThe Spectral cards are the powers of evil, of darkness and malevolence. These ten cards will give you the power to strip your opponents of their abilities, to force players to discard valuable cards, and to reduce the VP of their own creatures.\nAnd then you have Sinistra, the Elemental Dragon God of Shadow. Her trio of powers are alone formidable, but when combined, she can affect all opponents with her powers every turn. Now that's nasty!\nSinistra is definitely a game changer... \nCheck out the brand new review of Ember: Light and Dark from the Australian BoardGame Network by clicking here or on the image below.\nALSO, check out these reviews of the OLD version 1.5 rules, which are completely suitable for younger children and have very simple and easy to follow rules.

You and up to five friends are cave explorers who have become trapped deep underground. You must quickly explore a tile-based cave system, utilise your character's specialist skills and carefully manage your actions to find the way out before your flashlights die and you're lost in the darkness forever.  \nYou'll need to work together to overcome deadly subterranean hazards - stick together for safety, or split up to cover more ground. One wrong step could knock you unconscious and your friends will need to stage a rescue. Light and hope are scarce. And worst of all, you don't think you're alone down here...\n Looking for the Stretch Goal announcements?\n  Let's descend...\n        Check out the how to play video below (courtesy of Toucan Play that Game), which outlines the game setting, objectives, gameplay and some strategies for attempting your escape!\nSub Terra is a team-based push-your-luck game. Together, you'll decide what risks are worth taking and when. The caves is a dangerous place - no matter how well you plan, things WILL go wrong, and your survival depends on how well you react to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE: Escape the cave before you run out of time.\n1) CAVERS: Everyone picks a caver, and gives that caver 3 health points. There are eight characters to choose from in Sub Terra - each has unique abilities that change how they play\n2) TILES: Cavers begin the game on the START TILE. You're all trying to get to the EXIT TILE, which is near the bottom of the TILE STACK.\n3) ACTIONS: Every round, each caver has two action points to spend (and can risk a health point for a third) \nThe basic actions are: \nReveal (Flip the top tile of the stack and place it a gap next to your current location) \nMove (Move to an adjacent connected tile) \nExplore (Reveal a tile, then immediately Move onto it. Faster, but riskier!) \nHeal (You or another caver on your tile regains one health point)\nRun (Move three times) \nTogether, you must place tiles as quickly as possible while not getting too spread out. Why not run off by yourself? Well\u2026\n4) HAZARDS: At the end of each round, resolve the top card of the HAZARD DECK. Each affects a certain type of tile: cavers on those tiles will lose health, and the tile may become harder to traverse. For example, GAS hurts cavers on GAS TILES a medium amount, whereas a FLOOD hurts those on WATER TILES only a little but makes the tile twice as costly to enter in the future.\n If you lose all your health points, you fall UNCONSCIOUS - you're unable to take further actions until another caver reaches your tile and HEALS you. If a friend is nearby, this won't take long. If you've strayed too far down a side passage, it might take some time to reach you. Why does that matter? Well\u2026\n5) RUNNING OUT OF TIME: When the hazard deck runs out of cards, your flashlights are nearly out of power: instead of resolving a card, each caver has a chance of getting lost in the darkness forever. Turns are precious - time spent rescuing fallen cavers or backtracking through difficult passages is time you'd rather spend uncovering more tiles and getting closer to the exit.\n6) HORRORS: You're not alone down here. Some hazard cards can spawn...things...which will relentlessly hunt you down. If they catch you, you'll immediately lose all health points and fall unconscious. If you try to fight them, you will die. RUN.\n7) MORE STUFF: Sub Terra also contains: cave-ins, squeezes, ledges, slides, ropes, rough treacherous terrain, tremors, dynamite, cave diving, \"geology\" and soul-crushing despair \n(soul-crushing despair supplied separately)\nEager to play Sub Terra?

The team is poised!\n\nMANUFACTURE:\nWe're partnering with Whatz games from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's manufacturing, they're fast, reliable and produce high quality games. We're confident they'll produce a box that helps us deliver the Sub Terra experience. I will personally review the blank samples, the pre-production samples, and if the budget permits, visit the factory itself to inspect the production run.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING:\nWe're working with a specially honed team of fulfillment and shipping experts, in Hong Kong, Shanghai, the UK and elsewhere to ensure that we can offer leading backer shipping rates as well as deliver you your games speedily and in good condition. We're aiming to get a chunk of games once manufactured to the UK Games Expo in June, so we're aiming to get shipping on the go before then. November is our worst case scenario. We may obviously sell copies of the game at the UKGE before some backers get their copy elsewhere in the world. We're hoping that this doesn't happen but we want to be upfront, we can't afford as a small publisher to not take that opportunity.\n\nHORRORS:\nThere's a small chance the darkness will close in on the ITB team and the horrors will catch up to us. If this happens, we may not be able to ship your game, as we'll probably have been eaten. But don't worry because we've got he 'Experienced' ability and we've got a +1 to our skill check rolls.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Surface Dweller", "descp": "(Doesn't include 48 flash signed art print)\nINCLUDES:\nCredits in Rules Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}], "stat": ["196 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Caver's Edition", "descp": "Approx.

You and your blokes have been banished and stripped of everything but a few shillings and table scraps. Undaunted, you journey to a strange land to reinvent yourself and reclaim your honor! Will you farm the earth, fight as knights or finagle your own feudums? Your fate is in your hands. (And for better or worse, the hands of a steely-eyed monarch named Queen Anne).\nHailed as \"articulate and inventive,\" Feudum is a deeply nuanced game for 2-5 players that rewards resource management and skillful planning. Six uniquely powered characters and multiple paths to victory make for an ever-changing, open-world experience each time you play!\nFeudum mechanics include action programming, area influence, hand management and a unique economic ecosystem. The game features the kinds of strategic complexities found in deeper games such as Terra Mystica, Brass, Caylus and Dominant Species. Jamey Stegmaier (designer of Scythe) compared the game in \"depth and aesthetics to Trickerion,\u201d while Jeremy and David of Man Vs Meeple likened it to Vinhos, the Gallerist and Madeira saying, there's a lot of thinking but \"in the most fun way possible!\"\nWith many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in an attempt to score the most veneration points over five epochs. Each player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in an effort to rise in power.\nBut, that\u2019s only the tip of the behemoth's horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service, or face the charge of disloyalty.

It opens up the board and allows you to try different strategies, yet still maintains the feel and charm of the game.

I was Inspired by Eurostyle games in the late 90s and became a fan of legends like Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Martin Wallace and Andreas Seyfarth. I unveiled my prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. I am excited that the game has been hailed as \"articulate and inventive,\" and appears on several \"watch\" lists within the BoardGameGeek community. I sincerely hope the kickstarter community feels the same way. Check out facebook.com/feudum or BoardGameGeek to learn more.\nArtist\nAs he likes to put it, Justin Schultz is an \"earthling living in Jackson, Mississippi.\" Justin studied graphic design at Mississippi State University and worked for a number of advertising agencies before focusing on concert posters, album covers, package design and, just recently, board game art! His distinctive style of populating his art with monsters, reptiles and robots conjures up memories of children's picture books, albeit slightly skewed. Justin explains that he likes to lure viewers in with \"superficially charming images,\" but then reveal something more \"heartbreaking\" or \"daunting\" upon closer inspection.  In 2010, Justin started his independent studio, The Flying Chair\nOdd Bird Games is excited to announce a partnership with Quartermaster Logistics to get you your rewards! They are powered by CoolStuffInc.com, a business that has been shipping games for over 14 years to customers around the world. Quartermaster Logistics will ensure your packages arrive safe and on time as every game is professionally packed and protected. \nHow it Works\nA short time after the campaign is over, you will receive an email from Backerkit that directs you to a pledge manager where you can confirm or upgrade your pledge, and add base games, expansions or other \u201cadd-ons.\u201d (PayPal accepted). Shipping will be calculated at that time. Backerkit turns overpledges into a credit that may be used as you see fit in the pledge manager.   \nShipping Estimates\nThe rates below are good faith estimates and reflect actual current carrier rates (FedEx, UPS) plus freight. QM Logistics will be shipping from their international fulfillment centers local to backers so that backers avoid VAT. \nAdd-On | 1 Game | 1 Game + 3 Exp | 3 Games | 6 Games\n.01 kgs | 3.1 kgs | 5.43 Kgs | 9.3 kgs | 18.6 kgs   \n$05 | $15 | $21 | $26 | $40 \u2014United States\n$10 | $15 | $22 | $30 | $40 \u2014Canada\n$10 | $18 | $19 | $21 | $23 \u2014European Union\n$10 | $20 | $22 | $26 | $35 \u2014Australia\n$12 | $29 | $37 | $60 | $114 \u2014New Zealand\n$05 | $10 | $15 | $20 | $34 \u2014China\n$05 | $10 | $15 | $20 | $30 \u2014Hong Kong\n$10 | $50 | $?? | $?? | $?? \u2014Rest of World   \n\nLighter-weight add-ons (everything except additional games or expansions) will not likely incur additional shipping costs. Space permitting, orders will be included in one box to reduce overall shipping costs. These rates are based on current carrier rates (FedEx, UPS) and may fluctuate.  \n\nRest of the World Fulfillment\nQM logistics is dedicated to finding the most cost-effective delivery solution for backers around the world, therefore, the \u201cRest of World\u201d rate is merely an averaged estimate. When possible, QM Logistics will use the fulfillment centers that are closest to backers in order to save them money. (For example, fulfilling from China, for East Asia, or fulfilling others from the EU shipping.) Be forewarned, it may be difficult to economically ship to some places in the world, but we will do our best.  \n\nBulk Shipping\nHeavier rates will generally just be a multiple or combination of 50lb and under rates. So, shipping 5 Feudum Cartons  (3 games per carton) at 46.5 kgs, would probably travel in 1 30kg and 1 20kg package in Europe, or possibly travel in 5 separate 10 kg packages. It would depend on how the packing works out. Often these shipments will be broken up in multiple boxes that are all shipped at once.\n\nPallet Shipping\nOnce we reach a pallet sized shipment, (i.e. 99+ games), costs almost entirely depend on where it will be shipped. For example, shipping a single pallet can range from $150 - $700 in the U.S. \nFollow Feudum on social media! Oh, and tell your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTruth be told, there will undoubtedly be a smattering of bumps, hiccups and faux pas made on this maiden voyage of ours. It is, after all, the first game that Justin and I have created. Deftly navigating the rough waters of fulfillment houses, freight shippers, manufacturers and backer relations won't be easy. \n\nOur naivet\u00e9 is bound to try someone's patience at some point in this adventure. That said, my artist and I are indubitably marked by an old-fashioned, yet noble code of conduct: We always try to do the right thing. \n\nOf course, to do the right thing, one must have knowledge. Thanks to a treasure trove of books, online resources and the generous support of the game designer community, we both feel quite prepared to take on this challenge. \n\nAdditionally, we have invested time and money in key partnerships that will streamline all operations. Backerkit will facilitate backer orders; OTX will ensure that freight shipping goes off without a hitch; Fulfillment houses like Fulfillrite, Spiral Galaxy, Starlit, Aetherworks and SFC will allow games to ship from within backers' countries of origin. \n\nSo far, these partnerships have been marked by transparency and free-flowing communication, right down to the way cardboard boxes and bubble wrap will be used to ensure the safe transport of every game. \n\nAt first, Odd Bird Games was like a methane gas-sniffing canary trapped deep within the bowels of a coal mine. But, by good fortune, we escaped up the shaft towards the light.

Thank you in advance for understanding, please pledge responsibly.\n\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5\nKingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive. To ensure its safety, it is being package into its own carton with corner protectors. It is too heavy to ship with other rewards. It would crush them!\nWave 1 - Estimated Delivery Summer 2017 Core Game / 1.5 Update Pack \nUnited States... $25 / $10 \nEuropean Union... $40 / $20 \nCanada... $30 / $15 Australia (+ New Zealand)... $40 / $20 \nRest of World... $100 / $30\n\nWave 2 - Estimated Delivery Winter 2017 (Still hoping for Summer 2017)\nCurrent Expansions\nUnited States... $15 + $3 per additional expansion \nEuropean Union... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nCanada... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $15 + $3 per additional expansion  \nRest of World... $30 + $3 per additional expansion\nWave 3 - Estimated Delivery Spring 2018\nGambler's Box, Promo and cross-over figures\nUnited States... $20 + $2 per Add on\nEuropean Union... $20 + $2 per Add on\nCanada... $20 + $2 per Add on\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $20 + $2 per Add on\nRest of World... $30 + $2 per Add on\nWave 4 - Estimated Delivery Spring 2019 \nNew Expansions\nUnited States... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nEuropean Union... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nCanada... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nRest of World... $30 + $3 per additional expansion\nWave 5 & Beyond - Estimated Delivery Winter 2020\n???\nEven I don't know for 100% what may happen during this campaign.\nPlease note that the contents and prices of each wave are estimates and are subject to change depending on the final size of this campaign.\nPledges finalized after the pledge manager deadline passes will ship from the United States and will incur additional shipping costs and potential delays. Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI learned a lot about manufacturing a top-quality boutique game and fulfilling it to our backers from our first Kickstarter. Not all my lessons were easy, but all of them were meaningful. Trying to bring such a staggeringly large game to life, we worked insane hours, fought lots of battles, and saw some unexpected setbacks. It's taught me how to look for ways to turn logistical, artistic, and fiscal difficulties into assets.\n\n\nI'm heading into this campaign with my eyes open. If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become. I will create a transparent, streamlined campaign from the outset and work hard to maintain the honest communication about our process and developments to make sure we meet everyone's expectations.

And we're not done - yet - there's a colour profusion with the FINAL STRETCH GOALS...\nDesigned by Stuart Garside and with art by Sebastian Gosko, Ember is a game where you draw cards to form hands which you then discard to Conjure magical creatures, each with a unique magical ability that will give you an edge over your opponents. \nEmber is a game for everyone; beloved by children, the bright colours and simple rules make it the perfect gateway card game for gamers of all ages! You can learn how to play Ember in three minutes, but finding your favourite strategy might take a little while longer...\nBack today and get a super limited Promo Card, Golden Star.\nUPDATE: AROUND 35 promo cards left.\n56 brand new UNIQUE cards make up From the Ashes, consisting of 27 new separate creatures, 12 x Elemental God cards, 7 x Tutor cards, 5 x Artifact cards, and 3 x Spectral creature cards, and 2 Promo  Cards: Prismatic Unicorn and Blood Dragon, all in a gorgeous Poker-sized tuckbox - and we're not nearly finished yet. With your support, we have major plans to supercharge this expansion\u2026\nNote: to add the 2016 promo cards to any pledge level that doesn't contain them - just add \u00a35.00! You can do this at any time.\nFantastic Quality. Check the reviews - everyone's impressed! You can't get better quality cards and it really does show! Printed by one of the world's top manufacturers, these 310g black core card stock cards are of sensational quality.\nEmber is a fast-paced fantasy filler game with elements of creature collection and take that! It hides a deceptively strategic depth under its gorgeous art and simple gameplay. It's a game of strategy, of acting and reacting to the creatures your enemies' Conjure; it's a game of memory, of face up and face down cards, and trying to keep a track of which player controls which cards as you prepare for the final endgame. While it has a luck of the draw factor, the variations of card effect mean it is always possible to turn things around and there are many many routes to victory. Ember has many different variations of play available which will suit almost all play styles. \nDistrict 31: With over 20 years' experience in publishing - and having released one of the fastest fulfilled campaigns in Kickstarter history earlier this year (13 weeks from campaign end to shipping) - we wanted to bring you the complete Ember, giving you even more variety and more ways to win with From the Ashes. \nThe new creature cards focus on Ember's endgame, on new strategies, and lower VP creatures.\nDuring Ember\u2019s hundreds of playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed: \nThat Ember is an intro game that can be learned by all ages in just a few minutes. \nMultiple ways to play: Ember has a variety of different ways to play based on your play-style. Casual Play, Hardcore, or even Battle Mode. \nA simple, yet surprisingly strategic game. \nThe beautiful and highly evocative art. \nThat you can mix and match cards to suit your strategy (don\u2019t want an end game? Fine, just take out those cards. Hate the Take That element? No problem, just remove those cards, too. Ember is designed to be enjoyed in multiple ways with a variety of different rules to appeal to every gamer type. \nThe often tense and tactical endgame (where anything can change). \nSeal of Approval: Over the Saturday and Sunday of UK Games Expo 2016, almost 97% of participants who played a demo game of Ember went on to purchase a copy - that speaks volumes about the quality and how much fun Ember is - and From the Ashes looks even better!  \nNearly half the new cards in From the Ashes are made up of new card types. \nElemental Dragon Gods: the ancient elemental gods are beings of great power. Made up of Bahamut (the god of fire) and Kraken (the god of water) and Tarrasque (the god of earth). They are dragons made up of three separate parts. Collect all three (before your opponents) and gain a Legendary ability which will allow you to crush your enemies.\nAnd the mysterious Kraken, which has powers to revitalise other creatures as well as being able to strip creatures of their abilities. \nTarrasque has great powers to crush your enemies.\nTutors: are the teachers tutors at Alastor's Academy who wield great power. Each Tutor has a unique power that can influence the game to your advantage, along with a Quest that gives you crucial endgame bonuses.\nArtifacts: are magical items of great power that are the first cards in the game with two or more abilities. The basic abilities of an artifact will help you on a turn-by-turn basis, and the secondary effect comes into play when you Conjure a VP 5 or higher creature, but if you need a boost of power, use their Arcane ability, but doing so will exhaust the item, flipping it in the process and losing all of its powers for the rest of the game.\nAll the finished cards will have a wide variety of unique backgrounds. Cards here are purely for illustration purposes only. \nReprint of Wizard Cards: In addition to all of the above, every backer will also get the four x 6 cards which had a slight printing issue which meant some players struggled to tell which element they were. As you can see, there are no issues here.\nWe literally cannot improve upon the quality of the game components, so all our Stretch Goals are focused on bringing you new and exciting cards to add ever more value to the game.\nSocial Stretch Goals: Facebook 600 Likes - UNLOCKED\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOAL #2: 700 Facebook Likes. \nAnd more to come!\nBeing a UK company we are determined to support our local industry, as a result we've got plenty of UK games reviews from some of the best reviewers around.\nBoard, Deck & Dice\nGaming Knights\nToucan Play That Game (they call it \"a keeper\").\nBoard Gaming At Home \nAlso, check out our Ember BoardGameGeek page for all our great comments and feedback. \nCheck out our 5 minute Instructional Video (incorporating the EndGame).\nYou can download the v1.4 rules here.

It takes under an hour to play. Your cards become the fighting units that conquer and control territories. Since you're a god you decide whether to send defeated cards to the Heaven discard pile or the Hell discard pile! The discard piles sit on a scale that measures how many defeated enemies have been sent to Heaven or Hell. Tip the scales and open the gates of Hell or Heaven. You get Victory Points from each territory you control at the end of your turn plus bonus points from Angel and Demon cards. The player with the most Victory Points at the end wins!\nIf you like to eat dessert first you can just skip to the rule book here or check out the amazingly detailed gameboard here.\nLastly if funded, this will be our 4th published game!  Our previous game, Curses, won the Mensa Select award and our other game, Angel Quest - The Random Acts of Kindness Cards landed us on the Montel Williams Show as the \"kindest family in America.\"  We can't wait to see where Cosmic Balance takes us!\nEven Montel Williams likes the games we make!\n  An amazingly illustrated board! Lars went a little nuts on this thing. This is one of the most detailed game boards we've ever seen. It's 31 inches by 20 inches. (78cm x 51cm) and fits perfectly in the game box.\nBoard Game Mock Up. Image Not Final.\nAn original concept! As far as we can tell, this is the first game ever to use a scale to track how many dead cards are in two discard piles. There's also a couple hundred cards, 60 resource counters, 28 battle tokens, and 50 influence tokens.\nGame pieces not final.\n A Kickstarter Exclusive! 7 Knight cards, 5 Shield Tokens plus the God of Protection card available only to Kickstarter backers.  (See Update #5 for more details.)\nThe retail version will not include the God of Protection card, the 7 Knights cards, or their 5 Shield Tokens, and this Kickstarter campaign is the only place they will ever be available!\n  We spent a year refining the design of the Cosmic Balance scale.\nCheck out a close up of the cards here!\nSample cards.\n Let the All Father enlighten you on the parts of the card...\n  Check out the reviews below and also our interview with Druid City Games. You can also check out our Board Game Geek page!\nClick here to read Geek Dad's game review!\n                     All unlocked Stretch Goals are included in all shipped games!\nYou've unlocked killer bunnies & reapers!\n All unlocked Social Goals are included in all shipped games!\nSocial goals require no spending of your precious, wonderful money! Just share links and write posts on places like our page on Board Game Geek and we will bow to your very will.  \n    FULL RULEBOOK HERE\nOn your turn you have three actions. Spend your actions to draw Mortal cards from your deck or play your Mortal cards from your hand on to any of the board's eight territories. At the end of your turn score one Victory Point for each territory your Mortals control plus bonus points from Angel and Demon cards. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins.\nCards, like the below Giant, destroy your enemies and keep control of your territories. You have to spend Good or Evil to play them from your hand. But where do you get this Good or Evil?\nYour Peasant cards (seen above) generate Good for you when you send them to the nice parts of the board. Likewise, you earn Evil for sending the hapless Peasants to the icky nasty parts of the board, where there is only death and Brussels sprouts. Then you can spend this Good and Evil to play the more powerful mortal cards from your hand, such as Vampires, Knights, and aforementioned hangry Giants. \nThere's also a game zone called The Beyond. Cards in The Beyond are face up and available for all players to purchase. You can summon powerful Angels and Demons from The Beyond when you save up enough Good or Evil, but they cost a lot more.\nWhenever one of your cards kills an enemy on the board, you decide whether to send that enemy to Heaven or Hell, located on the Cosmic Balance scale.\nContent images not final.\nIf more cards end up in Heaven, that side tips down, and the Gates of Heaven open. Whenever you open Heaven or Hell you get an additional action for that turn. If you are clever you can use this to re-balance and re-open the gates for even more actions.\nWhile Heaven is open, all Angels in The Beyond cost half the normal amount of Good and you can summon them to defeat even more enemies and conquer more territories! Same with tipping down Hell and opening the way for Demons to stomp the faces of your enemies. Angels and Demons are freakin' powerful compared to the other units. They will often hit the board and kill something to help you tip the scales yet again. Angels and Demons also get you extra VP at the end of each of your turns.\nBeyond Cards and God Powers\nYou'll have 2 different God Powers every game. At the beginning of the game, each player chooses 2 of the 15 God Power cards, such as Greed, Blood, Protection, or Wind. Each of these powers determines which factions will go in your deck, so there are countless combinations. (Well, 15 factions have 105 possible pairings, so we're just going to call that countless.) Each God Power card also has a unique base ability that you can combine and use throughout the game. Some examples:\nWhich two of these God Powers would you choose?\nGod of Hunger: Whenever you destroy a non-Peasant enemy, gain 1 extra victory. Start with the Wolves faction in your deck.\nGod of Prosperity: Draw an extra card on each of your turns. Start with the Merchants faction in your deck.\nGod of Wind: On each of your turns you may move any card to a different territory. Start with the Eagles faction in your deck.\nAs a god, you can hear all the secret thoughts and prayers of the mortal cards in your deck. Although it won't affect the game's outcome, you can have fun granting the prayers of your followers. Or you can crush them and send them to Hell! That's the great part about being a god. You get to judge mortals and they can't judge you!\nWe're Alexandra Tinsman and Brian Tinsman, the creators of Cosmic Balance. We've spent the past 20 years helping to craft legendary tabletop gaming experiences (including favorites such as Magic:The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, Duel Masters, Curses, Risk, and Pok\u00e9mon) which has prepared us for the launch of this game. Lars Nielsen is the artist and Claudia Ng is the engineer.\nWonder powers unite! Form of Cosmic Balance team.\nAlex has spent her career in marketing and product development for top game brands including: Riot Games (League of Legends), Microsoft (Xbox, Halo, Minecraft), Wizards of the Coast (Magic:The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons), Pok\u00e9mon, Hasbro (Star Wars, Avalon Hill), and Gen Con.  \nBrian is an award-winning game designer with over 37 shipped game titles (including lead game design on 8 Magic:The Gathering sets, including Rise of the Eldrazi, Avacyn Restored, and Time Spiral.) He's also the author of The Game Inventor's Guidebook and has secured multiple new gameplay mechanic patents.  \nLars Nielsen is our lead artist. His unique art style has made him a favorite among gamers and indie comics fans. He's also the progeny of renowned Magic artist, Terese Nielsen, and has spent his life immersed in gaming culture. You may even recognize him from the Magic card, Samite Elder.  \nClaudia Ng is the owner and creator of Succulent Monsters, the cutest 3D printed monster planters on the internets. She is also the engineer of the Cosmic Balance device. She invented the physical mechanism that allows us to adjust how many cards are needed to tip the balance.\nWith your support, this game will continue to grow as we develop new content over time. Like a good living card game, it's built to support an almost unlimited number of new factions and god powers. \nYou can already customize your play experience by selecting a subset of Angels and Demons in The Beyond to provide a faster or slower game, and this will get better over time as we release more cards, god powers, and Angels/Demons.\nWith these new card releases we'll include some suggested faction combinations so you can maximize the influence of player skill or have a wacky, highly swingy game for your friends that enjoyed the Transformers movies - a lot of exciting action as long as you don't think too hard. \n  We continue to add new countries but for now we our shipping costs are:\n$10 USD to USA \n$15 USD to Europe and Canada\n$22 USD to Switzerland\n$29 USD to Australia \n$30 USD to New Zealand\n$30 USD to Singapore\n$22 USD to Switzerland\n$37 USD to Brazil\n$37 USD to Israel\n$22 USD to Cyprus\n$29 USD to Japan\n$29 USD to Malaysia\nAlex was brand manager for Magic: The Gathering and Brian was lead designer on 8 Magic expansion sets. Magic\u2019s use of the graveyard as a semi-active game zone inspired the idea for a board game where players could use the discard pile to affect battles on the board and use the weight of dead cards to measure the carnage. After a lot of prototyping we developed the Cosmic Balance device. Watch the video to learn our prototype journey for the Cosmic Balance scale!\nCheck out how Claudia uses her 3D printer to make the prototypes for the Cosmic Balance scale! \nFUN FACT: Alex first met Lars in 2001 when he was 8 years old hanging out with his mom, Terese, at the Magic Pro Tour LA on the \"haunted\" Queen Mary boat/hotel.  They've been friends ever since.\nHere's a behind-the-scenes sneak peek at the gameboard art concept. This board has an exceptionally high level of detailed illustration!\nConcept art for Cosmic Balance gameboard (by Lars Nielsen).\n  You can make this game even better by being part of our community and discussing the countless small decisions that go into making a strategy board game. What are the best cards? What's the funniest flavor text? How could the rule book be clearer? Are there card interactions not covered in the FAQ? Which card is most overpowered?\nAll this stuff is super important to making a high quality game that you'll be proud to have on your sacred gaming table.\nWelcome to our tribe.\nIt's the end of the world but after-life party is jut beginning.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery board game carries risks in budgeting, manufacturing, quality control, packouts, and shipping on time. Though this is our first Kickstarter we've created dozens of published tabletop games so we understand these risks well.\n\nThe biggest risk in most Kickstarter board games is game play quality. How often will you want to play it again? We're highly focused on this issue and we will not release it until the gameplay passes the highest quality bar according to our panel of experienced designers.\n\nThis game has a simple base system with a lot of complex content that we'll need to carefully balance for strategic fairness and replayability. Almost all of our playtest criticism has centered on card and power balance, which we will continue to refine even after funding.\n\nThough our theme is lighthearted, there's a powerful engine under the hood. When we worked on Magic: the Gathering expansions we did a great job of balance tuning (with a lot of help) and they turned out to be some of the best selling sets ever.
