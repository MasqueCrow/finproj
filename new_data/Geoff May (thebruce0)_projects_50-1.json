That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

It was a challenge we were happy to accept.\nKnog wants your help to bring to market the world\u2019s most powerful silicone headlamp\u2026\u2026the 400 Lumen Bilby.\nThe Bilby produces a seriously powerful 400 lumens of light output, providing enough light for the most serious outdoor user in the most demanding of outdoor scenarios. \nProviding over 5 hours of use on its highest setting, and over 90 hours on its lowest setting. With the Bilby you\u2019ll never be caught short.\nWeighing in at just 90 grams is unbelievably light for any headlamp, but when you consider the Bilby\u2019s power output to weight ratio, it extraordinary.  The Bilby is so lightweight and comfortable, it easy to forget you are wearing a headlamp at all.   \nOur strap and housing are made from one piece of silicone, making the Bilby perfectly balanced, ultra-comfortable and beautifully contoured.  \nWe know that everyone has their own preference when it comes to brightness of headlamp beam, so within the 6 modes available on the Bilby, you are able to choose from 4 levels of brightness. \nWe designed the Bilby to give the user multiple different lighting options to cover all user scenarios. The Bilby comes with 5 different LED settings as standard including: Spot, Mid, Wide angle, Reading and Red Night light. \n The Bilby features a special boost mode that allows a user to get 10 minutes of boosted power output at the touch of a button, regardless of how much battery life is remaining. The function is perfect for a user needing an instant boost of light.\nPLAY\n\n Pop out the light pod, and simply plug into any standard USB to recharge. No cables, no batteries, no fuss. A full recharge is achieved within 4 hours from flat. The Bilby\u2019s rechargeable pod saves the user from buying 1144 disposable batteries over its lifetime.  \n Using Knog\u2019s unique and simple to use modemaker app, allows users to fully customise this headlamp. Allowing users to choses which modes the Bilby uses and in which order they are operated.\n Knog knows silicone and its benefit\u2019s better than other brands, having utilised its many benefits for over 13 years. Silicone is the perfect material for use in a headlamp as it: will not lose it elasticity, will not tangle your hair and will not become odorous when wet. Silicone is easy to clean, temperature resistant and extremely hard wearing, making it perfect for use outdoors in any conditions.    \n Adjusting the size of the Bilby is easy. Simply angle the toggle up, move the strap to your desired size and angle the toggle down, it\u2019s as simple as that. \n The Bilby has a waterproof rating of IP67, which allows the headlamp to submerged in up to a meter\u2019s depth of water for a period of 30 mins. With the Bilby you\u2019ll never need to worry about getting your headlamp wet.\nKnog is an Australian based product design business. For over 18 years we have been making award winning cycle lights and accessories. We design, test and develop all of our products in our studio right in the heart of beautiful Melbourne. \nOur team is made up of 15 talented and passionate individuals, most of whom have been with Knog for well over 10 years, we are a business that values our team and we are proud of the low turnover of staff. At Knog we celebrate diversity and equality, this principle is reflected in our team who hail from all over the world, but who have found a home at Knog. \n2 years ago, Knog decided to apply some of our 18 years lighting expertise over to the outdoor category.  As this was a new space for Knog, we knew it would be critical to get proof of concept.  We also decided that Kickstarter audience would be the perfect community to critique and validate our designs. \nThis is now our 4th Kickstarter project and with the feedback from our backers, we are making some of our most innovative products ever. \nHere at Knog we sometimes get asked, why would an established brand who have been around for over 18 years need to turn to Kickstarter to launch a product? The truth is that there is a multitude of benefits to working with Kickstarter.\nThe most discernible benefit from working with Kickstarter is the feedback that we receive from the Kickstarter community. This community is curious, design-minded and passionate about both product design and the great outdoors.\nHowever well designed a product is, there will always be something that our designers may have missed or simply not considered. Through sharing our designs and process with the Kickstarter backers, we know that any design flaws will be exposed, which then allows us to address them. Knog has found Kickstarter to be the ultimate environment for proof of concept of any of our designs.\nAnother considerable benefit to working with Kickstarter is that it has allowed Knog to break into a new category. A move that would have been impossible, were it not for the encouragement and support we received from the Kickstarter backers. Such was the case with the launch of our first headlamp the Bandicoot. The outdoor channel is a crowed and established category, where not all the big players are motivated to innovate their products. By working with Kickstarter, Not only did Knog receive invaluable feedback that helped refine our headlamp design, but it also helped provide the funds to bring this product to market.\nSo to today, where we once again turn to Kickstarter for your passion, critique and financial support in order to help bring our latest product to market. The Bilby headlamp was designed as a direct result of the feedback from the Kickstarter backers of our first headlamp the Bandicoot. Backers loved the headlamp but wanted one that was significantly more powerful. And so the Bilby\u2019s journey began.\nOn this occasion we have the Bilby designed and developed, but to get it into production, we need the help of the Kickstarter audience. For Knog, your patronage allows us to develop and produce the very best designed product we can make. For you, the audience, you play an integral part of taking our design and making it into real tangible products. You also get the clear benefit of access to these products before anyone else and at the most cost-effective price.\nAs a business Knog likes to be as honest and upfront as possible with our valued backers, so we felt it was important to explain just how important Kickstarter has been to Knog\u2019s evolution as a business.\nThank you from everyone at Knog.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nShipping: To get a very fast, very reliable, to-the-door service can come with a painful price tag. Since the Bilby's price is market-leading, we want to keep costs down, but not have a poor logistics partner. Our logistics team have explored the best options for each region to make sure we can track to the door in most occasions without it costing the earth.\n\nProduction: We\u2019re in the fortunate position of having many years of experience designing and manufacturing lighting products. Therefore, we understand the risks that can occur in the production process. As with any physical item, flaws not picked up in the rigorous testing phase are possible.

And if they get you, you will play out the game as a geocaching Player Zombie!This expansion pack includes all of your favorite items\u2026 shotguns, chainsaws, crowbars and more!\nMore Equipment Cards\nSpecialized Equipment Cards\nAdditional Event Cards\nEven More Caching Area Tiles\n  The Zombies will be moving and gathering their numbers\u2026 Geocaching will never be the same!\nZAG Components\nA few examples of things found in the woods.\nWhat the Zombies do to Cache Me If You Can!\u2026.\n  The Zombie Pack changes the entire feel of Cache Me If You Can! You are still Geocaching, but now there is much more risk and danger. The permutations of what can happen have doubled. There is more strategy and there are more crazy situations that arise. One-legged Zombies on bicycles. Zombies calling in an airstrike\u2026 you name it!   \nA couple of the Event and Equipment cards\n    In most expansion packs the cards match the originals, not so in ZAG.  This way you will know when a Zombie Event card is coming up next on the deck. Zombie Event cards are not all bad or good. You still don\u2019t know what you are getting, but it might be your last chance to save yourself. Do you head back to the Sporting Goods Store to pick it up or keep on with your search in the woods?   \nBooklet (Front and Back page)\nInside of the booklet (pg 2 & 3)\nREVIEWS THE EARLIER EDITIONS (We kept the good stuff in and made it even better!)\nFrom Geocaching.com\nAmazing game that gets better every time you play it! Review by KBLAST\nI saw this game at multiple mega-events but had a hard time grasping the concept, and that made the price point a problem for me. I finally gave in and decided to try it out in July.\n    My family fell in LOVE with this game! I did not play it once and then come post my review, I have played dozens of times since my purchase, and the purchase was WELL worth the price! My seven-year-old son who reads really well (an important facet of the game) begs to play this game EVERY day (no exaggeration). My 12-year-old daughter loves playing, too! Both kids have had their vocabulary increased and their comprehension levels improved partially because this game has challenged them in a fun way! I was afraid this would just be a childish, silly game, but it allows for a strategy and just enough randomness and luck to make the game fun EVERY time for everyone!\n    I bought version 1 at the event and purchased version 2 the moment it became available. Version 2 made improvements that have made a SUPER fun game EVEN BETTER!!! I am now hosting geocaching events to teach others as much of the nuance of the game as possible because I don\u2019t want the price point to be a deterrent to anyone else\u2026 I want people to see how great this game is and how worthwhile this purchase is!\nQuick, family fun Review by luckyastrodiver\nI purchased this at a Mega event last year thinking that when my 10 & 11 yr. old grandchildren spent the night it might be more fun than watching tv or fighting (seemingly their favorite past-times). Since they have cached with us and enjoy it, they understood the basics. I never expected them to have so much fun and love it so much. Now they beg to play it every time they come over and since it can be adapted to be as long as you wish, it gets pulled out almost every visit. OK, I admit,I like it too!\nFrom posts on Facebook:\nGave the game to my dad as birthday gift (he does geocaching in real life) and loves it! Thanks guys! Perfect gift and amazing game! So unique!\nAlexander W. Burkard FaceBook \u2013 near Buffalo, NY\n\u201cCMIYC arrived safely and last Saturday I invited five other geocachers around to test it out.

Met the creators. They even autographed my box for me. Promised me that I\u2019d love the game or they\u2019d give me my money back. Played the game once, addicted. Haven\u2019t stopped playing it. My two boys are 8 and 9 years old and they beat me almost every time. A great game for the whole family. You can re-arrange the board layout to make the game more challenging too. That helps to keep the game from getting old. It\u2019s a new game every time!\nHelp other customers find the most helpful reviews\nWas this review helpful to you?

It doesn\u2019t matter if you are a geocacher or not. The game is different every time, as it says. I even find that we play it differently every time, different strategies from all of us. We play with our 11-year-old, and 7-year-old sons, and they love it too. It lends itself to rule modifications, and the game makers are great at getting back to you with answers to any questions you may have on the game. As a family that plays a fair amount of board games, this is one that is solidly in our regular rotation now.\nHelp other customers find the most helpful reviews\nWas this review helpful to you?

That range of experiences has given us a lot to work with, a lot to learn from, and a lot to build on. \nThis campaign will be the second where we implement our 'ITB Guarantees', where we make a public commitment to the best possible service to our backers, supporters, and fans around the world.\nTeam ITB has been working on Crypt X since 2018, playing a whole range of puzzle tabletop games, puzzle books, video games, escape rooms and more, trying to distill down what makes a great puzzle game. Since Rose joined us full time in 2018 as a developer, we've been steaming ahead turning these ideas into a tightly woven narrative puzzle experience. \nRose has done an incredible job of tieing together a fantastic, dramatic narrative threaded through over 50 carefully engineered puzzles inspired by dozens of escape games, escape rooms and puzzle books, as well as an unreasonably large pile of reference books.\nRecruiting the help of Oxford University Egyptology researcher Dr Edward Love who inspired us with loads of historical examples of Egyptian codes, ciphers and language quirks, we've attempted to make not only a satisfying game, but an informative and accurate one too! A great big thank you to Johanna and Roland, too - without whom the game wouldn't anywhere near as beautiful as it is!\nA massive thank you to all of our early playtesters, who've helped us make this the best it can be. Thanks to: \nAmy Nash, Andy Mackay, Becky Todd, Bernard, Britt Callebaut, Brooke B., Daniel Pitcock, Dave Wetherall, Donald Stanley, Eric Mazelis, Erik Cole, Frans Treur, Grant Miner, Ian Stronach, James Olson, Jens Grimmel, Jeremy Skrdla, Jing Lim, Jolien Bortier, Justin Bird, Justine, Ken Whitehurst, Kevin Beeckmans-Cop, Linda Canton, Liz Howald, Loriana Giuliani, Nic, Peter 'Pedro' Goins, Sally, Simon Westenra, Stephen Spikings, Theo Edwards, Aidan Reynolds, Benedicte Wulff, Alex Hopkins, Jiaqi Li .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGAME DESIGN: \nWe first came up with this idea over a year ago, and since then have been tirelessly researching both the thematic and structural aspects of the project. While between us, we've played dozens of puzzle games, gone through dozens of puzzle books, and completed half of London's escape rooms, we knew that for a game this ambitious, we needed something more. We recruited over 100 playtesters from around the world and got their feedback over multiple rounds of testing to ensure that the puzzles work exactly as we designed them to. Even after that, we need to make sure it all ticks like clockwork - and will be doing additional rounds of testing after the campaign before we get to print. The challenge for us is if there are lots of small edits to make, and ensuring that we get through those properly in good time. As Rose has done a spectacular job so far in this regard, we're confident that this will not affect the overall timeline projection. \n\nILLUSTRATION & GRAPHIC DESIGN \nAnyone who's backed our projects before knows that we spend a huge amount of time working on our artwork and graphic design. Johanna has completed the artwork for 90% of the puzzles, the journal and all other assets needed to wrap up the project for print. You can see many of her illustrations throughout the campaign. That said, there's a few more to be done and there may be tweaks needed in the final proofing stage. We've put a formal timeline in place to account for this, and have allowed several 'check points' to ensure that the artwork is up to scratch and consistent with the puzzle refinements we might make. All the packaging and box design is already complete and print-ready.\n\nMASS MANUFACTURE \nA year ago, as part of the Sub Terra Documentary promised from our \u00a3300,000 stretch goal, we visited the factory in Shanghai. We inspected all the pieces of equipment and production lines, met with staff and talked through our production objectives with their team, to ensure that we know exactly how your games are made. This means we've already avoided many of the costly mistakes that can catch projects off guard, and optimised the product design to take into account the way the machines and team produce the games - meaning they'll produce them better, faster! Nevertheless, we're working closely with the manufacturer for this project, Longpack, to ensure that every tiny detail is produced according to our high standards, and so that it delivers the excellent experience you expect. We'll be keeping close communication with them until we've confirmed everything is 100% and has been checked in the fulfillment warehouses.\nAs an additional assurance, we're spending two weeks with the Longpack team in Shanghai and around China inspecting the factory and their suppliers in November this year.\n\nFREIGHT & FULLFILMENT \nShipping hundreds or even thousands of games around the world is a complex project, and we've learned an enormous amount from our previous four successful campaigns. We've already calculated the plans for shipping games to 4 regional warehouses and fulfilling locally from there, as well as factoring in a realistic amount of contingency time for the not uncommon delays associated with sea freight of the games from the factory in China to the warehouses around the world. Additionally, we've optimised the product design of the game to account for shipping charge thresholds on dimensions and weight - ultimately saving you money.\n\nUNFORESEEN EVENTS \nDelivering a complex tabletop game Kickstarter project successfully is a challenge in itself, with a huge number of variables in play at any given time, and a large variety of places where things can go wrong. Due to the nature of this process, some things may change, but we are dedicated to making sure everyone is fully informed of any planned changes to content, the timeline or any other relevant information. We're dedicated to proving to all our backers that we are committed to excellent service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Summer School", "descp": "We'll send you a postcard from our travels digging up graves around the world...\nINCLUDES:\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "Undergraduate", "descp": "As well as a postcard from our travels digging up crypt x across the world, we'll also send you a copy of the professor's notebook.\nINCLUDES:\nCrypt X\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["876 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "Postgraduate", "descp": "Every adventurer needs the right tools, in addition to the postcard and professor's notes, you'll get a supply kit of essential tools for your cryptic adventures.\nINCLUDES:\nCrypt X\nArchaeologist's Notebook\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["220 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a337 or more", "title": "Doctor of Archaeology", "descp": "The most accomplished academics use the best materials to discover their next breakthroughs.

The game is back on Kickstarter with a 2nd edition full reprint offering updates to game play and a new expansion, Pathogenesis - STD.\nPathogenesis 2.0 (2nd edition full reprint):  The immune system for the 2nd edition of Pathogenesis has been updated.  These updates include 4 immune system cards (4 copies of each) that are more consistently damaging than before as well as updated antibody tokens that have an attack value of their own.  The adaptive immune system response is now less volatile and even more dangerous than before!\nPathogenesis STD adds the fourth tract to the body, the Genitourinary tract, introducing pathogens, traits, and virulence factors appropriate for this area of the body. Further, keeping to the science, the Genitourinary tract has no toxin cards but instead a new mechanic has been introduced, Collateral Damage cards!\nCollateral Damage cards add the damage from the immune system's attack against your pathogens to the damage your pathogens deal to the body if your pathogens survive the immune system's attack.\nALL QUALITY UPGRADES FROM THE FIRST CAMPAIGN ARE INCLUDED!  All of the completed quality upgrade stretch goals from the first campaign will be included in Pathogenesis 2.0!  These include the upgraded box thickness, UV spot coat on the box, custom box insert, black core cards, and linen finish. \nAt this level we will develop an online tutorial (also mobile friendly) that will run you through your first several turns without any need to even open the rule book.

Includes: 16 updated immune system cards, 20 updated immune system tokens, and rules insert.  \nPATHOGENESIS 2.0 (BASE GAME): Add $44 for each additional copy of Pathogenesis. This is a 2nd edition full reprint of the base game including updates to enhance play.  \nSTD EXPANSION + PATHOGENESIS 2.0: Add $59 for each additional copy of the STD Expansion + Pathogenesis 2.0. This add-on includes the new expansion plus the 2nd edition of the base game.\nCLASSROOM PACK:  Add $125 for each additional classroom pack.

The pathogens must survive the body's powerful immune response, adapt in an ever changing environment, and evolve to take on virulence factors to increase their attack, defense, and other abilities so that they may do enough damage to defeat the body before the human host becomes immune and all the players lose the game.\nThe game is highly scalable, allowing players to choose their level of difficulty and the length of the game they wish to play\nPathogenesis blends the feel of center-row style deck building games such as Star Realms and Ascension with mechanics base 100% on real science, simulating the roles of pathogens and the immune system at each phase of the game.\nModes of play include solo, competitive, cooperative, team play, and classroom.\n Who might like this game?  Avid gamers, fans of deck building games, medicine and science enthusiasts, teachers and students from high school to college level and beyond. \n1-4 players.  Ages 14+  30-60 minutes\nWe use the \u201cStegmaier\u201d method of shipping games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees and VAT and to keep shipping prices low.

We will treat Educational Institution and Retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release games into distribution.  \nIf you are with an Educational Institution or Retailer please contact us at wibaigames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nPATHOGENESIS CLASSROOM PACK:   The classroom pack may be divided so that 16 students can play at one time.  Students are divided into teams of two and each game uses 2 of the 4 body tracts.   Instructions for how to use Pathogenesis in the classroom can be found HERE. \nDr. Jamie Cunningham, PhD is the brains behind Pathogenesis and together with her husband Loren, they are the designers of the game. Jamie is an Associate Professor of Biology. When teaching the immune system, textbooks cover the subject in pieces and her students never get to see the whole picture. Her goal for this game was to help her students see how the immune system works during an bacterial infection.  \nLoren Cunningham is Jamie\u2019s husband and partner in crime. Together they created Transylvania: Curses & Traitors that was successful on Kickstarter in 2014. Loren\u2019s background is in business rather than science, so his job was to make sure that the game and its mechanics worked well for EVERYONE regardless of their background in biology. He also makes sure that the games get manufactured and shipped to your door on time.  \nScientific illustrator somersault18:24 is the artist and have partnered with WIBAI Games to bring art to the game that is scientifically accurate, yet re-imagined to achieve beautiful, eye-popping, images. somersault18:24 is run by the artists/scientists Luk Cox and Idoya Lahortiga. Both of them have a PhD in Biomedical Sciences and have set out on an ambitious journey to bridge the gap between the artistic visual arts and science. They excel in helping scientists and teachers to prepare easy-to-follow yet professional scientific illustrations.  \nThomas Deeny is the graphic designer for Pathogenesis. He specializes in game design and book layout. His layout work can be found in roleplaying games like John Wick Presents' 7th Sea, Atlas Games\u2019 Unknown Armies and Over the Edge,  MCDM Production's Strongholds and Followers, and Modiphius Entertainment's Star Trek Adventures. His work on boardgames includes AEG\u2019s Nightfall and Tempest line, and Tasty Minstrel Games\u2019 Cthulhu Realms.

(It's our 4th!!)\n\nOur 3rd Kickstarter didn't go quite the way we had hoped. This project is a re-launch of our 3rd Kickstarter. To help get this project where we want it to go we have engaged 3 of the biggest board gamer reviewers to help spread the word and have done a considerable amount of advertising. We have also revised the Kickstarter budget and stretch goals. We canceled the prior campaign after funding but we want to assure everyone that if we reach the project threshold, this project will not be canceled for any reason. \n\nOur first Kickstarter for Transylvania: Curses & Traitors really taught us a lot. We applied as much as we could from our first campaign to the 2nd campaign for Pathogenesis. We learned even more from our 2nd go round and plan on improving and continuing to learn every time. This is our first expansion Kickstarter so we are sure there will be a lot more to learn and we are looking forward to it!\n\nThe process of creating a game and getting it to backers on time is highly complicated and involved.

Say goodbye to the fossil-fueled lighters of the past and hello to the electric future..\nIt\u2019s time to ditch the disposables.  \nOver two billion single-use lighters are sold every year. They\u2019ve been the golden standard for decades, yet they are non-recyclable and ultimately end up in a landfill. It\u2019s about time you ditch the disposables and move towards a more sustainable future.\nElectric lighters are not only better for the environment, they have numerous features that make them better than standard butane lighters.\nGone are the days of awkward lighting and burnt finger tips! The Flip follows the form of a \u2018traditional\u2019 lighter but with two power buttons (one on top and one on the bottom) for easily lighting up from any direction or angle.  \nWhat makes the Flip stand out?\nThe Sparkr Wick is the go-to solution for those \u2018around the home\u2019 lighting needs. The extended 6 inch neck will have you reaching comfortably into hard-to-reach candles, barbecues, and more. Gone are the days of holding candles upside down or burning your fingers.\nWhat makes the Wick stand out?\nAfter successfully launching and fulfilling the Sparkr flashlight and Sparkr Mini, we decided that there was more work to be done to create better, more versatile electric lighters. \nWe focused on creating uniquely designed lighters that you wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of carrying with you everywhere or having on display near your candles, incense, barbecue, etc. One that you could charge up easily and that works regardless of the weather or task at hand.\nAfter ordering and testing all the current lighter solutions on the market, we started to narrow in on what features we thought would make the ultimate fire-making device. We decided that reliability, comfort, and safety were key to the perfect lighter and became our priorities.\nThe Sparkr Flip and Sparkr Wick were born after months of sketching, 3D printing, soldering and testing to ensure that these key features were accomplished in the simplest and smallest form factor possible.\nWe used the Sparkr prototypes in real world scenarios from campfires to candles and made sure they stood up to to the test. We appreciate you taking the time to learn more about our new electric lighters and the story behind them. We wouldn't be here without the support of our AMAZING Kickstarter backers.

I'm thrilled to introduce you to Flexr. \nFlexr works just like any other pullup bar, with one big difference: once you finish your workout, it folds up to a 2 ft by 1 ft by 6 inch form that's compact and easy to store.\n  Traditional pullup bars are bulky, difficult to store, and impossible to travel with. It's a bulky contraption that people handle with difficulty. It's something people have tolerated for too long - no more!\nHi - My name's Derek, I'm the co-founder of the Flexr pullup bar. I had two main problems with traditional pullup bars:\n1) There's nowhere to store them. They just take up so much space.\n2) They're impossible to travel with. Every time I went traveling, I had to break my workout routine. \nWhere do you put a pullup bar? Most of the time it looked like this - somewhere out of place:\nThat's why I decided to create the Flexr, the world's first foldable pullup bar.\nKeeping up a consistent workout routine is difficult enough. It's even harder when you have to stop and restart your workout routine. Every time you break your routine, it makes it much more difficult to get things started again. Most people have to break their routine when they go traveling.\nThat's why I wanted to have a pullup bar that I could carry with me no matter where I went. Having a pullup bar that you can take with you anywhere you go makes it easy to keep up your routine - whether you're at home or in Africa.\n  The Flexr is a major upgrade over most other pullup bars - even if you're not traveling. Why?\nMost pullup bars are so bulky that there's no practical place to put them. With Flexr, you can easily slip it under your bed or in a spare drawer. It goes from a \"where do I put this thing?\" to an afterthought. \n  So, how do you actually use the Flexr? \nIt's easy: just latch the pullup bar into your doorway. The sturdy top side lays on top of the door, while the door grips go on the other side. \nThen you're ready to get started with your workout!\n      You're ambitious and adventurous. You want to enjoy life to the fullest and experience all that the world has to offer.\nBut you can\u2019t do it unless you are taking care of your body and working out.\nYou can only work hard and play hard when you\u2019ve got an abundance of energy and vitality from eating health and working out. \nUsing a pull-up bar is a great way to improve your workout. The problem is, common products on the market are ugly, hard to store and can\u2019t easily be traveled with. \nMost pull up bars force you to sacrifice your apartment space, and don\u2019t travel well. \nYou shouldn\u2019t need to make sacrifices when it comes to working out. \nSo, as product designers with over 10 years of experience, who have used dozens of pull-up bars in the past 15 years of our lives, we made something better.\nFlexr is made of three light yet durable materials:\nThe top door rest is made of injection molded plastic. That's the same stuff that iPhone cases are made from.\nThe bars themselves are made from bent steel. The same type of steel used in steam ships.\nThe center latch is made from aircraft-grade aluminum. \nThe entire pullup bar only weighs 6 pounds. You can slip it in your luggage, without tipping over those pesky airline weight limits.\n      PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n        Meet Derek & Eric, the founders of Flexr.\nDerek and Eric have built many product businesses in the past, both on their own and as business partners.\nDerek: Derek\u2019s built a t-shirt company and a supplements company in the past. He\u2019s intimately familiar with how to get products manufactured and shipped to customers.\nHe\u2019s also traveled 28 countries, gotten chased by a bull while motorbiking India, and got bit by a monkey in Indonesia.\nEric: Eric used to manage digital marketing for one of the largest beer companies in the world. Before that he spent three years building the eCommerce systems for one of the worlds largest CPG companies. Since then, he\u2019s started several eCommerce businesses of his own.\nEric has lived in the United States, Brazil, London, Bali, Thailand and has traveled to over 20 countries.\nMeet Our Marketing Partner, Funded Today:\n Get your project funded here!\n Our backer fulfillment & reward management is managed in partnership with ...\n                                        Get cash back on the projects you love!\n    Yes, we ship to frequent travelers. \nDigital nomad living in Chiang Mai, Barcelona or Costa Rica? We got you covered. \nWe can ship your pullup bar anywhere in the world, and only ask for your address as we're about to ship it. That way, even if you're not sure where you'll be by the time we're ready to ship, you'll still be able to get your Flexr.\nIf you're unsure where you'll be when you receive the Flexr, just select U.S. shipping for now. You'll pay the difference in shipping costs once we're actually shipping the product.\nWe're projecting a ship date of January 2018. Just in time for New Year's resolutions!\n  Credit: Hubud & Outpost for letting us film in their co-working spaces in Bali.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNobody wants to wait longer than necessary for a product they're excited about. We've worked very hard to get this product as close to fulfillment as possible, before going to Kickstarter. That said, here are the risks we see moving forward:\n\nMANUFACTURING: Because the Flexr uses similar parts to other fitness products, most of it can be manufactured fairly easily. However, the folding top bracket and the weight bearing bottom clip are injection molded plastic and casted aluminum. Creating the tooling and castings for these two parts generally takes about 30 days, and this is where delays can happen. We're working with manufacturers with a history of prompt delivery to minimize that possibility.\n\nPRODUCT CHANGES: As the Flexr gets closer to final production, there will likely be some minor improvements made to the final product. These will always be made with the end user in mind. Any changes we make will be communicated to you prior to receiving the product, and we'll always let you know exactly why and how the product was changed.\n\nFULFILLMENT: \n\nOur team has experience shipping products to thousands of customers in over a dozen different countries. That said, unforseen circumstances can occur that can cause delays in shipping. To reduce that risk, we've identified specific logistics providers we want to work with, and have already began the process of setting up shipping with them.\n\nVideo:\n\nClaims in the video are not finalized and may change through the manufacturing process.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

The pathogens must survive the body's powerful immune response, adapt in an ever changing environment, and evolve to take on virulence factors to increase their attack, defense, and other abilities so that they may do enough damage to defeat the body before the human host becomes immune and all the players lose the game.\nThe game is highly scalable, allowing players to choose their level of difficulty and the length of game they wish to play.\nPathogenesis blends the feel of center-row style deck builders such as Star Realms and Ascension with mechanics based 100% on real science, simulating the roles of pathogens and the immune system at each phase of the game.\nModes of play include solo, competitive, cooperative, team play, and classroom.\nWho might like this game?  Avid gamers, fans of deck builders, medicine & science enthusiasts, teachers and students from high school to college level and beyond.\n1-4 players.  Ages 14+   30-60 minutes\n                    RULE BOOK, click HERE to access:\nHATE RULE BOOKS? - CHECK OUT THESE HOW TO PLAY VIDEOS! \nBelow is a link to 7 short videos that will show you how to play the game from set up, how to play your turn, and the various aspects of game play followed by a complete solo game example. You can skip through the videos using the arrows on either side.\nPathogenesis is all about building pathogens to withstand the punishing immune response and defeat the body.  The pathogens put in play stay in play (until destroyed by the immune system) allowing you to continue to build them and attack the body each turn, unlike most deck building games where all cards are discarded at the end of your turn. \nYou begin the game with your own personal deck of 10 cards:\nThese cards allow you to gain and use genetic value to acquire stronger pathogens, trait cards, toxin cards, and environment cards. The upgraded cards acquired on previous turns will cycle back into your hand on future turns allowing you to play them on existing pathogens increasing their attack, defense, and other abilities.\nThe pathogens' first task is to attack the body and breach the body's defense barriers:\nOnce the body's defensive barriers are breached, the immune system activates and your pathogens must survive the body's powerful immune response each turn before you are able to damage the body and take victory points. \nThe initial immune response is dealt from deck 1.  When this deck runs out the discard pile is shuffled into immune deck 2 to form the final immune response.  If players do not meet the game end damage condition before the final immune deck runs out then the body declares immunity and all of the players lose the game.\nWant to play a demo of the game now?

Going through many jobs ranging from lab work to video game motion capture, he's brought his passions together making videos about board and video games, science, and more.\n\"A mechanistically solid and highly versatile deckbuilder in its own right, Pathogenesis has great potential as a wonderful educational tool - taking the incredibly complex science of immunology and making it more digestible and understandable for anyone wanting to learn. Highly recommend giving it a go!\" - Danny C.\nREVIEW VIDEO BY UNDEAD VIKING:\n \"I don't usually enjoy Deck Builders, but when I do, they are fantastic games like this one!\" - Undead Viking\nPREVIEW VIDEO BY BOARD GAME BRAWL:\n WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT THE GAME?\n\"By taking the genre's strengths of customization and marketplace competition, giving it a wonderful theme, and removing the hassle of troublesome trash cards, Pathogenesis bridges the gap between new and experienced players, and even to those who typically don't reach for a deck-builder on game night like me.\" -Matt Ochs (Kansas City Game Designers)\n\"This is one game I've been looking forward to seeing become a reality. I had the pleasure of playtesting, and enjoyed it thoroughly. One of the big features I like are the options for co-op and team play.\" - Troy Pichelman (Kansas City Game Designers)\n\"I like that it is educational, but still FUN. As a college instructor, I see a lot of games that are educational. None of these games are fun to play outside of the classroom. I do not understand microbiology, but still have a great time playing Pathogenesis\". - Kelly C Hughes, Instructor at Alexandria Technical and Community College.\n\"Pathogenesis attacks a deck builder from an angle I have not seen playing as a bacterial pathogen attacking a body! The AI they have developed is very cleverly done and seems to think and guess what you as a pathogen are doing to it reacting and hitting back. This game is also VERY educational and great effort has been put not only into the artwork but the realism of the science as well. It strikes a great balance of learning but extremely fun at the same time!\". - Rodger Moore, Board Games & Beer Podcast & High School Biology Teacher.\n  We use the \u201cStegmaier\u201d method of shipping games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees and VAT and to keep shipping prices low.

Jamie is full time professor of biology. When teaching the immune system, textbooks cover the subject in pieces and her students never get to see the whole picture. Her goal for this game was to help her students see how the immune system works as a whole.   \nLoren Cunningham is Jamie\u2019s husband and partner in crime. Together they created Transylvania: Curses & Traitors that was successful on Kickstarter in 2014.   Loren\u2019s background is in business rather than science, so his job was to make sure that the game and its mechanics worked well for EVERYONE regardless of their background in biology.

(OK, so this is just our second rodeo.)\n\nOur first Kickstarter for Transylvania: Curses & Traitors really taught us a lot. We plan on applying everything we learned from that campaign to make the campaign for Pathogenesis even better.\n\nThe process of creating a game and getting it to backers on time is highly complicated and involved. Delays are possible at each step from art, to production, to shipping.\n\nTo mitigate these risks we have established a fantastic help-line of people who have the expertise that we do not. We have sought out industry professionals and people who have had successful Kickstarter campaigns to provide us with guidance, expertise, and a sounding board. We feel very confident that the people in our corner have and will provide us with the information necessary to provide a smooth and successful campaign.\n\nWe have established relationships with several manufacturing companies who have a proven track record of creating great games with high quality components and who have experience working with Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nWe have also established a supply chain network capable of getting the games from the manufacturer to our Kickstarter backers including multiple potential distribution agents who have a good reputation in the industry and experience working with Kickstarter campaigns.\n\n100% of the art and graphic design for all of the game components has been completed except for any new art created during the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nWe believe in being 100% open, honest, and transparent with our backers and will keep them up to date, informed, and we are ready, willing, and excited to communicate and answer questions.\n\nPlease feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns about our campaign: wibaigames@gmail.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "RESEARCHER", "descp": "Contribute $1 or more towards the important research that went into Pathogenesis.

Bigger pixels = better picture.\nChoosing a 5MP camera allows bigger pixels within the same sensor size, and is enough megapixels to print at 14\"x11\" full resolution.\nSee sample images here.\nMicro-Adhesive Sticky Pad\nPodo sticks with a quick press, then peels right off.

We wanted something much more versatile and easy to use, so we made it!\nWe raised $427,000 last year from over 3,600 amazing backers. Podo shipped worldwide, won global design awards, and starred on TV, magazines, and even a music video.\nPodo represents our passion, our team\u2019s grit, and our conviction that technology should be fun and simple. Thank you to every fan and supporter who\u2019s shown us love along the way.\nHOW TO ORDER\n1. Back this Project: Click \"Back This Project\" at the top of this page, or click here.

It's been an amazing journey and we are now manufacturing the first batch of The SilverAir Travel Underwear. To pre-order underwear, check out our website - https://www.yathletics.com\n Underwear rides up. Underwear smells. Sometimes, it gets hot and stuffy. Sometimes it loses shape. And when we\u2019re going away for the week, we need to stuff half our bags with underwear. That\u2019s just how it is. We wanted to change that.\nOur goal is not to \u201cpitch\u201d you the product (that\u2019s what our video is for!). Rather, we'll teach you something about it. We want you to really be able to see and experience the purposeful design and technology that went into creating these boxer briefs. Here are the highlights:\nSMARTGRIP NO RIDE-UP SYSTEM\nWhen we asked our backers what they disliked about their existing underwear, the most common feedback was that it rides and bunches up. So, we dug deep into the issue and discovered that the length of the legs and the elasticity of the fabric are contributing factors. Longer length holds better but when they ride up, there is more fabric that bunches up as well. So we adjusted the length to be just right and added spandex for superior elasticity. But we didn't stop there...\nWe created a brand new solution that we call SmartGrip. Inspired by grip systems in high-end cycling apparel, we called upon the best grip manufacturer and implemented cycling grips in our underwear. It worked, but the friction felt uncomfortable. After some more experimentation, we created our own custom grip system using soft silicones that you barely feel against your skin but which creates just enough resistance for the leg band to stay in place. The result is underwear that simply stays put.\nSILVERAIR ANTI STINK TECHNOLOGY\nThis is our signature technology and we\u2019ve incorporated it into the fabric of the underwear. It\u2019s the same silver that you\u2019ll find in our shirts and socks. Unlike most anti-odor solutions, ours is not a topical treatment. It's permanent and will never wash away. When it comes to anti-odor performance, this is the gold standard.\nHow does it work? The chemistry is simple. Sweat is mostly water and doesn\u2019t have any smell. But the bacteria present in sweat often create unpleasant odors. Silver has the ability to break down bacteria and prevent them from reproducing, so the pure silver yarns permanently infused into our fabric helps to keep our underwear fresh and odor free.\nPREMIUM MERINO FABRIC\nFabric is the heart of our products, and it\u2019s what we spend most of our time on. Some of the best underwear we\u2019ve worn is made from cotton, but cotton does not have any performance features. On the other hand, performance fibers like nylon and polyester tend to hold odor and can get uncomfortable after a few hours. We found the perfect solution in high end Merino Wool, which wicks moisture and can naturally regulate temperature.\nSourced from one of the best sheep farms in Australia, our Merino Wool is a 17.5 micron gauge - one of the finest in the industry. The use of ultra fine yarns allows us to create a fabric that's super soft. We also added spandex as underwear tends to lose their shape after being worn for half a day. The stretch fabric in this underwear not only holds its shape but it gives you increased flexibility for easier movement.\n  We are Y Athletics, and our mission is to simplify your life with thoughtfully designed gear you can fall in love with. To do that, we engineer each product from scratch, with materials and components tailored specifically towards them. By focusing on every single detail, we are able to strike the perfect balance between performance, comfort, and style. We don't make too many products, but whatever we do make screams quality and craftsmanship.\n3 years ago, we launched our first product through Kickstarter. The community here funded our dream and we delivered a 5 star product that is loved by thousands of people from around the globe. Last year, we did it again with our socks.\nAnother year and dozens of prototypes later, we\u2019re back with our third and we couldn't have been more proud. We\u2019re calling it The Ultimate Travel Underwear because it's going to change the way you travel. In reality, it's the best damn underwear for daily wear as well.\n    UNDERWEAR\nWe are making the underwear in the boxer brief style in three colors:\nGraphite Grey & Electric Blue are renderings\n  Swatches of actual colors\n SHIRTS\nShirts will be available in your choice of crew or v neck in 3 colors: Charcoal Grey, Alloro Green & Glacier Silver. Additional color options from here may be added depending on availability.\nSOCKS\nSocks will be available in the ankle length in your choice of four colors: Jet Black, Glacier White, Ithaca Green, and Sedona Red.\nUNDERWEAR\nOur underwear will be manufactured in sizes S-XXL and will cover waist sizes 28\" all the way to 46\". The size guide will be available when we send out the surveys.\nSHIRTS & SOCKS\nCheck out https://www.yathletics.com/pages/sizing\nThe underwear has been under development for more than a year. We've overcome most of the challenges and are ready to go into production. Below is an estimated timeline for production. You'll be the first to know if anything changes.\n  GENERAL CAUTION\nWe offer the best deals to backers of our Kickstarter campaigns. Backers are also the first to receive new products and they get to see exciting progress of our production. The money you pledge towards our campaign goes directly into the development and production of our products. This campaign is not a store front. If you want full service from Y Athletics, please purchase products from yathletics.com at retail value when they're available.\nREFUNDS\nWe reserve the right to issue or deny any requested refunds. If we issue a refund, we will deduct 10% from it because that amount has already been taken from your pledge as fees for the payment processor and Kickstarter.\nEXCHANGES\nWe want you to be satisfied with your reward. If the product you receive does not fit, you may exchange the unworn items for a different size. We cannot exchange underwear and sock once the package is opened so we recommend trying one pair before opening the remaining ones. For exchanges, you\u2019ll have to send the product back to us at your own expense and then pay for shipping the new product back to you.\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS\nWe ship internationally to select countries using FedEx and USPS. You will be given the choice to select your preferred carrier at the end of the campaign.\nAll international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying. All Kickstarter rewards will be declared 'gifts', however, most countries will assess duties/taxes and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. If you refuse delivery, your package will be abandoned. Once abandoned, we can\u2019t ship another package to you or issue a refund.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fourth Kickstarter project. We\u2019ve delivered some of the highest quality products to our backers in the past and this one\u2019s not going to be any different. The only risk we can think of is the projected timeline of the delivery of rewards. Since this is a brand new development, there may be unforeseen challenges when we start production. If any issues come up, the delivery of your reward will be delayed.\n\nThat said, we\u2019re pretty straight forward when it comes to communication and have built a reputation of being transparent with our backers. We'll make two promises:\n\n1. We will deliver the highest quality product to each and every single backer. We take extreme pride in making some of the best products in the world and will never compromise on quality.\n\n2. We will keep the lines of communication open at all times.

Even this game is a farce of a farce of a farce and shouldn't be played.\nI don't agree with the statement that these games are billed as offensive so you shouldn't actually be offended. Date rape isn't funny. Homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, racism, sexism isn't funny.

It was a revolutionary step forward for the medium in a time when developers first began experimenting with interactive story telling.\nPlayers were trapped aboard Citadel Station as they fought to survive against the cyborgs and mutated crew members corrupted by a maniacal A.I. known as SHODAN, one of the most treacherous antagonists ever conceived. System Shock offered an unparalleled experience that would solidify it as one of the greatest games of all time.\nSystem Shock - Big Box Collectors Edition\n    We want to demonstrate our commitment and passion for System Shock by providing a fun and exciting experience to potential backers. This demo represents the look and feel that we want to achieve with the final version we'll deliver to you, our backers. Please be aware, this is a proof of concept; the PERFORMANCE, FEATURES, and VISUALS are subject to change. We hope you enjoy your time aboard Citadel Station! SHODAN eagerly awaits your arrival...\n                                            PLAY\n\n                                                                                                         Caught during a risky break-in, you become indentured to a greedy TriOptimum executive. After six months in a healing coma, you awaken to discover the surgeons are missing, the station is in disrepair, and the once-prime corporate facility now teems with mindless cyborgs, robots, and mutated beings, all programmed to serve a ruthless A.I.: SHODAN. There's scarcely time to think before it unleashes the first terror...\nCortex Reaver Concept Art - by Robb Waters\nTo help shape and direct the existing narrative of System Shock, we've enlisted the help of Chris Avellone, who is best known for his work on a number of role-playing games, including; Fallout: New Vegas, Wasteland 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 2. Chris will be working closely with Stephen Kick (our Creative Director) and Jason Fader (our Project Director and Senior Producer from Fallout: New Vegas) as well as several other key developers from Fallout: New Vegas to bring modern AAA quality into the world of System Shock.\nChris has been a long-time fan of the System Shock series, and we\u2019re very eager to work with his design expertise to improve Citadel Station.\n  General Features\n\u2192 A modern take on System Shock, a faithful reboot; it\u2019s not Citadel Station as it was, but as you remember it. Many improvements, overhauls and changes are being implemented to capture the spirit of what the original game was trying to convey, and bring it to contemporary gamers.\n\u2192 Re-imagined enemies, weapons, and locations by original concept artist Robb Waters.\n\u2192 Terri Brosius reprises her role as SHODAN, and new VO will be recorded.\n\u2192 Brand new musical score composed by Jonathan Peros.\n\u2192 The user interface, game mechanics, enemies, and puzzles will be updated to reflect modern aesthetics and sensibilities, while maintaining the feel of the original.\nScope Features\n\u2192 $900k Goal: Modern Inventory Management, Modern Controls, New Puzzles, Updated Faithful Levels, Game Difficulty Modes.\n\u2192 $1.7m Goal : Enemy limb dismemberment, More puzzles, Ammo types/weapon settings, Vending machines, Weapon upgrading, Hardcore mode (No respawning), Ironman mode (Only 1 savegame. If you die, the save is deleted)\n    We wanted the art of System Shock to be fresh and new while still remaining true to the aesthetics of the 1994 classic. We've maintained much of the original look, while accentuating it beautifully by an array of modern rendering features such as Physically Based Rendering (PBR), screen-space reflections, real-time global illumination, ambient occlusion (HBAO), volumetric particles, and dynamic lighting. It's the world you remember:\n Leading our conceptual efforts is Robb Waters, the original concept artist from System Shock, the BioShock series, Thief, and Freedom Force. He's been tasked with revisiting his work from 1994 and re-imagining it. It's been very exciting seeing his designs evolve through the process.\n          We want this game to be as chilling to players today as the original System Shock was when it was released in 1994. What is most important to us is taking the essence of the original game, and emphasizing that as we present it to gamers today. With the knowledge and technological improvements over the last 22 years since the original, we can communicate the story of Citadel Station more effectively than ever.\nSystem Shock will have a dramatic and modern take on a musical score. Combining its root sci-fi elements with dynamic acoustic elements \u00e0 la BioShock, we are striving to set System Shock apart from other more action-based shooters as an atmospheric and dark experience.\nPrague's FILMharmonic Orchestra; Civilization V, Hostel, Halo Wars, et al. (see stretch goals)\nThough computer music software has improved exponentially in the last decade, there is no equivalent to the breathtaking and visceral sounds that real instruments can produce. We have been working with Videri String Quartet, and we are in talks with Prague's FILMharmonic Orchestra about recording the score for System Shock. They're a very professional orchestra, having recorded scores for Civilization V, Thief, Hostel, Dream Theater, and many more projects. If we can reach the stretch goal required to afford everything that it takes to record a full orchestra, the game's musical experience will be much more expressive and terrifying than would ever be possible without.\nThough for a modern game like System Shock, a more restrained and dramatic approach is called for, we are also really excited to bring the old System Shock tunes back to life in an updated way! With a roster of world-class musicians, we have set a stretch goal to release a remixed version of the original soundtrack intact! Please help us to make this a reality so that we cannot only provide a strong modern gameplay experience, but also give the old tunes the love that they deserve!\nNightdive Studios - Composer and Sound Designer, Jonathan Peros (Working in the Studio)\n    Nightdive Studios is comprised of industry veterans passionate about developing a faithful reboot of one of our favorite games.\n We understand the risks and challenges there are when creating a compelling experience and with the help and guidance from the original Looking Glass/Irrational Team (as well as AAA RPG developers directly on the team) we are poised to deliver a worthy entry to the System Shock universe. Here are just a few of the games we've worked on:\n    The full release of System Shock will be initially available for Windows and Xbox One. The Windows version will be available on Steam, Humble, and GOG (DRM-free). OSX and Linux versions will be unlocked when our first stretch goal is reached. We\u2019re open to other platforms in the future.\n    Nightdive Studios is a small team of passionate and talented developers and while we're able to operate on the revenue we earn from the sales of our classic games catalog, it's only enough to continue funding our core business. With our transition into full-time development, we'll need help from you, the fans and members of the crowdfunding community to get us off to a great start. We want to make this game with the fans, and it\u2019s important to us to remain independent for that reason. Ultimately, this game is for you. We want to ensure your voice is heard and we deliver on what you want. We've done the math, and with $900,000 we're confident we can complete the project and deliver a game (and rewards!) that every Shock fan will love - but with additional funds, we're prepared to increase the scope of the game and include some great stretch goals that will enhance everyone's experience.\n                    We are hoping to exceed our goal in order to bring you a more exciting experience. When our stretch goals are reached, prepare yourself for what is to come including cross-platform integration, new locations, challenges, and multilingual support. \n                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe understand that game development is difficult, and a numbers of risks are involved. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re dealing with that:\n\nFINANCIAL RISK: Games are very expensive to make. We\u2019ve worked on several big-budget games and have senior developers onboard to help budget the project properly. We have frontloaded a great deal of development using our own funds, taking on the risk ourselves. It wasn\u2019t easy, but we\u2019re driven to see our vision of System Shock complete and in your hands. Now, with a pre-alpha demo, we need your help to get us to the finish line!\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: One of the biggest risks with any project is the completion timeline. Early on in a project, estimates are far less accurate than later. Fortunately, we\u2019re starting this campaign at the 25% mark in development, so our estimates are more accurate than usual. Still, game development can be unpredictable at certain stages, and we understand that. Our goal is to do our very best to complete the game as outlined by our funding and stretch goals. Should the schedule need to change, our backers will be the first to know and we\u2019ll be as transparent as possible. We\u2019re in this together.\n\nFUN RISK: Making a fun game is the ultimate goal, but it\u2019s more of an art than a science. Often times a feature may not be as fun as we\u2019d like, and requires more iteration. Luckily, we\u2019re working with some amazing developers that have shipped critically acclaimed AAA titles to help ensure we\u2019ll make the game fun and engaging. During several phases in the project, we\u2019ll be conducting limited focus tests for every level and every feature. Through rigorous focus testing and iteration, we\u2019ll be able to optimally tune the game and maximize the fun. We know you care a great deal about our game, and we do too. Your support will help ensure System Shock is as fun as it can possibly be!\n\nThank you again for your support and we can\u2019t wait to show you the awesome content we\u2019re going to make!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "INTERLOPER", "descp": "+ Kickstarter Email Updates\n+ Concept Art Wallpaper Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["408 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "REPAIR BOT", "descp": "+ Digital Copy of the Game (Choice of Supported Platform)\n+ Digital Tri-Optimum Handbook\n+ Repair Bot Forum SSR Badge", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["11,744 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "HUMANOID MUTANT", "descp": "+ Digital Collector\u2019s Edition:\n\u2192 Digital Copy of the Game (Choice of Supported Platform)\n\u2192 Digital Maps\n\u2192 Digital Tri-Optimum Handbook\n\u2192 Digital Soundtrack\n\u2192 Concept Art Wallpaper Pack\n\u2192 Humanoid Mutant Forum Badge\n\u2192 Humanoid Mutant Credit In The Game\n+ Digital Copies of:\n\u2192 System Shock Enhanced (2015) (PC)\n\u2192 System Shock 2 (1999) (PC)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["4,064 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "DRONE CYBORG", "descp": "+ Physical Copy of the Game in Steel Case (PC)\n+ Exclusive Access to Closed Beta (Steam)\n+ Drone Cyborg Forum Badge\n+ Drone Cyborg Credit In The Game\nYou will Also Receive:\n+ Digital Collector\u2019s Edition (Choice of Supported Platform)\n+ Digital Copies of:\n\u2192 System Shock Enhanced (2015) (PC)\n\u2192 System Shock 2 (1999) (PC)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["1,837 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "CYBORG ASSASSIN", "descp": "+ Limited Edition System Shock Art Book\nYou will also Receive:\n+ Physical Copy of the Game in Steel Case (PC)\n+ Digital Collector\u2019s Edition (Choice of Supported Platform)\n+ Exclusive Access to Closed Beta (Steam)\n+ Digital Copies of:\n\u2192 System Shock Enhanced (2015) (PC)\n\u2192 System Shock 2 (1999) (PC)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["372 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "CYBORG ENFORCER", "descp": "+ Big Box Collector\u2019s Edition:\n\u2192 Soundtrack\n\u2192 Tri-Optimum Handbook\n\u2192 Tri-Optimum Crew Patch\n\u2192 Tri-Optimum Crew Pin\n\u2192 Repair-Bot Figurine\n\u2192 Steel DVD Case with the Game (PC)\n+ Cyborg Enforcer Forum Badge\n+ Cyborg Enforcer Credit In The Game\n+ Exclusive Access to Developer Forums\nYou will also Receive:\n+ Digital Collector\u2019s Edition (Choice of Supported Platform)\n+ Exclusive Access to Closed Beta (Steam)\n+ Digital Copies of:\n\u2192 System Shock Enhanced (2015) (PC)\n\u2192 System Shock 2 (1999) (PC)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,434 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 350 or more", "title": "HUMAN CORPSE", "descp": "+ You will forever be remembered on Citadel Station.

The object is to get all your cards to your opponent's side. Use strategies like blocking and trapping to beat your opponent.  Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent.\nNOTE: The Rushi Cards will be upgraded to 2mm card stock in the final retail version that we will deliver to our backers!\nA 10 Minute Game for Everyone\nRushi is is simple enough for a 5 year old to understand but has enough strategy for much more complex game play. We built Rushi in the spirit of classic board games like Checkers or Chess, but we wanted the game experience to be unique and fast paced. We have played hundreds of games and are still learning new strategies each time we play. \nRules\nEach player starts with:\n3 Single Arrow Cards\n2 Side Arrow Cards\n2 Corner Arrow Cards\nObjective: The objective of the game is to be the first player to place all 6 of their cards into their opponent\u2019s Home Squares (the first and last rows on the board, marked with a dot).\nHome squares\nSetup: Each player places the following cards on their Home Squares in the following order, from left to right: 1 Single Arrow Card (facing forward), 1 Corner Arrow Card, 2 Side Arrow Cards, 1 Corner Arrow Card, 1 Single Arrow Card (facing forward). Players keep the remaining Single Arrow Card in their hand.\nRushi setup\nGameplay: Players take turns placing the card in their hand on the board. Players can only place their card on a square that one of their other cards is pointing to (see Diagram). Players cannot place their card on top of another card. When a player places their card on a square, they must pick up the card that was pointing to that square to play on their next turn. \nYour next card can go in the blue boxes\nIf two cards were pointing to that square, players may pick up either card, but not both.\nYou can pick up either card in this situation\nSwap Rule: Instead of placing their card on an open square, players may swap the card in their hand with any one of their cards on the board, as long as that card is not on a Home Square. This ends the player\u2019s turn.\nAdditional Rules:\nThe person with the Blue cards goes first.\nAfter the initial setup, Single Arrow Cards can be placed on the board pointing in any direction.\nYou cannot swap a card that is on a Home Square.\nIf you can\u2019t make a legal move, you lose your turn.\nOnce you place a card on one of your opponent\u2019s Home Squares, that card is locked in place and cannot be used for the rest of the game.\nWhat does it comes with?\nThe game will show up at your doorstep in pristine retail packaging. The game will include a foldable board and 14 high quality professionally printed Rushi cards.\nHow far along are you?\nWe spent countless hours slaving over every aspect from game play to card and board design and we think we finally got it right.

It shares similarities to card games like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, but in a simpler easy-to-pick-up-and-play way, akin to Love Letter. Anyone older than 10 who has a knack for card games should enjoy themselves.\nWhat is Control?\nWith mechanics inspired by Cuttle, Control is combat card game for 2\u20134 players where rounds last 5\u201315 minutes. Players are time travelers who\u2019ve been caught in a rupture in spacetime and displaced outside time. Each player must use Fuel Cells (the cards) to refuel their own time machine or stop other players from refueling theirs first.\nWhat\u2019s the Goal?\nTo escape the rupture, a player needs to reach a Fuel Cell Charge of 21 or more at the end of his or her turn. Whoever does so first closes the rupture, leaving all other travelers lost outside time.\nWhat's in the Box?\n54 Poker-Size Cards (13 different card types with a custom illustration for each type)\nThe Instruction Manual\nCounters (Upgradable through Stretch Goals)\nPlatform Insert (To hold cards)\nWhat are the Rules?\nThe deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards. Cards are either Silver or Bronze Fuel Cells with their Fuel Cell Charge in the top left ranging from 1-10.\nOn their turn, a player chooses ONE of the following:\nDraw a card. A player may not draw if they have seven cards in hand.\nInstall a Silver or Bronze Fuel Cell in their area of play. The Fuel Cell Charge on installed cards goes toward a player's goal of 21 or more to win. Abilities on Silver Fuel Cells are activated when installed. \nBurn a Bronze Fuel Cell to the discard pile to activate its ability.\nDefuse an opponent\u2019s fuel cells with a Fuel Cell of your own of equal or higher value.\nThat\u2019s it. With two to three players, it's every-man-for-himself. In a four-player game, teams of two must work together to make their escape.

Since we do not want to infringe on other people's trademark or confuse our customers Skirmish has been renamed to Scrimish (a Middle English version of Skirmish).\nWhat is Scrimish?\nScrimish is a fast moving card game that pits player against player in an epic 10 minute battle of strategy, memory, and misdirection. Every game is different, and you'll want to play over and over again to try new ways of outsmarting your opponent. The game is expandable to large team or free-for-all games. \nScrimish comes with two 25 card decks each containing the cards pictured above. Strategically place these cards in 5 rows of 5 to defeat you opponent(s)\nInfinite Strategy, Infinite Possibilities\nScrimish is simple enough to learn in under 2 minutes but has strategy deep enough for an MIT grad to lose their mind over. \nIt\u2019s got the other following things you will love:\nExpandable to large team or free-for-all games. 2 Players/deck.\nFor ages 8+\nPortable 50 card deck\nRelies on memory in addition to strategy\nNO LUCK INVOLVED!\nHow does it work?\nTo get started each player selects the location of each of their cards and places them in 5 rows of 5 as shown.\nWhat does it comes with?\nThe game will show up at your doorstep before the holiday season in pristine retail packaging. There are 50 cards per deck. Cards are 2\u2019\u2019 x 3.5\u2019\u2019 made from premium card stock, professionally printed and digitally cut.\nHow far along are you?\nWe spent countless hours slaving over every aspect from game play to card design and we think we finally got it right. We recently completed a short run of cards with a local card manufacturer and have a complete game ready for production. We have also hand picked our manufacturing partner to make the version of Scrimish that will arrive at your doorstep. We have worked with these guys before and they do top quality work. This is where we need your help. \nThere is a large upfront cost of $4000 needed to start production.

YEAH~!\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nCharging iPad air2 at 1.58A load current with 4 panels of Solar Paper & 1.97A load current with 5 panels of Solar Paper.\n( 1.58A is the load current that an apple 10W wall charger generate.)\nTwo usb ports upgrade is coming soon.\nLive interview at CNBC\nPLAY\n\nEven with weak sun light, 4 panels of Solar Paper generated USB cable's power currents\nPLAY\n\nYOLK a day keeps nuclear generating station away.\nMatch height with a controller?\nFive panels are little lower than a controller and 6 panels are little higher than a controller.  One solar panel is placed at the back of the solar panel with a controller. (It is a prototype. We will let the metal connector to encapsulated magnet. Then it will have  a lot neat look.)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022Thin, Light, Fast: With Solar Paper we\u2019re making the thinnest and lightest solar charger that can reliably charge your smartphone in about 2.5 hours on a sunny day. That\u2019s about the same as a wall charger.\n\u2022Goes Anywhere: Solar Paper is so lightweight that outdoorsy types can clip it to a backpack and charge while hiking. Urban adventurers can easily slip it into a jacket pocket or notebook.\n\u2022Reliable and Easy to Use: Most solar chargers shut down and need to be manually reset after a cloud passes overhead and the voltage drops. Solar Paper automatically resets itself so you can keep charging, hassle free.\n\u2022Expands with Magnets: The basic 5 watt Solar Paper can charge your smartphone on a sunny day. If you need more power to charge a tablet, or to charge on a cloudy day, you can click new magnetic panels into place.\n\u2022From the same team that brought you SOLARADE, backed by 1,025 people in 2014.\nCurrent Status\n\u2022For the first batch, which we plan to ship in September 2015, we\u2019ve already ordered all the components except for the solar panels.\nCharge Anywhere Under the Sun\n         For Solar Paper, we\u2019re manufacturing the latest and most efficient solar panel. Because of this, Solar Paper is the world\u2019s smallest solar charger for the amount of potential wattage it can generate.\nAs part of this campaign, we\u2019re offering 5 watt, 7.5 watt and 10 watt chargers, with 2, 3 or 4 panels, respectively. In bright sunlight, the 5 watt charger can fully charge an iPhone 6 in about 2.5 hours, which is similar to a wall charger. For more powerful devices like tablets or cameras, or for faster charging, you\u2019ll want to opt for one of the higher-wattage versions. (There\u2019s a handy guide further down this page to help you pick the right one.)\n*We extended the Max power from 10W(4 panels in total) to 15W.(6panels in total)\nPaper thin & ultra lightweight, Solar Paper is just 0.15-inch thin and 4 oz.\nSlip Solar Paper inside a notebook or planner\nHanging Solar Paper on a backpack\nSolar Paper can recharge any device that charges using a USB cable\nCompatible Devices\nSolar paper can charge almost any device that recharges via USB, including, smartphones, tablets, walkie talkies, flashlights, portable game consoles, cameras, video cameras, and rechargeable batteries. (Refer to the handy guide further down the page to help you pick the right wattage for your devices.)\nSize & weight comparison\nThin, Lightweight and Durable\nSolar Paper measures just 9 x 19 x 1.1 cm when folded, and each panel weighs only 65~75 (2.5 oz). Watt-for-watt, it is 70 percent smaller and lighter than our closest competitor. Most importantly, Solar Paper is just 1.1 cm deep, at its thickest point, compared to 3.8 cm for our competitor, easy to carry it!\nSolar Paper with currencies from several countries.\nSolar Paper is water resistant\nEmbedded magnets let you easily add or subtract Solar Paper\u2019s solar panels.\nEasily Expandible Using Magnets\nWe wanted to make Solar Paper as compact as possible and also allow you to expand it in the future if you need to charge larger devices. Our design solution was to create a set of folding solar panels held together using strong magnets with silicon connectors. Only need two panels and want to save some weight? No problem. Just bought a tablet and need more wattage to charge it? Also not a problem.\nUse Solar Paper's embedded magnets to attach it to metal surfaces.\nThere are a couple of other advantages of using magnets in Solar Paper, too. First, there\u2019s no wear and tear on seams when you fold or unfold the panels, greatly extending Solar Paper\u2019s life. The magnets are also quite strong, so you can use them to mount Solar Paper to metal objects, as shown in the picture.\nAuto reset technology\nSet it and Forget It\nUnlike other simple devices with a battery, smart devices like smart-phones and tablets would not accept low current caused by insufficient sunlight. In this case, devices have to be manually reset. That means that users have to unplug and replug the cable every time a cloud passes overhead or you walk through a shadow. This is very inconvenient.\nWe wanted to make Solar Paper as easy as possible for anyone to use, so we have integrated \u2018auto-comparison technology\u2019 into the charger, to make it automatically resume powering your devices, after the sun starts soaking it again.\nDisplay exact load current so you know the power amount that Solar Paper is generating in real time.\nGeek Out with Real Time Readings\nBackers from our first solar project, Solarade, suggested that we find a way to show how much solar energy the panel is generating in real time. We thought this was a great idea, because, in addition to being very cool, it would let you see how the panel performs under different weather conditions.\nFor Solar Paper, we\u2019ve included an LCD amp meter that shows exactly how much current is flowing from the charger to your device at any time. We wouldn\u2019t include this  LCD if we were not absolutely confident about our technology and our product. No false advertising. No false promises.\n Please help us hit our fourth $1,000,000 stretch goal, so we can throw in 4carabiners, a pouch and a micro USB cable and something more.\nPicking the Right Wattage\nWe\u2019re offering Solar Paper in three versions:\n5 Watt (2 panels)\n7.5 Watt (3 panels)\n10 Watt (4 panels)\nYou\u2019ll want to pick the right one so you\u2019ll have ample power to charge your devices. We\u2019ve put together a quick guide to help you decide.\nQuestion 1: What\u2019s the biggest thing I want to charge?\nSmartphones need less power than tablets and most video cameras in order to charge. You can find out how much power your device needs to charge by checking your existing wall charger.\n5V * 1A = 5 Watts\nThe charger that comes with popular smartphones like the iPhone and Galaxy S, are 5 volts, 1 amp. Just multiply these numbers to get the watts you need:\n5V * 1.5A = 7.5Watts\nSome larger phones like the iPhone 6+ and Galaxy Note come with a higher powered wall chargers.  10Watt will charge devices quickly and stable, but 7.5Watts will be more cost effective if you live in a place with strong sun light.\n5V * 2A = 10 Watts\nCharging Tablet like iPad, Galaxy Tab. In this case, you can go with the 10 watt version of Solar Paper.\nIf you\u2019re charging a device that isn\u2019t \u201csmart\u201d, like a flashlight or Bluetooth speaker, you can use any version of Solar Paper. Higher watts means faster charging.\nQuestion 2: How\u2019s the weather?\nSolar Paper, like all solar panels works best in direct sunlight. If you live somewhere cloudy, (indoor artificial light will generate power, but it isn\u2019t enough to charge devices like smartphones at all), you\u2019ll want a higher wattage version to charge stably and quickly.\nMany \u201csmart\u201d devices like smartphones and tablets won\u2019t accept low power(250mA for 5W smartphones, 750mA for 10W tablets). This could happen if you\u2019re charging on cloudy days or close to sunset, and your device will display an error message like: \u201cThis accessory is not supported.\u201d If you\u2019ll regularly charge in less than full sunlight, consider buying the 7.5 watt or 10 watt Solar Paper, rather than the 5 watt.\nQuestion 3: Am I in a hurry?\nHigher watts generally means faster charging, and this is especially true when you don\u2019t have direct sunlight. The 10 watt Solar Paper has twice the potential power output of the 5 watt version.\nMission of YOLK:\nAfter the following success of the Solarade, I established a solar company and named it YOLK. It reflects our desire to supply solar energy to electronic devices as yolk does to the fetuses. Our mission isto bring this wonderful green technology to more people. I wish YOLK can be a bridge between solar energy and people, including not only campers and hikers or early adopters but many others who face battery problems in their everyday lives. I believe that solar technology can relieve the battery problem we face and contribute to making the world greener.\nYOLK's solar modules\nYOLK is a solar company specialized in high quality solar modules and panels. While we produce our own products like Solarade(2014) and Solar Paper(2015). We also supplied customized solar modules on client\u2019s demands. Solar modules are mainly used for iot & ict devices.\nYolk team\nAfter graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with BFA emphasis in design object, I have created nolla design studio to continue doing what I love and do best: making things. After the first solar charger project, Solarade, I was attracted by the synergy of technology and design. So I founded a solar charger company, YOLK. YOLK is a small company for now, but this team has the world's top solar techonology and a vision to spread this wonderful green technology to everyone's daily life. You will find the most innovative and advanced solar products at YOLK.\nSam Lim has been working in power industry for over 18 years and solar industry for 7 years. He has numerous patents and a wide arrange of experiences with developing power products.\nPrevious KickStarter Solar project was done by my personal KickStarter account in 2014. We made YOLK\u2019s new KickStarter ID since we plan to keep launch the innovative solar charger at here KickStarter.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/159052311/solarade-smart-and-powerful-solar-charger?ref=nav_search\nReview from the previous project, Solarade.\nSharing the campaign with your friend will be great help", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Solar Paper\" is a our second kickstarter solar charger project.

I am all about seeing things in different perspectives and bringing the unique sublime experiences through creative design from architecture, interior to products in our everyday life.\n MOTIVATION\nAs a Sci- Fi lover, I've always yearned for the day when I can experience the world like Star Wars, Blade Runner, Matrix, Tron and Starcraft ever since I was a kid. After so many years, I've become a designer and started to get back to tabletop game from TV game and PC game.  Dreadball fanatics is the one I like to play. It's a really fun game, but I always feel some futuristic elements are missing, just like watching a football game without beer. So I decided to design my own dice to satisfy my desire and here comes the Space Roller.\n WHAT IS SPACE ROLLER?\nSpace Roller is a unique design dice that dedicates to tabletop game lovers, dice collectors and toy maniacs who love futuristic design. It brings your fantasy of space traveling and concept of cyber world to reality. With just one roll away!\n SPECIFICATION \nStandard 16 mm dice\nChamfer corner gives more momentum \nGlowing resin\nPaint finishes with protective coating\nWeight about 5.5 g\nSpace Roller is a standard 16 mm dice with chamfer corner which gives Space Roller a bit more momentum when you roll it. Space Roller is made by injected glowing resin with different colors of finishes to obtain the futuristic and cyber feeling. All the sizes of carving lines and points are precisely tested out with many versions to present in 2 dimensions as a graph and 3 dimensions as an object. \nFinal design knock down\nFinished final mock-up\nTested out neon blue glowing with black, white & metallic gray finish\nFinish package design\nTesting packaging mock up \nReady for production for dice and packaging with manufacture\nRight now the final design is knocked down, manufacture for both dice and packaging are ready as well as delivery service. Everything is already, all we need is your pledge.\nWHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO\n1. The CNC molding for casting is really expensive due to the design complexity.  \n2. Space Roller requires secondary processing in addition to the resin casting which is much higher than other products.\n 3. We also have a very elegant packaging design that comes with the dice. Space Roller can sits inside in its box nicely as a collection while you are not using it. (Of course they would rather be used than just sit inside the box) \n4. Since we are located in Taiwan, international shipping is a huge cost. We absorb the cost for shipping to USA.\nWHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP\nEvery penny of pledge matters to us. We appreciate every thought from all backers who are a part of this project. Simply share our project in any social media to help spreading out. We invite you to be a part of our dream and let's make it happen!\n                                                                                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though everything is ready to go, there are still some possible challenges we may have to face, such as manufacture delay, delivery delay, missing delivery and so on.

We\u2019ve designed the system to capture contact information for parents or caregivers and we\u2019ll send all information to the child through that contact. In this way, we\u2019re never exposed to the risk of violating that trust we have with parents.

Thirty years ago, The Bard\u2019s Tale put Brian Fargo and Interplay on the map and launched a storied career crafting some of the most beloved cRPGs in gaming history.\nToday, we return to Skara Brae for the long-awaited dungeon-crawling sequel to the Bard\u2019s Tale trilogy -- the games that helped define the genre.\n[French Translation] [German Translation] [Spanish Translation] [Polish Translation] [Russian Translation]\nA single-player, party-based role-playing game, rich in exploration and combat\nDungeons filled not just with dangerous fights but with challenging puzzles and devious riddles\nDynamic phase-based combat, where the pace of battle is animated and fluid, but still gives you time to think and respond to your enemies\nA game set to beautiful Gaelic music, where the Bard\u2019s songs and melodies affect gameplay\nCo-funded by fans and inXile: if this game hits its $1.25 million goal, inXile will put in at least $1.25 million of its own money to double the initial budget!\nBuilt using Unreal Engine 4, for PC, Mac and Linux.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo.

Our initial estimate is based on a $2.5 million budget game and we will openly communicate on changes to the release date as our project progresses.\n\ninXile has established revenue streams from its back catalog, including Wasteland 2, The Bard\u2019s Tale, as well as the upcoming Wasteland 2 Game of the Year Edition. This revenue is invested directly back into the games we\u2019re working on \u2013 we will be investing at least a matching $1.25 million should Bard's Tale IV fund. These revenue streams will allow us to improve the quality of Torment and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, and provides additional security to see the project through to completion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Director's Cut Has Arrived!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Director\u2019s Cut Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "New Art from an Old Friend", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #56", "update_userinfo": "Mid-2019 Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "Early 2019 Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "The Bard Goes Caroling", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "It's Showtime!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Are You The Keymaster?", "update_content": "Preparing for Key Distribution"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "The Bard Draws Near!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "The Classics Return", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 12495, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/the-bards-tale-iv", "project_name": "The Bards Tale IV"}}, {"backer": "Geoff May (thebruce0)", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, I'm Mike Selinker. I have this game buried deep in my brain. You can help me unlock the memories of the game. If you'd like to find out what it is, read on.\nBox mockup. Image not final.\nThe Apocrypha Adventure Card Game is the next evolution of the gameplay from two games I helped create: the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game and Betrayal at House on the Hill. It can be run as a fully cooperative adventure card game solo or in a group, or a gamemaster can take over and expand it into a full-blown roleplaying game. It's designed by me and my teammates at Lone Shark Games, with card text by authors like Jerry Holkins, Kij Johnson, Kris Straub, and Patrick Rothfuss.\nSet on the precipice of a modern day apocalypse, Apocrypha is an hour-long game that immerses 1 to 6 players in a conflict with the most dangerous entities in the universe. Players play \"saints,\" characters who can see the monsters lurking in every alley and school lunch room. These characters grow through multiple sessions of gameplay, unlocking repressed memory fragments that expand their powers and capabilities. You get a character card around which you can display these fragments in a card sleeve page, and can change the arrangement of your brain from game to game. A gamemaster can customize new content that leads the story anywhere she wants. Here are the playtest rules to the game.\nThe game is expanded by chapters of new cards, each chapter revealing a new type of threat and introducing new mechanics. All chapters in this campaign have been unlocked, meaning we'll have 1,300+ cards in the game. Each chapter has its memory fragments written in collaboration with a well-known author and friend of Lone Shark, so you can get inside their brains as well as ours.\nYou know, because that sounds completely safe.\nFor $66 plus shipping, you can get the Revelation Box, which includes more than 500 cards, including a 90-card first chapter called The Book of the Skinwalkers and a bonus chapter called The Secrets of Candlepoint. It also contains 20 dice, card game and RPG rules, and standup character pawns.\nFor $99 plus shipping, you can get the Revelation Box plus all the chapters we've unlocked during the campaign. There are eight chapter expansions with approximately 90 cards each in this set.\nFor $333 plus shipping, you can get the Master's Edition. That's a special upgraded version for the ultimate adventure card game player. With a beautiful embossed deluxe box in the style of Doctor Zeez's Aesculapian Journal (see below), the Master's Edition will be numbered and signed by Mike Selinker, have upgraded custom dice, an Apocrypha dice bag, and more! And of course it will have all the cards from the base set and all the chapters. The box will have an insert that will hold the cards in place, even if you put it on its side like on a bookshelf. The cover will be faux-leather with a strap to hold it shut. It will hold all the cards whether sleeved or not. It will look a bit like this.\nMockup of Master's Edition. Image not final.\n Here's a video of the inside of the Master's Edition.\nPLAY\n\nAnd if you want it all, then you need the Beast Box. For (ahem) $666, you get 1 Master's Edition signed by all the developers, 1 signed Revelation Box with all the chapters, 1 Ultra PRO character binder, 2 mission playmats, 18 deckboxes (9 of Hope, 9 of Doom), 1,300+ Ultra PRO sleeves, 5 more sets of dice so every player can have a set, 2 sets of promo cards, and printed stories and selections from the Apocrypha Bible.\nEach copy of the game will ship with at least 10 promo cards. These are multicolor fragment cards and a special Day One card.\nShipping for any edition is $8 in the USA, $25 in Canada and the EU, $30 in Australia, and $45 elsewhere. If you want more than 1 copy, add up the costs of shipping all your games individually, then cut it in half. This game is EU-friendly, and will ship to EU residents from within the European Union.\nYou bet. They're from our friends at Ultra PRO. To order add-ons, just add their amount to your pledge. Your shipping cost stays the same.\nYou can order this awesome official Ultra PRO character binder. The \"soulbinder\" contains 20 sleeve pages for characters and their fragments, and you can keep your punched out pawns in there too. You can add this on to any level for an additional $17. No additional shipping is required.\nUltra PRO binder mockup. Art by Nick Kay. Image not final.\nAnd these amazing Ultra PRO mission playmats. Each is 13.5\"x24\". We recommend one for a 1-2 player games, and two for a 3-6 player game. They're an additional $18 each, or two for $33.\nTwo Ultra PRO mission playmats, side by side. Image not final.\nAnd these cool \"Box of Hope\" and \"Box of Doom\" character deckboxes. Each box holds a character or a mission's cards. They're an additional $3 each, or 6 for $16. You might want 6 because that's 1 for each player.\nIndeed so. These:\nAt our previous goals, we unlocked the base set and all the chapters, with memories written by esteemed authors Matt Forbeck, Bruce Cordell, Jerry \"Tycho\" Holkins, Kij Johnson, Keith Baker, Erin M. Evans, Mary Robinette Kowal, Wolfgang Baur, Kris Straub, and Patrick Rothfuss.\nWe also unlocked a DriveThruCards custom card creator, 9 cross-chapter missions and 9 multicolor fragment promo cards!\nWe also unlocked a short story by Matt Forbeck and selections from the Apocrypha Bible!\nWe unlocked over a hundred new cards, bringing the number of cards in the game to an astonishing 1,300+ cards!\nWe unlocked a game mastering guide, 4 more dice, and 9 RPG missions in either the rulebook or a special GM's PDF.\nAnd because we got real close to $333,333, we unlocked a Day Zero promo card.\nThe Apocrypha Adventure Card Game is based on a system we came up with in 2011 that would allow the feel of a roleplaying game with all the pressure of a great board game. Designed to play in an hour, an adventure card game has each player build a character that lasts through a year or more of gameplay, growing and changing as cards pass through her deck. The first example of this was the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, released to considerable acclaim in summer 2013.\nApocrypha is a card-based roleplaying game and a roleplaying-like card game in the same box. Here is the playtest rulebook for the game in both of its modes. Without a gamemaster, the game will run itself, and do its best to kill you before you beat it. With a gamemaster, you will decide the story and how the characters will evolve. This is not a permanent decision; you can play a campaign where some sessions are run by the game and some are run by a gamemaster.\nEach player starts with a single character card among the 18 playable characters. Your character card shows your virtues (Mind, Body, Soul, and Rage, in some order), skills, powers, and what kinds and numbers of cards you have in your deck. Along the way you unearth repressed memory fragments that open up new powers, new cards, and a whole bunch of new problems. As your character grows, she becomes more powerful but more unstable, meaning an experienced character might want to adventure with a brand new one. You can place these fragments around your character card in whatever order you like, but the position of these cards\u2014and your position around the table\u2014matters a whole lot.\nCharacter and fragment cards. Images not final.\nChapter and mission cards. Images not final.\nYou will select a chapter to play. Each chapter has nine missions you can choose from. In the course of playing a mission, the characters cooperatively explore nexuses of great power and overcome the threats you uncover. Your goal in a typical mission is to track down a master and her minions, and thwart whatever evil they're undertaking. They may be altered by mutations, which make them stranger and tougher.\nNexus and mutation cards. Images not final.\nMaster and threat cards. Images not final.\nYou will find good cards called gifts for your deck, You might be branded with tattoos of those you take down. A deck of omens looms over the game, and each turn, you'll draw an omen and decide whether to investigate your nexus. If the omen deck runs out, you lose. If your deck runs out, you gain a death card which will slow down your character's growth. Gain enough of them, and you're gone forever.\nGift and omen cards. Images not final.\nThose are the basics, but there is a lot more to it. We'll unveil a series of nine gameplay-focused videos over the campaign. Here's an overview.\nPLAY\n\nHere's a video on how characters work, with me and developer Liz Spain.\nPLAY\n\nHere's how memory fragments work, co-starring writer Jerry Holkins.\nPLAY\n\nHere's one on setting up and winning, with developer Gaby Weidling.\nPLAY\n\n Here's another on investigations, with developer Chad Brown.\nPLAY\n\nAnd Chad and I continue to talk about gifts and dice rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHere's developer Tanis O'Connor and me on assisting and mutations.\nPLAY\n\nDeveloper Paul Peterson joins me to discuss threats and true threats.\nPLAY\n\nAnd here's the gamemastering video, where Gaby, Chad, and Liz go on a mission. You can see a full gameplay session in action here.\nThose are all our gameplay videos. Watch them all before Doctor Zeez writes the cause of your death in his journal.\nIt's 2016, and the apocalypse is nigh. Because of a veil called the Paradigm, the world believes monsters aren't real. Nonetheless there continue to be outliers, creatures and events that don't make sense. Most people ignore the outliers, because it's a lot easier to make sense of the world if you do. But the saints, an often misapplied name for a group of oddly powered individuals who can see through the Paradigm, have formed choirs of defenders of humanity. These choirs will go out and try to stem the incursions of monsters into the everyday world.\nA group of ancient and powerful entities called the Novem are at the height of their power, threatening to break the Paradigm. Each chapter of the game is about the forces of a Novem, and they all behave differently. One type of monster might be highly organized and plotting an all-out assault on humanity, while another might be hoping not to be discovered but be under a threat of revelation by another faction. Each chapter will feel very different, and you can move between them as much as you like. You can create your own stories in this world, which of course is your world with a few outliers. Because monsters don't exist.\nThe Secrets of Candlepoint is the base set chapter which features an invasion of a small city called Candlepoint, Wisconsin. It's recommended for starting play before beginning all the other chapters.\nThe Book of the Skinwalkers is about the fractured legions of the werewolf lord Keiros. His shapechangers have balkanized into street gangs defending minuscule turfs against each other. When the 80th Street Griffons clash with the Bronx Jackals, silver hollowpoints will fly.\nThe Book of the Deathless features the Novem Ereshkigal seeks to expand her army of flesheaters, spooks, and bloodsuckers. What they lack in creativity, they will make up in sheer numbers. Numbers which might eventually include you.\nThe Book of the Fae has a tripartite Novem named The Morrigan. The Phantom Queen appears as three bickering sisters, each trying to trick the others into doing her bidding. The fae are more than just enemies; maybe you can trick the faeries to your side.\nThe Book of the Animus depicts the spirit of the earth, Mother Gaia. She has a decidedly anti-human bent; nothing humanity has done for millennia has sat well with her. Gaia's spirits inhabit every animal, river, and blade of grass. You wouldn't want to make Mother angry. \nThe Book of the Dreamers introduces the Novem Nebuchadnezzar, whose sorcerers are unlocking their subconsciousnesses and loosing them on the world. What you see as nightmares, they see as weapons. So don't sleep, and you've got a chance. \nThe Book of the Damned is the province of the teacher Abramelin. The Damned truck with things they call demons, but whether Hell is on their side is quite unclear. The demons sure are in a foul mood about doing their bidding, and the Damned sure seem oblivious to that.\nThe Book of the Golems centers on the chosen of Aleph, the original Golem of Chelm. Aleph has few living followers; his creatures were once limited to animated clay and walking rock piles. Now science has given him robots and computers to work with.\nThe Book of the Serpents has a Novem who no longer answers his adherents. The dragon Quetzalcoatl is buried under a Mesoamerican ziggurat, or so his cultists say. The nagavanshi Princess Kuberanaga has taken the dragon's place among the Novem for now.\nThe Book of the Physicians caters to the Novem Celsus, the first surgeon amongst the Greeks. The Physicians believe they are healing the world, but their obsession with perfection through fleshcrafting is most definitely non-Hippocratic.\nThe Lone Shark Games creative team and friends have come together to create a sweeping new world of gameplay for you. Here's the team.\nI'm the co-designer of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Lords of Vegas, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Unspeakable Words, and many other games. I'm the author of the books Puzzlecraft, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and the interactive puzzle novel The Maze of Games, which we launched on Kickstarter.

You can see their work in this creepy teaser video, released before the campaign.\nPLAY\n\nI wouldn't worry about it. But while we're here, I'd like to introduce you to Doctor Zeez, one of our playable characters in Apocrypha. \nHe's a saint, but as you can probably guess from his plague mask, he's not exactly all that saintly. Nonetheless, he tries to prevent the monsters from bringing about the apocalypse, and if he gets to dissect a few of them along the way, so much the better.\nDoctor Zeez keeps a journal. And every few days during this campaign, he'll share an entry with you. Well, maybe not \"share,\" per se. He's not the sharing kind. But there may be something you can derive from each of his entries. Along the way, you might pick up a few fragments of your own. \nHere are journal entries #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, and #10. If you find something hidden, send it to us via the manner on the update and you'll get one of our Apocrypha virtual badges that you can use as your Kickstarter, Facebook, or Twitter icons. \nWatch for more from Doctor Zeez in the coming days.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

ZANO connects directly to your smart device (iOS or Android)  via onboard WiFi and enables you to instantly begin capturing and sharing moments like never before. \n\"When we began work on ZANO, our goal was to make aerial photography and video capture truly accessible to everyone. This meant making ZANO small and lightweight, yet durable enough to take with you anywhere. Intelligent enough so no piloting skills were required, and most of all, pricing ZANO at a point that makes it affordable.\" Reece Crowther, Head of Marketing\nZANO next to an iPhone 5\n\"Right out of the box you can begin capturing and sharing stunning aerial photographs and videos, with absolutely no complex flight training required.\" - Ivan Reedman, Head of Research and Development.\nA plethora of sensors work seamlessly together to allow ZANO to avoid obstacles, hold its position and know exactly where it is in conjunction with your smart device, at all times. \nThis means ZANO operates on a virtual tether connected to your smart device. Allowing for simple gesture control of ZANO. Tilt your phone or tablet left or right, forward or backward and ZANO will follow. (ZANO can also be utilised in \"Free Flight\" mode, using on-screen Joy Sticks). On screen slide bars control rotation and altitude. ZANO will hold its position unless instructed otherwise (In both \"Capture\" mode as well as \"Free Flight\" mode), which allows for maximum control and creative freedom without the burden of piloting ZANO.\nIf ZANO senses it's strayed too far from your smart device or is running low on battery, it will automatically return to your smart device. \nOperating on a virtual tether also enables \"Follow me\" capability in ZANO. Which means once you set ZANO's hold position, it will register the distance it is from your smart device. You can choose for ZANO to hold this position or enable a \"Follow me\" feature, which will instruct ZANO to constantly maintain that distance from your smart device and follow you whilst avoiding any obstacles that may get it in the way during flight. \nZANO's GUI in \"Capture\" Mode\nExample of ZANO's GUI in \"Free Flight\" Mode\n An extended view of ZANO in action!\nRevolutionary Intelligent Flight and Autonomous Operation, complete with Obstacle Avoidance - Don't fly it.

Starting with a 240mm x 240mm UAV, Ivan and his team of highly skilled engineers and developers at Torquing Group worked tirelessly to continue to reduce the size of this UAV technology, without impacting on its capabilities. Initially targeting the defence, industrial and law enforcement markets, the idea for a consumer version of this Nano UAV technology was first raised in October 2013 at the weekly Torquing Group team meeting. The team felt they were finally ready for the challenge to get this technology out to the consumer and make aerial photography and video capture truly accessible to anyone with a smart device. ZANO was born and the race was on to get this sophisticated technology to market affordably. \nSince then we have been working relentlessly to bring this technology to the consumer market. We first designed the development environments (DEV Boards) in October 2013 (which is essentially all the vital components on one big PCB), so we could test that each of the electronic components would work as expected and meet the strict requirements we knew we had to meet in order to make ZANO possible.  We selected components we knew we could not only eventually fit on a board 65mm x 65mm PCB board (with some skilful PCB layout) but also were readily available and at a low enough cost to meet the tight budget we had for each unit. Once we had selected all the vital components and our DEV boards were ready, we got to writing the firmware, an assortment of digital filters, complex mathematics routines, data fusing algorithms, video handling, obstacle avoidance and signal processing to allow for these components to work seamlessly together to achieve autonomous, intelligent flight. Many a sleepless night went by developing, until we were happy that we had selected all the correct components to bring ZANO to market affordably with all the functionality we wanted it to have.\nEnter March 2014 and we have our first 65mm x 65mm ZANO prototype PCB ready to rumble. Naturally, there were a few minor issues. However, we were encouraged enough with the progress we had made, we decided to commit our resources to going full speed ahead with ZANO. Revisions were made to the PCB and sent back for prototyping and we began conceptualising the user experience and designing the graphics for the GUI.\nJune 2014, and we're finally happy with the PCB layout and that all components are working together in cohesion. We can begin to design the ZANO aesthetic. As a consumer device, Head of Design, Thomas Dietrich (12 years experience in the Royal Air Force) knew ZANO's aesthetic had to ooze sophistication. Yet on a device so small, size and weight are of the absolute essence. How do you make a device look great with such narrow design parameters? Thomas and his team set about for the next 3 months designing ZANO's aesthetic. A sleek, sophisticated shell that fuses functionality with durability. \nWith all the vital components selected and our PCB layout complete. It was now time to find an EMS (electronic manufacturing service) with premium quality manufacturing capability, yet with prices low enough to maintain affordability. As a British company it was important for us to explore all options on our home turf prior to sending the production overseas. October 2014, the search was finally over and we were able to find the EMS partner we were looking for in the UK, to handle the initial production orders.\nSo, November 2014, where are we? \nZANO's aesthetic is complete and we have selected our plastics manufacturing company. \nOur supply chain is 100% ready to go, from vital components that make ZANO fly, to the very boxes that ZANO is packaged in are all priced and sourced!\nOur in house team has begun work on the GUI and the App integration. Over the coming months the team will begin development for Android and iOS, this will continue until March 2015, at which point the App's will be tested rigorously then submitted to Android and iOS App stores for download in May 2015.\nZANO is up and flying, holding position, avoiding obstacles, streaming live video back to a smart device, capturing video and photos. However, with as much capability as we've packed into ZANO, we are continuing to refine the flight, avoidance, video and photo capturing and user interface, plus we have relentless testing and refining procedures prior to us releasing ZANO to the market. We will begin our BETA testing in March 2015. With a view to enter production in May 2015!\nIt's been a long journey, but ZANO is almost here! From everyone here at Team Torquing, we hope you are as excited as us!\n-Reece Crowther\nWe need to get the production volumes up in order to get the price down! It's as simple as that. This first Kickstarter production run will also enable us to iron out any potential issues in manufacturing as well as streamline the process with our EMS for production runs.\n\nThe profits made from the Kickstarter campaign will allow us to hire additional engineers, software developers, app developers, product developers, etc. So we can continue to innovate and deliver fantastic products with even more capability! And yes, we are looking for talented people to join our team! So if you are passionate about producing the world's most advanced UAV technology (amongst other secret projects) and you have a set of skills that you think can contribute, drop us a line hello@flyzano.com!\n\n\nWorking in the Aerospace and Defence Technology sector since 2008, Torquing Group Ltd has built a reputation as one of the most innovative and forward thinking Unmanned Aerial System research and development companies in the world.\nRegularly acknowledged in the defence sector as the primary innovator in bringing autonomy, intelligence and swarming capability to Nano UAVs, Head of Research and Development, Ivan Reedman feels it is now time to bring such innovation to the consumer at an affordable price.\n\"For me, The real joys of creating are being able to share those creations with the world. The experience of opening a product and feeling true innovation is something that once experienced, never leaves you. I got the same feeling when I opened my first iPhone as I did when I opened my very first Casio Calculator watch in 1983. I can only hope that people will feel the same and be inspired when they experience ZANO for the very first time.\"\nWith a wealth of experience in Product Design, Manufacturing, Engineering, Software and Application Development, Torquing Group Ltd is well equipped to deliver ZANO to its Kickstarter backers on time.\n                        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough innovation and diligent research and development, We are 100% confident in delivering an Autonomous and Intelligent aerial photography and video platform.

If so, then you know we are both massive fans of the science fiction genre, eager to tell large-scale sci-fi action stories with high quality digital artwork.\nDrone is no exception. Drone is a side-project we have been developing to allow us to tell more stories in between bouts of private work and work on Telikos Protocol. Another sci-fi work, this action story is set in a brand new universe that we are really eager to explore.\nCivil war has torn apart the galaxy as some of the most distant and most impoverished human outposts have turned their backs on the government of the United Earth Colonies and the people of Earth, seeking independence.\nCenturies of space travel have seen the human race spread far and wide, but the Earth government, reliant on the minerals and fuel mined by the colonies, is intent on maintaining control. The war has been a bloodbath, and calls for peace have grown louder by the day. The UEC's answer? A new army of remotely-operated combat infantry drones.\nDrone follows the deployment of conscript Natalie \"Nattie\" Assenberg, one of the Earth fleet's first drone operators, as she heads out to the colonial frontier to wage war against the dissenting colonists. A loner who is, in her own words, \"not a people person\", she soon finds a connection with her combat drone, a Semi-Autonomous Nodal Defence Endoskeleton that she affectionately nicknames \"Sandie,\" who becomes her only friend in the far reaches of colonial space.\nWe are trying something a little different with Drone - we are releasing it for FREE. While we will be offering digital options for major comic e-readers including Comixology, every single page of the book is going to be released for free to readers, released once a week on our up-coming website, allowing us to share our story with everyone whether you buy the book or not.

COOLMATERIAL\n\u201cIt easily competes with the best midrange names like the Jawbone Mini Jambox or Soundmatters FoxL DASH 7, which were my favorites until today.\u201d CNET\nThe product won the CNBC TechCrowd competition with 79% of all votes.\nIt all started in 2013 when a designer from San Francisco teamed up with a group of acoustic experts and manufacturing veterans, with the vision of creating a line of portable speakers that would challenge the trend of a booming Bluetooth speaker market that packed lots of features into products, but lacked focus on acoustic performance.\nWe launched NudeAudio last summer with a line of fashion forward portable speakers in three sizes. L for around the house, M to grab and take to the park and S to leave attached to your snowboard jacket or backpack. \nThe launch was received with fantastic feedback from the tech, fashion and design communities. Less than a year after launch, we found ourselves selling products in over 40 countries.\nThe grab-and-go size of M proved to be by far our most popular, so for our next and most ambitious development to date, we decided to explore how far we could take the acoustics in the M size. The result is Super-M.\n4 full-range, high-performance neodymium drivers are tightly packed on both sides of the Super-M, with each pair complemented by a passive radiator, totalling 6 drivers.\nThese are driven by highly efficient amplifiers and a powerful Lithium-ion battery. A state-of-the-art Bluetooth 4.0 chipset ensures the best signal and efficient battery use.\nThis innovative and unconventional set-up means Super-M can pump out incredible, 360\u00ba sound and keep the party going for 8-hours straight, all from a package that fits in your jeans pocket.\nThe final step was sealing the whole package for IPX-5 waterproof rating and sand-proof so the Super-M can be taken anywhere.\n\u201cTom asked me to audition the NudeAudio Move range in S, M & L against the big-brand competition and I was astonished with the rich, natural sound. I blind-tested the M and a competitor three times the price and the M won hands-down. Super-M takes this performance to the next level.\"\n\nHugh Padgham - Record producer for artists such as David Bowie, Genesis, The Police and Sting.\nPLAY\n\nPeter Riering-Czekalla, Chief Design Officer, is the creative lead of NudeAudio and is looking after all elements of design and brand experience. Trained as an industrial designer in Germany, he worked at IDEO for almost a decade. During that time, he led teams to develop design and brand strategies for fortune 500 companies like Samsung, Nike, Microsoft, etc. NudeAudio is a reflection of his passion to create simple, yet playful products for the everyday.\nTom Dudderidge, CEO, a serial tech and hardware entrepreneur, spent the last 10-years leading the business that built the largest docking station brand in Europe, GEAR4. Many of this team make up the Hong Kong and China engineering and operations for NudeAudio. Tom\u2019s father Phil is the Chairman of NudeAudio. He started out as live sound engineer for bands such as Led Zeppelin in the 1970s. He then founded Soundcraft, which invented the modern mixing console, and is now Chairman of Focusrite & Novation, leaders in professional audio interfaces, synthesisers and DJ gear.\nAt NudeAudio we are passionate about our fair price policy, so we're offering a wide-range of rewards where no backer will pay more than $99 - delivered - for a Super-M on Kickstarter, wherever you come from, and whichever colour or collaboration you select. \nUPDATE: FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING (NO EXCEPTIONS!) - OUR PLEDGE TO YOU!\nBecause of the overwhelming response from international backers, we have now announced that we will ship anywhere in the world with no exceptions. It's always been our intention that nobody pays more than $99 for a Super-M, wherever they come from, and because of the initial success of our campaign we feel we are able to make this pledge ourselves. \nPlease note that pledges in California will be subject to sales tax, so please add 9% (pledge $108 for $99 pledge) or we will have to eat it ourselves!\nYOU CAN EXTEND AN EXISTING PLEDGE BY SIMPLY ADDING AN AMOUNT AND SENDING US A QUICK NOTE.\nWe introduced black this spring for our entire product range with great reception. What better color than monochromatic black to launch our Super-M with?\nWe are introducing seasonal colors in alignment with the latest fashion trends. This fall, we have Petrol, Pine and Plum. Complex but muted in monochromatic style.\nMany of you asked for it so we added a Kickstarter edition. Black body with iconic Kickstarter-green cord.\nWe've also collaborated and handful of our friends and supporters to deliver some Kickstarter exclusive Special Edition designs, which we will be launching during the campaign. Don't worry about your color or Special Edition choice for now, you will only need to decide when we email you later after you've backed us. So keep watching our updates during the campaign to see the different collaboration options as they are released.\nThe last but certainly not least collaboration we are presenting is with the Kickstarter community itself. We announced to create a community color as a $500K stretch goal, created and decided by the backer community. After many suggestions from everyone, we visualized 9 options and put them out for a vote. Black and Coral was the clear winner. (please note above image is a computer visualization)\nAs a business centred on our passions for design and music, we like to think that NudeAudio is a contributor to the arts. Our collaborations with other artists and brands are a great opportunity to work with other people's passions too.\nDavid is a London street artist who travels the world, painting murals and creating objects and canvasses. His work can be seen in the streets a few blocks from Kickstarter HQ, as well as in villages in Africa, projects in Kosovo, in Cape Town, Japan and Rotterdam, to name just a few places.\nDavid came to OUR UK office a few weeks ago and painted an amazing mural on the wall. He also agreed to hand paint 20 sets of grilles of Super-M to create a David Shillinglaw Limited Edition especially for Kickstarter backers. These will each be bundled with Limited Edition 'Kingless Kingdom' print.\nLimited Edition David Shillinglaw Hand-Painted Super-M plus 'Kingless Kingdom' Limited Edition Single Colour Screenprint (from run of 100)\nEXISTING BACKERS PLEASE LOOK AT FAQ BELOW\n\nBelow is a short video that we made while David was painting the mural in our offices, I hope you enjoy it and David's unique character.\nPLAY\n\nWe are talking a lot about protecting the technology inside the speaker against its environment. But let\u2019s not forget that we first need the environment to enjoy the speaker in. So let\u2019s try help protecting it, a little bit at the time.\nIntroducing the Cuipo special edition. With each unit sold, we will purchase 5 square meters of rain forest for you to own and keep protected against deforestation. You will receive documentation and the geolocation of your personal 5 square meters. Interesting fact is that there is a population of one monkey per square meter. But no, you will not own 5 monkeys!\nThe main body is kept in a safari green with a contrasting bright red cord to make sure you don't lose it in the jungle.\nWe are partnering on this with Cuipo, a lifestyle brand dedicated to preserving prime rainforest around the globe. Cuipo was created to inspire the preservation of our planet's most vital ecosystem by empowering individuals and institutions to act and become responsible trustees of our planet.\nWe are very excited to announce a new Special Edition Super-M collaboration with UK star-DJ, MistaJam.\nWorking closely with Peter, he designed the duotone black and turquoise Super-M with a slice of colour peeping through the grill, exposing both the MistaJam and Speakerbox logo. The MistaJam presents Speakerbox logo has also been screen printed to the base, and of course finished it off with our trademark NudeAudio cord in turquoise. \nClick the video link below to hear what the man himself has to say about it: \nPLAY\n\nWe're pretty excited, and hope you like this new option as much as we do.\nIn addition to the special editions that we will continue to announce during the campaign, we are delighted to announce an exclusive Limited Edition today, live from Miami, Florida. \nIn celebration of late night parties, sleeping in, weekend getaways, staycations, singing in the shower and breakfast in bed, we are stripping down and teaming up with one of our favorite hotels, The Standard, to bring you a custom speaker evocative of our worlds. \nWith their devotion to design and innovation, The Standard are at the forefront of the industry with five properties in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami. And in true Nude style, The Standard's Limited Edition Super-M is in the buff, colored monotone nude.\nThe Standard X Nude speaker is available to all of our Early Bird backers, (select it when we ask for your color choice), and there are only 100 limited edition pledges available so pledge quickly before they disappear.\nYelle is a recording artist from France, currently touring the USA. They have released 2 albums, Pop Up and Safari Disco Club, with a third album, Compl\u00e8tement Fou, eagerly anticipated. NudeAudio loves their brand of dance floor friendly European disco-pop, and the band have designed their Yelle Special Edition Super-M in a standout bright blue with red silk screened logo on the base to match their album cover.\nPLAY\n\nWe've had a great number of requests for a bike mount for Super-M, so we decided to offer one. Since it hasn\u2019t been designed yet, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for a collaborative design project. Join us for the ride by pledging $124 which includes the bike mount plus Super-M.\nAbove picture is a functional prototype to proof the idea. Look and feel is to be designed in the coming weeks.\nTHE PROCESS: We just started thinking about the design and what you see on the picture above is only our first prototype. We will facilitate the process gathering your input and translating it into ideas that will be shared with you to feedback on. Please share your initial insights and ideas, as well as feedback on the first prototype here. Based on your thoughts over the next few days, we will be iterating on the design and present new iterations before the end of the campaign.\nTHE DESIGNER: NudeAudio partnered up with Adam Reineck, ex IDEO, bike design superstar who helped design the Faraday bike as well as the Spurcycle Bicycle Bell. Both of which gained a lot of appraise across the bike and design community.\nWe had a lot of comments on ideas for additional colors. Extra thanks to Henri who even sent some designs over. Every color has a minimum order quantity and while we always liked to have more colors, we had to draw a line. \nIf we reach 500K, we'll add one color and have YOU design it. We will invite everyone to tell us their color idea, collect them all and visualize the most popular suggestions. At the end of the campaign, we'll put them out for vote to all backers and produce whatever turns out to be the community favorite.\nEarlier in the campaign we revealed that there was a candidate for an upgraded driver for Super-M. Packed with four, even a small cost increase is multiplied 4 times, and the potential cost increase to include the upgraded drivers was high. But there was a noticeable improvement and we set a stretch goal at $550k, as we need the volume to get a good price from the supplier and justify the margin hit.\nWe're pretty certain that we'll hit the goal, but we're uncomfortable leaving you guys hanging and wondering whether or not the upgrade is coming. Furthermore, while we are doing parallel tuning processes for both driver types, it's important that we lock it down soon so we can ensure we don't have any procurement hiccups.\nSo we've decided today that we are going to guarantee the stretch goal now, which will make you guys happy, whilst reducing supply chain risks, and make communication easier over the coming days.\nTom & Peter demonstrate and challenge the IPX5 Waterproof rating\nPLAY\n\nPeter takes a look at the hardware and explains some of the functionality.\nPLAY\n\nOK, you got this far, so we figured you're really interested (or have time on your hands). Either way, here's a 5 minute video of Tom unboxing and reacting to the latest prototype, demoing the simple functionality, and describing the final steps of development, all in a single (first) take!\nPLAY\n\n  It's a cruel world, and the conventional way to launch new brands and products in this very crowded market takes a lot of effort and money and can be very risky.\nWe know that when people hear our philosophy and our story, when they see and hear our products, it really resonates. Every NudeAudio owner that we've talked to is a big fan. But we don't have the resource to market in the traditional way with advertising and big in-store presence.\nKickstarter, and you, our crowd, seems to be the very best way for us to spread the word. By offering the product at a very fair price, with shipping included worldwide, we hope that you guys will give a a little back by sharing with your friends, giving us great feedback, and joining our mission for better sound.\nEntering mass production for a high-volume consumer product like Super-M is a big investment. We need to raise at least $75,000 to fund the balance of our minimum production run (hence the target), and we've got access to parts for up to 10,000 units immediately if the campaign is big success, before hitting long lead times for additional parts.\nWe'll use you pledges to get into mass production and use the residual funds and the momentum of the campaign to get our brand out into the big, bad world and stand up to our big-bucks competition. Thank you!\nDisclaimer: There is no disclaimer. We decided to give everyone free world wide shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the time of writing, Super-M is very close to pilot production, with virtually all hardware parts developed. The audio tuning process described in the video above is commencing. At this stage of development, the risks associated with the development project have been almost entirely eliminated.\n\nThere are also inherent supply chain risks which need to be managed, but we have secured parts for the first 10,000 units of production so these risks are controlled at least for this level of production. Our contract manufacturing partner is a large, experienced company with members of our respective teams have long-lasting relationships going back 10 years.\n\nQuality is also something that needs close management in any manufacturing process. Our quality team, based in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, follow professional processes to ensure that quality is managed throughout the design, development, supply chain and manufacturing process.\n\nDisruptive Hong Kong, parent company to NudeAudio, will take responsibility for fulfilment of all product pledges, which will be shipped direct to our backers worldwide directly from Hong Kong as soon as production has been completed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Update correction!", "update_content": "Dear NudeAudio friends and backers,\n\nToday we received confirmation that the Yelle and MistaJam collaboration Super-Ms have arrived in our Hong Kong warehouse, and are ready to ship out to our distribution centres world-wide.

Holmes has been a continuous hit since his creation, and he was the first fictional character that fans really took ownership of \u2014 after Arthur Conan Doyle tried to kill him off, they refused to accept his death and wrote their own Holmes stories.\" - Stephen Marche\nFrom Tabz: I'm a giant Sherlockian. I have been since I was 9. There's no single fictional character that has had a bigger impact on my life than Holmes. I believe in Sherlock Holmes. He taught me to think; he showed me the wonders of reading, learning, and writing; he showed me the value of friendship; and most, importantly, he taught me to love my obsessive geekiness. \nI owe a lot to Sherlock Holmes and the fandom. Because of this, I would LOVE to give back in a small part by creating this project. If we hit the stretch goals there'll not only be two playing card decks, but also a Pairs deck, music, books, and more!\nFor those who are familiar with Shane Tyree's work, please know that this project is being administered, produced, and fulfilled by Tabz.\n\"His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer.  In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller.  His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision.

Tech.\n\u2018Game of Phones\u2019, A Clever Card Game That Is Played Using Smartphones on Laughing Squid.\nThe basics.\nYou (glorious pledger)\nYour friends (as many as you can fit around a table)\nYour smartphones (sorry dumbphoners)\nOne deck of cards (100 prompts but infinite possibilities)\nHere's how it works.\nOne player picks a card and gets to judge that round. They read the prompt to everyone else. Something like 'Find the best #selfie' or 'Show the last photo you took'. Everyone finds something on their phones and shows the judge, who gets to choose a winner for that round. First to win 10 rounds is the overall winner.\nThat's pretty much it. Simple right? But with different friends and the internet in your hands the game is totally different each time you play. It's limitless fun. Especially after a beer or two. Not that we advocate drinking.\nHere are a few of the cards:\nWhat's the story?\nSam and Luke are design students in New York City. We're fascinated by the way technology is changing everyday behavior. Not long ago, excessively checking your phone was considered anti-social. Now you're probably too busy checking your own phone to complain that someone else isn't listening.\nBut sometimes phones can make conversations better too. A funny photo is funnier than a description of a funny photo.\nWe had a weird idea for a card game that involved phones, and when we tested it out on our friends it turned out to be super fun. Plus, by bringing phones into the game they somehow become less of a distraction. No time to check your email when you're in a heated round of 'Find the weirdest Google Image search result for your name'.\nSo 'Game of Phones' was born.\nWe laughed. People shrieked. No one cried yet. We think you'll love it.\nUsing your phone at a party used to be anti-social, now it's the name of the game (literally).\nWhere you come in.\nWe're looking for your support to help bring the game to many more people. We have a beautiful card design thanks to our talented illustrator, Francisco Gal\u00e1rraga, which we intend to take to the next level. With Kickstarter, and you, we hope many more people will be able to enjoy the game.\nWe had some prototypes made, using a manufacturer that was great. But to get it to more people we need to do two things: get a better quality product made and order a larger quantity to keep the costs down.\nBy pledging you'll be one of the first to own 'Game of Phones'.\nExtras.\nWe're producing a beautiful large format poster of the card back design, printed with gold metallic ink.\nWhat's more, we'll produce up to 25 limited edition laser-etched cherry wood boxes, hand-made here in Brooklyn.\nTest version of box design\nWe're also selling a handful of our prototype 50-card decks, which we'll ship as soon as the Kickstarter is over (with the final game to follow).\nWhat else?\nWe're working hard to make the game content better and better. We'd love to hear ideas and feedback, particularly from the Kickstarter community. Feel free to send us your thoughts.\nThanks so much for your interest.\nSam and Luke\nFollow Game of Phones on Facebook and Twitter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any product, there could be issues with manufacturing and shipping.

It's not too late to support us and try our Beta test! Please visit us at storium.com for more information.\n4/8/14: WE DID IT! With the help of our incredible backers, we have unlocked every stretch goal, funded a staggering 60 worlds, and reached 1000% of our original funding target. This has been an incredible campaign and we are deeply grateful for the support we've received.\n(Are you a backer looking for your Beta invite? Please see the first FAQ at the bottom of this page \u2014 the info you need is there!)\n\u201cStorium is everything I never knew I always wanted in a game.\u201d \u2014 Eve Jacob, playtester\nStories are part of what makes us human. They\u2019re all around us, from books and movies to TV and video games. Experiencing a good story can be one of life\u2019s great pleasures. But telling your own can be even more fun!\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve devoted the last year of our lives to creating Storium, the online storytelling game. We\u2019ve been playtesting an early version for months with hundreds of people. The feedback has been amazing, and we\u2019re ready to bring Storium to the public. We need your help to make it happen.\nStorium is a web-based online game that you play with friends. It works by turning writing into a multiplayer game. With just your computer, tablet, or smartphone, you can choose from a library of imaginary worlds to play in, or build your own. You create your story\u2019s characters and decide what happens to them. You can tell any kind of story with Storium. The only limit is your imagination.\nStorium uses familiar game concepts inspired by card games, role-playing games, video games, and more. In each Storium game, one player is the narrator, and everyone else takes on the role of a character in the story. The narrator creates dramatic challenges for the other players to overcome. In doing so, they move the story forward in a new direction. Everyone gets their turn at telling the story.\n\u201cStory and Game had a baby, and it\u2019s Storium. This is vital stuff, equal parts revolutionary and fundamental \u2014 giving the old ways of storytelling a major digital upgrade.\u201d\u2014 Chuck Wendig, novelist and screenwriter\nThe following three-minute video gives you a glimpse of our current beta playtest:\nWhat makes Storium special?\nTotal freedom: You decide what happens in your story.\nMultiplayer: Write and play with your friends, online.\nAsynchronous: Play at your own pace.\nWorlds: Pre-made playsets that help you tell stories in different settings and styles.\nSomething for everyone: You can tell any kind of story you want!\n\u201cStorium is one of the most fascinating systems I\u2019ve ever used to facilitate games, and it\u2019s helped me fall in love with storytelling all over again.\u201d\u2013 Lillian Cohen-Moore, playtester\nThis campaign funds the work that\u2019s needed to launch Storium to the general public. That means:\n1. Worlds for you to play in\nStorium needs a wider library of what we call worlds. Each world is a complete playset that gives you all the tools you need to play a game in a certain style or fictional setting. This includes virtual playing cards that drive gameplay, ideas for stories, pre-made characters, and backstory. We\u2019ve assembled an award-winning group of novelists, game designers, storytellers, and artists to create these worlds. Some worlds are wholly new, while others are adaptations of worlds you\u2019ll recognize.\n2. Important features\nThere are key features that Storium still needs. Your support will help us build them. This list is subject to change based on prioritization and technical feasibility, but here are a few of the examples we are considering:\nReal-time play: Chat and play live with your friends when they\u2019re online.\nShared narration: Give everyone in your game a chance to be the narrator.\nParallel storytelling: Play out two scenes at the same time with different characters.\nImproved support for tablets and smartphones: Play using interfaces created specifically for your mobile device.\n3. Technology and team\nOperating an online service like Storium can be a labor-intensive and expensive task. While it's easy to use and play, behind the scenes Storium is a complex piece of engineering. It requires dedicated, ongoing developer attention. We also have to pay for servers, storage, and a number of underlying services upon which the system relies. As Storium grows, these costs increase. \n\nWe\u2019ve been working full-time on Storium without pay for over a year now. That\u2019s how much this project means to us. We've set our target goal as low as possible, but anything we raise beyond that helps ensure that as Storium grows and evolves, we\u2019ll be able to keep up by investing in the technology and people we need.\n\n\u201cStorium revolutionizes storytelling not by new bells and whistles but by returning it to its most pure form in this most complex of ages \u2014 dynamic characters and people telling evocative and passionate stories.\u201d \u2014 John Adamus, playtester\n\n\n\nHere's a visual overview of the rewards we're offering!\nAnd here are more details about a few of the more popular rewards:\nBeta player\nEvery backer at the BETA PLAYER ($10) level gets instant access to our current beta test of Storium. You\u2019ll find an invitation URL in campaign update #1 (backers only). This URL enables you to immediately sign-up, start a game, and invite your friends to play with you.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is an early test version of Storium. We expect it to change and grow quite a bit before the public launch. As a beta player, we welcome your feedback. There\u2019s a \u201cGive feedback\u201d button at the top of every page that goes to a built-in playtesters-only feedback system.\n\nMember\nWhen it launches to the public, Storium will have a modest annual membership fee of $25 per year \u2014 the equivalent of just $2 per month. Becoming a backer at the MEMBER ($20) level gets you your first year of Storium membership (starting on the date we launch publicly) for just $20.\n\nMembers will also be granted a special ability when Storium launches publicly: the use of our forthcoming World Creator tools to build their own Storium worlds and share them with the Storium community.\n\n(By the way, there will always be a free version of Storium \u2014 and it will be the full game, not a demo version. You\u2019ll be able to play up to three games, with full functionality, before you have to pay any membership fee!)\n\nWe want to grow Storium into a sustainable business, and we want to do it without plastering the game with advertisements. Our membership fee will help make that possible.\n\nThe Deal\nOur campaign starts by funding ten worlds, but we have dozens more in the works from a wide array of award-winning creators. Every backer at THE DEAL ($40) level will get a year of Storium membership, plus early and ongoing access to every world that we fund through this Kickstarter. This means you'll always be able to play games in these worlds, regardless of whatever they end up costing in the future.\n\n(When Storium launches publicly, many of our Kickstarter worlds will have a small fee for usage. Much like how Apple's App Store works, Storium world creators will have the option of charging app-like prices for their worlds. We will then pass on the majority of the proceeds to the world's creator! We hope this will become great new way for players and fans alike to support the authors and designers whose work they love.)\n\n\"I work nights and weekends and haven\u2019t been able to game with my friends in years.

Initially they were a stunt to try and get our name into some graphic design press - and splashed in glorious full-colour across packaging blogs. This worked, and we moved onto other projects and 'proper' runs of products for retail...\n\nWe never really got over our first project though! His memory lives on and we often get emails about our graphic design gambling work. So we'd like to rouse the Kickstarter collective once again and hope we can get enough support from designers and people-who-know-designers to be able to fund a full production run of our first project! Even if it is 2 years later...\nCMYK Playing Cards were born from the happy realisation in our studio that the maths fits! A traditional deck of playing cards consists of 4 suits with 10 cards (not including face cards). All we had to do was switch the suits for colours of ink used in printed media (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) and swap the numbers on each card for a percentage of ink on the surface. The cards are just as useful as traditional printed styles, AND perhaps most importantly, all niche and only understood by people who are in our little design world. We've tried explaining the cards to people outside the industry and were met with almost perfect poker face expressions. Our favourite kinds of products are the weird little niche things that only certain demographics (pun) will understand, and while that might not make brilliant business sense; it does seem to attract some of the most sincere people we have met.\nWe combined the opacities of ink with a strict anti-design rule. The only decoration would be made from the kinds of crop marks and registration bleeds usually never seen in the post-production world, and the various shapes, patterns and rules that never make it into a finished piece of printed media where given centre stage.\n\nMade from the finest German black-core paper, with a genuine playing card linen finish, the cards are poker spec at 63 x 88m and include a uniform back face design and matte laminated card tuck box.\n\nWe have some wonderful stretch goals in mind to push this project beyond just being another playing card goal, and we believe the people who understand this project will really enjoy owning such a design-led product.\n**UPDATE*** (28 JANUARY)\nBased on suggestions from backers we have adapted our original artwork very slightly, to improve gameplay and make the product nicer. See images below:\n\n1. HUNDRED MILLION logo removed from the back of \neach card.2.Jokers adapted to include as much fun as I could bear. Also made different so you can tell the difference between each joker. 3. Face cards - added a diagonal line which gets thicker. Jack 0.5pt, Queen 1.5pt, King 2.5pt - this will enable people to tell the difference quickly and separate them from the 100% card - and also reflects the traditional layout of a face card, as minimally as possible.\nUpdated spread design\nClose up of CYAN face cards, jokers and back design changes\n _____________________________________________________________\n**Giant THANK YOU to The super-talented Kenneth Aidan Foo for his video flicking our playing cards about. We are forever in your debt (like any good gamblers).** ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges we have faced have so far centred around the facts. With a product so focussed on the technical and the proof - it was vital not to mess up any overprints or even have slightly the wrong colour; Pure cyan, magenta, yellow and black sound easy to achieve, but the reality of getting the registration correct on so many opacities of so many colours was much more difficult. We spent time finding a factory that could consistently re-produce exact percentages of ink and keep the small print-design details that would typically be ironed out.\n\nOne of our biggest obstacles (as always in a project like this) was logic! Though the cards function just the same as a normal deck, we were concerned that some of the lower opacities in the Yellow suit in particular; could be difficult to read. We experimented with adapting the print, using a black stroke around the numbers, drop shadows, patterns to make the number of the cards more prominent - but they all looked upsetting, and went against the purity of the point. In the end we decided to let the whole flavour of the 20% opacities speak for the card, rather than just the number in the corner. So users become accustomed to which density of ink is which number, in a much more instinctive way.\n\nAnother challenge has been our previous project, we ran a Sugar Skull Spoon (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hundredmillion/sugar-skull-spoon) funding period in late 2013, and the reward fulfilment management overlapped this work. It was a lot difficult to manage both the reward procedure for the previous piece, and the planning and pricing and supplying of this project, but we have endeavoured to not let one affect the other, and we believe this is a challenge we can meet effectively.\n\nI am confident we have chosen a manufacturer more than capable of delivering this finished product at a quality we are happy with, and are trying to finalise stretch goals from our other suppliers - the usual pitfalls lie ahead of us for those and we promise to keep you informed as they occur, but without giving away too much of our surprise until it is time!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "A new name, and a new game!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "New project launched!

The 19 inch (48 cm) cable supports high-speed data transfer.\nUnlike power banks, JUMP charges automatically every time you charge your phone, giving you complete reassurance that whatever situation you are in, there\u2019s always power in your pocket.\nWe developed intelligent technology called AutoCharge\u2122 \nAutoCharge\u2122 is an efficient circuit prioritization system that detects when the battery inside your smartphone is full, and automatically redirects the power to charge the batteries inside JUMP.\nIt's always ready and charged\nJump provides a significant power boost to your smartphone when you need it most.\nIt's compact and lightweight\nJUMP fits easily in your coin pocket. (50mm x 50mm x 13.6mm)\nWith it\u2019s compact size, JUMP is small enough to hold behind your phone as you call.\n JUMP is case-friendly\nIt even fits with the official iPhone case\nWe designed JUMP to be your everyday charging solution. One of the priorities was to ensure it is small and compact, no bigger than your average rolled up cable, allowing you to take it with you wherever you go.  \nThe cable management system enables you to carry JUMP easily and neatly; no more messy cables thrown into your pocket or bag.\nPrecision-engineered channels securely hold the cable, allowing you to pull out the desired length during charging, as well as fastening whilst on the go.\nIntelligent design that is robust, compact and portable\nQuality of the components are extremely important to us \u2013 we wanted to create a device that cannot only withstand the stresses of everyday use, but is also something that looks and feels really good.\nWe custom made cables from a hard-wearing resistant nylon, resulting in cables that are durable and long lasting. We wanted to use materials for the casing that would ensure strength and longevity; therefore, we selected a thermoplastic blend of PC and ABS.\nThis is what we have been waiting for.\nFeatures Overview\nThe Design Story\nToday's Working Prototype\nElectrical evaluation of the first working prototypes have proven AutoCharge\u2122 and we are confident that JUMP will provide substantial additional charge to an iPhone 5s as we move forward towards production.\nWhy Kickstarter \nWe wanted to share JUMP, our latest product, through Kickstarter first. We recognize that Kickstarter hosts an important community: artists, innovators, and the intellectually curious. We wanted to share the background and development of JUMP with you because we value your opinions and support. We believe we have started a new product category within the portable charging market; one that we hope you would like to follow the progress of. Your support means everything to us, and all of the funding will go towards vitally important aspects of making this product a reality.\nNATIVE UNION\nnativeunion.com\nNATIVE UNION is a creative and lifestyle brand that has received critical acclaim from the design community.\nIn 2013 NATIVE UNION launched SWITCH, a wireless portable speaker, conference call device and mobile phone charger. During the year it has received numerous accolades and awards including; Good Design Award, Chicago, Gold Winner of A\u2019Design Awards, Italy and winner of Design for Asia, Hong Kong. Previous products have been awarded the Good Design Award, Tokyo, Design Plus Award, Frankfurt, iLounge, Las Vegas. At NATIVE UNION we have a track record of creating, designing and producing innovative and thoughtful products.\n Technical Specifications", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt has taken nearly a year to be where we are today, and it has been incredibly challenging from a design and development perspective to achieve such great battery performance in a compact sleek design.\n\nThis upfront R&D has inherently reduced the amount of risks still involved in the project and we now face the final major task of bringing all the elements together, through; tooling, testing, compliance and production. \n\nOf course by developing and manufacturing a product with new technology, there are still risks involved. At this stage we foresee the largest of these hurdles, aside from the normal challenges involved in any development, is Made for iPhone (MFi) compliance testing and shipment of individual products around the world.\n\nJUMP is the first MFI accessory that combines a battery and sync product and is classed as a charging cable; this puts us in new territory within the MFI certification process.\n\nTo reduce risk and challenges, we have partnered with a world-leading manufacturer of MFI products; this provides us added insurance and confidence to pass the Made for iPhone (MFI) certification. \n\nDe-bugging the software involved in AutoCharge\u2122 and within compliance of MFI will take further fine tuning and testing as we want the most efficient device for power vs size on the market today.\n\nThe last challenge is getting the individual product to each of our kickstarter backers \u2013 with tighter restrictions on the shipping of singular products that contain batteries around the world today. Our in-house logistics team has spent a considerable amount of time searching to find a logistics partner that has a proven track record of dealing with this issue and we believe we have greatly reduced the challenges involved.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Guess who's back?", "update_content": "Dear JUMP Cable Backers,\nWe are excited to announce that we'll be launching our latest product on Kickstarter two weeks from today, on October 26th at 8 AM PDT.\nYou may remember that we\u2019ve been wanting to come back to Kickstarter for some time now.
