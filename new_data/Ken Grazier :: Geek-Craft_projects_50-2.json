When Kay and everyone at Oni saw the last version, we all shouted perfect (almost)! We sent the design back with one subtle but important change: Chamomile needs to be a lot grumpier. We need him to look like we accidentally woke him up from a really good nap and he is not happy about it at all. Once that change was made, we found our perfect Mountain Chamomile. \nThe Mountain Chamomile plushie and woven blanket shown are prototypes and the final versions may be slightly different. The final blanket will be 50\" x 60\". \nIf you're looking for add-ons, don't worry! We've got you covered.  If you back at any level (even the $1.00 pledge), you'll be able to add individual plushies to your pledge through Backerkit once the campaign ends, as well as the blanket, game, and books.\nPLAY\n\nOne of the greatest things about being in the comics and games industry is that throughout the year, we get the opportunity to interact directly with the fans at conventions all across the world. These events give us an outlet to create specialty items that we think fans will treasure, but that are prohibitive to make for retail. This year, we didn't have that opportunity, so many of the projects, like Mountain Chamomile, had to be postponed.\n\nWith Kickstarter, we have the ability to reach our fans directly and bring our creative projects to life. Literally every backer makes a difference and with enough backers, we can continue to connect with fans, share our process, and offer a variety of fun rewards.\nKay O'Neill is an Eisner and Harvey Award-winning illustrator and graphic novelist from New Zealand. They are the author of Princess Princess Ever After, Aquicorn Cove, The Tea Dragon Society, The Tea Dragon Festival, and Dewdrop, all from Oni Press. They mostly make gentle fantasy stories for younger readers, and are very interested in tea, creatures, things that grow, and the magic of everyday life.\nOni Press / Lion Forge Publishing Group is a premier comic book, graphic novel, and games publisher located in Portland, Oregon. Established in 1997, Oni Press\u2019s curated line includes a variety of award-winning original and licensed comic books and graphic novels, including: Adult Swim\u2019s Rick and Morty\u2122, Nickelodeon\u2019s Invader ZIM, Scott Pilgrim, Queen & Country, Courtney Crumrin, Wasteland, The Sixth Gun, Stumptown, Wet Moon, Letter 44, The Bunker, The Tea Dragon Society, The Coldest City, and Kaijumax.\nPlease note that shipping is not included in the prices. Shipping will be charged in the pledge manager based on where you live and on which rewards and add-ons you purchase. We've included a chart for estimated shipping costs with our reward levels and different shipping regions. Whenever possible, we'll bundle items together to save you shipping costs. \n\nPlease note that taxes are also not included in the prices. We are required to collect and pay taxes in specific states and countries. If ordering from California or Missouri, taxes will be added in the pledge manager. If ordering from Canada, VAT will be added to your overall purchase in the pledge manager.  \nWhat is Backerkit?\nBackerkit is a crowdfunding software tool that helps us make sure you get exactly what you want and are charged correctly.\n\nWhen will this happen?\nYou will get an email survey 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over providing a link to a Backerkit survey. In the survey, you\u2019ll add your shipping info and reward preferences and grab any add-ons to see the overall shipping and tax costs.\n\nHow much will I pay?\nThe total cost will be the value of all the items in your BackeKit cart, plus shipping and applicable taxes, minus what you were already charged in Kickstarter through your pledge.\n\nHow Much Do I Pledge Now?\nTake a gander at the banners on the right side of page and click on your preferred reward level. Looking for add-ons? No worries! As soon as you receive your email from Backerkit, you'll be able to add as many plushies, books, and blankets as your heart desires.\n Music: Bensound.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the Alpine plushie, we've been working closely with Kay O'Neill and the manufacturer to perfect the grumpiest face ever. \n\nThe two main risks for this Kickstarter are unexpected delays in manufacturing or shipping. With a project of this size, customs can sometimes also cause delays in shipping. If the project is highly successful, materials could also take longer for our manufacturer to obtain, although larger orders usually mean faster production. Overseas holidays can also cause a delay in either shipping or manufacturing. We're working with an established manufacturer, one we've been partnered with for three adorable plushies so far. We will always keep everyone updated with all stages of production and shipping, and if there are any delays, you'll be the first to know.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nWe're using eco-friendly polyester and polyester fiber during manufacturing!", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wild Tea Dragon Spotter", "descp": "Support our campaign and follow our story!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["285 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Alpine Plushie Adopter", "descp": "The fluffiest and grumpiest tea dragon!\nShipping and taxes are not included in this price.

See the Licensing section for details!\nEngage the Nazi occupation of France in la petite guerre to throw off the yoke of the oppressors and free your homeland!\nMaquis is a solitaire worker-placement game with variable goals and a play time of approximately twenty minutes. The player places their resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve their goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.\nWith this new edition, we've added some new components to include some more difficult 3-star missions, some new spare rooms and resources, and made some tweaks to the rules & original components to improve clarity and gameplay.\nFor previous backers/customers who got the 1st edition, we have the option on this campaign to order the new components to add to your original game (Backer Level \"Maquis - New Content\"). They'll be fully compatible and will fit into the original box (with some maneuvering \ud83d\ude0a), or you can keep them in the nice tuck box they'll ship in.\nNOTE:  We only plan on printing what we need of the \"Maquis - New Content\" level so there is no guarantee that folks who don't back the Kickstarter will receive the new content separately. Don't miss out!\n\n\n\nTo begin, the player will set up the board, organize the game tokens and  randomly choose two mission cards that must be completed in the allotted number of turns.\n\nThe player will then shuffle the patrol deck and place it next to the side of the board. This deck represents where the Milice patrols will occur during each day.\n\nThe player will choose a location to send their first worker and assign one of their pawns there. They then draw a patrol card, and place a Milice pawn if able. This continues until all of the available worker pawns and Milice pawns are placed. If the Milice find your worker during patrol, they will be arrested!\nYour diligent workers are then free to perform their duties, working toward your two goals. Gather resources, recruit fellow patriots to the cause, and undermine the enemy plans to throw off the yoke of oppression and free your homeland!\n Downloads: \n(for 1st edition - 2nd edition files coming!)\nRulebook PDF\nPrint & Play\nTry it for free on Tabletop Simulator \nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through a pledge manager. \nThese shipping rates listed below are estimates and may change based on 2021 shipping rates & final production weights.

For backers in Australia & New Zealand, pledges will ship from within Australia (Aetherworks).\nFor our EU backers, all pledges will be fulfilled from the EU. We are closely monitoring what's happening with the trade deal with the UK and EU resulting from Brexit and we'll make sure that effective, customs friendly shipping will be available for everyone.\nFor backers in the rest of the world (including the US), pledges will be shipped from China either directly to you or through a local partner. This allows us to offer affordable shipping to everyone across the globe.\nAnd, for backers getting the English version, each additional copy you order doesn't increase the shipping cost! So if you order 1, 10, or 100 copies of the 2nd edition the shipping charge will be $6/$9/$15 depending on your location. :)\nNOTE:  These shipping estimates are for the English version only. We will work with our licensing partners to provide shipping estimates for those versions based on shipping locations. \nIt would be an honor to have Maquis on the shelves of retail stores!

In the PnP and first editions, the day track marks \"completed days\". This wasn't an issue for any of the original PnP missions, but some of the newer ones require you to complete objectives on or before certain days.

This project aims to fund the manufacturing of Zodiac Mermaid pins that I have designed. As of January 12, 2021 all 12 pins have been unlocked! My name is Jess of JellyJessBeans and you can find me on Instagram for more designs and art I make. I have experience making an enamel pin previously so I know what to expect from my manufacturer and have trust in their quality. if you would like to see my previous pin you can find it on my Etsy store.  You can also check out my design process and information about the Zodiacs on my TikTok. I have been drawing most of my life, and have decided I wanted to pursue my passion, so here I am! Thank you so much for taking a moment of your time to look at my campaign!\nThis project aims to fund the manufacturing of the below pins. The pins are all hard enamel, gold plated, at approx. 2 inches tall. They will have two pin posts and come with rubber clutches and will be sent with backer cards that are custom designed for each of the mermaids.\n In the line-up below you can see the pin artwork of each of the mermaids that will be sent to the manufacturers. Below them are each of the backer cards for each of the pins. The cards will be roughly 3 inches tall and will be white, with gold foil to give them that extra special touch! If you would like to see the illustrations of each of the mermaids, please head over to my Instagram to view them all!\n\nI am also offering freebies for certain pledge tiers!\nIf you order 6 or more pins, you will receive a 5x5 inch print of the illustration of each of the pins you want!\nThe initial funding target for the pins is $1300 which allows me to fund the manufacturing, shipping and fees on the first three of the zodiac sign pins! If this goal is exceeded we can start working towards unlocking the next nine pins! For those of you who are curious about how the costs get broken down or where the money goes here is a rough breakdown:\nPin Production: ~70%\nFulfilment and Shipping: ~20%\nKickstarter/Transaction Fees: 10%\n\nThank you for looking over my campaign! If you can't back the project right now, sharing this Kickstarter on social media is a great help! I'll be posting updates here and on Instagram!\nAll pins have been unlocked! Whether you pledge before or after they are unlocked doesn't matter, but you may miss out on the Early Bird specials if you wait too long! At the end of the campaign, regardless of when you pledged, you will be able to choose between any of the pins that we have unlocked. You will also be entitled to any additional freebies we have unlocked by the end of the campaign! This includes the Kickstarter exclusive 1.5 inch mermaid pin for free!\nI have even partnered with two Etsy shops to make custom designed pin boards for the project! They come in 13 inch and 18 inch variants which you can check out below the mermaids. The 13 inch board is being made by WhatsYourInnerGeek. This pin board is a thick, durable foam and has a wood backing. The 18 inch board is being made by UniqueCorkBoards. This pin board is made of cork like many boards you see in stores. I have linked their Etsy shops in their names if you want to go and check out their work!\nThese are custom designed, engraved pin boards, and are priced as such. The 13 inch board will cost $60 USD ($45 + $15 shipping & Handling), and the 18 inch board will cost $80 USD ($65 + $15 shipping & Handling).\nTo increase your pledge you can go to Manage Pledge > Update Pledge > Bonus Support > Confirm. I have also added 2 new reward tiers to get all 12 pins at a discounted rate that includes one of the pin boards!\nCapricorn, Pisces and Scorpio\nAquarius, Sagittarius and Virgo \nGemini, Libra and Cancer \nAries, Leo and Taurus\nKickstarter Exclusive FREE Mermaid Pin\n13 inch board on the left, 18 in board on the right\nSize comparison with my previous 1.5 in pin for size\nPledge Now, Pay Later\nOne way to think of Kickstarter is that it is a pre-order site! The benefit is that you can pledge now for the pins you want, and only pay at the end once we are fully funded; meaning if you need to back out before the campaign ends, you can! This means it\u2019s risk free for all involved! Once the campaign ends I will send out a survey allowing you to pick the pins you want.\nThe fees will not cover any import taxes or customs fees if you live outside the United States, so be aware of those if your country has them!\nJanuary 8: Kickstarter campaign starts and lasts 45 days.\nFebruary 22: Campaign ends, surveys are sent out.\nEarly-March: Funds received from Kickstarter and manufacturing can begin.\nEarly-April: Pins are finished! They are sent to me for grading (quality check) and packaging.\nLate-April: Your pins are sent to you! (Just in time for MerMay!)\nThese are all estimates and due to the pandemic situation delivery of the pins to myself, or to your home may be delayed. Be sure to check if you can receive packages from the US during the pandemic.\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask them! I will add any questions and their answers to the FAQ section as they are asked. If your question isn't answered there or you just need further clarification on something, feel free to contact me! You can get in touch with me through the Kickstarter messaging platform or via social media.\nEtsy\nInstagram\nTikTok: JellyJessBeans", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- If Kickstarter does not reach its goals, you won't be charged anything - your card will only be charged if we reach our goal and you don't cancel before the project end date.\n\n- Delay in pin production (due to errors or COVID-19)\n\n- Delay in shipping due to COVID-19 (USPS is experiencing delays, so please be mindful of this)\n\n- Small design changes (the overall look of the pin will stay the same but it may be necessary to make minor tweaks to metal line thickness or position of enamel to preserve the integrity of the pin)\n\n- Color differences due to Pantone matching and monitor colors\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "1 Mermaid Pin", "descp": "Special Kickstarter pricing! save $3.50 over retail price!

There's something about weird, interesting, emergent gameplay, shared incentives, and cubes stretching across a hex map that brings me joy.\nUnsure what a cube rails game is? That's okay. Some of the most popular titles are Chicago Express, Paris Connection, Irish Gauge, Ride the Rails, and more. These are 30-60 minute games of route-building, share-purchasing, & railroad-investing.\nWhile games in the genre can sound similar, cube rails titles have a long history of doing all sorts of weird stuff: 8 to 16-hour games of logistics in Union vs Central, the meta-think of Northern Pacific's player order, and the entirely wild random share ride of Erie Railroad.\nI wanted to do something different as well.\nCard Rails is a 3-5 player, 20-30 minute cube rails game played on a deck of cards. Instead of giving you a predesignated map, players together create the landscape of the game they are playing, blocking others and bettering their own positions, all while making the tough decision to keep a card for future financial gain or to garner an immediate reward.\n CARDS INSTEAD OF A BOARD? \nBased on player count, you will have a specific number of cards in hand. Each card is different and has lots of information on it. Cards are comprised of hexes, and there are different types of hexes:\nBasic green hexes\nPurple hexes that add value to the Railroad Company\nRed hexes that let you swap out cards in your hand\nBlue Lake hexes that block where you can go\nSpecial hexes with Railroad Symbols that majorly increase the value of a Railroad Company\nA Share of the Brown Company with a Red Swap Hex and an impassable Lake Hex in the middle\nA White share conveniently located in the middle of the card with a Purple +2 Value Hex just below it. But those two 1/2 Lake Hexes could be tricky to build around.\nON YOUR TURN: Take a Share or Build Track.\nTake a Share. This is how you get points. Without shares, you don't score anything!\nDiscard a card from your hand.\nTake an available share of a company. That's it.\nHowever, you can only have 3 shares in total.\nOh, and cards remaining in your hand at the end of the game also count as shares of companies, so discard wisely.\n\nBuild Track. This is how you increase the value of companies. Without high values, you won't score enough points to win!\nDiscard* a card from your hand.\nTake 1 or 2 cubes from any available Railroads and place them on the map, expanding their lines.\n*Are you building into a 1/2 hex (like the purple above)? Then play the card you were going to discard onto the map where you're building into. The hex on the card you play has to match, but nothing else does. Rotate the card to block your opponents.\nBuild into a Purple hex or a hex with that Railroad's matching symbol? That company's value increases at the end of the game.\nBuild into a Red Swap hex? Exchange a card from your hand for any discarded card.\nHOW TO WIN\nThe game continues until all players have a certain number of cards left in hand, dependent on player count. Then players:\nTotal up the value of each Railroad\nReveal the cards in their hands\nMultiply the Railroads' values with the number of shares they have (both as cubes taken earlier and the symbols of the cards in their hands).\nThe player with the highest total wins!\nRules Translations\nJapanese\nSpanish\nFrench\nPortuguese \nCard Rails is a 54-card cube rails game that comes with 60 8mm wooden cubes.

I am only making 100 copies of Card Rails. If you missed out, I'm so sorry. If this does well, it shows me there is a desire for these small box games. More than likely, I will open up preorders for a summer release, you know, when I'm not in the middle of being a public educator in America during a pandemic.\nDue to the volatile nature of the USPS right now, and because this is a short, small project, it's only shipping to the US.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

Thanks to the unexpected, stupendous support, PNP backers will receive W\u00fcrfel Pie, too! Thanks to a helpful friend, the rules for both games will also be available in French. \"Roll and write\" means that your game components and setup are minimal. \"PNP\" means that you will receive the PDF files for this game immediately after the campaign ends so you can start playing right away!\n The Picts, an ancient Scottish culture, were among several groups to have a hand in thwarting the Roman Empire\u2019s expansion, including the building of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. They were accomplished sailors, traders, and even pirates.\n\nStanding Stones is a blind bidding domino placement game by Benny Sperling. Yep, you read that correctly! Players will use one half of a domino to bid on an action card and the other half to complete a numbered action. The action cards will award resources, change how you use your domino, or allow you to do specific actions better. Players can even send a diplomat to visit another player\u2019s land and utilize one of their actions. Not only are you using diplomacy to do something you might be unable to do on your own, but you are also effectively blocking that action from their use that turn!\n The dominos are surprisingly tactical and wonderfully tactile. They really capture the theme for me when I stand them up on edge, looking every bit like the standing stones described in history and carved by the Picts. The stones represent your power and offer you more goods to feed into your resource converting engine.\nCheck out the rules, HERE, or watch a demonstration video below:\n If you're like me, a major reason you love roll and write games is because they usually have solitaire modes of play. We have a special second sheet which drives an AI opponent designed to make your solo experience an engaging challenge. Princess Eithne will draft dominoes against you and send her emissary to try and slow you down every turn. \nBellow, Derik shows how to setup and play the solitaire version:\n  No problem!\nThe PDF files will include dominoes you can print with the rest of the game\nWe will have thematic domino cards available for purchase through The Game Crafter very soon\nSophia makes and sells incredible hand-cast resin dominoes. \n We met her on Twitter (@thesophia_509) and were absolutely floored by the gorgeous colors and textures she gets from her resin crafts. Her amazing dominoes made this Boston based artist an easy pick for our first community spotlight. Check out her store at PHIAART.\n Because support has gone so far and above expectations, we've rearranged our publication schedule to add Mr. Sperling's first (and my favorite) roll and write game to this project FOR FREE!\n\nW\u00fcrfel means \"dice\" in German. In this game, players are pushing their luck and trying to find the exact right combination of fillings in their pie and serving it up. Dice drafting finds the players hoping for just the right roll without their opponents snatching them away! Tricks and thoughtful play abound in this dice chucker. Is it easy as pie? Time will soon tell as you dig in for that first scrumptious piece!\nCheck out the rules, HERE, or watch a multiplayer demonstration below:\n Or, watch this one for the solitaire version:\n W\u00fcrfel Pie features art and graphic design by the incomparable Jason Washburn (Talon Strikes Studio). Be sure to put eyes on his latest releases as they are also looking and playing great!\n Benny and I have a passion for gaming and would love to publish these games in a format that is both fulfilling and inexpensive. As such, we realized that offering the files for players to Print and Play (PNP) at home was a perfect way to go! In fact, you don't even need a home printer. Since you'll have the PDFs, you can print at work, at a local print shop, or (like I often do) play straight on your iPad, Surface, or other tablet device.\n This unusual format (PNP) allows us:\n    To offer a low entry point into fun games produced on a regular, frequent basis with no extra shipping costs or delays.\n     The freedom to design wild, wacky, and wonderful ideas regardless of typical commercial viability.\n     The opportunity to connect creative creators and makers with a passionate community united by similar interests.\n Honest and responsive communication.\nDelivery immediately following the close of the campaign. \nA referral to at least one indie-maker in our community.\nMore projects just like this every month.\nAnd we\u2019d love to work with you designers out there!

We will get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nYour pledge must be confirmed within 8 weeks of our pledge manager email to you. If you do not confirm your pledge at this time, you agree that KTBG has fulfilled its obligation to you, and your pledge will become a donation. After the 8-week window, it might still be possible to get your game shipped, based on availability. It is so difficult for us to confirm shipping to different regions of the world when our numbers are in constant flux.\n\nIt is the backer's responsibility to provide us with the correct shipping address and to ensure it is deliverable by typical methods of shipping. Unfortunately we do not ship to PO Boxes. Backers who have provided an expired address, or incorrect addresses will be charged shipping a second time to get their game to them. There is always the possibility of a refund, although the Kickstarter and pledge manager fees are non-refundable.\n\nWe reserve the right to sell our games, for the purpose of keeping our company going, at any point through the production and fulfilment process.

Choose your side, grab your dice, and get ready to roll!\nKAPOW! uses buildable dice, allowing you to add and remove dice faces during the course of battle. This makes for a super-strategic dice-battling experience. With each roll, you decide how to attack, defend, and power up your character by choosing where to place your dice. \nThe battles get more explosive with each roll and as you gain more dice and dice faces. KAPOW! is simple to learn (roll and place), but has layers of strategy as you customize your dice pool and leverage the unique powers of the KAPOW! universe\u2019s heroes and villains!\nCheck out this gameplay video:\n And here is a video showing the Solo Play mode we've unlocked:\nKAPOW! Volume 1 & KAPOW! Volume 2 are each complete two-player games. \nJust pick the one with the characters you like best, or get both by selecting the TEAM-UP Tier to be able to play 2, 3, or 4 player games!\nPorcupine Mega-Hero Unlocked for the TEAM-UP Tier!\nThis is your chance to get Kickstarter Exclusives from previous White Wizard Games Kickstarters you may have missed!\nTo order an add-on, just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. You will be able to specify exactly which add-ons you are getting using the pledge manager after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nNote: If you ONLY want add-ons (like the Star Realms High Alert First Strike pack) but don't want any KAPOW!, back the \"Pledge Manager Tier\"\nThis Conversion Kit is for ONLY backers who currently own the first edition of KAPOW! It contains stickers to update your Player and Super Boards, plus the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero: Halfmoon and the Kickstarter Exclusive Mega-Villain: Sawmill Jackson. When purchased along with the KAPOW! Volume 2 Tier, your Stretch Goals will be upgraded to the TEAM UP Tier Stretch Goals.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Star Realms game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Hero Realms game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Epic Card Game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Sorcerer game line.\nAt the start of the game you will choose a hero or villain to play. Each comes with their own \"Super Board\" showing their unique powers, starting dice pool and health. \n\nEach round, players simultaneously roll their dice and secretly place them on their Player Board and/or their Super Board to attack, defend, or power up (gaining more dice and add faces to their buildable Action dice). \n All players then simultaneously remove their player screens revealing their boards.\nPlayer Board with dice.\nPlayers deal damage equal to their attack minus their target's defense. Reduce your opponent's health to zero to knock them out and win the game!\n\n\n\nEach set of KAPOW! comes with two high quality score dials!\nThis is the 2nd edition of KAPOW!. \nThe first edition of KAPOW! was designed and published by 2 Ton Porcupine in 2019. We met the game designers at the Boston Festival of Indie Games and were intrigued by this game. It felt super fast and thrilling with every play.\nWe fell in love with KAPOW!, and brought it into the White Wizard Games portfolio. We took the 1st edition to PAX Unplugged and PAX East,  where we ran tons of demos, and sold through the entire print run. \nThe White Wizard Games and 2 Ton Porcupine teams then combined forces to improve the game play, visuals and components of this already awesome game. In this Kickstarter you can get the new-and-improved second edition of  KAPOW! Volume 1 , and the ALL-NEW KAPOW! Volume 2. \nIf you already have the first edition of KAPOW! Volume 1, it is compatible with KAPOW! Volume 2. In the future, we will post a small second edition rules conversion supplement on our website.\nPLAY\n\n Shipping\nWe will be shipping to backers directly from fulfillment centers in The US, UK,  EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our fulfillment centers, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in some regions may receive product before backers in others.\nIMPORTANT - For this Kickstarter you will be charged shipping separately after this Kickstarter concludes. This will be done via the pledge manager. What you are charged for shipping will be based on our actual cost to get your rewards to you from your region's fulfillment center plus taxes/fees we were charged to get your reward into your region.\nHere is an estimate of shipping cost by region. Keep in mind, this is just an estimate and cost will increase with add-ons.\nUSA (Contiguous 48): $12-$18\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico: $22-$54\nCanada: $17 - $27\nGermany $12 - $22\nRest of EU: $16 - $29\nUK:  $14 - $18\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland: $35-$49\nChina, Macoa, Hong Kong: $18-$28\nRest of Asia $29-$59\nAustralia $20-$30\nNew Zealand  $25-$38\nRest of the World: $49-$89\nEU Backers, please note: Your product will be shipped from within the EU. You will be charged VAT in the pledge manager.\nUK Backers, please note: Your product will be shipped from within the UK. You will be charged VAT in the pledge manager.\nUSA Backers, please note: If you are in a state where White Wizard Games is required by law to collect sales tax(currently: Florida, Massachusetts, and New York), you will be charged sales tax in the pledge manger. \nUnfortunately, we don't ship to Afghanistan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia, or Ukraine.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Kickstarter exclusives may eventually be remade with new art and/or language for general sale.\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art and/or language.\nNothing is final until it is printed.\nAll art, materials, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change. The final versions you receive may not exactly match what is pictured here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are veteran publishers with a lot of experience and great products under our belt, but we are also perfectionists. We will have the printer make samples, improve on those, make more samples, round and round as many times as it takes for things to be awesome. This means we may be late with delivery.\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this Kickstarter is December 2021, but please keep in mind this is just an estimate. We will work hard to ship your game on time, but our number one concern is that this product turns out great. If we have to delay delivery to improve the product, we will.\n\nAlso note COVID-19 has thrown off our production and delivery timelines a bit. Hopefully this won't be an issue when this Kickstarter is ready to ship, but it may slow things down a bit.\n\nWe are pretty active on the comments while the Kickstarter campaign is live, so we can get your feedback and input. Once the Kickstarter campaign ends we put our noses to the grindstone working on games, so we aren't on the comments nearly as much.\n\nOnce the Kickstarter campaign ends, you can expect an update about once a month letting you know our progress.

Eduardo Baraf is at the helm of Herbaceous Pocket to ensure it delivers Herbaceous' perfect balance of simple play, interesting moments, and wonderful art in a fantastic, tiny, package.   \n Keith Matejka (Thunderworks Games) - designer of Bullfrogs, Roll Player, and Skulk Hollow - created the additional rules for solo play, loved for its easy, rapid play.  \nHerbaceous is Zee Garcia's #1 relaxing game (and Mike Disilio's #4). The new, great way to experience Herbaceous with a cup of tea.  \n\n\nThe pocket edition of the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion includes Cinnamon, Star Anise, and Peppercorn and adds a little extra spice to Herbaceous' flavorful play. \nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for Herbaceous Pocket Edition will also receive the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale typically for $5 separately on BGG, at Conventions, the PFG Store, etc. It will not be packaged within the base game.     \nMy Mother Gives an Overview of How to Play the original Herbaceous - she has the prototype from our first KS.\nRodney Smith from Watch It Played teaches Herbaceous .

It is an absolutely delightful and very fast playing game that you can really do with just about anyone. This is the perfect game for high tea. \nBower's Game Corner: Herbaceous is a rock solid filler game - great family game, great game night game, great gateway game! \nHerbaceous: Pocket Edition is a Stretch Goal free campaign. We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift. It is an easy, gateway game for almost anyone.\n> Herbaceous Pocket will be EU Friendly,UK Friendly, CA Friendly\nKeep up on Herbaceous\n                            - Follow Herbaceous on Facebook\nKeep up on Us\n                            - Pencil First Games, Follow Ed on Twitter\n                            - Dr. Finn's Games, Follow Steve on Twitter\n                            - BethSobel.com, Follow Beth on Twitter\n                            - Thunderworks Games, Follow Keith on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGameGeek.com\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGaming.com  \nIntro Video, Header & Lifestyle Photos: More Games Please, Follow Ross on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is Pencil First Games' fourteenth Kickstarter. \"Lift Off!

We are confident that you will get a game that you\u2019ll be proud to play AND proudly display on your game shelf.\n\nThe art and mechanics for In Too Deep are nearly complete. Once this campaign ends we will tie up loose ends and submit print files.\n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition. This can happen for various reasons such as manufacturing issues, freight delays, and even importing the games to the various regions of the world, as we have recently experienced during this global pandemic. Although we have budgeted 11 months to bring this game to your doorstep, please know that these delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore our timeline is only an estimate. We are working to meet our goal to fulfill the game by the end of September 2021.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation. We have worked with all of these partners many times before, so we are optimistic that everything will go as planned.

Unfortunately the Endeavor: Age of Expansion campaign was delayed in some regions of the world due to Covid-19. We found ourselves just entering into our fulfillment phase when the world shut down. Although the fulfillment didn't go exactly as planned, we have been open and honest about the process, updating backers often.\n \u2022 Wide praise for production quality and gameplay development, as quality products is of the utmost importance to us. \n\u2022 Our designers and artists come to In Too Deep with many years of experience.\n\u2022 Customer service is key to creating a positive backer experience. We are here for you!\n\nOUR REFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including all fees associated with the campaign. After that period, we will refund your pledge, no questions asked, minus all of the fees associated with the Kickstarter, payment processing, and our pledge manager. These fees cannot be recovered from Kickstarter/our pledge manager after two weeks of the campaign ending. This project is in CAD, therefore, refunds will be processed in CAD.\n\nWe want you to be happy! We promise to keep you in the loop every step of the way. If you have any questions, send us a direct message, email us at info@burntislandgames.com or simply comment on the campaign. We will get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nYour pledge must be confirmed within 6 weeks of our pledge manager email to you. If you do not confirm your pledge at this time, you agree that Burnt Island Games has fulfilled its obligation to you, and your pledge will become a donation. After the 8 week window, it might still be possible to get your game shipped, based on availability. It is so difficult for us to confirm shipping to different regions of the world when our numbers are in constant flux.\n\nIt is the backer's responsibility to provide us with the correct shipping address and to ensure it is deliverable by typical methods of shipping. Unfortunately we do not ship to PO Boxes. Backers who have provided an expired address, or incorrect addresses will be charged shipping a second time to get their game to them. There is always the possibility of a refund, although the Kickstarter and pledge manager fees are non-refundable.\n\nWe reserve the right to sell our games, for the purpose of keeping our company going, at any point through the production and fulfilment process.

The countryside is blossoming and you are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the farmers turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community, it\u2019s you!\nAgropolis is a standalone Sprawlopolis game. What does that mean? Well it's more of what we built with Sprawlopolis, but instead of more cities, it's farms. It adds a few new twists (livestock and feed fees), and can be played on its own or combined with Sprawlopolis in a fun new way. \nAgropolis will be the 66th game to join our growing line of Wallet Games\nA quick note on Sprawlopolis\nWe've made over 60 Wallet Games by now and it's safe to say that there's something really special about Sprawlopolis. It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge.

(Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

The goal in placing habitat tiles is to create contiguous corridors by matching rivers, prairies, wetlands, forests, and mountains. Once habitats are placed, players populate them with the wildlife species that each habitat supports. Each species has their own spatial requirements and connections to one another and their ecosystem! \nCascadia is a modular, dual-layer puzzle, with variable scoring conditions that is simple to learn, but challenging to master!\nCascadia comes with a variety of spatial wildlife goals allowing you to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are hundreds of unique puzzles to explore! Create stunningly beautiful terrain maps as you build your own personal environment, while competing with others for the habitats and wildlife you desire!\nKickstarter backers of Cascadia receive a set of 5 Tarot-sized Promo Wildlife Scoring Cards FREE! With the addition of these cards, players will be able to mix and match even more goals. These promo cards are a special THANK YOU to all backers for being early supporters, and will not be included with future copies of the game!\nWant to learn about Cascadia in just 1 minute? Check out Board Games In A Minute's quick overview!\nCheck out this How-to-play video by AnnaMaria of Girl's Game Shelf!\nLearn all about Cascadia with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCascadia can be played solo! The solo mode elegantly simulates a 2-player game experience by turning the tile and token drafting into a cascading market. Players must make difficult decisions about which tiles and tokens to take, as each turn brings changes to what is available. The solo mode is a quick and relaxing experience that is simple to learn, and does not require the upkeep of an AI player, while still offering interesting puzzly choices and challenging thresholds to overcome.\nGavin McGruddy of MyAutoma has uploaded a great browser-based demo of the Cascadia Solo Mode, so that you can try it out for yourself! This demo will let you play the recommended starting group of Wildlife Scoring Cards! Challenge your friends to see who can get the highest score! Try it out here!\nCascadia also has a Family Variant! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you can play with the included Family Variant Wildlife Scoring Card. This streamlines the wildlife scoring so that each animal scores in a similar way, reducing the number of different scoring conditions to learn, while still offering challenging puzzly gameplay. In addition to the Family Variant, the Wildlife Scoring Card features a flip side with an Intermediate Variant. This mode increases the challenge of the spatial puzzle a bit, without adding more complex scoring conditions. \nWith this range of gameplay modes, Cascadia can be tuned to offer different game experiences to different players, depending on experience level.\nCascadia provides a fantastic mix of approachable game play with strategic depth. It is a natural follow-up to our wildly successful first publication, Calico! We wanted to provide fans of gorgeous puzzly games another easy-to-teach, yet challenging-to-master game. Our collaborative team has worked hard to make Cascadia an accessible and exciting game for a range of audiences.\nWhile it can be a fun gateway experience for new gamers, it provides more experienced players with variable goals, tension of managing habitats and wildlife simultaneously, and a great mix of long-term strategy and short-term tactics. This makes the challenge and reward of each puzzle extremely satisfying! We are very proud of the gameplay and quality of the product.\nWe know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Cascadia is the perfect game to do just that!\nThe members of our team have years of experience working on a number of successful projects, from Point Salad to Overlord! What we think these games all have in common is their attention to detail and focus on great gameplay and amazing product quality.\nLast year, 6,724 backers joined us on the journey that made Calico possible. Since then, the game has received various accolades - from being one of the most anticipated abstract games of 2020 on Boardgamegeek.com, to praise from countless reviewers.\nThe Dice Tower gave our first game, Calico, their prestigious Seal of Approval!\nSince this is only our second published game, Cascadia does not currently have access to broad distribution in order to be available in retail stores. This means Kickstarter is your first and best opportunity to bring Cascadia home! The Kickstarter Edition comes with free promo cards that will not be part of a standard retail edition, even if the game does make it into distribution.\nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support. The pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value, as well as subsidized shipping, as our way of saying thank you for your support. You are all special, and have a big hand in the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without all of you, and we appreciate that! \nWe also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. We are focused on you and anything we can do to improve the backer experience!\nRetailers\nCertified brick-and-mortar retailers interested in backing can reach out through our website form (www.flatout.games/cascadia-retailer). Interested retailers will be invited to our pledge manager after the campaign has ended.

We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is fantastic, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that simply will not be possible without a larger initial print run. \nAs we get funding, we\u2019ll be going on a trek together! As our numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and finding fun bonuses along the trail!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the game \u2018to the peak\u2019! \nWE DID IT!\nThanks to all of our amazing backers, we have reached the peak and the game has been fully upgraded with all of these fantastic extras!  \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts on Cascadia!\n Check out Jeremy's Final Thoughts of Cascadia on Man vs Meeple! \nCheck out Fiona and Amy's Review at The Game Shelf!\n Check out Eric's Review at What's Eric Playing!\nSee why Cascadia earn's Steph's Super Rainbow in her review!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Overview Video with Shantelle and Sara!\nCheck out Slickerdrip's First Impressions of Cascadia!\nWatch Theo's Overview of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Our Family Plays Games has to say about Cascadia!\n Check out The Cardboard Kid's Review of Cascadia!\n Check out Eric's Cascadia Review at The Cardboard Hoard!\nCheck out Marti and Sarah's Review of Cascadia at Open Seat Gaming!\n Check out Brian's review of Cascadia at Colorblind Games!\n Check out Jonathan Liu's Review at GeekDad!\nCheck out Plumpy Thimble's Review of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Ruel had to say about Cascadia on the Projects We Love Video! \nCheck out Andy's Review at Meeple Mountain!\nCheck out Jess's preview on Gameosity!\n Check out Ken's Review at Geek-Craft!\nCheck out BJ's interview with Molly and Shawn on Board Game Gumbo!\n\n\n We know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nDuring our last campaign for Calico, we subsidized over $20,000 in backer shipping charges to help pitch in, and we're continuing with that trend here.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. The game will ship in 2021 and there is some uncertainty about how much global shipping will rise over the next year. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. \nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\n\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the 2019 Dice Tower Family Game of the year, Point Salad (2019, AEG); Truffle Shuffle (2020, AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2021 from Crafty Games).\nWhat's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome established and emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. In 2019, the CoLab brought you Calico, which had over 6,000 backers on Kickstarter, and our team is back together, with our new member, Randy Flynn on board!\nOur approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This publication of Cascadia is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's Meet the Cascadia Team!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Cascadia! You can check out her work here!\nDylan Mangini, our graphic designer makes amazing board game apparel as well. If you're looking for some sweet new threads, check out www.teebletop.com!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to people who have helped make Cascadia the amazing game that it is today!

We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our second crowdfunding campaign, we have the experience of a successful campaign under our belt. We have also done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful. We are Superbackers ourselves, proving our commitment to the amazing community on Kickstarter, and we have followed along on many other campaigns. In addition, the members of our CoLab have been involved with a number of successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

We take great pride in the quality of our games, since we know that a well-made game is one that will stay on your shelf and provide many hours of enjoyment without becoming dated and ending up as waste.\nReusability and recyclability\nAt Flatout Games, we strive to use reusable and recyclable materials whenever possible. This production of Cascadia uses cardboard and wooden components that not only look and feel great, but are easier to recycle. We also try to avoid the use of plastics in packaging and shipping materials in order to reduce our impact.\nSustainable materials\nFor the production of Cascadia we chose to go with simple materials (cardboard and wood) because they are relatively easy to source and they can be produced with very little waste byproduct. Avoiding using plastics that consume fossil fuels and focusing on renewable resources like forestry products helps us to reduce our impact.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe shipping and fulfillment of this project will be carried out by multiple regional fulfillment centers around the world to reduce the overall energy expended to get games to backers.

Through careful planning and placement, the aim is to make the most money from selling your buildings.\nThe city is populated by increasing numbers of people (wooden meeples), each with their own preferences. These hipsters, tourists, shoppers, and parents increase the value of any buildings they occupy, and they move from street to street as they are scored. You'll need to locate your buildings carefully and attract the right crowd to earn more than your opponents!\nLay tiles and influence people!\nSome of the building tiles found in Streets.\n\nYou can download the draft rules here. The final rules will look much nicer!\nStreets is really easy to teach! If one person knows the rules, you can open the box and be playing in less than 5 minutes. Here's the basics:\n1. On your turn, place a building into the city.\nAdd meeples according to the colour and number of icons at the bottom of the tile you played. You'll also add an Ownership Token in your player colour.\n2. When a Street is Enclosed, all buildings in it are sold for money.\nCalculate how much each building is worth based on the Valuation in the top right corner, adding $1 for every meeple.\n3. Meeples move to new buildings.\nThe player who enclosed the street moves the meeples on it to new buildings of matching colours on unenclosed streets. Meeples who can't move stand up and get FOMO (fear of missing out), and they'll move immediately to matching buildings when new ones are built.\n4. Earn the most money to win!\nThere are lots of opportunities to create scoring combos, and to profit from other players' buildings. The number of meeples in play increases as the game goes on, raising the stakes and the tension! Though the game is suitable for new gamers, these dynamic mechanics create a lot of depth that seasoned gamers will enjoy.\n The Business expansion makes use of the icons on the top left of every building tile. Each building has one or more Home, Shop, Restaurant, Recreation, or Wild icon on it.  \nBusiness tokens and some of the tiles that generate them.\nWhenever a street is scored, every player with a building in that street gets to take a business token matching the icon on one of their buildings. At the end of the game there's a $10 bonus for the player with the most tokens of each type, and $10 for every set of all four tokens.  \nA simple addition to the game, but a big change to the way you'll play! Included in every copy of the game are seven Consultant cards (70x120mm tarot size) which give each player a really powerful and unique special ability. Deal one Consultant card out at random to each player during setup and you're good to go! \nSix of the seven Consultants that come with the game.\nBoth of the expansions are optional, and we recommend playing without either of them the first time you play, or if you're playing with a group that prefers simpler games. The expansions add extra crunch to the decisions you'll make as you play!\nRahdo's reaction to playing with the expansions.\nA game of Streets in progress.\nStreets can be played by one player versus an AI opponent called The Grifter, using a simple set of rules and no extra components. You can find more information on this in the draft rulebook.\nYou can watch a full solo mode playthrough video on our YouTube channel.\n\nMore building tiles - they're the same in standard and deluxe editions.\nWe've taken great care to ensure that Streets offers excellent value for money right out of the box, and we've come up with a number of cosmetic and usability upgrades to both editions of the game that we can include even at the minimum funding goal. Rather than throw everything at you at once, we'll reveal these additions as the campaign goes on. Since we've already budgeted for them, they won't be tied to the overall funding level, but we will make you work for them :D\nNew artwork will be revealed below...\nThe more copies of the game we order from the factory, the cheaper they become. We can use those savings to add some cool new content for backers at no extra charge. The more backers who join us, the more extras we can include for everyone.\nIn short, more backers means more free stuff for everyone! The free promo pack is our way of saying thankyou to backers for supporting this campaign. After the campaign it will only be available direct from Sinister Fish Games at an appropriate price plus shipping.*\n* The deluxe edition and promo pack will be available in limited numbers from retailers who back this campaign, but it will not go into general distribution, and there will be no restocks.\nThere are two versions of Streets; standard and deluxe. They both contain exactly the same gameplay content, but the deluxe edition has some upgraded components.\nScreen printed wooden ownership tokens (same in deluxe and standard editions).\n\nDeluxe wooden money tokens.\nDeluxe meeples.\nDeluxe business tokens.\nThe creators of these videos were paid to showcase the rules and components of Streets. These are not reviews of the game.\nIf we reach our funding goal, all pledge information will be passed over to our partners at BackerKit after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Their pledge management system allows backers to pay for shipping, to confirm or update their shipping address, upgrade or downgrade their pledge, and add extra items.\nIt is necessary for every backer to confirm their details in the pledge manager in order to receive their rewards. We'll give clear instructions on how to do this when the time comes. It's quite simple, you'll just need to keep an eye on our updates after the campaign ends.\n We are making the previous game from Sinister Fish and Haakon Gaarder - the Golden Geek Award nominated Villagers - available as part of this campaign. You can pledge for it (and the Kickstarter Expansion Pack) alongside the standard or deluxe copy of Streets by selecting the relevant pledge level here on Kickstarter. Villagers will also be available as an add-on item in the pledge manager.\nVillagers was a nominee in the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game of 2019\nBackers in the United Kingdom will receive their copy of Villagers and the Kickstarter Expansion Pack in October / November 2020 as we have stock in our UK warehouse (aka Dave & Carly's garage). Shipping is free for this.\nBackers outside the UK will have their copy of Villagers and Expansion shipped at the same time as Streets, with shipping charged separately in the pledge manager. See below for shipping cost estimates.\nWe are not reprinting the Villagers playmat or Coin Chest at this time.\nWe will charge backers for shipping after the campaign ends, closer to the time we actually ship. We'll do this via BackerKit, our pledge manager.\nInternational shipping prices are currently volatile because of the pandemic, and there are surcharges applying to many destinations. We want to minimise the chance of the final price we pay being significantly different to the price we quote now. By doing this we'll be able to give backers the best possible shipping price. On top of that, we will subsidise shipping by \u00a33 (about $4 / \u20ac3.50) for every backer, and UK shipping will be free. Wherever practical, we will pay local taxes and import costs. See the table below for more information.\nTo help us offer the best prices to our backers, we will send rewards from various shipping hubs around the world. Everything is subject to change, but our current plan is this:\n Sinister Fish Games (that's us!) will ship to the UK.\n Meeple Logistics will ship to all EU countries, plus Iceland and Switzerland.\n Pick & Pack Logistics will ship free of tax and customs to Canada\n Grimfield Games will ship free of tax and customs to Norway.\n Flat River Group, our retail distributor, will ship to the USA.\n VFI Asia will ship everywhere else.\nWe are investigating a better option for Canada - the deluxe version exceeds the import tax limit, which we'd overlooked previously. \nDue to pandemic related restrictions, we cannot currently offer shipping to India. We hope the situation there improves soon.\nWe will deliver the game as soon as is practical for each region. Not everyone will receive their pledges at the same time. We will delay the retail release until pledges have been shipped, but we can't guarantee that everyone will have received their pledge before the game appears in stores. \nIf your reward is lost or returned to us we will send a one-time replacement free of charge. If your reward is returned to us due to you submitting an incorrect shipping address, we will ask you to cover the cost of reshipping it. Lost rewards (that are not returned to us) with incorrect shipping information cannot be reshipped or refunded. Before your reward is shipped you will be able to check that your address information is correct and to update it if necessary.\nStreets is available to play online right now via Tabletop Simulator, which is available on Steam. You can play solo, or with up to 4 other players. Just follow these links and subscribe so you can download the necessary files.\n1-2 players\n3-5 players\nSetup instructions and a link to the rulebook are provided.\nStreets is available to back at retail level by physical stores only. Retailer information can be found here.\nWe recognise the urgency of the climate crisis, and we want to try and minimise our environmental impact. We are planning to use FSC certified wood products in Streets, and we aim to partner with an established tree planting organisation to overcompensate for the greenhouse gases generated by the manufacture and transport of Streets. We will share more details later in the project.\nThe price of the game includes a small allowance for the increased cost of FSC wood.\nAll tree planting expenses will be borne by Sinister Fish Games.\n If you'd like to keep up with Sinister Fish, we can be found at the following:\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\nTwitch\nDiscord\nAnd specifically for Streets:\nStreets Facebook Group\nStreets on BoardGameGeek\nStreets on SinisterFish.com\nSinister Fish Games is a small family business with one full-time employee, one part-time, and one toddler. We will do our best to answer support requests during office hours (GMT) on weekdays. We can't guarantee an immediate response, but we answer every message and we will get to you.

As long as we remember that there's a real person behind every username, and treat each other with respect, then it's all good.\nStreets has been a labour of love for the following humans:\nHaakon Hoel Gaarder is the game designer, artist and graphic designer behind Streets and Villagers. He has a background as an animator, specialising in character design and infographics, using animation to communicate complex subjects in a fun and simple way. Haakon lives in Oslo Norway, and loves exploring large cities. This love of urban life inspired him to make Streets.\nHaakon has recently started using Instagram, where he shares behind the scenes content and bits of trivia about his work.\nDave is the owner of Sinister Fish Games, publisher of Streets and Villagers. He has had various careers, more recently in print & signmaking, graphic & web design, and making leather armour & props for film & cosplay. He has been running Sinister Fish full time since 2017. He lives in Lincoln, England, with his partner, their son, and one and a half cats. \n Carly plays an important role in the day-to-day running of Sinister Fish, including customer support, event organisation, planning, and office management. A keen negotiator, she once talked her way free-of-charge out of a Vodafone contract with 18 months left on it. She lives in Lincoln, England, with her partner, their son, and one and a half cats.\nFollow our progress on KickTraq!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a good working relationship with our Chinese manufacturer, Whatz Games, who we've been working with for several years.\n \nAs with any Kickstarter project, the usual risks apply.

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world. This project is EU, UK, CA, and AU friendly. This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address. Outside of these areas, we cannot guarantee friendly shipping.\n    ------ PLEASE NOTE: SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE PRICE ------\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager at the conclusion of this Kickstarter project based on pledge level and region.

Here's how you play!\nThe Thunderworks team has been working on this project for over three years. The scope is bigger and more ambitious than any project we've done in the past. It's a project born out of love for both narrative adventure games and the passion players have for the other games in the line. We are excited to bring such a big game to you from a small team.\nBut, printing a board game with a scope this large is expensive, and Thunderworks Games is a small company. Without the help of backers on Kickstarter, Roll Player Adventures simply will not exist.\nWe need your support to make this game a reality. The design is complete. The art is complete.

I've outlined some common areas of risk in boardgame projects and how I've done my best to address them.\n\n> Artwork: All the artwork for the game is complete, with the exception of any images added due to achieving stretch goals or any last minute tweaks before sending the final files off to the manufacturer.\n\n>Development: All twelve books of Roll Player Adventures are complete and have been extensively playtested. We are currently playtesting the full campaign with final art and most of its graphic design to make sure everything is just right before we send the game into final layout for manufacturing.\n\n> Component Quality: I've worked with and built a great relationship with one of the best game manufacturers around, Panda Game Manufacturing (www.pandagm.com). Their proven track record on games like Eclipse, Terra Mystica, Pandemic, Belfort, and Mice & Mystics, proves they make great games with a high standard to quality. They've printed all Thunderworks titles to date.\n\n> Delivery Timeline: Unexpected delays out of my control can always occur (i.e. component shortage, manufacturer issues, customs delays, etc...). For the production schedule of Roll Player Adventures, I've used conservative estimates to account for unknowns and bumps in the road.\n\n> Fulfillment: I have received multiple estimates and will be working with established fulfillment companies that have proven track records for delivering quickly and efficiently all over the world.\n\n> Eighth Project: Even though this is my eighth Kickstarter project, I have continued to spend endless hours researching Kickstarter as well as participating in many Kickstarters. I have done my best to foresee and minimize any obstacles or stumbling blocks.\n\nIn addition, in my life outside of this campaign, I have over a decade of project management experience on large-scale software projects. I will continue to leverage that experience and apply it to this project by anticipating issues and sidestepping hurdles that may arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Make your mark on the future of Ulos!\n- This and all other pledges will get you access to the pledge manager after the close of the campaign.\n- Shipping to be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager.

Evidence can be put towards individual success by investigating the three Chapters that make up the game's timeline, or towards a shared pool of Evidence dedicated to foiling the Final Plot itself and preventing the Syndicate from dominating New Dawn City for good. \nEvidence is filed into the Chapter for personal gain, or into the Final Plot to foil the Syndicate's plans as a group!\nEach turn, you'll hook into the mind of a criminal, then you'll gain Grip with every criminal you control. As your Grip increases with criminals, you'll gain access to their unique skills, and develop the stamina to extend your turn and accomplish more. \nA player hooks into the Smuggler, and gains enough Grip to activate its unique Skill!\nNext you'll put your hooked criminals into motion in the zones of New Dawn City. You can move criminals about, transport crucial items, activate the unique zone powers if the coast is clear, trigger powerful criminal skills if you have enough Grip, manipulate the unsuspecting local security forces, and engage in other activities designed to bring you ever closer to the heart of the Syndicate. \nThere are lots of possibilities... the game provides a deep toolkit for achieving your goals!\nYou'll need to put everything in place for the Syndicate's criminals to carry out their nefarious deeds. When everything has been arranged and a crime is committed, you'll earn Intel and Evidence, and unlock more serious crimes in that storyline. Your presence in the minds of the criminals lets you influence their approach... dangerous behaviour will earn you more Intel on the Syndicate's operations, but it also destroys Evidence and earns you more Dilemmas. \nSide Crimes are simpler but less rewarding. Story Crimes get more complex and more rewarding the further into a storyline the group pushes!\nDilemmas are tricky; they come with tempting rewards, but also dangerous Corruption. At the end of each Chapter you'll be forced to choose half of your dilemmas to keep as Permanent Corruption... the ones you keep could be richly rewarding, but the best rewards come with the most corruption! Losing control could drive you over to the Syndicate's side if you're not careful... and it's hard to know for sure if you are the most corrupt agent!  \nYou want big rewards but can you risk the corruption? That's the dilemma!\n At the end of the game, the least-corrupt player earns a bonus. The most-corrupt player has gone in too deep, and will suffer a massive penalty... if the plot was foiled! If enough of the needed Evidence has been filed, the plot is foiled and the In Too Deep player suffers the price of their corrupt ways. If the plot wasn't foiled however, that player reaps the benefits of their troubling tactics with no penalty at all. All players cash in their Dilemmas, and when the dust settles, the player with the most Intel wins the game! \nReady for more?

Hit the button below to be taken to the game's Workshop page. Please note that you will need to own a copy of Tabletop Simulator in order to download and play. \n_______________________________________________________________\nIn the world of Prisma Arena, every hero - like every player - is unique. We've worked hard to ensure that you'll be able to see yourself in the characters you can create, so before your first game of Prisma Arena, you will personalise your Hero\u2019s appearance. Using removable stickers, you'll have a variety of options open to you such as new faces, haristyles and much more. While all Heroes start out with the same ability, as you train in the Arena and rise through the ranks, you will unlock new uniforms and incredible Prisma Powers that you can mix and match to suit to your personal preference and playstyle. We can't wait to see who you bring to the table!\n_______________________________________________________________\nWe've worked with some of our favourite content creators to see what their thoughts are on Prisma Arena!  \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nAt Hub Games, we are determined to always offer the very best product from the start. We\u2019re also very aware that games are luxury items, so want to ensure the widest audience possible by offering our range at the best price possible. Everything you find inside the Prisma Arena box is the best that it can be, meaning that we\u2019ve got no need for Stretch Goals or Kickstarter Exclusives. You simply get a great game, manufactured to our exacting standards, earlier than anyone else, at a price that\u2019s lower than you\u2019d see in a store. This way everyone gets everything, and folks who miss out on the Kickstarter don\u2019t have to worry about getting less content in a game. We\u2019ve been working on Prisma Arena for over two years, so we want everyone to enjoy the full experience!\nSo, what do you get inside a copy of Prisma Arena? \n  _______________________________________________________________\nWe're keeping the Reward Levels as simple as possible for this campaign. If you want to pick up a copy of Prisma Arena, that's \u00a325 (approximately $30 USD / \u20ac28, or however much that converts to where you are in the world). If you want an additional copy, great! Each one costs the same amount - \u00a325. We'll then work out your shipping costs in the pledge manager when we're planning delivery. And if you're not all-in, no worries! Backing us at the \u00a31 level gives you access to all news and updates throughout the campaign, as well as the pledge manager later in the year.\nCertified Retailers will be able to pick up cases of Prisma Arena at a reduced rate. For more information on this, please see the Details for Retailers section below! \n_______________________________________________________________ \nWe are working alongside experienced shipping companies and have found pricing that we believe to be the most competitive around. Although you will not be charged for shipping during the Kickstarter for Prisma Arena, please be aware that the costs for shipping will be added the pledge manager after the campaign. The estimated costs are found below. If you require information on pricing for a specific location, please get in touch to ask!\n  ______________________________________________________________\nHub Games is determined to support Brick and Mortar stores by offering them the possibility of pledging for a retailer package. This includes a free demo copy of the game and an organised play kit for each case ordered, so you'll receive five copies for sale, one for demo, and a Launch Kit. The Launch Kit is a release celebration event, meant to not only provide a space for Kickstarter backers to enjoy their new game, but most importantly to introduce the game to new players who missed out on the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe kit will be available to both retailers who support the campaign and those who will purchase the game through traditional distribution networks.\nFor more information about the retail pledge, the launch kit and organised play events, please contact corina@wearehubgames.com \n_______________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPrisma Arena has been in development for over two years at the point of campaign launch, and has been tested by the widest variety of players available, from first-timers to experienced gamers.

Never have an itchy or irritated butthole again from improper cleaning with toilet paper.  \nYes there\u2019s other bidet attachements out there, but we spent hundreds of hours watering our butts to fine tune the angle, stream and pressure of the Narsehole for your tender areas.   \nIf Your Butt Could Talk -  \u201dImagine a life where im never irritated. You rarely see me, but you can feel me when I\u2019m upset.  Please start using water, it\u2019ll make me happy and when I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy.\u201d \n How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n\n Perfect for any occasion: You can activate the individual nozzles for the starfish or the clam, or both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. \nWhat is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :) \n How do I poop with the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done. \n What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\nDoes the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. That means if your power goes out you can still clean your butt! \nNEW - Two Handle Options!\n Spray Nirvana: The Narsehole has a spray stream with separate nozzles and pressure controls for both the starfish and the clam. Trust us, all sprays are not created equal, we spent hundreds of research hours watering our butts to fine tune the Narsehole\u2019s stream in order to take the best possible care of your tender areas! Wanna roll the dice and save five bucks on Amazon? You\u2019re risking getting either a small and pointy spray (ouchie!) or the super soaker that gets your entire bathing suit region wet (might as well just hop in the shower).\nPLAY\n\nNo More Wiping Yourself Raw!\nNo More Dingleberries!\nNo More Aggravating Your Hemorrhoids Before the DMB Concert!\n\nWould you use toilet paper if you pooped out your belly button?  No? then why is it good enough for your butt? \n Toilet paper is a 38 billion and 10 million tree a year industry in the U.S. Save money, the environment and your butt. \nDay of the Nareshole Shoot\nWe\u2019re four dudes that used water to clean our butts for the first time in our mid 30\u2019s. It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked. \nOur goal -  Is to red pill everyone on water over toilet paper and to make sure their first experience is with a spray that\u2019s gentle but firm, if they need it to be.  \nBelow is our estimate for standard shipping charges, with $5 \u2013 $20 decuted (Nareshole\u2019s covering percentage of shipping to keep the cost down) Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.\nCustoms, Duty, and VAT charges: In some cases, international backers outside of the USA will be required to pay additional customs, duty, and/or VAT charges. We cannot control this additional charge, and it will be the backers responsibility to cover once they receive the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backers customs office.\nQ&A\n1. How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n2. What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\n3. How do I use the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, go back to playing on your phone while moving your butt around a little bit to be thorough, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done.\n4. Is it sanitary for multiple people to use the same Narsehole? Yes. Narsehole is designed to be clean and hygienic with a self-cleaning, auto-retracting nozzle and full-length nozzle guard. i.e. it\u2019s a million times more sanitary then using toilet paper.\n5. What\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs.\n6. Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. This also makes it easier to install.\n7. What is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :)\n8. What\u2019s the difference between the Narsehole and the less expensive options on Amazon?  The cheaper ones have one nozzle (not worth your time) and 90% of dual nozzles are $70-$150.  We tested all the (direct from China) Amazon models and the truth is, you get what you pay for \u2014 if you\u2019re used to boxed wine, you\u2019ll still think it\u2019s good \u2014 but the Narsehole is for people who like that fine wine! We\u2019re not judging, but ask yourself, which person are you?\nDesign/Prototype - Our main focus on design was finding the perfect spray for both the starfish and clam.  Testing hundreds of different angles and hole patterns, we finally found the perfect spray and are excited to bring it to a butt near you coming this July:)!!\nInitial Design Scetch\nDesign Process & Progression of Nozzles\nPrototyping Nozzles for Perfect Spray", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe supplier has been established, vetted, and final samples have been tested and approved.

I picked the ones that resonated with me. I'm so glad the There is no planet B pin was offered, I've been watching it for a long while but never got to buy it. The Sashimi one is so small and cute!\"\n\"The bag is huge. Loved the pockets. I'm kind of hesitating using it for groceries ... it looks good this way, I really don't want to stain it.\"\n\"The lanyard feels nice. I hope I get the opportunity to use it.\"\n\"I just received my pins and bag and all I can say is WOW! The pins are just gorgeous! I'm so happy with them. I'll be proud to display them in my collection. The pin is stunning. And I am so, so happy I decided to get the tote bag !!! It's incredible! Nice, heavy canvas, zips and pockets and it's HUGE! It looks extremely well made and will last for years and years. Thank you so much for such beautiful items. I'll be backing any of your future Kickstarter campaigns, that's for sure!\"\n\"Such an amazing artist!Was able to pick them up cause I was local. They look even better in person. Can't wait to display them in my collection it's just perfect!\"\n\"The tote is such good quality can't wait to use it either!\" \n Timings \nPin & tote manufacturing at this rate will be complete by end of June for a Mid July arrival to me.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's always a risk in delays when manufacturing as there is a lot of hand work. Things that could go wrong include: too many seconds quality pins, slow shipment, manufacturer errors, etc. However, I've worked with my manufacturer for years of designs and they are very prompt and produce great pins! I don't see many things happening that would delay the production for too long and if there are any errors they have always promptly remedied with a fixed batch.\n\nThere may be minor differences in the actual pin vs what you see in my mockups due to hand enamel filled precision, color matching. These should just be small changes though and the pins will be close to what you see here as much as possible!\n\nPackages may get lost without the right address, so please double check your address to be sure that it's correct! If packages do not arrive over 2 weeks past estimation, I will ensure I correctly make a solution to get the product to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 20 or more", "title": "\u2661 ANY 1 PIN", "descp": "\u2764 choose (1) pin from the unlocked pin collection or Add-Ons.

It's Free, featuring over 20 spells, and the entire Day 1 from the final game! Available for Windows and Mac. \nA young girl named Vasilisa, destined to become a witch, decides to throw her fate away and marry her beloved - but that dream is shattered when her betrothed dies under mysterious circumstances. \nAching for her lost love, Vasilisa seeks out Black Book - a demonic artifact, said to be powerful enough to grant any wish to the one who uncovers all 7 of its seals.\nStep into the shoes of a devil-fighting sorceress, and travel the province of Cherdyn to unseal the Black Book - and solve the plights of people in need.\nThe game takes place in a setting unlike any other - a 19th century countryside, where Slavic myth neighbors reality.\nFantastical creatures, elemental spirits and demons exist alongside ordinary folk. Some of them are evil, some are not. Yet, only a select few are able to perceive, let alone communicate with the otherworldly beings. \nVodyanoy - a male water spirit\nBlack Book features a wide variety of mythological creatures: from some that you may recognize, like Chorts and Drowners - to other, more obscure ones.\nWe took extra effort to achieve authenticity in our portrayal of these creatures - using old texts of classical myths, illustrations from folk tale books, and every other source we could find as reference. \nLeft: Vasilisa the Beautiful, 1899 by Ivan Bilibin\nBlack Book is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the world of Northern Slavic mythology, shaped by its history and tradition. The game was developed by the people who grew up with these folk tales, and consulted with historians and anthropologists to make sure the game\u2019s narrative accurately represents the beliefs of their ancestors.\nEvery Chapter's main goal is for Vasilisa to unlock a Seal of the Black Book - and to do so, she will have to challenge the mysteries of the otherworld.\nBattle demons and other mythological beings, help ordinary townsfolk with their troubles, and solve the mystery of the all-powerful Black Book! \nBattle otherworldly forces using a unique card-based combat system. Each turn, Vasilisa has to compose a spell by putting together multiple cards - each with their own special effect. \nSome cards work better together - so be sure to create a perfect combo for maximum damage!\nThroughout the game, you'll always be adding new cards to your arsenal. There are multiple ways to obtain new cards - from buying them at the shop and getting them as rewards for quest completion, to getting them as drops from enemy encounters.\nCollect different cards and build decks that fit specific situations! \nOn her journey, Vasilisa will meet some people (and not just people), who wish to aid her in her cause - each with their unique backstory and ability, that will definitely be helpful in battle. \nTo grow stronger, Vasilisa sometimes relies on the aid of Demons, whom she sends out to do her bidding. Recruit demons, and pick out ones with the right abilities to get the job done properly.      \nIn Black Book, we do our best to emphasize the dark atmosphere of mythological stories with the help of music and sound effects. In the game we combine electronic music and folk musical instruments. We studied authentic recordings of folk songs - some tunes were recorded hundreds of years ago, and will now be reborn in our game.\nMikhail Shvachko is the composer of the game, breathing life into the world of Black Book with his music. Previously, he did the music for our previous game, The Mooseman - which can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/mikhail-shvachko/sets/themoosemanost\nIf you want to get a taste of what to expect when it comes to the unique sound of Black Book, you can find some of his latest work here: \nAside from Mikhail's work, in Black Book you'll hear live choral music, performed by the student choir of the Perm Regional College of Arts and Culture.\nIn Black Book, you'll unlock new songs as you explore additional locations and do side quests. You will be able to listen to them in a special section in the game menu.\nThanks to reaching the first stretch goal we\u2019ll be doing an english voice over for Black Book \u2014 this was made possible through the support of each backer! \nHere\u2019s the list of voice-over actors we confirmed: \n Sarah Anne Williams as Vasilisa (Jinx \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, Chihaya Mifune \u201cPersona 5\u201d)\n Kyle Hebert as Egor (Ryu \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d, Kamina \u201cGurren Lagann\u201d)\n Daman Mills as Nikolai (Frieza \u201cDragon Ball Super\u201d, Kai \u201cBeastars\u201d) \n Ben Diskin as Proshka (Mega Man \u201cMega Man 11\u201d, Aida \u201cBeastars\u201d)\nIf you feel like helping us grow the community around Black Book, we\u2019ll be happy to reveal some content as milestones are reached. Join us on Discord to enjoy content reveals!\nBlack Book supporters, who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers, will see themselves in the game - or help us design unique in-game content!\nThroughout the world of Black Book, multiple gravestones will be scattered. These are not your regular gravestones - these are a token of our eternal gratitude, in remembrance of those who pitched in to make our dream game a reality!\nEveryone's name from Adept pledge (or limited Backer Relief Plus) and forward will be immortalized in the game in those gravestones, so don't miss out on the exclusive chance to find yourself among the beautiful backdrops of Cherdyn!\nOne of the core features of the game that we're really proud of is the unique visual style of the Black Book. That includes every visual aspect: the locations, character and enemy models and animation, and last, but not least - the character portraits!\nIncluded in the Occultist pledge, you'll get the chance to see your own appearance, drawn in Black Book's artstyle, in the game itself! The development team will contact you and ask for a photo, which the artist will use to commission a portrait (which is also available on its own in the Herald pledge) - and then we'll pick out a place to include it in the world of the game!\nThe entire Black Book's combat system revolves around cards. Each card has a unique property - and if combined with others in the right way, can deal massive damage to the unholy creatures that roam the land. With the Hexer pledge, you'll get to design the look, name and in-game properties of a combat card that Vasilisa will use in her demonic encounters. Still, remember - setting and game balance restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over cards included in the final game. \nThroughout her journey, Vasilisa will find herself in many uncommon situations - from solving domestic disputes to confronting demonic creatures, who are known to terrorize human folk. Black Book will be filled with lots of unique in-game events - and with the Sorcerer pledge, we'll include your own scenario in the game as well!\nLater on in the development cycle we will contact you, and ask you to submit a short scenario - which we will then discuss and edit with you, and include it in the main game. But please keep in mind that setting restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over the events included in the game.\nWant to leave a bigger impact on the events transpiring in Black Book? Then the Warlock pledge is the way to go!\nA side-quest consists of several in-game events, usually ranging from two to three - and tell a bigger, more developed story. As with the previous reward, we'll contact you later on, and after edits and approval from the development team, we will include an entire side-quest of your making in the final product! Be warned, setting restrictions still apply, and the development team still has the final say over in-game content of this calibre.    \nAfter finishing our latest project, The Mooseman, we\u2019ve wanted to return to the idea of making a game based on Slavic mythos - but this time, something much bigger in scale.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Black Book for quite some time. During that time, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot - from refining the game\u2019s visual style and character design, to writing the story and developing the proper combat system.. The result of our work so far can be seen in the demo - but there\u2019s still a lot left to be done until the game is ready for release.\nWith the extra budget acquired from Kickstarter backers, we aim to add many new features to the game: some of them planned, but scrapped due to time and money constraints, and others completely new.\nAside from gathering the funding required for development, crowdfunding would allow us to directly engage with the gamers all across the world - and, with their help and feedback, make The Black Book the best game it could be.\nWe're aware that the current gaming landscape is about to undergo major changes. With that in mind, we want to make sure that Black Book will be available on PC, as well as current and future consoles - so that all of our audience gets to enjoy the game, no matter what their main gaming destination is.\nWe intend on supporting all current generation platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch. \nOne of Black Book's core features is its rich, text-based narrative - and we believe that we owe it to the players to make sure this narrative is to you in full. We are already working with a professional editor, making sure that the English version of the game meets the high standards that our audience has. And currently, we expect the game to be available in the following languages upon release:\nMorteshka - The Developer\nOur projects are mythology and ethnic-based with the narrative and worlds supported by historical facts and folklore. Our first project, The Mooseman, was released in 2017 on Steam, and in 2018 on AppStore, Google Play, and modern consoles.\nThe name of the studio comes from wordplay of \"Mort\", which is French for \"dead\" and Komi for \"a man\", and \"Matryoshka\", the famous Russian doll.\nHypeTrain Digital - The Publisher\nBlack Book is being published by HypeTrain Digital, an indie game publisher for PC and consoles. They provide initial funding for developing the game and porting it to consoles and helping us with the Kickstarter campaign.\nHypeTrain Digital work side by side with independent teams to successfully ship their masterpieces to a worldwide audience. Their titles include: The Wild Eight, Stoneshard, DESOLATE, Police Stories, 12 is Better Than 6.\n-\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mooseman was our first project as a team - and during its development, we learned a lot about what it takes to make a game from start to finish. While we are confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, Black Book is a project of a bigger scale, compared to Mooseman - and so, there is a chance that the release date would be changed further down the line. \n\nHowever, as we've said before \u2014 making Black Book as great as it can be is our priority number one. Throughout development, we will keep you informed about all updates and issues. \n\nWe thank you for your faith and support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["78 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Reader", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["2,173 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Wanderer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["574 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Loyalist", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["514 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["223 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Adept", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits -

Instead of playing as only 1 civilization in 3 hours, each player could now play as 3 civilizations in 30 minutes!\nWith the help of the unique gaming mechanism, the set-up for every game is greatly different, providing a high replay-ability to players. During the game, players will rise civilization to collect resources, research technologies, build wonders, and prepare for war. Eventually, every civilization may become less powerful as the population may drop in different ways, or simply because the era is changing. (Not all civilization can adapt to a new era, as we know it from history.) It will be time for you to raise another kingdom! The new kingdom can inherit the advantages of the former civilization to continue the legend in the game. As the rise and fall of 3 empires, a unique set of the civilizations of yours will finally arise! \nPLAY\n\nAt the beginning of a game, 8 action cards are shuffled to form a time track in random order, then place the permanent action card at the upper left of the time track.\nIn each player turn, the player take actions by assigning worker tokens to the action slots. Only the 3 actions on the permanent action card AND the 3 actions right under the permanent action card are available to choose.\nWhen all players have finished their turn, the current round ends. Move the permanent action card to the right by 1 card slot when a round ends. As a result, 1 action card of the previous round will become unavailable, and 1 new action card will be available for the next round, creating a new era!\nBesides taking actions to develop empire, each player could rise civilization card to gain more powerful abilities and reset population(number of workers). Civilization cards you own are stacked to show your current civilization with its main ability, and the legacy ability of your previous civilizations.\nRising new civilization is very powerful, but the number of civil. card each player could own is limited to 3. So the timing of \"Rise and Fall\" is a critical decision to make.\nAfter 6 rounds, whoever has the most points wins! \nFor detail rules, please check out the following links:\nDownload / Game Trial\nRule Book v1.5 (English) PDF\nRegola v1.5 (Italian) PDF\n Regel v1.5 (German) PDF \n R\u00e8gle v1.5 (French) PDF \nTry it free on Tabletopia ! \nNote: All the above rule books are not the printed version. \n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

In Tramways (required to play these two expansions), the aim of the game is to finish the game with the most happiness.\nIn Tramways: The Moon and Tramways: Mars, you will first build the board by arranging a number of modules (depending on the number of players).\n  In these two expansions, the outer edges are linked by Roman numerals. As you would expect on a planetary map, you can build off one edge of the board and continue on the other side!\n You will also play these two expansions with a new special development card.\nCards with two icons in ONE slot\n The Tramways Dystopian box can fit all other expansions already released in 2017&2018...\nIn addition to the build-around-the-board mechanism, you will need to manage night & day.\n  During each turn, one of the modules are found in the night and no more deliveries can be made, making all buildings \"black\". On the next turn, the night moves on and it is the next modular board that sinks into the night. All these changes will need to be taken into account as you plan your actions.\nIn this expansion, the Martians become a new type of passengers. The green discs of the Tramways base game are used as Martians and you will need to move them as many times as possible.\nHowever, Martians will only travel to buildings already containing a Martian.\nIn order to move a Martian, you must play a magnetic strip, as usual, but you must also discard a rail worker.\nThe network will also have to stay connected and you will have to start the game by building from one of your parcels. \nYou can find the English rules HERE.\nTRAMWAYS is a game for 2\u20135 players, lasting about 30 minutes per player. It is set in the same world as Small City, also published by Alban Viard in 2015. Fans of this universe will recognize the city theme and challenging yet intellectually rewarding mechanisms.\nTRAMWAYS is a pure pick-up-and-deliver game \u2014 OK, with a twist of card management, but no randomness \u2014 in which players are trying to build their networks into a full-blown transit map. \nIf you want to know more about the original campaign click HERE \nThe goal of the game is to have the most Happiness points at the end of the game. \nYou earn Happiness points by moving passengers, building new railways, and constructing new buildings. You take on the role of investors in the early 1920s who are trying to develop the most efficient rail network. You collect tickets (cards) throughout the game and use symbols on them to take actions.\nThe more efficiently you use your cards, the more you can do with them, but the more you must increase your stress level, as well. Stress is tracked on your personal board, and counts as negative Happiness points at the end of the game. \nYou can add to your pledge any add-ons you like, just add the total to your pledge. I will send you the survey after the campaign for confirmation. There will be no pledge manager later, you need to increase your pledge by the amount.\nExample: One copy of Tramways: The dystopian Expansions + One copy of Tramways Engineer's Workbook = $24 + $25 + $5 (SC) = $54 (no additional SC)\nWe'd love for you to try Tramways before you back the campaign! The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\nI have designed and developed several boardgames during the last 9 years such as Tramways, Small City, CliniC, Card City XL, Town Center and many expansions for these games. \nFor this project, I have worked with 2 awesome graphic designers\nSampo Siki\u00f6 is the graphic designer of Eclipse and Tramways. I like working with S because he is a genius to sump up complexe ideas with one minimalistic icon. \nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. He has a great renown as a solo board game designer.\nMany of his games have already been published: Pulp Detective, Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden,  IUNU and They Who Were 8\nBecause you are helping me finance my project, I will help you finance your shipping: I will pay part of the cost, so you only have to pay $5 for shipping a game of this size. It is the least I can do. \nAlso there won't be additional shipping costs for any adds on you will purchase during the campaign !\nLike our past campaigns for games such as Tramways, the Tramways expansions, Card City XL, and the Tramways Engineer's Workbook, we have respected the delivery time, and in some case, boxes were even delivered earlier than expected (depending on how complex production of the game has been).\nFor example, for the Card City XL campaign or Pulp Detective campaign, thanks to very rigorous management of the files, and great contacts at the manufacturers, we managed to deliver the game 2 months early! \nThanks to Ludicreations for their help during the campaign.\nFollow my projects on Twitter : https://twitter.com/AlbanVIARD?lang=en \nBecome a fan on BoardGameGeek : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233149/pulp-detective ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAVStudioGames has already put a substantial amount of money into the initial illustration and graphic design. \nWe now need your help to traverse the final route: Producing the game.

I'm a photographer, artist, pin maker, and this is the third Kickstarter i've launched. I've worked as a freelance photographer, lived abroad in England,  traveled around Europe photographing different countries, I have a full time job at a rad tech startup, I own a pin company, I have both a bachelors and a masters degree, and my baking skills are Great British Bake Off level. All of that sounds really great on paper, but what that paper doesn't tell you, is that I struggled through hours and hours of work, and frustration, to accomplish those things...i've got ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. First and foremost, ADHD is my main squeeze, anxiety and depression are a result of living with ADHD.\nAs is common with girls and women, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until later in life. When a psychiatrist first said \"My professional opinion is that you have ADHD\", I just didn't believe her. I was a good kid, did marching band for 8 years, I did really well in school, and I was at the top of my class during my undergrad \u2013 surely she was mistaken. \nI researched the f*ck out of ADHD. The more I read, the more I realized that I carried the same misconceptions and ideologies that the general population does. I thought ADHD meant that you had trouble concentrating or sitting still. What I learned is that everything about ADHD is so complex, that it borders on being incomprehensible at times. Even the term Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is misleading and incorrect in describing what it is. The symptoms, the brain chemistry, the cognition, the neurological and genetic theories, are so far beyond \"not being able to pay attention\".  Every time I did research, and read about other people's stories, it was like someone was telling a story from my life. \nI studied film and media theory for my undergraduate degree, so for my master's degree I chose the Film, Photography, and Media studies program at Leeds University in England. One of the best things about studying media, is that it is so pervasive, that you can study pretty much any topic. The concentration of my master's degree was studying the representation of people with mental illnesses, and the associated stigma, through media, from the 19th century to the present (talk about getting really niche. I studied everything, from how people with mental illness were represented, to associated stigmas and their detrimental effects to all of society, and even what happens in the brain of a person with a mental illness, when they consume media. This resulted in a 42 page thesis and a photo essay that took a look into the small and intricate cues of my \"disorder\". Getting a post-graduate degree with ADHD was arduous, but at that time, I did it without stimulant drugs like adderall, and I graduated with honors. \nWorking on that graduate photo series.\nOne of my dreams in life is to give a TED talk on ADHD, breaking down how the ADHD brain works, and what life is like living in a world where your brain works differently. I would gladly sit here and debunk whatever misconceptions are out there, but then we'd be here for years. This is just my story, but the whole campaign isn't just focused around ADHD. Needless to say, mental illness, mental health, and stigma are topics that are very near and dear to my heart. I have wanted to create this project for a very, very long time.\nThe cover image of the photo series for my graduate thesis.\n\nWhile you're perusing through the project, please keep in mind the following:\nYou'll find that the first 9 pins of this project focus only on ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I am aware that they are not the only mental illnesses that exist in this world. In fact, there are a multitude of different illnesses, disorders, and conditions. Mental health is unique to everyone, so I can only speak from my own experiences. While I would love to branch out and make pins for other illnesses, so that everyone feels heard and represented, I don't feel like I can interpret an illness that I have not experienced or lived through. I don't feel that I have that authority. \nWhile these pins are based off of my experiences, my hope is that maybe you'll find a pin that you can also relate to. If any of these pins resonate with you, remember that you're not alone, because I, as well as millions of other people, have gone through the same struggle. We may experience our illnesses in our own unique ways, but there are some common stigmas and experiences that we have all had to face. I also understand that some people may disagree with what I have to say, and that's totally cool, no one is forcing you to pledge to the campaign. \nWhy did I title this campaign \"Own your Stigma\"? \u2013 Also a long story.\nWhen I was first diagnosed with three mental illnesses, I felt guilty, selfish, like I was a burden. I didn't want to believe it to be true about myself. I went to therapy, tried some medications, and kept it all on the down low. Then over the course of 6 years, in my early adulthood, I went through experiences that were traumatic for me. Soon after that it just kind of clicked for me. I was sitting in my room and out loud to myself I just said \"This is so f*cking dumb. I didn't choose this, my mental health problems are not my fault. Why have I allowed other people to dictate how I feel about my own life?\" It may have just been something I gained from age, or from some empowering sociology classes in college, but my best guess is that I came face to face with one of my deepest fears. Ever since then I have been 100% percent honest and open about my mental health, and the fact that I take medication and go to therapy. I realized that if you can just be a genuine person, and communicate honestly and openly to others, you'll learn that there are so many other people fighting the same fight, that have the same fears that you do.\nWhen someone stigmatizes you, for whatever reason, they're exerting power over you. This doesn't mean that they're always doing it maliciously, sometimes it's out of sheer ignorance or lack of knowledge. When I was younger, if someone called you a slut, it was an insult. If someone were to call me that today, i'd probably find it funny and laugh. It's a good example of a word that carried a stigma, and instead of fearing that stigma, overtime, women just took ownership of the word. We started speaking out about slut shaming, and about how women should be able to be open about their sexuality. Women took ownership of that label, and once we owned it, we took the power back. \nIf someone tells me i'm being over emotional, I say \"yeah? so what. What's wrong with showing emotion?\" People don't know how to respond to that because then they have to admit, out loud, the unspoken rule that we always have to keep our emotions in check. A really sh*tty ex once called me crazy and erratic when I became emotional and anxious, from discovering his unfaithful activities and compulsive lying. Needless to say, that relationship did not last, and it has been over for some time. When we first got together, I had failed to see the red flag when he told me \"his ex had depression and emotional problems, and that she was crazy\". Recently, we had contact where we got on the topic of our relationship. He told me that he couldn't be calm and faithful when someone, (meaning me) was so volatile. Ironically, I had never even raised my voice at him, until I found out what he was doing behind my back. Let me interpret what he was really saying, \"I was unfaithful, and I didn't like your emotional and behavioral response to that, so that justifies my unfaithfulness.\" He tried to stigmatize my ADHD by saying I was erratic. He used my ADHD and anxiety as a scapegoat so he couldn't be held responsible for the pain he had caused me. At that time in our relationship, I had responded with a completely unapologetic emotional response. Did I take the high road, probably not. I said some terrible things out of anger, and did a few things out of pettiness. A good amount of time has passed since then, but from our last encounter a few months back, it's clear he hasn't changed. Many people have asked why I stayed so long. He had his own mental health issues, addictions, and vices, and for the longest time I was patient, forgiving, and I made every attempt to be understanding and to not stigmatize his issues...but I was not met with the same compassion. Indeed this is a long story of an ex, that involved so many more factors, but the importance here, is that this was the most traumatic time that anyone had ever used a mental health stigma to manipulate me, shame me, and take away my power. For a long time I was angry that I let someone do that to me, I felt weak, like I wasn't the strong, independent woman I wanted to be, but it was the most pivotal moment in my life. It was the moment I realized that if I just took ownership, than my ex, or anyone else, could never have that power over me again. I owned the stigma he tried to place on me, I took the power back, and I became a stronger, more empathetic, and caring person. \nWhen this Kickstarter meets its base goal, the first three brain pins will be unlocked. All pins after that will be unlocked when they hit their \"funds raised goal\". The pins will first be sold at an early bird price of $8 per pin, however, there are a limited quantity of early bird spots. When the early bird spots are gone, each pin will sell for $10 each, unless noted elsewhere. This campaign involves 20+ pin designs. More pins will be uncovered as our funding increases. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted elsewhere.\n*Please Read \nThe Once Daily pin is the first time we are experimenting with new materials. The left side of the pill will be filled, by hand, with a special epoxy. This is so we can create the look of a pill with one colored half of the capsule, and the other side clear. We've ordered a test batch of these pins from the manufacturer, because I personally will be filling each pin with the epoxy. If the test does not work, and we realize this was a bust, we'll still produce these pins. The only change is that the clear part you see on the left will be filled with stained glass enamel. Stained glass enamel is not clear, but it does create a unique look.\n The freebie pin is only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this. \n*Please Read \nThe Mosaic Heart is a pin that will contain stained glass enamel. The white part you see is regular white enamel, but the colored sections will be stained glass enamel. This process means that all the colored spots will be cut outs, that are then filled with an epoxy/enamel mixture. This produces an opaque look, somewhat like, well stained glass. If you hold it up to the light, the colored parts will show some light. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice. The most important thing to note here is that this process can be expensive. If you choose this pin as one of the designs for your pledge level, it will be the only time you'll be able to get it at that price. After this campaign ends, this pin will retail for somewhere between $12-$15. If you've never seen stained glass enamel, google it, and you should find some examples. \n *Please Read \nThe rainbow pins you see above are what's called anodized, or rainbow, metal. The metal plating is a rainbow color that looks really nice in the light. Pins made with anodized metal will always be soft enamel. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted otherwise. Below is photo of our logo pin so you can see what this metal looks like. \n *Please Read \nThe Spectrum pin will contain stained glass enamel. The white opaque part you see, inside the prism, will be a milky opaque stained glass enamel. If you hold it up to the light, some light should shine through the stained glass part. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice.\n I'm more than happy to create more label pins. I like fonts.\nIf there is a label pin you'd like to request, please message me directly. Please message me with the mental illness, condition, or disorder, and how you think it should appear as a label. For example, if you have Bipolar Disorder, should the pin read Bipolar Disorder, or just Bipolar. Please also keep in mind that I will only create labels for another three conditions, because if I made one for every condition, we'd be here all damn day. Please don't message me with a physical illness or condition, for now  i'm only making these for mental illnesses recognized in the DSM-V. (i.e. Autism, Bipolar, PTSD, OCD, etc). I know there are some people who have qualms about \"labeling\". This pin isn't saying that your illness is all you are. I wear my ADHD related pins in hope that if someone wants to ask, i'm more than happy to answer any questions... and the next time my partner looks at my disorganized room with a smirk, i'm going to smile and point to this pin. Even though i'm only making another three label pins, this doesn't mean there that others won't appear in the future. Another note: It might seem that this stretch requires a much larger sum of funds raised to unlock. This is because even though these pins are small, they call for three seperate mold fees. Mold fees are paid only once, but they impact the cost when producing a new pin.   \nFreebie pins are only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this. \n*Due to the nature of this pin and it's complexity, it's subject to change. We'll notify you of any changes made to this pin before your survey lockdown.\n\nThe other day I did a rough estimate of how many pins we\u2019ll be manufacturing...and it was over 20K. That\u2019s alot of pins which means alot of backing cards. Now I know there are some of you out there who collect backing cards, some of you just throw them away, and some of you even graciously offered to not have one, but I like backing cards. I like designing backing cards, I like quality cards, and even before I launched this campaign, I was designing the backing cards for it in my head. I wanted to try something new, and having a campaign with such a high volume of pins, meant that this was the time to try it. So here\u2019s how the backing cards will work. We\u2019ll be using 4\u201dX6\u201d, 22pt stock, postcards, and each card will hold 4-6 pins depending on size. If you purchase one 1-2 pins, you\u2019ll receive your pins on a typical square backing card. If you purchase say 7 pins, then you might get 5 of them on a postcard and two on regular sized backing card. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to choose whether you receive postcards or individual backing cards, and you won\u2019t be able to specify which pins go with which cards. While buying more than 20K regular backing cards is possible, it would mean we would have to cut the quality. I won\u2019t do that for this campaign because I have a special idea in mind. Let\u2019s say that you purchased 5 pins, so you\u2019ll receive them all on a postcard, but you\u2019re really adamant about a single, regular sized, backing card, because maybe you want to give one pin as a gift. In this case you\u2019ll be able to purchase a single backing card in the add-ons section for 25 cents a piece. (also take note that freebie pins come in the regular factory bag and not on a backing card)\nAfter this Kickstarter campaign has ended, Kickstarter will collect the funds for your pledge level. If your payment is declined, Kickstarter allows you 7 days to \"fix\" your pledge. If you miss the 7 days, you will still have the opportunity to reinstate your pledge through your BackerKit survey. After these 7 days have passed, we will send you a survey from a pledge manager called BackerKit. This survey will first ask pledge level questions, this is where you designate which designs you want. Once you've finished your pledge questions, the designs you've chosen are automatically added to your item list. After pledge questions, you'll go through an add-ons section (sort of like an exit through gift shop situation) Add-ons are optional, and do not affect the items from your pledge level. We haven't posted pictures yet, but here are some things you can expect to find in the Add-Ons section.\n- Stickers (both sticker packs, and individual stickers)\n- Locking backs\n- Pins from previous campaigns or what we have in stock at that time\n- Any extra pins you might want from this campaign\nKeep checking back, as i'll soon add the sticker design mockups. \nStickers\nBelow are the first four stickers for the add-ons section. There are more to come, and not all are just sticker versions of the pins. The stickers range in size from roughly 2\" - 5\". \n\nIt's hard to show what a holographic overlay looks like on a sticker mockup. It's essentially and overlay that reflects back a full spectrum of rainbow colors when you move it around in the light. Below are holographic stickers that Snarky Co. has made in the past. \nWhat is an Add-On Stretch Goal? \nThe reason we use a pledge manager like BackerKit, is because it allows us to create more comprehensive surveys, and streamline our shipping process. BackerKit has a feature called an Add-On Stretch Goal. For my first campaign, I had an idea for a t-shirt design, but I didn't know if anyone would actually want to buy it. So I contacted some screen printing companies, priced out t-shirts, and then added it to the add-ons section of the survey. Three people ordered it. Whenever you manufacture a product, there's a minimum order quantity. The minimum quantity is usually the product at is highest price. To have t-shirts printed, I needed 50 people to order them, and that didn't happen. I ended up contacting those three people and letting know that I had removed the t-shirt from their order, and that they wouldn't be charged for it. \nThe add-on stretch goal will show up in the add-on sections, and it'll have a banner that says something like \"Hey we need 50 people to make this happen\". As people add this item to their carts you can see whether this product is going to be made or not. When you complete your survey, if you add any extra items, you'll be prompted for your card details. You won't be charged when you complete your survey. You'll be charged at the lockdown date, and we'll notify you when that date is. If we don't meet the minimum quantity for an add-on stretch goal you may have ordered, then it is removed from your order, and you are not charged for it. This allows us to put out other products like patches, t-shirts, and key chains, to see if people actually respond to them. It's essentially a fail-safe, if we like a t-shirt design, but then find out no one else does, we aren't stuck manufacturing 50 t-shirts because only one person ordered it. \nWe are still talking to manufacturers to work out pricing on all these items, so we don't have a price estimate at the moment. What we do know, is that we are offering add-on stretch goal items at a discounted price to Kickstarter backers only. If you pre-order these items after the campaign, you'll order them at full price. \nPatch\nBelow is a somewhat blurry photo of a chenille patch. The red and light green are the chenille, which is a soft fuzzy material. The seeds and stem are done in embroidery, and the black outline is felt. Chenille patches are often what you see on varsity letterman jackets. \n T-Shirts\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign you can pledge a monetary amount in any of the pledge levels. Your money won't be withdrawn from your payment method until the end of the campaign. Funds will only be collected if we meet our goal. \nAfter the campaign ends, your funds will be drawn from Kickstarter, and then you will be sent a survey to pick out your rewards and add your shipping info. We will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to send out surveys. There will also be an add-ons section to your survey, where you can add on extra items, such as sticker packs, locking metal backs, or additional pins. Payment details will be collected in your survey to pay for any last minute added items. \nOnce the funds have been released from Kickstarter I can start production!\nPlease Note: \nOnce orders have been locked down we have a no refund or return policy. After orders are locked and funds are secured, production orders will be placed and paid for. The amount of funds determines the quantities that we need to fulfill this campaign. We will only offer refunds for extenuating circumstances or if you rewards were damaged in transit.  \nShipping for your pledge level will be collected on Kickstarter during the campaign. This project is only shipping to the following countries: USA, Canada, The United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland. \nIf there is another country you'd like us to consider shipping to, please contact us directly. We will attempt to see if we can arrange to ship to your country. Shipping fees for other countries have not yet been determined, but when you contact us we will give you an estimate. \nPledge Level Shipping is a fixed rate that is based off of the amount of pins in your pledge level. Keep in mind some pledge levels have as little as one pin, and some pledge levels have as many as 20. We will be using the U.S. postal service for shipping. \nUnited States: $4 - $10\nCanada: $11 - $25\nUnited Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland: $15 - $25\nIf you choose to purchase extra items in the add-ons section of your survey there may be added shipping fees. Any extra shipping fees are based on the weight of your package, for example, adding a sticker pack has no additional shipping fee, but adding another four pins may have a shipping fee. \nWhen shipping internationally we will make every effort to properly fill out customs forms. We will abide by your countries customs and shipping laws, which means we will denote the package value as the cost of your order, and mark this as merchandise. Please do not ask us to change the value of your package, or mark it as a gift. We are not responsible if your country holds your package and requires extra payment to release it. \nBelow you can find the estimated timeline for this project, as well as the funds breakdown. \nMarch \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign Begins\nApril \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign Ends and funds are collected\nApril \u2013 Surveys are sent out\nApril/May \u2013 The pre-order store is open\nMay \u2013 Orders are locked down and sent to the manufacturer\nMay/June - Pins are in production\nJuly \u2013 Shipping of rewards begins (the reason rewards will not ship until June or July is because it takes several weeks to manufacture the pins, package orders, and send them out) If all materials are produced earlier than the estimated shipping start date we will of course begin to ship in asap.\nKeep in mind that July feels like a long ways off, but for our last two campaigns we shipped well before the estimated ship date. Our first campaign was supposed to begin shipping in February 2019, and instead we sent out our last 20 orders in February. Our second campaign was set to begin shipping in April and we started shipping the first orders in the last week of February, and the remaining orders will all be sent out in mid march. We've consistently shipped early so far. We can't make any promises for this project because sometimes with crowdfunding there are unforeseen circumstances, but if all goes well like the last two campaigns, you should get rewards before July. \nCheck out our social media pages, Etsy store, and previous campaigns!\nSnarky Co. Pins - Our First Kickstarter.\nKiller Queens - Our Second Kickstarter. \nwww.snarkyco.com\nInstagram\nPatreon\nEtsy\nThe Things to Know section contained our policies for this campaign, but we've now moved it to the Risks and Challenges section of this page. Even though we've re-located our policies, they still apply. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'll be using trusted manufacturers that i've worked with before, but occasionally, minor mistakes can be made, and delays in production can happen. \n\nI will always be upfront with backers along the way. I will disclose any setbacks, delays, and any other pertinent updates.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is a crowdfunded campaign. Crowdfunded campaigns are often subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances. Please also understand that money pledged to a crowdfunded campaign is a donation or investment. This is not an online store and you will not immediately receive your rewards after pledging.\n\nPlease note that minor changes may occur in production, and that the images presented here are my mock up designs. There is a possibility of slight changes in color and size, but I don't foresee any major issues.\n\nPin Grades\nThe Snarky Company offers two grades of pins, First Grade, and Second Grade. First Grade pins are really the only pins I offer in my online stores, and they are the only ones available for Kickstarter campaigns. Second grade pins are only available through online stores, and currently we're not offering any. Our pins are handmade and they may have minor cosmetic imperfections. \nExamples of expected First Grade imperfections:\nSmall buff marks, scuffs, or scratches on metal/enamel\nSmall specks, pores, or bubbles anywhere on the pin\nSlightly low or uneven fills\nSlightly misaligned screenprinted details (for pins with screenprinting)\nSlight variations in the distribution of giltter\nSlight defects in text (this is usually only in pins with small text)\nWe want to make you aware that these First Grade pins may have small imperfections, but 99% of the time, these imperfections are non-existent or not noticeable. \nAn important note about color and size.\nIt is crucial to understand that while we have made pins before, the pins in this Kickstarter have not yet been manufactured. The designs you see on this page are only mockups, which means the final product may have slight changes in color and size. Taking your two dimensional design, sending it to a manufacturer, and receiving a three dimensional, physical object is difficult. From our experience, the majority of our pins turn out looking like the mockup design. \nThere are so many variables when you see a mockup that you are viewing on your computer or phone. Different computers, phones, or other devices have different screen settings which means we may not all be viewing the same coloration. We use a Pantone Solid Coated book to choose the colors for our designs. The manufacturers use those Pantone numbers to know which colors to mix and apply where, however, looking at a Pantone swatch on paper, is different than looking at a Pantone color in enamel. \nEach mockup has a rough estimate of what the size will be. Our sizes are either specifying the general height of the pin, or width of the pin, however, the actual size of the physical product may vary. \n\nGlitters\nWhen you view a mockup design that has components with glitter, it is crucial to understand how glitter overlays work in Adobe Illustrator. Glitter textures are artificially created in Adobe illustrator. We have glitter textures in various shades for each color, but they come no where near to the hundreds of different glitter colors that manufacturers offer. The mockup design may show you a section of dark blue glitter, that has flecks of dark blue and silver, however, the physical glitter may contain specs of other shades of blue, green, or silver. When you see a mockup design with glitter, understand that the glitter overlay is to give you an idea of the general color of the glitter, and where it will be on the pin. When a pin has holographic glitter, it will be labeled as holographic glitter. Holographic is what you could call rainbow glitter, each spec of glitter can reflect various different colors. What you should know about holographic glitter is that it reflects different colors depending on the enamel it is placed in. When placed in white enamel, it reflects a shade of light blue, when placed in black enamel it reflects a shade of green. \nRefunds or Exchanges\nAfter the campaign has ended, you will have ample time to make your pin selections in your BackerKit survey. You will be notified before surveys are locked down and any add-ons are charged. Once your order is locked down, we have a no refunds or exchanges policy. The only time we will issue a refund or replacement, is in extenuating circumstances, or if your pin arrives damaged (please read the section on pin grades to determine if your pin is damaged). Examples of damaged pins are, posts that are bent and unusable, posts that may have fallen off, or whole chunks of enamel that are missing. We will also offer refunds or offer to reship an item if it is missing from your order. \nRubber Backs vs. Locking Backs\nEach pin from our campaign will come with rubber backs, but we highly recommend purchasing locking backs. If you choose to adhere your pin to a jacket, bag, or other item, with a rubber back, and it falls off, we will not replace the missing pin. We do offer locking backs through our add-ons section in your survey. \nShipping Policies\nPlease visit the shipping section to read about these policies. \nComments\nMental Illness can be a very intimate and personal topic. Any one who leaves a comment that I determine to be rude, defamatory, or ignorant, will be blocked with no explanation. \nThe Denim Jacket Pledge Level\nIf you pledge for this tier, after the campaign has ended, we provide a sizing chart where you can choose your size. We'll provide 1-3 different options for jackets. We prefer Levi's jackets, but we have other chosen brands that are also great quality. From the options we provide, you'll get to choose which jacket style, color (if that style has color options), and of course your size. For the collector's box you have three options for engraving. You can choose just our Logo, just your name, or you can choose to have the Logo and your name. You'll receive one of each pin, and if that pin has multiple color options, you'll receive one of each color (for example, the Pill pin comes in four colors, you'll get all four). All pins will come on backing cards, with locking backs, and arrive packed in the collector's box. Please be careful when choosing your jacket size, as we cannot provide an exchange or refund if it does not fit. Once your pledge level is locked down (you'll be notified before the lockdown) the pledge level is non-refundable. If any of your items are damaged in transit, we will replace them though. If you purchase this tier as an international backer, we properly fill out all customs forms, but we will not be held responsible if your country loses your package through their mailing service (this means once the package is no longer with the USPS), or if they hold your package and ask for additional VAT, taxes, or fees. You'll also receive any add-on stretch goals that are successfully unlocked. If any add-on stretch goal is not unlocked, it will not come with your order.

Even bringing in someone new to help with shipping is challenging because it takes a good amount of time to teach them everything in order to understand how to navigate 100+ SKUS and a new shipping software.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself.

What if the story depended on the choices YOU made? \nSound familiar? You've probably heard of game books where you get to choose your path by reading a series of text paragraphs each ending with a fun choice. But what if...\nWhat if a game book implemented GRAPHICS into the game play? What if instead of text driving the action, text AND graphics combined to create a visual sensory experience?\nLast year, we first introduced you to the next evolution of game books with Season 1 of Graphic Novel Adventures. And now we are back with MORE!  \nThe Ultimate Gamebook Experience\nThese books are an incredible gaming experience. And they are so accessible even to those of you that have never played a gamebook before. Most of the books are one player, but in Season 2 one of the books even supports playing with 2 players! \nProduct Highlights:\nThere is zero setup time. Open the book and begin playing. Start and stop at will, play time is whatever you want it to be.\nThey tell a cohesive and engaging story.\nThey include puzzles, riddles, hidden numbers, and other challenges that will test you at every step.\n\"I need a game to play on an airplane tray table\" - Look no further!\nThe books feature a variety of themes and story lines each with different rules and gameplay twists on the core system.\nIf you were here for season 1 you already know my opinion... This is the BEST game book experience out there.\nStill not convinced? Let's take a peek inside... \nIn Mystery! you are a new recruit trying to join the Legion of Champions, the most famous super hero group of all-time. You'll have to prove yourself. Experience the trials with Mystery, Miracle Woman, ShadowDark and others in this hilarious and fun filled adventure!\nNew recruits are needed.\nLooking at your character sheet, you'll get to name your super hero and then decide how to split your 3 starting hero points between Flight, Strength, Super Senses, and Super Rich. As you progress, you will be able to increase your stats in the skills of your choice! There is even a high tech metamorpher machine that will allow you to reconfigure your stats during the game, but you might want to be careful using that as there could be, well, er, side effects. Ultimately you'll need to earn enough hero points to become a full fledged member of the Legion of Champions!\nLet's look at one of the scenarios that might come up in the book...\nHow would you handle this situation?\nDid you notice the QR code on the page? One of the special features in Mystery is that you have a high tech watch you can use to get instant information and tips. If you have a QR code reader on your phone, go ahead and scan it now. If not, or you prefer not to have a device on hand, don't worry, the QR codes are completely optional!\nSo which choice would YOU make? Want to know what happens? Well pledge for these books and you'll be able to find out this and soooo much more!\nSo many doors, so little time!\nAll of the books have choices of where to go and what to do. You'll encounter foes, puzzles, traps, riddles, and much, much more! Not every path is safe though, so choose wisely! \nYou don't want to miss spotting a hidden number that could be critical to your objective... Can YOU spot the hidden number in the frame below? (Don't worry, the below frame is modified. This is not an actual hidden number in the book - as to not spoil anything)\nIf this was real and not just a made up example, you would flip to panel 101 and perhaps discover one of Mystery's most intimate secrets. \nI can tell you want MORE! Well to experience all these books have to offer you are going to have to pledge for the set. But let's look at an overview of the other four, shall we?\n Ready to continue where Sherlock Holmes: Four Investigations left off? Well look no further than Sherlock Holmes & Moriarty: Associates! In this book, not only can you play as Holmes and Watson, but now you can also choose Moriarty! He's joined the team under peculiar circumstances... \nThe Napoleon of Crime seems to have made arrangements.\nQuestion suspects without fear of offending them knowing your ability to coerce and threaten them will produce useful information!\nQuestion suspects as Holmes, Watson, OR Moriarty.\nIf things go south Moriarty is willing to use... less conventional means.\nWill you solve the cases with the help of your arch nemesis? And has he really changed his ways? Or is he up to something sinister? \n In Sherlock Holmes: The Challenge of Irene Adler, there is a new detective in town! Irene is now competing with the Baker Street boys for business. But will she truly be able to rival the skills of Sherlock? \nA entirely different game is afoot.\nPlay solo, or head to head against another player each taking on the role of either Sherlock Holmes or Irene Adler. Only by using your wits will you prove yourself to be London's Greatest Detective! Will you best your opponent in this battle of wits? Or will your opponent come out on top?\n In Pirates: The Great Chase, you can choose one of three Pirates with a different set of stats. Your goal? To find the prisoner that just escaped your ship and is swimming  toward a nearby island.\nYou can't just let prisoners escape!\nThis is a true treasure hunt and you will really need to keep your eyes peeled for hidden objects along the way! You never know what you'll come across that could be helpful later on! \n In Pirates: The City of Skulls, you'll continue where your adventure left off and explore the bustling pirate town. Will you be able to unlock its secrets and find what you are looking for?\nFeaturing a new stat to track, your piracy level, this Pirates book is sure to satisfy. \n ________________________________________________________________\nWe are so excited to bring you these books.

Here are some quotes and videos from some of them.\nBoardgames and Bourbon - Glenn Flaherty\n\"If this is any indication of what this second season has overall over the first season, it is an evolution of the story telling. I can definitely recommend [Mystery].\"\n90 Second Nerd - Nick and Jenny \nBeyond Solitaire - Liz Davidson\n \"I am really happy with what I've experienced while playing the Graphic Novel Adventures series so far, and based on the strength of Mystery, my expectations remain high.  This project is an instaback for me.\"  \nPraise for GNA Season 1\nThe Dice Tower review of Graphic Novel Adventures - Season 1 \nUnfiltered Gamer Review \nListen, if you are a genius and lucky enough to get through one of these books on the first try, well then we bow to you (unless you cheated). But the chances are if you are playing legit, it will take you at least a handful of tries to complete one successfully. You are looking at several hours of game play in each book. And these books are the sort where you can put them on the shelf for a year or several months and you'll be able to revisit them again unless you've got one of those photographic memories where you never forget anything! \nGreat news! The season 1 books are available now! Please support your Friendly Local Game Store by purchasing there. If they do not have them, they can probably order them for you if you are in the USA or Canada. But if you still can't find them, you can purchase them directly from us at vanrydergames.com\nFor international locations outside of the USA and Canada, please check your local stores as  these books and/or others may be available from other publishers in your language.\nWe MAY offer the Season 1 books in the pledge manager after this campaign, but that is not guaranteed. And if we do we will not be able to ship them until Season 2 is ready.\nGraphic Novel Adventures are self-contained games within a book and are English translations we are printing under license of previously released French game books from publisher Makaka Editions. As a result, we will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. However it should be noted that the more we achieve with this campaign, the greater likelihood we will be able to translate and produce MORE Graphic Novel Adventures! \nWe are planning to be able to deliver these books very quickly and are targeting August or sooner for our delivery estimate. For Season 1, we were able to deliver in just a few short months and we are confident we can achieve similar results with Season 2.\nWe are offering retailer pledges for USA/Canada retailers ONLY that are interested in purchasing case quantities. This is simply our greatest retailer offer we have ever had so we hope our retail partners will be interested! \nTo take advantage of this offer simply back for $50 to commit to buy. Then, prior to shipping from the factory we will ask you to finalize your quantity commitment, but you can pay your remaining balance at a later date prior to final shipping. Pricing is 50% off of KSP (Kickstarter Shipped Price) or $42.50 per set. Minimum order quantity is 4 book sets.\nAdditionally, as a special thank you for supporting our GNA book line, we will send Brick and Mortar retailers a custom display to use for the GNA books in your store, a pre-release store demo copy of The Crusoe Crew - the upcoming co-operative GNA game, and we will produce a \"How to sell a GNA book\" video for you to share with your employees! And we will send these items as soon as they are ready for use with your Season 1 GNA books you carry now  - NO NEED TO WAIT for your Season 2 product to arrive! \nVan Ryder Games will pay the shipping for retail pledges. We are not trying to make money off of retailers with this deal. We are trying to earn your commitment to the brand while giving you amazing margin to get started (or continue), as well as all of the tools you need to succeed in selling the books! \nThis offer is LIMITED. We will verify all retailers! \nRetailers interested in stocking Season 1 - which is available NOW! - can do so by contacting your distributor of choice.

In PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers as they trek through different trails across four seasons of the year. While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the sites they visit\u2014memories being the resources in the game. Players will trade in these memories to collect National Park cards, mementos, at the end of each hike. You'll be able to purchase equipment and fill canteens to make your hikes more efficient, but at the the end of the year, it's the Park cards and photos you have collected along your journey that will win you the game. Welcome to PARKS!\nWe have all been inspired by our world at some point. In fact, if you\u2019re like the people in the audio journals we've been sharing, then you have an inspiring memory of an experience you had in the wild. The Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series reached out to us and captured our imagination with the beautiful artwork they are creating in celebration of the United States National Parks. We could not think of a better way to help celebrate with them than to develop a game that makes use of this beautiful work and helps give back to the Parks themselves.\nWe\u2019re committed to honoring national parks. Because of your help bringing this project to life, we will be making an annual donation to the National Park Service for the lifetime of this product. This donation will be based on gross retail revenue each year.\nAdditionally, Every dollar added to the tip jar in our pledge manager will be included in our first year\u2019s donation.\nPARKS' solo adventure puts you back on the trail, but this time alongside Park Rangers! Rangers will be moving alongside you as they take care of the Trail. In order to visit a site with a Ranger on top of it you'll need to use your Campfire just like in the main game.  Enjoy your hike, but don\u2019t take too long because the Season ends when the Rangers finish the trail!\nSolo Mode Includes:\n2 Hikers vs 2 Rangers\nRanger Movement correlates to the Gear cost revealed that turn\nRangers pick up Weather (Sunshine or Water) on Tiles they land on and it is placed in their Tracker\nIf Rangers collect three Sunshine or three Water, then the corresponding event is triggered such as a Government Shutdown. After its action resolves, a new card is revealed\nRangers skip over tiles with Hikers as they don't want to impose on the Hikers' experience of the Trail, but they don\u2019t mind sharing a space with each other\nThe first Ranger to reach trail end will close down a Park and select an additional effect\nHikers caught on the trail when season ends cannot take any further actions until the next season\nOfficial Solo Rules available in the rules folder above\nOur love of board games all started with a standard deck of cards\u2014so when Fifty-Nine Parks brought up the prospect of doing playing cards as well, we jumped at the opportunity! Each face-card will house a park for a total of 12 Parks in the deck. In this set you\u2019ll find: Acadia, Arches, Everglades, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Joshua Tree, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. The deck will be made with the United States Playing Card Company on premium card stock featuring sustainable forest paper and vegetable-based and metallic inks. \nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want.

The strength of the series comes from an eclectic mix of artists and the unique beauty of each park. Every screen printed poster is printed here in the USA.

The full series is currently being archived by The Library of Congress.\nVisit their website for more details and to view their collection of wonderful prints, many of which are available for purchase.

It will be their responsibility to guide the other player(s) to complete all of the MISSION OBJECTIVES using only a set of 11 special COMMAND CARDS. They are not allowed to speak. \nThe other player(s) take the role of the CADET who must complete the three MISSION OBJECTIVES within the time- or round-limit using the COMMAND CARDS they receive from MISSION CONTROL. They will receive five of these cards at a time and will have to decode the order they actually belong in because they must be shuffled before given to the CADET each round.\nYour Goal: Cooperatively fix the station before time runs out by deducing the correct order in which each set of instructions belongs, until all of the MISSION OBJECTIVES are complete. MISSION CONTROL is allowed to reveal when a MISSION OBJECTIVE has been completed, but that's all they can say until the end! But, if you run out of time on the clock, or exhaust your total number of TRANSMISSIONS before solving all three, it's GAME OVER. \nClick to Watch: UNFILTERED GAMER's review\nDynamic tile art!

CADET: Arrange the EMPTY CORRIDOR tiles as shown in the animation below. Shuffle up the OBJECT/STATION tiles Repaired (Green) side up and deal them out in the empty squares. Then flip over 8 tiles in the diamond pattern below to the Damaged (Red) side. Last, place the Cadet Meeple in the center tile on the board.\n2. MISSION CONTROL: Shuffle up the three MISSION OBJECTIVE decks and draw one off the top of each, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Only you are allowed to look at them. Do not show them to the CADET. These are the Missions you will need to complete in order to win! (This part is called the PLANNING PHASE)\n3. BEGIN PLAY! MISSION CONTROL selects five of the 11 COMMAND available to them, (hopefully five that gets the CADET closer to completing a MISSION OBJECTIVE,) shuffles them, and gives them to the CADET face-down. \nThe Cadet must place those five COMMAND cards in the order they believe is correct, and then execute those commands in that order. (This part is called the DECODE PHASE)\nAfter executing the five commands, return the COMMAND CARDS to MISSION CONTROL. If the conditions were met for any MISSION OBJECTIVE at any time, even if for just a split-second, that MISSION OBJECTIVE is completed and may be revealed to the CADET.\nRepeat step 3 until all of your MISSION OBJECTIVES are complete! \nNext, you'll be ready to make the game even more exciting with:\n\nClick to watch: GEEKYGAYMERGUY's review\nNow with full-color tiles!\nTabletop Simulator sold separately, but the module is free for backers!\nClick to watch: BOCK'S GAME REVIEWS Incoming Transmission review\nSee the Stretch Goals section for even more!\nLoad up the app and use the Tabletop Simulator demo or Print-and-Play to try them out together!\nWhat the Incoming Transmission Companion App IS: \nIt is a digital helper that can add sights, sounds, and extra features to your game that are unrealistic to expect a human to manage while playing.\nIt enables additional play modes and enhances existing ones without detracting from the core of the game.\nIt will keep track of certain information for you and provide a unique gaming experience.\nIt is an OPTIONAL TOOL, you do not have to use it in order to play Incoming Transmission.\na FREE application for all players of Incoming Transmission.\nWhat the Incoming Transmission Companion App IS NOT: \nIt is not required in order to play or fully enjoy Incoming Transmission.\nIt is not supported by, nor shall it include, any third-party ads.\nWhile the current demo is web-based, internet access will not be required to use the final application.

What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nHere it is, blunt and forward. We ran a KickStarter campaign for Incoming Transmission last Summer. It funded, and we were happy! We immediately started finalizing assets and began the long task of working with the manufacturer. \nHowever, there was a long list of improvements & features we weren\u2019t able to add due to not reaching certain stretch goals and we strongly felt that they should be part of the project. We asked our backers if we should attempt to sell an expansion at a later date, run a short Kickstarter to unlock those items, or just leave it alone. Over 90% of our respondents said we should go for another Kickstarter, and as we want to support our supporters, that is exactly what we are doing!\nThis campaign will not create any delays in production, for you or our previous backers.

Production on schedule thus far (subject to improvements based on the performance of the current campaign)\n\nThe publication of a board game is a complex process with many variables and parties involved from multiple countries. It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers with well-developed relationships with their suppliers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects. We have met unique challenged in each of our previous campaigns that have only equipped us with more experience to prevent similar delays again.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done extensive pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art is 99% complete. The production quote is in-hand and ready to be initiated. Several fees and partners have been paid in advance for this production, as well.\nThis process has been improved due to the challenges encountered in previous projects, and we have prepared even more in-advance than years past.\n\n2. We are working with a highly-experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods, pre-press checkpoints, and freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We also plan to provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with experienced fulfillment partners with a wide range of options. Amazon has been immensely effective for quickly distributing our products within the USA. We will again consider our options for international shipping when the time comes, both Happyshops and ShipFromChina have worked out very well in the past.\n\nAs always, we will pay close attention to our shipping and manufacturing options to make sure we are making responsible decisions all the way down to the end-user's experience. We delayed Overworld's production intentionally to ensure the components could be improved to the standard that our backers expect to receive and we aim to never need do so again.\n\nThe only thing we are more dedicated to than the quality of our products is backer communication. We will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. We will be present daily during the project to answer any questions you have! We read every comment. We will also provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress throughout the entire journey, we want you to be a part of the creative process as early-adopters of our products.\n\nThank you for your confidence and support!!

If you're interested in purchasing the original Pixel Glory, you can visit our website for more information!  \nhttps://www.zaftygames.com/collections/pixel-glory\nPixel Glory - The Heroic Dungeon is a new expansion featuring 5 new exclusive spells, and 51 familiar monsters but with all new abilities and a heroic difficulty - this is a difficult dungeon to conquer, even for the best wizards.  \nDue to us reaching a special stretch goal, all cards in the heroic dungeon are holographic!\n\nWe sold out of Pixel Glory: Light & Shadow, and it's time to reprint!  We've been a publishing company first on Kickstarter with the original Pixel Glory back in 2013!  We don't like the idea of trying to maximize profit and essentially exploit our Kickstarter community.  \nThe Kickstarter community is single handily responsible for changing our lives, and helping Russell and I launch a game company that was originally expected to be a resume booster into a company that is slowly becoming our life's work.  We're more interested in expressing gratitude to the community that's willing to pay money to support our games months in advance than to look at them as wallets that we should work to exploit more money out of.  We've actually stopped spending money on advertising and doing stretch goals for our Kickstarters because it just doesn't sit well to prioritize income off the Kickstarter community for us.  \nPay What You Want is intended to let people get the new stuff for the game they already own for essentially free. If you want to pledge more, that's awesome!  Seriously, thank you.  \nIf not, that's awesome too!  You already own our game which is amazing, and you want the new stuff for it which means you probably like it, play it, and share it with others which is amazing.  A minimum pledge is far from anything other than your support, and we're super grateful.  \nWe are a small team of ladies and gentlemen that like to treat gamers like the ladies and gentleman that they are. This means, we will provide you with an experience that is professional, honest, transparent, and most importantly, respectful from beginning to end. It's a horrible thing to see hobby game companies treat the people that keep them afloat as just a customer, and that is not what we are about. \nBy March, we have published seven games with several expansions. We have successfully fulfilled 9 Kickstarters, delivered the majority of those campaigns early, and released two games without Kickstarter.  We look forward to successfully delivering the rewards from this, our 10th, campaign!

Over the past decade, our library of gateway and filler games have entertained, inspired, and provided an opportunity to make memories around the game table, and it all started with our flagship title, Tsuro: The Game of the Path.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate this 10 year milestone than by returning to the series that started it all - so we welcome you to the launch of a brand new Tsuro game!\nLong ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, brave people released glowing paper lanterns toward the heavens. This act of hope summoned clever magical phoenixes, who soared through the sky and raced toward the lanterns. \nAs the birds flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch transformed the lanterns into brilliant new stars! Before the people's very eyes, the night sky became illuminated with beauty, all because of the firebirds.  The phoenix that creates a constellation of seven new stars will illuminate the night sky and once again restore balance to Tsuro...the path of life! \nIn Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, an exhilarating new entry in the classic Tsuro series, each player is a phoenix, soaring across the board in an effort to reach glowing lanterns and transform them into new stars in the night sky.  The first player to collect seven star tokens wins the game!\nTsuro: Phoenix Rising builds upon the foundation of classic Tsuro \u2013 you must play tiles to extend your path, traverse the board, and be aware of your surroundings \u2013 but it adds exciting new features such as double-sided path tiles that allow for diagonal movement and can be flipped and rotated to choose your destination, as well as a revolutionary new molded board.  As a phoenix, you also have the astounding ability to rise from the ashes and return to the board once per game! \nAll New Gameplay! \u2013 Become a phoenix!  Soar across the board, flipping and rotating the double-sided tiles to build your path on the revolutionary new modular board.\nNew Twist on classic Tsuro \u2013 Builds upon the foundation of Tsuro \u2013 create your path, stay on the board \u2013 but introduces exciting new elements such as set collection, strategic board manipulation\u2026and the ability to rise from your ashes and return!\nExclusive Kickstarter Content! \u2013 Pledge now so you don\u2019t miss out!

Some core gameplay elements remain, such as placing tiles and moving your pawn along the path.  However, as a Phoenix, your turns in the game will now consist of extending your path, moving your Phoenix pawn, transforming Lanterns into Stars, and scoring Stars to make a constellation!\nFor additional copies of the standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, manually add $40 per game to your pledge.

Retailer orders will be shipped with all other Kickstarter orders prior to standard distribution. Your final order and payment will not be finalized until the game is ready to ship.  Orders must be placed in case quantities (6 units per case); maximum two cases per location. \nPhysical store verification will be required; you must provide the store name, store address, phone number, EIN number, and website or Facebook page.

Result of the verification process by Calliope Games will be final.  \nNOTE: International retailer copies will be shipped at the same time as all international backer copies; international freight forwarding may cause delays in fulfillment.  \nThe truth is, we packed all possible quality and value in the presentation of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising.  Upgraded tile thickness?  Done.  Fancy components?  Included.  Amazing tray?  You got it!!  So we can't approach stretch goals the same way other campaigns might.\nInstead, we are going to treat stretch goals as a bonus for backers, to celebrate the entire Tsuro series!\nEveryone at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer pledge levels will receive all unlocked stretch goals when Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is fulfilled!  No additional charge or shipping will be required!  \nA note about grouping multiple copies of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising:\nEach copy of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer levels will come with one of each stretch goal item, so you can put together a group pledge and every copy will come with the goodies!  This also means retailers will be able to provide the stretch goal items for all copies!\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n*See Update #2 for list of EU Neighbor countries. \nThe above costs reflect the Standard Retail Edition and Kickstarter Exclusive Set pledge levels; Way of the Retailer and Legacy of Tsuro levels may be slightly higher due to quantity of boxes to be shipped.  Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign ends through CrowdOx. \n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 19 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.  \nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.  \nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!\nIf you would like to add other amazing games from our catalog to your pledge, you may do so by manually adjusting your pledge using the amounts below.

The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nUpcoming tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen.

A modern version of the classic game Rallyman, complete with all new illustrations and fine-tuned rules, Rallyman GT will have you pushing your luck to be the first over the finishing line!\nRoll your dice to race along the track as fast as you can, but beware \u2013 get too many Warning signs and you\u2019ll spin out!\nRallyman GT is an addictively simple racing game with a lot of strategic depth. Plan your trajectory with care to tackle dangerous turns, cut off other drivers and burn that rubber until your luck runs out\u2026\nA fast, exciting racing game with simple mechanics and rules\nA fun new take on the classic game; Rallyman GT is a multiplayer, GT version of the original, optimised for racing against your friends!\nSolo players won't feel left out though as the game's renowned Solo mode is also back with full support!\nA beautiful new edition with artwork by Lo\u00efc Muzy\nHexagonal tiles allow players to create their own tracks\nA 1-6 player game lasting around 60 minutes.\nRallyman: GT tracks are made of hexagonal tiles that you may set up however you wish! You can either use one of the 8 tracks included in the Rule book or invent your own. With 32 double-sided tiles to choose from, the possibilities are endless!\nTiles have one Urban side with 2 lanes and one Rural side with 3 lanes. Try racing on both and see the strategic possibilities that open up or, better yet, use the converter tiles to create bottlenecks, wide open straights and more!\nOnce track setup is complete, the players begin the race in the starting grid. Their positions are chosen randomly by drawing speed tokens, and the player in Pole Position becomes the First player.\nRallyman GT is a roll and move racing game, so to move, you\u2019ll be rolling dice!\n\nThe base mechanic of the game is very simple: 1 die = 1 space of movement.\n\nThese dice do not have values as you would find on a regular D6, but each die has one or more Warning signs. Rolling a Warning sign still allows you to move, but if you accumulate too many in one turn you\u2019ll lose control of your car and spin out, losing time and potentially taking damage\u2026\n\nAt the start of their turn, the active player plans out their trajectory by placing their dice on the track, following the route they plan to take.\n\nThere are three types of dice to choose from:\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your trajectory by laying your dice out on the track, you\u2019ll have a choice to make. You can choose to either roll your dice one by one, which allows you to end your turn whenever you choose if you\u2019re getting too many Warning signs.\nOr, if you\u2019re feeling lucky, you can choose to go Flat Out, and roll them all at once! If your roll is successful, you gain the same number of Focus tokens as the number of dice you rolled.\nFocus tokens are a precious resource during the game \u2013 allowing your driver to have brief spurts of intense concentration. You can spend Focus tokens to secure your dice rolls - automatically passing them without the risk of getting a Warning symbol, so use them wisely!\nIf you get too many Warning symbols in your roll (3 in normal conditions), then you spin out! The consequences of a Loss of Control are determined by the gear you were in at the time, and the Danger level of the terrain you were driving on. Each player has a Dashboard card showing how to resolve their Loss of Control \u2013 from simply starting their next turn in gear 0, to skipping a turn and/or drawing damage tokens!\nThese damage tokens are drawn at random from a bag and have different effects, from changing the weather conditions to giving you less dice to roll. Damage tokens are cumulative and can add up fast! Making a Pit Stop will allow you to repair damage to your car, but will cause you to lose even more time, which might make you think twice about taking too many risks\u2026\n\nThe core box comes with two Dashboards for each car: one with Asphalt tires and one with Rain tires. Asphalt tires are great all round tires but lose a lot of their effectiveness in the rain. Rain tires are much more effective in wet weather but slightly less so on dry roads.\nHowever, in this Kickstarter version of the game you'll be recieving an additional set of tires: Soft tires! These tires provide excellent traction, however they do wear out VERY fast so you will no doubt have to perform a pit stop at some time during the race, especially if you're doing more than one lap!\nYou can start a race with the tires of your choosing and, should you feel the need; you can perform a pit stop during the race in order to simply swap out your tires (Ie. Changing out one dashboard for another).\nThe base mechanics of Rallyman GT may be simple, but don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 the game has a lot of strategic depth to it that will keep players coming back for more !\n\nThe tracks in Rallyman GT contain challenging twists and turns, represented by corner spaces. These spaces have speed limitations and special conditions that drivers must adhere to in order to cross them safely. For example, some spaces may only be crossed while going at a certain speed or lower. Considering that you may only roll each Gear dice once per turn, these speed limitations can make things tricky! Others cause the driver to automatically add a warning sign to their roll. Some of these conditions can be avoided by moving into the space diagonally instead of via the same lane - in the same way as cutting across makes taking a corner easier in real life driving - so choose your trajectory carefully!\n\n  Of course, during a game of Rallyman GT, you\u2019re also going to have to deal with other drivers!\n\nOther vehicles can get in your way, forcing you to make difficult manoeuvres on dangerous corners, or even cutting you off completely! Speed is vital \u2013 you cannot overtake another car unless you\u2019re going at the same speed. This can push you to make strategic - and often risky - choices to avoid being left behind.\n\nAt the end of their turn, players must place a Speed marker next to their car, showing which Gear they were in at the time. The Speed tokens have both a black and a white side, to help players keep track of who has already played their turn.\nIn Rallyman GT, speed is everything: at the start of each new round, the turn order will change. This determined by:\n\nSpeed: the player with the highest speed\nDistance: In case of a tie, the player the furthest along the track goes first.\nInside Lane: In case of a tie on speed and distance, the player on the inside track relative to the next corner goes first. \nSo, ending your turn at the highest speed possible may result in you playing twice in a row. Or, you might prefer to hang back on certain key spaces on the track to give your opponents a hard time!\n  If only one player crosses the finish line during the round, then they take the trophy! If several players cross the line during the same round, then the winner is determined by the exactly the same criteria as the turn order: Speed, Distance, Inside Lane!\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the original Rallyman games, or if you\u2019re just a lover of solo games, then fear not - Rallyman GT also has a great Solo Mode, which will allow a single player to go up against the clock to get the best lap time possible!\nSolo Mode is played almost identically to a multiplayer game of Rallyman GT. At the end of each turn, the player simply jots down their Speed (meaning the gear the ended their turn in) on a Print and Play scoring sheet. Depending on your speed, a certain number of seconds will be added to your overall time. At the end of the race, leftover Focus tokens will take seconds off your result. So, do you use them to play it safe, or do you go try for the best time possible?\n\nOnce you have your total lap time, will you be able to beat it? Take part in monthly, community organised races and test your mettle against other pilots!\n\n\nYou can download the Beta Rulebook HERE.\n\nPlease note that this is a BETA rulebook. It has not been set out for print. It may be subject to minor changes and some grammatical errors may still be present.\n\n\nHow do I include add-ons in my pledge?\n1.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Rallyman: GT with JC for the better part of a year now. After many internal development sessions, feedback from playtests at major events and from the previous rules document which has been available online for some time now; we\u2019ve arrived at the current rules set which we\u2019re very happy with.\nAll Core box content, Expansions and Stretch Goals have been fully developed and tested.\nGraphically, the majority of the core box is complete with only a few minor elements left to finalise. The expansions and stretch goals are partially illustrated and should be completed by January next year.\nPre-production wise the entirety of the project has already been reviewed and approved by the manufacturer so we\u2019re expecting no serious issues during production.\nTherefore, we\u2019re expecting a very smooth finalisation phase, post campaign, and look forward to getting your games to you on time, if not earlier!\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during or after the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind!\nJean-Christophe Bouvier burst into the French boardgaming scene after the success of the original Rallyman. Designed and developped by him, then sold from his home garage, the game was a hit and continues to be quite a find in the second hand market! As a Rally driver himself, he wanted to make a game that represented his passion. The original Rallyman has been out of print for over 6 years, but has maintained a base of loyal fans who continue to play to this day.\nYou can read our interview with JC HERE!\nIllustrator and character-design specialist, Lo\u00efc Muzy has been working in the world of gaming since 2008 and as Holy Grail Games' in-house illustrator and Art Director since early 2018. He started by designing minatures for wargaming, then made a name for himself in the world of board games (Fire team zero, Mythic Battles, Orcquest,...). He has also worked on video games projects, such as some based in the Warhammer 40000 universe. He's best known for his illustrations for Call of Cthulhu (role-playing and other derivative products) as an illustrator with Sans-d\u00e9tours editions. Lo\u00efc has been painting figurines for over 20 years, and is passionate about fantasy universes.\nHoly Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns), Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author) and Eric Dubus (History teacher, Game author and human loudspeaker). They couldn't do that however without the help of the rest of the team including Georgina, Quentin, Owen, Raphael, Jonhatan, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois...\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue doing what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by November 2019. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nShipnaked will be taking care of North America whereas Meeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions as well as other worldwide destinations.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done our best to reduce the costs as much as possible. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\n \"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.\nBelow are the prices for delivery of one copy of Rallyman to each Country.\nPurchasing multiple boxes and/or expansions will incur a small increase in postage costs to cover packaging and handling.\nAdditional copies of the core game will cost around 3\u20ac in shipping\nAdd ons will cost an additional around 2\u20ac in shipping depending on the size.\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please don't hesitate to ask us in the comments section!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter.

This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Rallyman: GT 1.1 rules", "update_content": "Greetings Drivers!\n\nFirst of all, a happy new year to all of you!\n\nWe have some pretty cool stuff for you today: The revised Rallyman: GT rulebook!\n\nWe touched on it previously, but with the success of GT since its release and Dirt on the horizon, Rallyman is much more than just one game now. We want each new addition to stand on its own, but be compatible with one another so as to give you guys as many different racing experiences as we can!\n\nWith this in mind, we went back to the original GT rulebook, not just to integrate the feedback we\u2019ve received since the game\u2019s release last year, but also to create a good foundation for what would be following in its wake. This includes making sure that the structure, terminology and general spirit of the rulebook could be used in any racing setting. The goal of this is that whatever Rallyman you pick up in the future feels and plays like a Rallyman game should.\n\n\nOne of the core mechanics of Rallyman is how the turn order is decided each round. For GT that\u2019s Speed > Distance > Position. Distance refers to how far along the track a player is, and to the existing text we\u2019ve added the following line:\n\n\n\nThis is a very minor change in terms of determining the turn order and in that respect isn\u2019t even needed. However, by referring to the front edge of the car\u2019s space we can easily clarify some other situations, such as Fast Lanes.\n\n\nWhilst the original rule did have the advantage of being simple, there are some rare situations where it becomes too much of a hindrance for those in no way involved or near to the Loss of Control that caused it.\n\nSo, at the cost of slightly complicating the rule, we\u2019ve made it much more thematic and less impactful on players not in the vicinity of the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re big believers in gaming aids as tools to help speed up gameplay. However, the ones in Rallyman didn\u2019t really have enough space to contain a pertinent amount of information on each element. It was still passable in English but in other language versions the font had to be reduced a lot in order to make things fit.\n\nTherefore, we\u2019re removing the gaming aid cards from future print runs and replacing the illustration on the back of the rulebook with a full page gaming aid that players can pass between them. It includes much more information as well as page numbers for quick-referencing more detailed rules.\n\nThese are the three biggest changes present in this new version but you\u2019ll find all the corrections and clarifications from the FAQ/errata document in the rulebook as well as other things such as the Redline rule.\n\nAlso, this document is not final. We\u2019d love to hear what you have to say about these changes and if you think there\u2019s anything we could make better!\n\n\nThe DIRT campaign included a \u20ac2 errata pack that replaces the handful of errors in the original campaign. Please note that we will not be able to include a printed version of the new booklet in this pack. As you may know, we priced the errata pack at cost. The downside to that is there\u2019s no wiggle room to add anything else to it. We will of course make both a low res and print quality version available for you to download. If we have the possibility of making this updated rule available in a future campaign, we will endeavor to do so.\n\nHope you guys like the changes, let us know below!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Rallyman: DIRT is ending soon!", "update_content": "Hi Drivers,\nWe just wanted to let you know that our campaign for Rallyman: DIRT, which is currently running on Kickstarter, ends today at 8pm CEST.

Once each year, Taron releases the toughest gang of war prisoners into the royal Colosseum to fight for their freedom. \nIn Lockup: A Roll Player Tale, players command squadrons of captured minions. They must keep their suspicion from the guards under control while hiring the strongest crew and building the most powerful items. The crew with the highest reputation wins the game and a chance to fight for their freedom\nLockup is a worker placement game with elements of bluffing, set collection, resource management, and variable scoring to make sure each game feels different. Collect and play tome cards at the right moment to get the upper hand. Each player's crew has members with different strengths and abilities. Knowing when and where to use each member of the crew is key to success in Kulbak. \nLockup is played over six rounds. Each round is divided into three phases:\nROLL CALL - Players take turns placing their minions in different parts of the Kulbak Prison, some face up showing a unit's strength and some face down, hiding the strength from the other players.  \nLIGHTS OUT - Each area location on the board is scored based on the strength of each player's crew. Players receive resources and have opportunities to recruit goons and build items.  \nPATROL PHASE - The game board is prepared for the next round of play. The guards then patrol Kulbak and can call a raid, punishing the players who have attracted the suspicion of the guards in previous turns.\nWhen playing the Solitary Mode of Lockup, the player is isolated in an old wing of the prison. Instead of playing against other players, the player is playing against an automated opponent \u2013 the guards.\nEach round, the guards are dispatched to different locations of Kulbak, and are slowly revealed, sometimes even calling for reinforcements. \n Gain the upper hand on each of the three levels of difficulty in Solitary Mode and score higher than the corrupt guards to secure your position at the top when King Taron arrives.\nWant to take a closer look to how Lockup works?

Capture the hearts of weapons to level them up in this \u201cshack-and-slash\u201d dungeon crawling adventure. Forge relationships and save Love itself!\nWe've decided $200k USD is our final stretch goal. Although we'll continue using your money to improve the game's polish and quality, we don't feel comfortable promising any further features or additional content. So... thank you for making our dream come true! Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles. For example, hit hard and dodge quickly with the dagger, or take on crowds with Lasersaber\nInclusive, tasteful approach to gender and sexuality, including male, female, and non-binary romance\nLet's get to the point: take your weapon-babes on romantic outings, such as to the club or the beach\nThe couple that slays together, stays together.\n This campaign not only supports us making our dream game, but also offers you once-in-a-lifetime merchandise, including weapon-dating-based mugs, body pillowcases, pins, and other extremely practical objects.\nAwards: Boyfriend Dungeon has already won two awards at BitSummit, and has been selected for showcases, including the PAX West Indie Megabooth and the Damage Camp Arcade 2018.  \nPlatforms: Boyfriend Dungeon is developed by us, Kitfox Games, and we already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux! Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier. Includes: the game, soundtrack, rose USB key, enamel pin, and sticker sheet, all in a beautiful box for your shelf.\nTemperature changing Boyfriend Dungeonmaster mugs of infinite thirst. Included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nTransform Talwar OR Dagger at will from their human form (front) to weapon form (back). One of your choice is included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nThis super-soft, high-quality cotton blend Sword Smoocher shirt color combo (white on black) is only available via the Ultimate Collector's Edition tier!\nEverything in the Ultimate Collector's Edition tier. Includes: T-Shirt, Messenger Bag, Stickers, Soundtrack CD, Mug, Pin, USB Rose game copy, Collector's Edition Box Set, and a Body Pillowcase of your choosing\nThe music, sound effects and audio design overall will be managed by Omar Dabbous, audio designer of GNOG by KO_OP.  \nThe soundtrack of Boyfriend Dungeon is an hour of all-original summery weapon-pop from the master composer Marskye (also of GNOG), often featuring the vocals of Madeleine McQueen.    \nTheir collaboration has already produced a few amazing tracks, including the main theme song you hear in the trailer, \u201cWithout a Weapon\u201d (Soundcloud link):   \n  And, presented here for the first time, a preview of the new soon-to-be-hit single, Spellbound:\n If you back the project now, you\u2019re sure to get notified when we post more songs and track previews in the future, during and after the campaign.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background Illustration: Jessica Mao is creating most of the game\u2019s background illustrations! They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

Baker also get the enamel pins at special discounted price!\nTIMELINE\nAugust: Kickstarter starts  \nMid-September: 14 day processing for funds to deposit into bank.\nOctober: Production begins.  \nNovember: Get pins from manufacturer, check out their quality and ship out your pins and rewards.\n\nCOST BREAKDOWN\n\nPin production 70%: The majority of the funds are used to produce the enamel pins as well as cover the manufacture fees and shipping costs. \nShipping & Packing 20%: This is to cover any and all supplies needed to ship out rewards to the bakers which may include: bubble mailers, clear bags, backing cards.. and also the shipping fees that correlate with how many enamel pins you will be receiving.\nKickstarter Fees 10%: Kickstarter charges every successful project a small fee for operating through them as well as all credit card transactions.\n\nPREVIOUS WORK", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter project and is a big responsability, but I'm sure it will works well.\n\nI count with a great manufacturer and the result will be very good. But if there is any setback with the quality of the pins, I will contact my manufacturer immediately to solve the problem (in that case it would be a 2/3 week delay aprox). Enamel pins are filled and polished by hand, so the finish of each piece may vary. I will work closely with the manufacturer to ensure that they are of a good standard and will update backers should any issues arise. I will also personally sort through the pins that will be shipped to backers to make sure I do not send any flawed pins.\n\nAlso I have Etsy, so I have a lot of experience with orders and shippings so you don't have to worry at all.\n\nThe postage method provided for rewards is tracked and certificate for backers. I use Correos postage National and Internacional. Shippings are included in the price you pay, but international backers are responsible for any additional import taxes or customs fees established by their country (usually is not the case).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac6 or more", "title": "\u2661 Three Stickers \u2661 Full Set", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Jiji The Cat sticker\n- Kaonashi No-Face sticker\n- Magpie and Boh sticker\nPrinted on heavyweight UV resistant vinyl, between 4x6cm big.\nINCLUDES:\n3 Stickers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "\u2661 One Pin \u2661", "descp": "You'll get:\n- One pin of your choice from all unlocked pins.\n- Free sticker\nINCLUDES:\n1 Hard Enamel pin\nFree Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac22 or more", "title": "\u2661 Two Pins \u2661", "descp": "You'll get:\n- Two pins of your choise from all unlocked pins.\n- Free sticker\nINCLUDES:\n2 Hard Enamel Pins\nFree Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac33 or more", "title": "\u2661 Three Pins \u2661 Full Set", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Three pins of your choice from all unlocked pins.\n- Free sticker\nINCLUDES:\n3 Hard Enamel Pins\nFree Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac38 or more", "title": "\u2661 Three Pins + Three Stickers \u2661 Full Set", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Full Set of three pins (if unlocked)\n- Full Set of stickers\nINCLUDES:\n3 Stickers\n3 Hard Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Early Bird \u2661 One Pin \u2661", "descp": "You'll get;\n- One pin of your choice from all unlocked pins.\nINCLUDES:\n1 Hard Enamel pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac18 or more", "title": "Early Bird \u2661 Two Pins \u2661", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Two pins of your choice from all unlocked pins.\nINCLUDES:\n2 Hard Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac27 or more", "title": "Early Bird \u2661 Three Pins \u2661", "descp": "You'll get:\n- Three pins of your choice from all unlocked pins\nINCLUDES:\n3 Hard Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "5 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "All rewards have been sent!", "update_content": "HI guys!

MEEPLOID PANIC AND SIGNAL BOOST CARDS INCLUDED!\nIncoming Transmission is a 10-30 minute, 2-5 (or more) player, game of deduction and strategy. Players must work together to achieve victory, but each side plays with slightly different rules. \nShuffle the tiles, Deal them out as shown, and flip 8 of them over either randomly or in this diamond pattern. Also place the Compass tile near the board so everyone can agree on which way \"North\" is.\nPlayer one takes the seat of MISSION CONTROL. Their job is to review the MISSION CARDS, which only they are permitted to see, and plan the best course of action to fix the station. \nPlayer two, and any additional number of players you wish to add, take(s) the role of the CADET, the lone survivor on the Station. \nThe Cadet side, if more than a single person, may speak freely amongst themselves. These are the multiple voices arguing in the head of the space-mad Cadet. MISSION CONTROL MAY NOT SPEAK and should remain completely poker-faced to the best of their ability to play in the spirit of the game.\nEach round, Mission Control will secretly choose 5 cards from the 11 available COMMAND CARDS which have simple one-word instructions (EAST will move the Cadet one tile East, and so on) and SHUFFLE THEM.\nThey must choose carefully because only 2 of each direction are available and 1 of each interaction command (COLLECT, DEPLOY, and REPAIR) exist in the deck.  \nDamaged tiles must be Repaired before they can be picked up or used to complete a Mission. Colorblind-friendly iconography helps to differentiate the Repaired side from the Damaged side.\nUpdated to be even more friendly to players with Color-Vision challenges\nAfter Mission Control shuffles the 5 Command cards and then turns over a TRANSMISSION CARD. These cards will be made into a stack when you set up the game, each one counts for one round of Communication before the Station self-destructs. The Transmission Cards will show you the current communication conditions. \n- ? - Lines are ordinary shuffled commands.    \nNumbered, Green Lines allow Mission control to show the Cadet a specific command for the register shown on the Transmission card. If 3 is lit, then Mission Control may indicate which Command should be performed third.  \nError, Red Lines force Mission Control to pick one additional Command Card at random from those they did NOT select for their 5 to give to the Cadet, and add one at random to their Command Card selection, shuffling it in.\nThe Cadet will need to examine the mixed-up Command Cards and decide how they should be re-ordered. They will need to be very careful in their selection, sometimes clues from previous rounds will be all they have to make the decision easier. Once the Cadet has locked-in their Command Card order, they will execute the commands from left to right, moving the Cadet meeple (which always begins in the center of the board) and Station Tiles accordingly.\nFor each Mission the Cadet completes, they may be rewarded with a SIGNAL BOOST card:\nHow many more can we add with the new Social Media stretch goals! Scroll down to find our more!\nIf Mission Control can guide the Cadet to accomplish the tasks on each Mission Objective Card before exhausting the Transmission Card stack, you win!

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects. We have met unique challenged in each of our previous campaigns that have only equipped us with more experience to prevent similar delays again.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done extensive pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 80% complete. The production quote is in-hand and ready to be initiated. Several fees and partners have been paid in advance for this production, as well.\n\nThis process has been improved due to the challenges encountered in previous projects, and we have prepared even more in-advance than years past.\n\n2. We are working with a highly-experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods, pre-press checkpoints, and freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We also plan to provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with experienced fulfillment partners with a wide range of options. Amazon has been immensely effective for quickly distributing our products within the USA and ShipFromChina worked very well for us with Fire of Eidolon and we expect it will again when Overworld is finished Manufacturing. \n\nAs always we will pay close attention to our shipping and manufacturing options to make sure we are making responsible decisions all the way down to the end-user's experience. We delayed Overworld's production intentionally to ensure the components could be improved to the standard that our backers expect to receive. \n\nThe only thing we are more dedicated to than the quality of our products is backer communication. We will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. We will be present daily during the project to answer any questions you have! We read every comment. We will also provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress throughout the entire journey.\n\nThank you for your confidence and support!!

As a village founder you'll invite people from all walks of life to live and work in your expanding community. If you can recruit the right people to form lucrative production chains while balancing your food production and building capacity, your village will become the most prosperous and you'll win the game!\nIn solo mode, a lone village must prosper against the machinations of the very ill-tempered Countess.\nBasic villagers - the backbone of any good village!\nStretch goals are divided into three camps: base game upgrades, expansion pack content, and upgrades to the Coin Box. Any expansion content we unlock during the campaign will be included in a free expansion pack for everyone who pledges to receive the game. The expansion pack and Coin Box will be sold separately at retail.\nNo money was exchanged for any of our reviews.\nIf you'd like to see the work-in-progress rulebook, you'll find it here.\nTom aka Slickerdrips plays through a two player game:\nVillagers is played over several rounds, each with two (or sometimes three) phases. \nIn the draft phase, players take it in turn to take villager cards from the face-up or face-down cards of the central road area. Whenever someone takes a face-up card, it is immediately replaced from the leftmost stack of face-down cards. The number of villagers a player can take in the draft phase depends on how much food their village produces. \nIn the build phase, each player places villagers from their hand into their village - putting them to work. You can play as many cards as you have builders in your village. \nThere are two market cards, tucked away under the second and sixth stacks of face-down cards on the road. When a market card is revealed, there will be a market phase this round, right after the build phase. \nDuring the market phase, players count up the total amount of gold produced by the people working in their village. At the end of the second market phase, the player with the most gold in their supply wins the game.\nAs you can see, Villagers is quite simple, but it's not that simple, there's some other stuff going on, so let's talk about...\nEach villager is part of a production chain. Villagers must be placed in the correct order in their production chains. Longer production chains give you more resources, but require more draft and build actions to put into play. \nSome villagers need special tools or equipment to start working, and they have padlocks on them. Padlocks must be unlocked by paying the bank, or a villager of the type specified - called the unlocker - 2 gold. If possible, this gold is paid direct to the unlocker, and the coins remain on their card for the rest of the game, scoring extra gold during each market phase. This interaction makes it possible to profit from what other players are doing. \nA silver coin icon indicates that some villagers score a conditional amount of gold at the end of the game. They offer many extra scoring opportunities, and you can play two of the same to double your bonus! \nSpecial villagers can make a big difference. Some are like wild cards, helping you create your production chains, while others can create scoring opportunities, or help you in the draft phase. \nIn solo mode, a lone village must stand against the evil Countess, an AI opponent who seeks to restore her former glory at any cost. The early rounds take place in Summer, but fair weather does little to lull the fury of the Countess. And when Winter comes, she really loses her temper... \nAs an optional extra we are offering a fabulous Coin Box - a set of 110 coloured & printed wooden coins to replace the cardboard coins that come with Villagers as standard, all packaged in a magnetically fastened cardboard treasure chest that fits inside the Villagers game box. \nDesign subject to change.\nWhat's more, you can use them in almost any other game that would benefit from the addition of some classy wooden coinage! Quantities and dimensions (correct at time of writing, but subject to change) are: \n30 Ones - 16 x 4mm\n30 Twos - 18 x 4mm\n10 Fives - 20 x 4mm\n10 Tens - 22 x 4mm\n15 Twenties - 24 x 4mm\n15 Fifties - 26 x 4mm\nIf you'd like extra sets of coins, click on \"Manage Your Pledge\" at the top of the page, and add the appropriate multiple of \u00a38 / \u20ac9 / US$11 / CA$14 / A$14 to your pledge amount.\nClick to go to Villagers on Tabletop Simulator (via Steam)\n                             We are shipping Villagers to backers ourselves. Armed only with a spare bedroom, a Royal Mail Business account and a can-do attitude, we will aim to get every pledge out of the door and into the postal system no more than one week after taking delivery of the games.* We're based in the UK, and Brexit hasn't happened yet, so shipping will be EU friendly.\nTo keep shipping costs low, parcels will not be tracked. Items sent within the United Kingdom will be sent by 2nd Class mail, and will take 2-3 days to arrive from the date of posting. Items for Europe will take 3-5 days, and Rest of World 5-7 days. Obviously, these are estimates, and actual delivery times can and will vary.\n\nShipping for all pledge levels is free for UK backers, and subsidised for backers anywhere else on the planet. Please make sure you enter your shipping address correctly - we cannot be held responsible for missing packages sent to incorrect addresses. You'll have a chance to double check your details and correct any errors before shipping begins.\nCurrency conversions estimated at the time of writing.\n *When this was written, before the campaign, we expected no more than 1000 backers. We have obviously surpassed that by some margin. We will still mostly fufil Villagers ourselves (besides the spare bedroom, we have a very large quadruple garage, and failing that, we'll rent some warehouse space), but it might take longer than a week. If we need to draft in extra help to get your game sent out in a reasonable timeframe, we will.\nOur current plan is to get our factory to pre-package the vast majority of games before they ship to us. The factory confirms this is something they can do. This means all we'll have to do for about 95% of pledges is print a shipping label and have Royal Mail collect from us every couple of days until we're finished. It will still be an intensive and very involved process, but nowhere near as insane as if we had to physically package every single pledge ourselves. Whatever happens, we have plenty of extra hands to call on, should we need them.\nWe will work with Snakes & Lattes to fulfil pledges to backers in Canada, and VFI for backers in China. It is also possible that we will use an Australian fulfilment company for Australia and New Zealand, and we'll do our best to prevent anyone from having to pay import fees & customs charges.\nWe'll communicate the entire process via project updates, photos, videos, psychic waves etc.\nWe are pleased to have BackerKit as our pledge management partner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first rodeo for Sinister Fish Games. It's our second, go us! Maybe second-and-a-half, if you count the Removable Sticker Set for Gloomhaven, which is a large and ongoing project, but wasn't on Kickstarter.\n\nWe have a good working relationship with our Chinese manufacturer, Whatz Games, who we worked with on Great Scott! and the Removable Sticker Set for Gloomhaven. They'll be taking care of the international freight shipping. We literally give them an address, pay them some money, and games appear a few weeks later. It's a pretty sweet deal.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter project, the usual risks apply. Things can and do get delayed for a multitude of possible reasons. The estimated fulfilment date of February 2019 allows some buffer time for mishaps to happen in, so you might get your stuff before then. Whatever happens, we will keep you in the loop via project updates.\n\nI should probably mention that my partner is expecting our first child at the end of July. At that point I will mainly just be coordinating with Haakon (designer & artist of Villagers) and the factory, which won't be a 24/7 job, so things should still run fairly smoothly.

You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\nFantastic Factories is a dice placement, engine building tabletop game for 1 to 5 players and takes 45 to 60 minutes to play. Players build a set of factories into their compound and then roll dice to use as workers. With over 35 different blueprints, you can discover endless inventive and creative ways your factories can work together. \nDifferent factories have different worker requirements. Some require a pair of matching dice. Some require a specific value. You aren't stuck with what you roll, though. With training facilities you can manipulate the values of your dice in order to figure out the optimal placement of all your workers! Each turn is a satisfying puzzle to solve. \nThere are over 35 unique buildings!\n                                                                             28 dice (16mm) (4 red, 4 blue, 4 green, 4 yellow, 4 purple, and 8 white)\n50 energy resource tokens\n30 metal* resource tokens (*clarification: represents metal resources in the game but made out of chipboard)\n85 goods tokens\n4 tool label tokens\n78 blueprint cards\n18 contractor cards\n1 first player token\n5 player boards and player aids\n Fantastic Factories comes with over 40 unique blueprint and contractor cards, ensuring each game is a fresh and new experience with lots of replayability.\nPromo Cards\nPledge now to receive 4 bonus blueprints and 1 bonus contractor!\nKickstarter backers will also receive 5 promotional cards FREE! After the Kickstarter campaign these cards will only be available at conventions or through other exceptional means. \nPlease note that the art and components are not completely finalized and may change slightly.\nIn Fantastic Factories, your goal is to build the most prestigious buildings and manufacture the most goods. Players start with 4 blueprints and some resources (1 metal, 2 energy). Players also have 4 colored dice that act as their workers.\nMarket Phase\nEach round begins with the market phase. On your turn you either select a face-up blueprint to add into your hand for free or discard a card to hire the corresponding contractor. Contractors have unique effects that allow you do things such as roll additional dice or gain resources. \nTake a blueprint or hire a contractor.\nOnce all players have taken a turn, the work phase begins. \nExample of some contractors you can hire.\nWork Phase\nDuring the work phase players take their turns simultaneously. You start by rolling your dice. Then you can take various actions in any order. \nYou can place your workers on a set of basic actions to gain more resources or draw cards:\nBasic actions let you draw cards and gain resources.\nYou can build cards by discarding another card with the same tool symbol and paying the resource cost: \nBuilding a Nuclear Plant.\nAnd finally you can activate your cards (yes, even on the same turn you built it!). Training facilities help you get the correct value workers to run your factories. \nSequencing your actions correctly can allow you to maximize your turn!\nOnce all players are finished with their turns, the round is complete, and another one begins with the market phase again. If any players have manufactured 12 or more goods or have built 10 or more cards, the following round is the final round.\nSolo Game\nFantastic Factories supports playing solo. You still get to build awesome combinations of factories and strategize where best to place your workers. The only difference is you will be competing against a simple but efficient opponent known as \"The Machine\". The Machine is easily managed and guided by dice rolls and can be adjusted for varying levels of challenge. More details can be found in the rulebook. \nFantastic Factories is that perfect mix of approachability and strategic depth. The mechanics and rules are simple but the creative combinations of factories and numerous ways you can manipulate your dice make each game feel new and fresh. We've played the game more than 300 times, and we still enjoy playing it. \nWith simultaneous play, each game takes an hour or less so you know you'll be able to get it to the table time and time again and even play games back to back. With so many viable strategies to pursue, you'll be exploring the depths of Fantastic Factories for many games.\nSome of you may be waiting for the game to hit retail stores instead of pledging now. We would love to be in retail but getting the attention of distributors largely depends on the success of the Kickstarter campaign. There is a very real possibility that Fantastic Factories may never be available at retail outside of retailers who choose to back the Kickstarter. We know there's always risk in backing a Kickstarter so as a thanks for joining us on this journey, we've priced the pledge levels below our anticipated MSRP and are also including promo cards that will not be widely available through retailers that receive the game through distribution.\nRetailers\nInterested retailers should back at the retailer pledge level. We plan on charging standard retailer pricing and delivering the games well before normal distribution (if we even end up with a distributor). After you pledge, we will reach out with details about pricing. If you choose not to purchase for any reason we can refund your deposit pledge. Beyond the initial pledge there is no money due until just before fulfillment at which time you can specify your desired quantity and we will invoice you. The MSRP of the game will be $40. If you are a retailer and have any questions you can send us an email at retail@fantasticfactories.com.\nCheck out this 3 player full playthrough by JonGetsGames: \nYou can also see Jambalaya go through the first few rounds of a SOLO game:\nFantastic Factories is available on both Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia.

You can find the latest rulebook here. \nWhat are stretch goals? Meeting our funding goal allows us to place an order with our manufacturer for the minimum order quantity. However, the more quantity we order, the cheaper it is to manufacture each individual copy. We reinvest these savings into upgrading the components of the game. That means the more funding we receive, the better the game will be for you! Sharing this project with people you know helps us improve the game.\nPlease note that our stretch goals for the game itself are component upgrades ONLY. We do not believe in additional content or gameplay as stretch goals because we have thoroughly play tested the game with all the content that we believe is necessary for a balanced game and the best possible gameplay experience. No more. No less.\nDigital Puzzle Book Stretch Goal\nWe'd like to release a printable PDF that includes a curated selection of One Turn Puzzles and solutions.\nOn July 6, if there are 50 or more puzzles on the BGG forum AND 200 or more thumbs up collectively on the puzzles, we will release a PDF puzzle book complete with final art and layout. We will also credit each puzzle creator in this book. There are already 10+ puzzles and 20+ thumbs up in the forum right now.\nBut there are only a few short days before the campaign ends! That's why we are extending the deadline of this stretch goal to July 6th. That's still only a short week and a half away so don't wait too long to get involved.\nWhen we were selected for the PAX South Indie Showcase in January 2017, we were faced with a conundrum. How could we possibly demo our 1 hour game to the masses on the show floor of PAX?\nAnd that's how we came up with the Puzzles. They are literally snapshots of a single turn in Fantastic Factories, taken at the moment right after you've rolled your dice. The challenge is the same as your final turn in the full game: make as many points as possible, given these dice, resources, and buildings in your compound.\nHere are a couple of them, see if you can figure them out!\nInstructions: Manufacture as many Goods as possible by assigning the dice (with values as shown). Each building card has an ability on its bottom half that you may use, but you may not use the same building twice.\n(Note: you can ignore the build costs in the top left corner of the cards. These cards have been pre-built for you)\nAn Introductory Puzzle\nDojo flips a die to its opposite side. Warehouse requires 3 dice, and those dice must sum to 14 or more.\nSee solution.\nAnother Puzzle!\nManufacture as many goods as possible!\n See solution.\nSolve More Puzzles, and Create Your Own!\nDiscover (and try to solve) more puzzles on our forum on Board Game Geek (some of them are challenging).\nAlso, check out this post to find out how you can create and share your own Fantastic Factories One Turn Puzzle for others to try to solve!\nIf enough people submit puzzles by July 6, then Joseph and I will put together a printable PDF of the best puzzles (with solutions) so you can bring them to game night!

They have a great reputation as experts in shipping and will be assisting us with coordinating shipping games across the world. As a result, shipping will be EU, AUS, and CAN friendly with no additional VAT being charged separately to backers. \nShipping is one of the most expensive parts of bringing a Kickstarter game to life. We estimate that shipping within the US will cost $12 per game, but we wanted to subsidize the shipping and split the cost with our backers. That means US backers will only be charged $6 for shipping for a single copy and we will cover the other $6. For non-US backers, we will still subsidize the shipping costs for $6 but the shipping cost to backers will vary by region. To see the shipping cost to your region, select the pledge level and then select your region.\nTwo Pack Bundle\nWe know that even with the subsidy that shipping can still be a lot. That's why we are also offering a pledge level for 2-game bundles at a significantly lower shipping price per game. For example a 2-game bundle being shipped to the EU would save you $11.\n3+ Copies\nIf you want to order more than 2 copies of Fantastic Factories, you can select the Two-Pack Bundle pledge and pledge an additional amount:\nFor Continental US/EU/Norway/Canada/AUS/China you should pledge for the Two-Pack Bundle and then add an additional $31 for each extra copy you want (this amount includes the additional shipping). \nFor Alaska/Hawaii, add $37 per extra copy.\nFor Puerto Rico, add $36 per extra copy.\nFor New Zealand, add $36 per extra copy. \nFor Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan, add $33 per extra copy. \nAnd for the rest of the world, add $40 per extra copy. \nWe are not offering any group buy discounts outside of the shipping savings.\nFor example, if you live in Belgium, the Two-Pack Bundle is $56 plus $15 shipping (total of $71). If you would like 4 copies of the game, you would add $31 for each additional copy so your pledge should be for a total of $133.\nIf you are currently pledged at the Retailer pledge level but are not a retailer, please switch your pledge to the Two-Pack Bundle and adjust your pledge amount for the quantity you want.\nWho are we?

Sprawlopolis is growing and YOU are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center, it\u2019s you.  \nIn Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice.\n\nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.  \nIn this game, you will try to keep Parks away from the edges, line up lots of  Commercial blocks in a row or column, and create roads that connect your Parks.   \nBut not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.  \nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible.   \nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.   \nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap, so each road will cost you points in the end.   \nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.   \nCan you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\nSprawlopolis is the next game in our ongoing Wallet Line. Simply 18 cards and rules, packed into a small wallet for maximum portability.\nWe sent out a handful of review copies and the reviews are glowing. Here's a selection, but there are also podcasters, instagram(ers?), and others praising the game.  \nFULL REVIEW: https://thethoughtfulgamer.com/2018/05/11/sprawlopolis-review/ \nFULL REVIEW: http://www.everythingboardgames.com/2018/05/sprawlopolis-kickstarter-preview.html \nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2018/05/14/sprawlopolis/ \nFULL REVIEW: https://openseatgaming.com/2018/05/11/kickstarter-preview-sprawlopolis/ \n FULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2018/5/17/the-cardboard-hoard-review-of-sprawlopolis\nFULL REVIEW: https://gameosity.com/2018/05/16/sprawlopolis-kickstarter-preview/\nFULL REVIEW: https://singlehandedlydotblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/build-a-city/\nWe are offering a few things. Sprawlopolis in both PNP and physical game, as well as Circle The Wagons (a competitive 2 player game by the same designers that shares a similar variable scoring method with Sprawlopolis), an Instant Collection of Button Shy games, an Instant Collection with a collector's box, a retail level for stores that want to be one of the very few that carries our wallet games, and a standard and deluxe subscription to our Board Game of the Month Club (scroll down for full details on the club).\n\nCheck out the list below and contact us with any questions. \nIf you don't have Circle The Wagons, it is a MUST HAVE two player game. It's our highest rated game on Board Game Geek and our best selling game of 2017 and 2018. We're also offering Lone Cowboy, a 6 card set of solo scenarios for all of our solo friends.\nReview: https://whatsericplaying.com/2018/04/02/circle-the-wagons/\n The first stretch goal is up!\nNext up is Construction Zones, a 4 card expansion that adds a little wrinkle to your city planning.\nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of three things.\nUse the INSTANT COLLECTION reward levels to get 3 extra games.

We've highlighted some prominent games, but there is a lot more than we could even note here.\nYou may know the designers (Steven Aramini, Danny Devine and Paul Kluka) from their previous Button Shy game, Circle The Wagons and it's IDW reimplementation X-Files: Circle of Truth, but they have a handful of other games that you may have in your collection right now!  \nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. Here's a look at what we're doing right now:\nAnd here's a peek at what's coming next month.\nOur $5 June package includes the next episode of Timestamp, a time-travel game that takes place on a single postcard. Each episode is fully playable on its own, and supporters receive PNP links to previous episodes. It also includes Banned Books: Jerry, the next character in our expanding series Banned Books. All supporters receive the Banned Books base game in their first package. It's a solo game of literary characters trying to get their books un-banned. And finally it includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Legends of Dsyx Roll and Write Game: Seascrapers. Legends of Dsyx is an ongoing roll & write series where each game is set in the same kingdom, but the games play very differently.\n\nOur $10 June package includes all of those and Tornado Chase, a 9-card dice-drafting game of tornado-chasing tactics. Two players jockey for position while avoiding being swept away in the storm.\n\nAnd our $20 June package includes all of the above and a copy of  Sprawlopolis and all stretch goals (or the wallet game of your choice).\n Come join us at either Patreon or buttonshygames.com:\nhttp://patreon.com/buttonshy\nhttps://buttonshygames.com/products/board-game-of-the-month-club-basic-subscription", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nReleasing games each month has established a groove with the manufacturer.

Do you like them? Do you even know them? What are they doing right now? Wouldn't it be nice not to have any? Or, are they there when you need to borrow something?\nWell, you might like them, or you might not. But one thing is certain. You probably would not appreciate it if they stepped into your garden when you're away on holiday and try to mess with it, right?\nThis, and managing his bee population is what Mr. Cabbagehead has to deal with in between holidays, when he is planting his garden in anticipation of the Garden Committee's visit.\nJoin us in creating this beautiful game full of victorian-era illustrations, some of which are not pleasantly disturbing. Join us in Mr. Cabbahead's Garden!\nMr. Cabbagehead's garden is a simple, yet sometimes frustratingly challenging game. It is designed by Todd Sanders, who was inspired by a day spent in the library looking at books of victorian seed catalogs that featured some very quirky anthropomorphic vegetables\nCombining his love of gardening and his passion for unconventional game design, he created a game to match the style of these lovable curmudgeons that beckoned Victorians to garden.\nMr. Cabbagehead's Garden was first released as a solo-play-only Print & Play that quickly intrigued gamers on BoardGameGeek, and has been played and enjoyed as such since 2016.\nSince then Todd has continuously refined the game, and after a period of development within LudiCreations, we are pleased to be able to present it for a high-quality print run, as befits a game as iconic as this.\nImprovements include rules for 2 players, a rebalancing of point values, a clarification of the flow of the game and an update of the graphic design. Combined with endowing it with high quality materials such as linen-finished cards and cardboard, the boxed commercial release of Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden is something we are very proud to bring to you.  \nIn doing so, we would like to complete Todd's vision and offer game new content. This includes The New Neighbours, 6 new tiresome busybodies who can't wait to mess with Mr. C's beautiful garden. It also includes the Grasshopper expansion, and the Romancing Eudora expansion.\nAll cardboard is 2 mm thick, and all cards are 320 gsm. All surfaces are linen-finished.\n We have partnered with Dogmight, your friendly local viking berserker woodworkers to bring you something they are clearly crazy enough and talented enough to even dare to make:\nThe ultra-deluxe custom-made wooden Prestige Box\n For more details, please check out this backer update!\nIn Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden you will be planting your garden in a 3 x 6 grid of Vegetable cards. In each of the game's 3 rounds there is a Planting phase and a Neighbour phase.\nIn the Planting phase, you draw 3 cards from the deck of Vegetables. You plant one in the garden grid, and then draw Neighbour tokens according to the values of the other two cards.\nIn the Neighbour phase, the Neighbour with the most matching tokens is the one who visits and interferes with the garden, removing or moving Vegetable cards.\nAt the end of the game, the garden is ready for evaluation. The more vegetables of the same kind you have, the better! And if you really want the coveted Blue Ribbon, you better arrange them in aestheticallly pleasing patterns!\nFor more detail, here's Bebo with a rules overview:\nEach of the included expansions also adds something, ranging from a huge jump in variability with the 6 New Neighbours, to an increase in difficulty with the Grasshoppers and a modular bonus possibilities with Romancing Eudora. All that and more are explained in the rules linked below.\nAs usual, we offer you the chance to try the game before you back the campaign. The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\nYou can download the rules of the game here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026).

If you find any mistakes, please use this form to submit them: https://goo.gl/forms/jTFX4bDRvO7cuejD2\nPlease note that the following videos depict prototype components, some of which may be fairly old. The game has been developed over a period of years, both in its graphic design and in the values of various cards and scoring bonuses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnApjD6C8zw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYYm7vxogc\nRunthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24hexXxlaY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICW4QfIRUy0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKOWvolaC60\nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. Todd is well known as a designer of solo board games. Many of his games have already been published, including IUNU and They Who Were 8, the first two in the Sanders Select Series of games by Ludicreations.\nEven though Todd has been designing games for several years, he has never been at Spiel. This, even after 2 of his games have debuted there. Travel & accommodation there are not cheap, as we have certainly experienced in the past few years.\nGiven that this year Todd expects to see at least 2 more games being published and shown there, we wanted to do what we can so he can get to Essen, and with your help we hope to cover some of his expenses.\nIf you would like to contribute and get some really special rewards prepared by Todd, simply pledge at the $34 level. Todd and we would be very, very grateful for your support!\nThe special rewards include:\nA postcard from by Todd, signed & sent to you!\nA special promo Neighbour for Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden. This will be designed in full view of backers of that level. We do not like exclusives, but if we sell it later, we will give profits to Todd.\n5 Daily vlogs from Essen, right from the exhibitor floor, and possibly some other places too! Probably not live, since the connection there is terrible.\nPlaying a game with Todd! Quite a few of Todd's games are on Tabletopia, and they are free to play. At some point or another, Todd will play a game with you, either one-on-one or as part of a group. This would have to be up to Todd's availability and time zone issues. LudiCreations games on Tabletopia are free to play!\nPlease note that there is always the possibility that due to any unforeseen circumstances, Todd does not make it to Essen. If that happens, we will still be able to fulfill the above in the best way we can. Postcards can still be sent, promos made, vlogging from Todd might be from his design space, and Tabletopia is still happening as it normally would.\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, and the rewards bound for EU and other countries from Germany. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 16 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 19 USD / 25 CAD / 25 AUD / 19 CHF / 2101 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained.\nUnfortunately, we are not able to make bulk shipments.\nWe are not able to ship to some countries during the campaign. If your country does not appear on the list after you click the reward in which you are interested, please send us a message via KS.\nThe Prestige Box will be shipped separately from the game material, from the USA. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees related to it.\nThe shipping cost for the game is 5 USD worldwide.\nThe shipping costs for the Prestige Box are:\nUSA: 12 USD\nCanada: 25 USD\nOther countries: 35 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We already go to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nRetail availability: We have no idea. This is a weird game. Past experience shows that this type of game rarely finds its way to stores, but we can not make any guarantees either way.\nSPIEL availability: We intend to sell the game at the SPIEL trade fair in Essen. We do not yet know the price, but we are confident we will have very few copies there.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\n Game design, graphic design, visual identity: Todd Sanders\nTabletopia implementation: Viktor Csete\nAudiovisual support: Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen\nSpecial Thanks: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou, Brittanie \"Bebo\" Boe, Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan, those Victorian illustrators, and many, many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll 2017 campaigns have been fulfilled. The CRISIS: The New Economy campaign is in the production phase. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know. Informal currency conversions made on this campaign may not be accurate by the time you read this, and therefore result in seemingly cheaper prices further in the future. Warning: Please practice safe gardening. Avoid sticking sharp tools into any squishy things, even if they deserved it those bastards who keep stealing m- your vegetables. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this game are fictitious, maybe.

A land with a glorious past, a most uncertain present, and an even more unpredictable future. \nNow a member of an Economic Union, it has fallen on hard times, and its people are suffering. Corruption, inefficiency, and incompetence have a real human cost, as political tensions continue to increase.\nHowever, all is not lost. A group of investors (that some would call opportunistic) have seen this as an opening, a chance to build their own future. \nThe players take on the role of these investors, who seek to bail out struggling businesses, recruit employees, raise capital, and produce goods for export.\nShady business deals can win influence or grease the right palms, but players must be careful - cutting too many corners is inefficient and hurts the overall economy. In fact, it may even lead to bankruptcy for Axia and an early end for the game. \nBut, with hard work and a focus on the future, the winner must seize opportunities where others see only crisis! \nThe reprint of CRISIS is only for the Deluxe edition. It contains the same components as the first print run. Minor changes have been made to the rulebook (capitalization, FAQ) and to some cards (wording, clarifications). The rules of the game remain the same. \nCrisis is a game for 1-5 players that takes 45-120 minutes.\nFor more details on the components and rules of Crisis, download the rules here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026). Please download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. This file is the low-resolution version of the final rules document. \nIf you find any mistakes, please send us a message via the KS messaging system (we can't track responses in the comments section).\nThe first expansion for Crisis is here! \nIt contains 15 new Company cards, each meant to replace one Company in the base game. However, not all are used in each game, dramatically increasing replayability.\nThe fantastic illustrations for the new Company cards have been beautifully crafted by Anthony Cournoyer, the talented illustrator of the base game (and of Diesel Demolition Derby, and of Long Live the Queen's dieselpunk edition, and many more).\nYou can download the rules card for the expansion here. \nThis small new expansion forms the basis for much more content in the future, and we plan to put out more substantial, boxed expansions once we have fully developed and playtested them.\nLa version Deluxe de CRISIS et l\u2019extension La Nouvelle \u00c9conomie sont maintenant disponibles en version fran\u00e7aise, \u00e9dit\u00e9es par Geek Attitude Games.\nL\u2019extension ne sera pas disponible en boutique.\nUne pr\u00e9sentation fran\u00e7aise du Kickstarter est disponible sur le site de Geek Attitude Games.\nT\u00e9l\u00e9chargez les r\u00e8gles (non d\u00e9finitives) de CRISIS et La Nouvelle \u00c9conomie.\nVous pouvez \u00e9galement d\u00e9couvrir les r\u00e8gles de CRISIS en vid\u00e9o :\n Pour toute question, une seule adresse : info@geekattitudegames.com\nWe have been able to, for the first time, develop our own German edition for a game! We are currently proofreading the language-dependent components: the rulebook, the events cards and the influence cards. \nIn the post-campaign survey, you will be able to choose to receive the German edition of the base game and of the expansion.\nCheck out a review in german here:\nWe are also working on a german-language conversion kit for the backers of the first print run.\nWould you like to try the game? We have both a Vassal module and Tabletopia implementations! \nYou can find the Vassal module, handcrafted with love, here. You can get the latest version of Vassal here. Apologies, this does not contain the expansion.\nYou can find he Tabletopia implementation here.\nNote that some videos below show prototype components which were created before the first campaign for the game. \nThe game may look really good in these videos, but know that the final product is even better (rigid cards, appropriately-sized wooden tokens, etc.).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDT8nD088ro\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQbjCJKCPBk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKDkoa3HJYo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCOibZkgOWc \nFor the main runthrough video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n88T4s77MNA\nFor the extended game play video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aCYjMe-PWE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4aZHVV3JnI \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQhMEwBihko \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9iwXIooQHY \nBesides his final thoughts, the Vitruvian Gamer filmed his entire playthrough: \nIntro + round 1: https://youtu.be/KfFQvIJ53sw \nRounds 2 & 3: https://youtu.be/np9dR3UGNro\nRounds 4 & 5: https://youtu.be/ZUmROgpHawA\nRounds 6 & 7, final thoughts: https://youtu.be/86wcuK7OTDw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__5n5ZJhyOE \nYou can also see ConnectMore's \"Avoid The Rules\" video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0kscIKj94s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNeBiKXPkc \nhttps://vimeo.com/173257588 \nMore rounds & opinion: https://vimeo.com/173271788\n(21:25 onwards) https://thefiveby.fireside.fm/32\n(01:14:57 onwards) http://punchingcardboard.com/?p=863\nhttps://brokenmeeple.blogspot.com/2016/07/crisis-preview-kickstarter-its-12.html \nhttp://www.cardboardrepublic.com/preview/on-crisis \nhttp://www.creakingshelves.com/crisis-review\nhttp://www.devondice.co.uk/crisis_preview/ \nhttp://goplaylisten.com/games/one-play-crisis/ \n(16:00 onwards) https://www.heavycardboard.com/episodelist/2016/08/24/heavy-cardboard-episode-52-amandas-top-50-edwards-top-50 \nhttp://www.polyhedroncollider.com/2016/07/crisis-kickstarter-review.html  \n                                (click here or on the image above for a high resolution photo)\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, and the rewards bound for EU and other countries from Germany. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT. \nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 45 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 59 USD / 75 CAD / 76 AUD / 55 CHF / 6224 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained. \nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for the period of the campaign. We reserve the right to charge higher shipping costs during the pre-order period and beyond. We are not able to make bulk shipments. Other costs that we bear may also include packing materials, labor, freight, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases.\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nCRISIS: The New Economy expansion\nWorldwide: 2 USD. Real cost: 4.59 USD (3,70 EUR)\nCRISIS deluxe edition\nEU: 9 USD. Real cost: 11.04 USD (8,89 EUR)\nUSA: 9 USD. Real cost: 11.70 (estimate based on offers)\nWorldwide: 14 USD. Real cost: 19.73 USD (15,89 EUR)\nExamples:\nCrisis deluxe to the UK: 9 USD\nCrisis deluxe + expansion to the UK: 11 USD\nCrisis deluxe to the USA: 9 USD \nCrisis deluxe + expansion to the USA: 11 USD\nCrisis deluxe to Canada: 14 USD\nCrisis deluxe + expansion to Canada: 16 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\n(Yes, we subsidize worldwide rewards by 3 USD more. We are nice like that. EU/USA backers, you will probably be getting yours much more quickly. Hopefully that is enough consolation.)\nWe also have to pay 3-5 USD for materials, packing and handling - also something that you do not have to pay, resulting in discounts of 30-60%, depending on location and number of shipments. Individually it may not seem like a lot, but multiplied by thousands of packages, it represents a significant cost.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list.\nWe expect to have tracking for the USA, but not for anywhere else. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. We do not expect to be sending tracking codes when the games are shipped.\nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that add-ons and/or stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We intend to print with the highest quality materials, and we let you, our fans, decide which version you want. \nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nWe do not offer add-ons (not even our other games) during the campaign, because we want to keep our operations simple and deliver efficiently. We will however be able to offer a post-campaign chance to obtain other games, if stock levels and our operations allow. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we would disappoint *all* backers. We have a reputation for shipping on time or early, and this is how we minimize the risk of missing our deadlines.\nRetail availability: We hope to put the game in shops, with the intended MSRP of 70 USD. However, we do not guarantee that you will be able to find it in retail, just like the game's first print run.\nSPIEL availability: We intend to sell the game at the SPIEL trade fair in Essen. We do not yet know the price, but we are confident we will have very few copies there.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\nGame Design: Pantelis Bouboulis & Sotirios Tsantilas  \nIllustration: Anthony Cournoyer \nGraphic Design: Sami Laakso, Viktor Csete & Heiko G\u00fcnther \nVassal Module: Mindy Getch & Sotirios Tsantilas \nTabletopia Implementation: Alvin Chen & Viktor Csete\nSpecial Thanks: Alvin Chen, Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan, Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou, Brittanie \"Bebo\" Boe, and many, many more.\nLudiCreations is a publisher of such novel games as \u2026and then, we held hands, ESSEN, Kune v Lakia, Pocket Imperium, [redacted], and Town Center.

We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know.

In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they will move on a modular board, allowing for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.\nThe rules are simple: Each turn a player has to move one of his ships in a straight line, as many spaces (star systems) as he wants but he cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After his move, he has to place a Colony or Trade Station on that system, thus gaining control over that system for until the end of the game, for which he will get an amount of points. When all of the players placed their Colonies and Trade Stations, the game ends and points are calculated. The player with the most points is the winner!\nWith these extremely simple rules, players will get into the game from the very start and they will immediately immerse in the depths of the tactical and strategic choices they will need to make, in order to score more efficiently at the end of the game.\n Social Stretch Goal is still active!\nHelp us spread the word around for the campaign by sharing the posts below and for each 20 shares + retweets we will include another Technology card!\nSharing this Facebook post on your timeline: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/smallstarempires/posts/1857701910957675\nRetweeting this post: https://twitter.com/ArchonaGames/status/994663787151192067\nAdditionally, we will be including another Technology card for each AUD $1000 that will be above the AUD $93.000 mark, or more precisely above the final stretch goal! \n To see more details on what the Fate of the Galaxy is all about, check out this Kickstarter Update!\nNew Add-on: TILES and 2 NEW CIVILIZATIONS!\nMake your epic Small Star Empires gaming nights even more epic by including this 5th and 6th player expansion! \n\nAlso, if you buy both the Deluxe 5-6 player expansion AND the wooden component set, you will get the 5-6 player wooden expansion set FOR FREE!\nCivilizations overview\n                                                             Get to know the Civilizations and their Unique Abilities on our blog post here:\nhttp://www.archonagames.com/2018/04/18/the-civilizations-of-the-galactic-divide/\nFor more information on Galactic Warlords visit our BGG Page\n                                       Download the RULES of the Base game HERE.Download the DRAFT RULES of the Expansions HERE.Download the Supermassive Black Hole mini-expansion rules HERE.\nDownload the EPIC GAME MODE rules HERE.\nDownload a Print and Play of a single scenario of the Solo Campaign HERE.\nCheck out Milan's overview of Small Star Empires at Essen Spiel 2016 by BoardGameGeekTV:\n And check out this overview of the expansions:\n Check out the companion Score Keeper app that is available for both Android and iOS!\nDownload the app for Android, or iOS.\n Watch The Dice Tower's review here:\n Watch Undead Viking's review here:\n Read I'm a Social Gamer's review HERE.\nWatch Epitrapaizoume's video review here:\n  Watch Life of a Board Gamer's review for Small Star Empires here:\nRetailers and Group Pledges  \nFor retail and group pledge orders, please write to us at contact@archonagames.com.

The overview video shown below is from Rahdo Runs Through and covers the original Villages of Valeria game. It does not include any of the Landmarks content, but it's a great way to get to know the original game if it's new to you.\nSo, what does Landmarks bring to Villages of Valeria? The primary new mechanic is a new follow opportunity called \"Build A Landmark\". \nWe heard from a lot of players, and the mechanic they like the most is being able to follow the active player's lead action. Rick and Isaias decided to amp up this mechanic by giving you another option besides just following the lead action. \nWith Landmarks, if you cannot or choose not to follow the lead action, you can build a landmark as your follow action.You simply discard a specific card from your hand and, based on the resource icon at the bottom of the Building card, you take a certain landmark token and place it on your castle card. For example, discard a Building card with a Food resource at the bottom to establish a Silo as a Landmark in your village.\nLandmark tokens do not count as Buildings, but at the end of the game, the player with the most of each type of Landmark will earn victory points! For each set of all five different Landmarks you've collected, you'll gain even more victory points. \nThe Landmarks expansion also comes with new Adventurer cards that trigger on the Landmarks you've collected, new Building cards to grow your village with cool new powers, and all-new Architect cards to award hidden end-game bonus points!\nIncrease your Landmark holdings, leverage the new Buildings, attract the new Adventurers, and show your rivals what a proper village looks like!\nDownload the PNP files linked farther down this page to read the rules for all of the details.\nA Note About Solo Play: The Villages of Valeria base game supports solo play and the new Landmarks expansion contains 49 cards that will meld with the base game and support solo play (assuming all the stretch goals are unlocked). However, the new \"Landmarks\" mechanic itself does not support solo play. It requires at least two players because much of the mechanic depends upon the brinksmanship of players trying to outmaneuver each other in the acquisition and mix of landmark tokens.\nThe Deluxe custom tokens you receive with your pledged rewards will not be included in the retail version of the Landmarks expansion. That version will have wood block tokens. We may make the custom tokens available as a separate purchase via the BoardGameGeek Store after Landmarks has been released in 2019.\nIn 2016, we offered Villages of Valeria in a Deluxe Box that could hold everything made at that time, even with sleeved cards. In 2018, our expansion ideas outgrew the Deluxe Box, so we're now offering the Landmarks expansion with a VOV Big Box, especially for card sleevers.\nThe VOV Big Box has 206mm of card storage, that's 1.75x the capacity of the Deluxe Box, and it features 8 token wells that should accommodate event the fussiest organizers.\nThe playmat shown above can be added to any pledge level of $19 or above by increasing your total pledge by $25.\nThe Deluxe Pack above can be added to any pledge level of $19 or above by increasing your total pledge by $16. If you already have the Villages of Valeria Deluxe or are pledging here for the Deluxe Catch Up, you do not have to add this on as it's already in your box.\nCongrats on Unlocking ALL of our Stretch Goals!\nThe reviews and videos shown below are for the original Villages of Valeria game. They do not include any of the Landmarks expansion components.\n                                                                                                   The PDF file linked in the graphic below is FREE to download and requires the base Villages of Valeria game to play. The file contains the cards we used while developing the Landmarks expansion and do not include final art. In this PNP file, the 35 landmark tokens are replaced with 35 landmark cards for your convenience.\nBefore you pledge, please take a look at this flowchart to help you determine which pledge level is best for you.\nBacker rewards will ship from hubs in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia to reduce the likelihood of backers having to pay VAT and import duties to receive their packages.\nEarly-ship copies of VOV Standard and VOV Deluxe from the Catch Up pledge levels WILL be shipped from the USA warehouse. It is possible that international backers could incur additional charges to receive these packages. To avoid this risk, we recommend that you buy the Villages of Valeria base game at your local game store wherever possible. It is widely available and you can get the Bonus Pack from the BGG store.\nPlease see Update #2 for details on how and when the Deluxe Pack Add On will be shipped.\n                                                                                                                                                     Daily Magic Games has spent the last three years building a community of gamers here on Kickstarter and we want to give those loyal backers an opportunity to get a special copy of Landmarks with custom Landmarks tokens that won't be in the retail version.\nIf you've missed out on any of our recent Game projects, you can pre-order Kickstarter versions from our Pre-Orders Page.  \nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.\nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer \nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer \nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer \nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner \nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer \nWe're based in Seattle, Washington and like to promote the growth of game design in the Pacific Northwest.

We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design files for Villages of Valeria: Landmarks are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delivered.

When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!  \nA Challenging Single Player Game- In Stuff of Nightmares you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging! \nAn Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!\nA Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Stuff of Nightmares can support a four-player tournament out of a single box!

Players must decide if they should save tools for an epic late game point swing or grab points now to take an early lead. \nAI Variants: Experience the excitement of Fire in the Library on your own with the solo game or spice up a multi-player match by adding new challengers.\nHistory is burning\u2014take chances, be brave, SAVE BOOKS!\n See the rest of Gameosity's review here. \nYou can see Jeremy's full review here. \n Below is the How to Play video: \n Below is a full playthrough video: \n Below is the How to Play for the solo version: \nEach round of Fire in the Library begins with each player obtaining a turn order card. Turn order cards contain safe and risky spaces for different strategies.\nPlay then moves to the Saving Books phase where each player, in turn order, draws tokens from a bag to see what they save. If you stop, you\u2019ll score points for any books you save and earn points for bravery if you stopped on a risky space. Books will increase in value as Sections of the Library burn down. \nWatch out! Pressing your luck while Saving Books may pull out fire tokens. Pull two fire tokens out\u2014or just one in a risky space\u2014and things will all go up in flames as the fire spreads! Sections of the Library will collapse based on the tokens you pulled during the Saving Books phase if you've pressed your luck too far. This can cause more Fire tokens to be added to the bag, as well as increasing the value of the burned Sections. \nFortunately, not everything is left up to luck. As a resourceful librarian, you have tools at your disposal. You start with two and may gain more during the course of the game. All of the tools provide new options for saving  books, changing the odds, or giving more opportunities to press your luck.\n Once each player has taken a turn, the Round is over and the fire continues to grow. Burn a Section of the Library by setting aside the Library card that has the lowest Burn Index Number (smaller number on the Library card).   \nThe game ends IMMEDIATELY when the last Library card for any one Section of the Library is removed. The player with the highest score, wins!\nRules, Print and Play, and TableTop Simulator\nYou can learn from the full rules here: http://fitl.sale/rules (The rules are not final and will be formatted professionally in the final game).

We'd love to get the games to the libraries and other locations that could use them. \nThe Gift backing levels will also come with an additional laser cut Fire in the Library gift token as a thank you for thinking about others!  There will be two tokens made, the Library Hero token for anyone who gifts at least one game and the Super Library Hero for those who gift at least three. \nAdd-Ons\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, click the Manage Your Pledge button, click the Change Your Pledge button, then update the pledge amount. \nThe Jumbo Laser Cut Token Add-On will come with a set of Tarot sized Turn Order cards to fit the tokens.  Shipping is included for US backers, but if you're outside the US, you should add an additional $2 for shipping for each token or bag add-on.\nUltra Edition of Fire in the Library\nThis Ultra Edition is very special and unique; we'll make a few more than are backed here, but we'll never make a large number of them. Each one will have a unique token that only you will get. These are going to be handcrafted and put together in the US. This will complement the base Fire in the Library game and if you back for the Ultra Version, you will receive both the Ultra and base game. This means you can mix and match the components as you wish to create the game experience that you want. \nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach four out of the five social goals and we'll add a Bravest Librarian card to the game! If we meet all five goals, we'll include a special promo card in the game, as well! \nHere's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post,Twitter, Twitter tweet. \nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Fire in the Library is that we currently have no plans to put this game into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.  \nKickstarter Limited \u2013 Fire in the Library might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions.\nHelp Us Improve Fire in the Library \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality of the components and add more content to the game for everyone! \nSubsidized Shipping \u2013  $5 shipping to the USA,  $10 to the EU and Canada and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs. \nDiscounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost. \nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT fees for backers. \nMost importantly, without you, Fire in the Library would not get created. We definitely appreciate every backer\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Fire in the Library to retailers during the campaign. Back the project for $1, send us a message, and we'll get back to you! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping costs differ based on your location:  \n$5 for the United States \n$10 for the EU, Canada, and Australia \n$15 for the rest of the world \nWe are still working on the fulfillment strategy with several potential fulfillment partners to get Fire in the Library to you the proper way, with fulfillment partners in different parts of the world which will be chosen closer to shipping, as things tend to change over time. We intend to personally be shipping out the copies that have destinations within the United States. \n To order a second copy of Fire in the Library, add an additional $24 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost. \nI am happy to discuss group orders larger than two copies, but these need to be handled on a country by country basis. Please send me a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nFire in the Library is the third project of Weird Giraffe Games. Super Hack Override was our first project and it was delivered a month early to backers in March 2017. Stellar Leap is our second project and is currently scheduled to be delivered early to backers in June. \nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.  \nThe Fire in the Library team is made of the following people:    \n We're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

We're debuting our company and partnership on Kickstarter with the brand new, North American versions of Herbalism and three other excellent ES4 titles.\n  Every game of Herbalism is played with a deck of 14 cards that contains 4 ingredients of varying frequency. Every round, two of those 14 cards will be set aside randomly. Those are the ingredients that will cure the epidemic.\nPlayers take turns choosing combinations and taking actions to exchange hidden information until they can solve what two ingredients are missing from the deck. Each action consists of two parts: what a player gives to another player and what that player gives in return.\nPlayers will exchange information this way until a player thinks they know which two ingredients are missing. Then they can take the Cure Action and choose the formula they think is the correct one. Other players have the chance to make their own guesses or follow this player!\nIf the player making the guess is correct, they score 3 points and anyone who followed them scores 1 point.

If you discover this project after it has ended, you can find more information about the game on our website:\n   Spy Club is a new cooperative board game from publisher Foxtrot Games. Acting as young detectives, players work together to solve neighborhood mysteries. Spy Club includes unlockable content that changes the game every time you play, along with a way to play a series of 5 games connected together to tell a larger story.\nSimple but interconnected actions provide meaningful and clever decisions.\nBonus teamwork actions bring out communication and interaction between players.\nBeautiful artwork by Bart\u0142omiej Kordowski (Dream Home) and a storytelling element add laughter and draw players into the emerging narrative.\nUnlockable campaign content adds the thrill of discovery and novelty as the game evolves over multiple plays.\nSpy Club will be the sixth game from Foxtrot Games. Our previous games include award-winning titles like Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, World's Fair 1893, and more.\nEach player has double-sided clue cards in front of them. On your turn, you'll use 3 actions from the following options:\nInvestigate to reveal the other side of your clue card(s)\nShift Focus to gain ideas and set up teamwork\nConfirm Evidence to make progress on one aspect of the case\nScout to draw a new clue card\nTrade Clues and Share Ideas \u2014 only when you've set up teamwork\nHere's an example turn:\nOn this turn, the players have identified the Crime (blue).\nWhen you collectively confirm 5 clue cards of one type, you will solve that 1 part of the case.\nEach case has 5 parts to solve: the Crime (blue), the Suspect (purple), the Location (green), the Motive (red), and a related Object (yellow).\nBut beware! The suspect is on the move, triggering events that will sabotage your investigation:\nRemove ideas\nRemove clue cards\nAdvance the escape marker\nFlip all players' clue cards\nIf you solve all 5 parts before these events end the game, you successfully crack the case!\n  To get a look at Spy Club in action, watch two different groups each play a full game in these full playthrough videos:\nA gaming family learns Spy Club  |  Gamers teach Spy Club to their game group\nSpy Club includes a large deck of unlockable content that changes and evolves the game every time you play. This deck contains 152 cards comprising 40+ unique, replayable modules with new rules and story elements: characters, equipment, challenges, objectives, and more!\nThis unlockable content also provides a way to play a campaign, a series of 5 games connected together to tell a larger story:\nEach game plays in 30-45 minutes, and each campaign consists of 5 games.\nNew rules and story elements are unlocked in every game.\nEverything can be fully reset and replayed.\nYou only unlock a small portion of the total content in one series (just 5 of the 40+ modules). When you start again, you will continue to unlock new content each time!\nThe modules you unlock are determined by your decisions each game, which gives the campaign the sense of choosing your own mystery adventure!\nWhat is the structure of a campaign?\nIn each individual game of Spy Club, you work together to solve 5 aspects of a case. But a bigger picture is forming during a campaign: a master crime is also taking shape, and you'll need to discover one new aspect of that master crime in each of the 5 games. You'll unlock new content related to the particular aspects as you discover them.\nFor more details on the campaign structure, check out our How To Play > Campaign video.\nHow is Spy Club different from legacy and other games that change as you play?\nWe\u2019re excited about games that change over multiple plays, but the differences between various formats can be confusing. For example, legacy games, are intended to be played one time in a linear fashion, with players unlocking all of the content in one campaign. Spy Club, on the other hand, is intended to be reset and replayed. The sequence of content isn\u2019t scripted, so each campaign will unfold differently. With 40+ modules in the campaign deck, a unique story and gameplay experience will emerge in every campaign.

We are incredibly fortunate that our previous projects Lanterns: The Harvest Festival and World's Fair 1893 did well on Kickstarter and have continued to sell through multiple print runs in retail. We know that Foxtrot Games would not exist if it weren't for the pledges and support of each and every backer!\nThe success of those projects has given us the opportunity to keep our funding goal low and also include right from the start a number of additions that might normally only be added after certain funding levels have been reached:\nLarger, thicker cards (310 gsm black core, 70 x 110 mm)\n44 unique clue card illustrations (instead of 6 category illustrations)\nCustom suspect meeple\nCard tray (for double-sided cards)\nPlastic insert\nCampaign system: 40+ expansion modules (152 cards), 55 tokens, scorepad, and envelope\nWe included all of these right from the start to reduce the risk of new artwork delays, to provide you a high quality product at a great value, to thank you for backing early, and to show you how much we believe in this project.\nFoxtrot Games is a small publisher committed to beautiful, engaging, and approachable board games. We have successfully fulfilled three Kickstarter projects previously, including Lanterns: The Harvest Festival in 2015 and World's Fair 1893 in 2016.\nThe team for Spy Club includes some familiar names from our other projects: Jason D. Kingsley (graphic design work for Lanterns and World's Fair 1893), Randy Hoyt (owner and game producer at Foxtrot Games), Keith Pishnery (graphic design work for The Fox in the Forest and Sundae Split), Charles Wright (game developer for The Fox in the Forest and Sundae Split), and Dustin Schwartz (rules editor for all our recent games). We've also partnered with some new collaborators for this project: illustrator Bart\u0142omiej Kordowski (Dream Home), and game developers Sarah Graybill and John Shulters (of Black Straw Games).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing thousands of board games is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. There are a lot of steps in the process, and delays or setbacks could happen at any one of them. We have successfully navigated this process three times before. We even delivered rewards for our last two projects early!\n\nHere is some feedback we received on our last project:\n\n\u2014 Leah Webber: \"Thank you guys for consistently making excellent, replayable games on a timely schedule. I will always give your projects my time and money!\"\n\n\u2014 John Carl Brown: \"Thank you guys for a great product, and for a great campaign, you ran a model effort on kickstarter from the communication throughout the funding period and beyond.\"\n\n\u2014 Ryan McManus: \"Wow. What fantastic customer service. Thanks Randy!

It is a time of adventure, progress, and opportunity. The transcontinental junction was a great milestone in American history, a first step that reshaped a whole continent.\nIn SteamRollers you are a railroad entrepreneur building a network of tracks and a fleet of train engines to secure freight delivery contracts before your opponents.\nThere will be only one version of SteamRollers: All unlocked Stretch Goals will be included in all copies of the game. All unlocked expansions will be integrated in the final rules book.\nWHAT YOU GET IN THE BOX:\n1 Game box 25x25x5 Cm\n1 Fr+En+De+Nl Rules Book 24x24 Cm\n1 Main board, 24x24 Cm thick cardboard\n1 Play Aid Medium/Hard, 24x24Cm, cardstock\n1 Cloth bag\n1 First player 'train engine' wooden token\n1 Special black dice 20x20 mm (stretch goal 25k)\n6 Normal white dice 16x16mm\n6 Black 'Coal' wooden cubes 8mm (stretch goal 20k)\n50 'Goods' wooden cubes 8mm (5x10)\n1 'Solo play' action tile, thick cardboard\n6 'Action' tiles, thick cardboard\n6 'Order' tiles, thick cardboard (stretch goal 30k)\n1 player sheets pad, 100 sheets A5 recto-verso.\n FUNDED in less than 32 Hours!\nThis funds the base game, with the same gameplay as the Essen 2015 limited preview, PLUS a solo mode. Contains a central board, a difficulty player aid, 6 special action tiles, 1 solo player tile, 1 cloth bag, 5x10 wooden cubes, one wooden first player train engine token, one rulebook, and one pad of 100 dual sided player sheets.\n Gameplay upgrade : Coal mini-expansion\nThis mini expansion adds 6 'Coal' black wooden cubes. Coal can replace any resource during the game so it can be delivered to any city. it will also interact with another future expansion: the Orders\n Components upgrade : Bigger special dice\nThis level allows us to make the black special dice larger, and thus more legible. (from 16mm to 20mm)\n Gameplay upgrade : Orders mini-expansion\nThis mini expansion adds 6 tiles to the game. With this expansion, players can get extra points for their deliveries by fulfilling orders with a specific set of resources.\n Gameplay upgrade : Starting Powers\nThe starting powers mini expansion adds 5 tiles to the game. With this expansion, players get an asymetric start each game. Each player has a small starting bonus that differentiates him from other players.\n Component upgrade : 1st player token\nWith this stretch goal, we upgrade the first player token to a larger wooden engine meeple (44x25x15mm instead of 30x17x8mm), in golden color instead of Yellow.\nMore stretch goals will be revealed progressively during the campaign.\nWe have some nice things in store for you!\nThe central board has a map with the goods available for delivery. You have a personal play sheet with the same map, on which you draw your rail network and keep track of your engine fleet. When you make a delivery, the goods are removed from the central board and you earn points for cities and towns crossed. Once three cities on the central board have been emptied from available goods, the game ends. You then collect points for your deliveries, your engines, your network, and a few bonuses.\nSteamRollers is a fast and fun roll and write game. The active player rolls all the dice, then in turn each player picks a dice and uses it to either draw rail, improve his engine, do research, or make a delivery. Once each player has picked and used a dice, the next players rolls the all dice and so on.\nThe central board has the goods goods available for delivery, and each player has a play sheet.\nThe dice are rolled, and in turn each player uses one of the dice\nYou can use a dice to draw rails on your play sheet. The white dice determines the region, the black dice the kind of rails you can draw.\nYou can use a dice to improve your engine. The number indicates the box you can check. The number of checked boxes is your engine power. In this example, the white dice is a 2, and that checkbox is free. The engine now has a power of 3.\nYou can use a dice to make a delivery. The number indicates the source of the delivery, and the cube colour indicates the destination city. \nIn the example, we deliver a cube from region 1 (yellow). It's a blue cube so it must be delivered to city 5 (blue). There are three steps to cross (city 4, town and city 1), so we need an engine power of at least 3 to make this delivery. Each step earns the player one point, so this delivery is worth 3 points.\nThen a second delivery, a yellow cube from region 2 to region 1, also for 3 points.\nHere are some video reviews of SteamRollers. Reviewers have received a hand-assembled preproduction copy for review purposes.\nReviewers also received the mini-expansions that may be unlocked as stretch goals, so you have a sneak preview of what's coming here :-)\n(mention starts at 09:44)\nFRENCH VIDEO REVIEWS:\nThe team behind SteamRollers :\nCurrently I'm working as a programmer in Brussels. One of the great thing about Brussels is its vibrant board gaming community. Several times a week, I get to play great games with great people. One of my favorite genres are train games like for example Age of Steam, which was a big inspiration for SteamRollers. This is my first game design to find a publisher but hopefully it\u2019ll be the first of many.\nBenjamin started for publisher Editions Dupuis on the Alter Ego series, for six albums between 2011 and 2014. These were very well received and Benjamin was offered to work on the new season of Michel Vaillant, where he specializes on the cars and backgrounds. Benjamin is now considered a reference artist in realistic European comic strips, and gladly accepted the opportunity to explore a different setting and medium for SteamRollers.\nRetailers: please click here to register as a participating store and pre-order SteamRollers at retailer discounted price. We don't tie up your cashflow: Order now, pay when shipped to your store!\nSteamRollers will be a Kickstarter Exclusive* game for one full year after the campaign ends! \nThis game will not be available in distribution or at your local retailer.\nOnly Kickstarter backers will be sure to get a copy of SteamRollers!\n*What do you exactly mean by 'Exclusive' ?\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends and for a whole year, The Flatlined Games edition of SteamRollers will only be available through limited channels:\n- Directly from Flatlined Games.\nThis includes our website, our Facebook shop, our booth at conventions and fairs, and maybe we will set up an Amazon Flatlined Games shop.\n- From retailers who registered during the Kickstarter campaign. Other retailers will not be supplied!\nParticipating retailers will be allowed to re-order as many time as they want during the exclusivity period - while stocks last. The list of participating retailers will be published on our website, in the retailer locator.\n- It is possible that foreign partners contact me after the game is released to make localized versions of SteamRollers in languages not included in the Flatlined Games edition (Fr/En/De/Nl). Such localized versions may become available in the localized retail and distribution channels before the end of the exclusivity period. However I know from experience this takes time, usually more than one year. I will make sure to post updates if this happens.\nAt the end of the one year exclusivity period, I will assess whether it makes most sense to open to distributors and other retailers, to keep this channel restriction in effect, or to start a new campaign for a reprint.\nShipping will be added to your pledge automatically.\nThis project is EU and USA/Canada friendly: Shipping will be domestic for EU and US/CAD locations! \nWe will partner with local web-retailers Funagain.com (US), Levalet (CA) and Philibertnet.com (Fr) for shipping this project. They have expertise about sending individual parcels and volume to get cost-effective deals from carriers, and did a terrific job for our previous campaign, Argo.\nDon't change a winning team!\nMultiple pledges\nIf you want to pledge for several copies of the game, multiply your total (pledge+shipping) by the number of copies you want. We do subsidize a portion of the shipping costs for each pledge, so we cannot offer a lower total for grouped orders, sorry.\n There has been a lot of preparation before I brought SteamRollers on Kickstarter. Here is the full timeline :\nOnce the game is funded, lots of things still need to happen. First it takes a couple weeks for the project to be closed, money transferred, polls answered, etc. After that, the production process starts, and will last for about three months. Then the goods need be shipped from the factory to the shipping and handling facility, which takes another month and a half. So it will take at least 5 months between the project end and the time you get your game box. If there are issues to be solved along the way, it will be a bit longer. And we may get delayed on production and/or shipping from factory because of Chinese new year. (It could also be shorter, but I want to keep expectations realistic. Too many projects over promise and under deliver in that regard.)\nI positively impressed backers with Twin Tin Bots and Argo by delivering a bit early ahead of time, and intend to do so here as well. I have set a target date of May 2018, which is a worst-case scenario.\nNow that everything is ready to go to press, I do not want to delay SteamRollers further for lack of money to produce it. Without Kickstarter I simply cannot publish SteamRollers : I need your support to bring this game to the market!\nWithout you, SteamRollers will not be printed!\nI have a track record of high quality games, previous Kickstarter experience with Twin Tin Bots and Argo (both projects delivered on time and as advertised), and I can manage the complexity of this project. I have ran quotes with several manufacturers with a track record of quality games produced, to validate our design decisions and price them. I have the channels for logistics and fulfillment, everything is ready to bring SteamRollers to your door. All I need now is your pledge!\nThe key part of crowdfunding success is to be able to reach a crowd. Flatlined games is a small indie publisher, a one-man shop, and currently I have little 'reach' in the US. To make this campaign succeed, it is critical that this can become visible to as many US gamers as possible.\nAs backers, you play a key role in that visibility : \nPlease tell your friends about SteamRollers! \nShare the project page on Facebook and Twitter, on your website, everywhere! Each share reaches new backers!\nYou are our best ambassadors to make this project a success: people pay much more attention to your recommendation than they ever would to any banner ad or promotional video. Your network of friends and contacts is full or gamers we have no other way to reach. Your support makes a huge difference between a failed and a successful campaign!\nShare this link : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flatlinedgames/262599968\nNB: All pictures are from a prototype version or 3D renderings, not actual game components. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main issue to produce SteamRollers is raising the funds to go to the factory.\n\nSteamRollers has received extended testing and development, and has been played on several events over the last three years.\n\nAll artwork for the game has already been produced, as the layout for the game components and design of the playing pieces: This project is complete and ready to be produced, it is not a work in progress.\n\nFlatlined Games already successfully produced six titles (Dragon Rage, Rumble in the House, Rumble in the Dungeon, Twin Tin Bots, Robin, Argo), and sold more than 80.000 copies of Rumble in the House/Dungeon over 7 years. I do have experience in this business, a proven track record, and a reputation to hold. I got funding for Twin Tin Bots and Argo through Kickstarter, and delivered both to backers as promised and ahead of schedule.\n\nPublishing a board game is however always a risky endeavor. Many things can happen, errors can be made, as board games are such individual projects that there is no 'standard procedure' that can be followed. I am confident I can deliver, just as I did before with previous projects.\n\nFlatlined Games is a one man business. The main risk is delays, in production or in shipment, as I will not compromise on product quality. Of course I will provide regular updates on production and shipping status and issues along the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac27 or more", "title": "SteamRollers - Kickstarter exclusive*", "descp": "One copy of SteamRollers, with all unlocked stretch goals, shipped to your home.\nThis is a one year Kickstarter Exclusive*.\nIf your country is not listed, please contact us.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Shipping update - all parcels have been sent (some still underway)", "update_content": "Hi all.\nI'm glad to report that all parcels have been sent from our fulfillment partners in Canada, USA and Europe.\nSome EU parcels are still underway and should reach backers this week.\nWe asked for an address confirmation to Eu backers to reduce shipping issues.

This is a Kickstarter project for an expansion to my hit board game The Networks. \nNot familiar with it? That's okay! Here's a website where you can learn more about the base game, and here's the Kickstarter project from 2015 where over 2,700 generous backers pledged over $100,000 to make it a reality.\nThe Networks is now in its third printing. It's been printed in Chinese, there's a German version in the works, and more languages are on their way. \nLike what you see? If your friendly local or online game store is sold out of The Networks, the base game is available from this campaign.\nYou'll need a copy of the base game to play The Networks: Executives.\nAnd now you're all caught up!\nSo you\u2019ve proven your worth in the past. We know you can run an ordinary TV network. Big deal.\nWe have a bigger challenge for you. Here are 12 unique Network Executives, each with their own weird characteristics. Every Executive has powers, but they also have significant liabilities. Can you master each Executive\u2019s idiosyncrasies, draft the best Season 0 cards, claim your true status as a Mogul, and come out on top?\n           The Networks: Executives adds three major components to The Networks: Executives, Season 0 Cards, and Mogul Cards.\nThe Executives are the biggest addition to the game. The expansion comes with 12 Executives in the box. Each one will significantly change the way you play the game by giving you a set of distinct powers and liabilities.\nYou can play as Flix, which turns your network into a streaming service that lets you consider all your Shows as being in their proper time slots... but every time you switch genres within a time slot, you lose Viewers.\nYou can play as Beeb, which turns your network into a state-run enterprise that tends to generate revenue. But because you now have a lot of bureaucracy to deal with, you must use a rondel to choose your actions.\nYou can play as Telethon, which turns your network into a public broadcasting network. You may not hold Ads in your Green Room. But you may hold a telethon once per season to ask other players for money, in exchange for powerful Sponsorship Tokens. If they don't give you money, you get to keep the Sponsorship Token to use yourself.\nAnd so on. With all the Executives in the game, the amount of challenge and replayability grows enormously. \nThe Season 0 Cards are a new way to begin the game. Instead of everyone starting with similar Shows, Stars, and Ads, you will now begin the game with a draft. Everyone starts with a hand of 4 Season 0 Shows, and chooses one as their 8 pm Show. Most Season 0 Shows get you Stars, Ads, and/or Money, but have no genre and give you no Viewers. Others have a genre and Viewers, but get you nothing else.\nOnce you've selected your 8 pm Show and received anything it gives you, you'll pass the remaining 3 Season 0 Cards to the player on your left and receive 3 cards from the player on your right. Everyone will now choose their 9 pm Show, and so on.\nThis starting draft ensures that players begin the game with completely different setups. Some players may begin with a stocked green room, but no Shows with Genres. Other players may get shows with Genres to get a head-start on their Genre Bonus, but with little in their green room.\nWhy is the race to a Genre Bonus important? Because of the third addition to the game: Mogul Cards. These are effectively supercharged Network Cards. At the start of the game, you'll deal out a number of them to the table equal to the number of players plus one. These will be the only Mogul Cards available in the game; you will not replenish these between Seasons.\nYou get a Mogul Card by either getting your first 5-Show Genre Bonus, or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus. You can no longer draw Network Cards or trade in money for Viewers after a 5-Show Genre Bonus, but some Mogul Cards still let you do that. \nMogul Cards even out some lategame swinginess present in the base game and give players a long-term goal to shoot for.\nWith these three huge additions to the base game, The Networks becomes a much deeper and more replayable game!\nWant to know more? Here's a draft of the rulebook for the expansion!\nWant to try it? If you have a copy of the base game, here's a free PNP of the expansion! \n    \"If you ever thought what your damp, shoddy, and structurally unsound public access TV station experience needed was to give more attention to the equally shoddy and unsound eccentricity of its management, then you're in luck! Because that's what Executives is all about.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"The Executives adds a ton of variability and exciting new strategies to the base game! The wide array of player powers and Season Zero starting options makes every player's game feel unique with interesting and challenging decisions. The addition of Mogul cards give players powerful rewards to work towards, and the new shows inject welcome new content for regular players. More than an essential expansion, The Executives is a reward for Networks fans!\" - Danielle and Jake Bock, Draft Mechanic\n\"When we played it was obvious that this expansion gives The Networks a ton of replayability. This is totally an expansion you need if you like the original game.\" - Gameosity\n             \"...The Networks is a well crafted card-drafting game. The game remains engaging throughout the entire playing time, and the escalating strength of the three Show decks gives a nice trajectory to the strategy/scoring.\" - The Opinionated Gamers\n\"This is the perfect medium-weight game... I\u2019m impressed with what Gil Hova has done in The Networks and look forward to seeing how it will do on Kickstarter. He\u2019s made a solid game with a great sense of humor. And yes, it was difficult to cancel \u201cAn Hour of Shouting\u201d, but it didn\u2019t bring in the viewers I needed. There\u2019s no room for sentimentality on the Networks.\" - Indie Cardboard\n\"The Networks is, quite literally, my favorite Euro-style game. Gil Hova has done what many have found unthinkable, combining a deep economic game of resource management with sharp humor and an incredibly engaging narrative. It's a perfect blend of mechanism and theme. It is, in short, UHF: The Euro Game. And you need it in your collection.\" - Your Moderator Chris, Flip the Table podcast\n\"If you're looking for some lighter fun with a backbone, and fantastic dad puns, you can feel good spending an hour of your table time with it... I think Gil's game is smart, well-designed, and it sneaks in a challenging game under the cover of humor.\" - Heavy Cardboard\n\"With screwball humor and well-developed mechanics, this game offers both charming flavor and solid design. The Networks is basically UHF: The Board Game. It encourages you to excel at the inanity of television programming on the one hand while lambasting it on the other, and yet this charming mix of motives adds up to a game that\u2019s amusing and strategic all at once.\" - The Cardboard Republic review (Awarded the Seal of the Republic!)\n\"The Networks is a thoroughly enjoyable card game. Deciding when to develop new shows and drop existing shows, as well as what time slots, who will star in them and what advertising to use is surprisingly fun. The game plays fast, is easy to teach but has many tough decisions. I cannot wait to see what potential additions come about from stretch goals for this game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"All-in-all, I really enjoyed The Networks. It is approachable, funny, and smart all at the same time. I know that this is a game that I can bring out with newer gamers because they will have a blast with the theme, yet I can also bring it out with more hardcore gamers due to its subtle depth. Gil Hova of Formal Ferret Games has created an impressive gem; One which points to a bright and successful future for this indie publisher. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of cards and new ideas will make their way into future expansions. Any game that can make me want more while still feeling like a complete and final product has something special going for it.\"- Meeple Mountain\n\"This is a winner. I want one. We're actually going to fight over this copy.\" - Punching Cardboard\n\"Overall, The Networks was done beautifully and kept me wanting more... kinda like my yearn for reality television, but much less guilty this time around.\" - Indie Tabletop\n\"The Networks is simply an extremely well-designed game... and the gameplay is just so solid. Maybe it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing good on TV, but, quite frankly, with The Networks, I\u2019ve already got plenty of entertainment at my fingertips.\" - Gameosity\n\"Like an episode of Game of Thrones, this game is addicting and leaves you wondering how the last 60 minutes flew by so quickly. The Networks is must-see-TV and I highly recommend you check it out.\" - League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"...it\u2019s strong in all its elements \u2013 theme, gameplay, strategic challenge, accessibility, length, graphics, humor \u2013 across the board, making for a fantastic game that\u2019s greater than the sum of its already solid parts. A game of The Networks is more fun than drinking from the fire hose, and in the end, fun is what it\u2019s all about.\" - Up With Meeple\n  At this pledge level, you can stay subscribed to updates about the game. Every little bit helps!\nThis pledge level is for retailers only. It will allow retailers to buy The Networks and The Networks: Executives by the case. If you pledge at this level, you will buy the games as an add-on, so you will not be charged until just before the games get shipped to you. \nThis pledge level will allow you to get digital Print-and-Play files (PNPs) for The Networks, The Networks: Executives, and The Networks: On the Air. You will need to print these files out and cut them into cards in order to play the game. \nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks: Executives and all PNPs. This pledge level does not include a copy of the base game.\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the International Executive level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. This pledge level does not include a copy of the base game.\nOn the Air is a mini-expansion containing the stretch goals achieved from the previous Kickstarter campaign, with extra Shows, Stars, and Ads, as well as stickers to put on your turn order and scoring markers and some blank cards to come up with your own Shows and Stars.\nThis will be a new printing of On the Air, so the quality here should be more consistent than the first printing.\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the International Executive with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, and all PNPs.\nThere are still quite a few copies of the base game floating around local and online game stores. I heartily encourage you to consider buying the base game from your favorite game store. You'll support their business, and you'll be familiar with the base game by the time The Executives arrives at your door!\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. \nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name an Executive!\nHere's how it works. Each Executive is double-sided, with a female figure on one side and a male figure on the other. Each Executive has a stock name for their power, e.g. Mr./Ms. Rich, Mr./Ms Cheapo, Mr./Ms. Telethon, and so on. But at this level, you'll supply us with the Executive's real name, like \"Martha Higgenbottom III, Esq.\" \nYou're welcome to choose your own name, the name or nickname of a friend or loved one, or a fictional name you just think sounds cool. I will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name a Network!\nHere's how it'll work. There are 5 player boards, just as in the base game. These player boards will be divided into a Network Name board, showing the name of your network and your player color, and an Executive board, reminding you of what powers you have.\nThe Network Name boards will be double-sided. The existing network names from the base game (U62, VCK, PKW, ICS, and MOO) will still be on one side of the board, but the name you select will be on the other, along with a brand-new design.\nI will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nWant more copies of the game? You can add them on here!\nI will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to help manage add-ons. So while you can pay for these add-ons by increasing your pledge, you can also wait until the campaign ends. Either way, you'll submit the add-ons when you give me your mailing address. Then, if your pledge isn't enough to cover the add-ons, BackerKit will prompt you to cover the difference. \nI used BackerKit in my previous campaign for Wordsy, and I found it made my job exponentially easier. Hopefully it will help you out as well! \nNote that all these prices are without shipping. I will calculate add-on shipping costs closer to the end of the campaign.\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks base game for $50 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks base game to your pledge) by adding $90 to your pledge. This 3-pack offer is only available if you have pledged at a level that includes the base game as a reward level ($79 and up).\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks: Executives for $29 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks: Executives to your pledge) by adding $50 to your pledge. This 3-pack offer is only available if you have pledged at a level that includes The Executives as a reward level ($29 and up).\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks: On the Air for $6. \nThere are no quantity deals available for The Networks: On the Air.\nThe Networks: On the Air contains stretch goals from the first Networks campaign; see the $35 pledge level above for more details. \nThese stretch goals will not come in the retail box for the expansion! Instead, they'll be packaged in external expansions that will be available once the expansion is out in stores.\nThis means the stretch goals below are not exclusives. However, they will be tougher to get ahold of than the base game or expansion, so this is your best opportunity to pick them up! \nCOMPLETE! At $30,000, the project has been officially funded. Hooray!\nCLEAR! At $40,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will now receive 20 clear plastic cubes to replace the black timing cubes from the base game. A lot of people who play The Networks like to place their timing cubes directly over the number of viewers they're getting that season, in case they have a show on at the wrong time slot. Transparent cubes will make that a lot easier!\nCOMPLETE! Meet the Gorilla! At $50,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 13th Network Executive.\nThis character is the 800-pound gorilla. When playing, you will get extra money at the start of each Season ($2M per player in the game), and extra Viewers at the end of the game (1 Viewer per player in the game). The downside? You go last every Season, regardless of your score. Quite a challenge!\nCOMPLETE! Meet Continuum! At $60,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 14th Network Executive.\nThis character is a time traveler! Once per Season, you may spend money to run your time machine to take two actions on your turn. If you don't do that during the Season, you may run it at the end of the Season to consider one of your Shows as being in its proper time slot.\nWhen you run your time machine, you'll take an Anomaly card and put it on top of the Star Deck. Any player who gets that card, either through drawing from the top of the Star Deck, or in the following Season, when the card becomes one of the Stars available to Sign, puts it in their Green Room. You can spend an Anomaly to get two actions on your turn.\nCOMPLETE! At $70,000, we will give each Network Executive its own logo! This will make them easier to distinguish from one another.\nI have a signature up there, but they won't necessarily look like signatures. Rich may have their name written in diamonds, Butcher will be sharp and maybe drip something red, and so on. It's going to look cool!\nCOMPLETE! OK, this one is exciting. At $80K, I'll provide replacement scoring markers in all colors that will replace the squares that came in the base game. These scoring markers will look like cute little TVs! And they'll still stack nicely like the original discs.\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nCOMPLETE! ...and here's the companion to the $80K stretch goal! At $90K, I'll provide replacement turn order marker in all colors that will replace the discs that came in the base game. They'll look like little remote controls!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nAt $100K, you'll get a new Season Marker that will replace the current one. It's going to look like a TV tower!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nWhen I launched this Kickstarter, I was going to ship out the base game along with Executives, in the same package. But at $125K, I will be able to manufacture the base game first, get that on a cargo ship ASAP, and deliver it to you in a separate package a few months before Executives!\nIn a week or two, I will have a better estimate of when I can fulfill the base game if we reach this stretch goal. Right now, it's looking like we can deliver it no later than April 2018, possibly sooner.\nThis stretch goal will only affect folks who pledge at $75 and up. \nAt $150K, all backers who pledge $29 and up will get all starter Shows, Stars, and Ads from the base game, with special rules on how to incorporate them in Networks: Executives!\nThis stretch goal has been requested by a few backers. I had to figure out a way to smoothly incorporate them into the experience, but after some testing, I think I have it.\nAll Starter Shows will now all be gray \"no-genre\" cards, but will have the same names and art as from the base game.\nIMPORTANT - If you are in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, or Switzerland, and you want to back at the $29 or $35 levels, make sure you pledge at the International Executive or International Executive with Bonuses levels. Those will give you better shipping rates!\nNote that there's a slight omission in the pledge level bullet points for the International Executive pledge level. There should be a bullet point for a physical copy of the On the Air expansion.\nFor this campaign, I am providing a $7 discount on shipping for all backers. This won't reduce your shipping cost to $0, but I hope it will take most of the sting out of the shipping bill.\nIf you're backing in Canada, you will not have to pay any extra charges beyond shipping. All rewards will ship from Starlit Citadel, based in Vancouver.\nIf you're a customer within the EU, your rewards will ship from within the EU. This means people who live in EU-member countries will not have to pay VAT. Hooray!\nKeep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within the continent of Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are in the EU and choose either the $29 or $35 pledges, your package will not be tracked by default, as that increases shipping costs significantly. If you fall into this category and prefer your package to be tracked, message me and we can work something out.\nOne more note on current events: At the time of this campaign, the UK is still part of the EU. The current plan is to ship all EU rewards (including UK rewards) from the UK. \nIt's unlikely that will change by the time of fulfillment, but if it does, I will send UK rewards from within the UK and EU rewards from a different fulfillment center within the EU. \nEither way, if you are in the EU right now, you will not have to pay VAT!\n   Gil Hova - Game Designer\n Travis Kinchy - Illustrator\nHeiko G\u00fcnther - Graphic Designer\nKickstarter Page Graphic Design\nDaniel Newman\nMain video voices:\nEthan Hova\nGil Hova\nBrodrick Jones\nCarrie Margulies\nJosephine Stewart\nMain video animation:\nBen Shulman, Jellybean Soup\nMain video music:\n\"Magic Forest,\" \"Enter the Party,\" \"Eighties Action,\" \"Surf Shimmy,\" \"Egmont Overture (Beethoven),\" \"Malt Shop Bop,\" \"DarxieLand,\" \"EDM Detection Mode,\" \"Teddy Bear Waltz,\" and \"Lost Time,\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are hard to make! Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have three successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks' base game, Wordsy, and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. All of my projects have shipped to backers around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure The Networks: Executives will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are mostly done. This game is less than a month away from being ready to be sent to the manufacturer. In fact, I will begin the pre-production process with my manufacturer during the Kickstarter campaign, which should save us some time.\n\nSecond: One lesson I learned since the original Kickstarter campaign for The Networks was a better understanding of manufacturing and quality. Since then, I've switched manufacturers. Ever since the second printing of The Networks, I've used Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. I've also used them for my game Wordsy. They deliver incredibly high-quality products on time.\n\nThird: I will be using several board game fulfillers to deliver The Networks: Executives to the US and most of the world. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. \n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics. I've used OTX to deliver two printings of The Networks and the first printing of Wordsy, so I know they're reliable.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Viewer", "descp": "Thank you for keeping an eye on the campaign!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Business Partner", "descp": "This level is only for retailers!

Coupling that with its approachable ruleset, Mint Delivery is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of pick up and deliver.\nCheck out the Mint Delivery rules to see more detail about what makes Mint Delivery tick.\nAll Cards contained within a copy of Mint Delivery are printed upon Premium 305GSM blue core card stock. Mint and Truck Tokens are made of Wood and all other tokens are made from 2mm thick chipboard. All printed components will have a linen finish.   \nJames Hudson - Druid City Games  \nMarried with Board Games \nLindsay - Shiny Happy Meeples\nWhat's Eric Playing\nWhat's Eric Playing - #125 - Mint Delivery [Preview]\n Board Game Geek Comments \n\"...Even if pick up and deliver games are not your cup of tea try this one out and you might find a renewed interest in the genre.\" - MHGreenleaf\n\"Played a prototype yesterday and really enjoyed it. Similar to Mint Works, even though it's small there's a lot going on.\" - MichaelDyrud\nYou can download the rules here\nIn Mint Delivery, players take the role of a mint delivery truck driver, driving around the area taking orders for mints, then delivering them. Each player has two actions on their turn, such as moving, loading their truck, and upgrading the mints they are carrying. Once enough orders have been taken, the game ends.\nWhoever has fulfilled the highest value of orders will be deemed the employee of the month and win. \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nDiscord\nMint Delivery was created after the success of Mint Works, with the idea to introduce another mechanism to non-gamers while still being interesting enough for gamers to want to bring it to the table.\nI wanted to come up with another quick easy to teach game for a mechanism that I felt didn't have a lot of options that didn't take a long time to play, while also straying away from games with direct conflict between players.\nPick up and deliver seemed like a really good place to start. Since the vast majority of these types of games tend to be quite long, and have a lot of gotcha kinds of rules.\nThat gave me this set of constraints that I utilized for making Mint Delivery:\nHas to fit in a mint tin \nHas to be taught as easy or easier than Mint Works \nHas to play quickly \nWith those constraints in mind, I started the task. \nSince it was to fit in a mint tin, I decided to continue the same visual style that we used with Mint Works, and also to continue the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. It seemed logical to me that Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has started to branch out and provide mints to more than just the local neighborhoods.\nThat gave a great foundation for the supply/demand chain that would be the foundation of the pick up and deliver mechanism. I didn't want the mint requests to be too flat, so i added some \"improved\" type mints to the mix at that point. Which essentially gives us 3 forms of currency instead of just one.\nFrom that point, it was all about creating orders for mints, a few locations to pick mints up from, and a map to lay it all out. And that's where we are now.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Delivery that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Delivery as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advance copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advance copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nPhoto Credit Eric from whatsericplaying.com\nBecause Mint Delivery is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs.\nThat said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US. Here is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nWe have partnered up with Mr. B Games to assist in the fulfillment process to ensure that everyone gets their rewards quickly, correctly and in great condition.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Delivery before the game makes its way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email md.retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe will also be funding a re-print of Mint Works with this campaign, you can add extra copies of Mint Works at $10 each during the campaign, or later on during the pledge manager.\n\nNote: Any add-ons that you select will be delivered at the same time as the rest of your rewards from this campaign.\nSince the map doesn't change from game to game, we came up with the idea of using a mat for the game to play on during demos, it worked out so well that we have decided to add custom mint delivery mats on as add-ons to any pledge level as well.\nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of two Mad Scientists myself and Mel (you might recognize him as Mort) and our awesome testing group. \nI'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them. I have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations.\nThey are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.

My name is Derik and I'm looking for a few archaeologists excited to get their hands dirty with field work. We have three locations already scouted and ready for someone to dig, dive, and explore. All we need is you!\n*FIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!*\nAncient Artifacts is a challenging dice game for 1-4 players and takes 20-45 minutes. Players take on the roles of archaeologists working and researching at three different sites, managing limited budgets, and trying to avoid nefarious tomb raiders. Finish the game with the most renown and money to win.  \nThis is a \"roll and write\" game plus a little extra (action selection, pattern building, and push-your-luck). Players draw and roll dice from a bag to select their action and location on the Atlas board. Then, roll custom dice to mark off various sets, runs, or combinations on their career tracking sheet. Complete every career milestone at a location to find its ancient artifact!\n\nSkip the rules and watch this great video:  \nWant to know more? You can check out the full rulebook, a low-ink print and play with printer-friendly rules!\n                                    I'm not taking any chances here. I've teamed up with an experienced shipping partner who has depots around the world. They have promised me \"friendly\" shipping for all backers. Which means reasonable prices and no import fees! And yes, shipping to the rest of the world really is only $6 more than to the USA!\n Working on Ancient Artifacts has been an absolute joy. I've been blessed with the opportunity to share the game files with players and other designers all across the country for months now and to improve the game based on their feedback. Ancient Artifacts and I even made the trip to Unpub Prime in Baltimore, MD - where it was well received. Through precious time spent on critical feedback from generous volunteers, designers, and even a fan who taught it to his friend, we were able to streamline the game's conclusion and tighten up the time-frame. After months of testing, lucking into a working relationship with an incredible artist, and trusting in a very skilled editor, Ancient Artifacts is now ready for full scale production - which is where you come in!  \nBetween giant print runs, shipping prices that rise every year, taxes and fees, and even freight costs to get the game from the printer to a distribution annex for shipping, printing a game takes a LOT of money. I have already paid out-of-pocket for every pre-production aspect of Ancient Artifacts (illustrations, rulebook layout, editing, and even some of the helpful videos). However, I need your help to pay for the actual printing. \n\nWithout YOU (yes, you), I won't be able to share this game with the world. More importantly, without help, you won't have the chance to gaze longingly at Mr. Sosnin's beautiful illustrations on your table, laugh at your friends' terrible rolls, and feel the swell of pride as you demonstrate that you are the most prestigious archaeologist with excellent penmanship.\n  Derik Duley - Designer and Publisher\n Lover of God, Nicole, and games!

Thanks to lessons learned from other indie publishers, I have saved up a financial buffer to cover unexpected costs and budgeted a time buffer to allow for unexpected delays, like Chinese New Year (which shuts down production in February) and the dock strikes two years ago (which prevented MANY products from being properly imported through California's docks).\n\nAncient Artifacts will be manufactured in China. So, we'll need to wait for shipping and customs, but I am confident it will allow me to deliver a quality, affordable game. To reduce delays, the artwork is all already completed and, during the campaign, I will be working with a copy editor and graphic designer to finalize the rule book.\n\nIf any unforeseen delays do arise, I promise to be transparent and open. I believe that honesty in communication is critical for any successful relationship.

Think of it as a sneak peek into the next version of Wits & Wagers, which we plan to release nationwide in Fall 2018 as a replacement for both Wits & Wagers Party and the original Wits & Wagers.\nHow can one game replace two games, you ask? By combining the best of both into one game that does it better than either. To get the word out, we're offering a limited-edition, over-sized playmat at a highly subsidized cost (we won\u2019t make a profit on this campaign). You can get everything you need to play Vegas Wits & Wagers through this Kickstarter. \n  Before we introduce Vegas Wits & Wagers, you should know what Wits & Wagers is. \nWits & Wagers is a party game we published in 2005. It was a hit, sold millions of copies, and became the most award-winning party game in history:  \n  Wits & Wagers is a betting game masquerading as a trivia game. You don't need to know the answers to win, because you can win by betting (fake) money on other players' answers. This transforms the game into a high-rolling, push-your-luck nail-biter. Gameplay is simple as pie:\nRead a fun question...everyone writes down a guess.\nPlace your bets...which guess is closest?\nFeeling confident? Bet on yourself.\nThink others know better? Bet on them.\nNo idea? Bet on any guess and hope you get lucky.\nAfter 12 years and thousands of plays, we've figured out how to make it better. A lot better: \n  Vegas Wits & Wagers improves what everyone loves about Wits & Wagers: the betting. The centerpiece is a stupid-big play mat:\n  Its size makes it a show-stopper. It will turn any gathering into a Vegas casino, everyone standing excitedly over the mat, praying for their bets to pay out. It has a powerful table presence and you'll see from the reviews below we're not the only ones who think so.\nCompare it to the play mat for regular Wits & Wagers:\nIt's made of a luxurious, thick neoprene that's hard to damage. You can swaddle a medium sized dog in it when the need arises:\nPLAY\n\nThe size of the mat isn't the only cool thing about Vegas Wits & Wagers:\n  Cool Thing #1 - Wonderful Ways to Wager\nThe mat gives players options for betting that make the game feel particularly casino-ey. \nCool Thing #2 - Two Games for the Price of One\nThe mat's reverse side is the mat for Wits & Wagers Deluxe: you get two games for the price of one (Vegas and Deluxe). \nCool Thing #3 - New Questions\nEvery stretch goal in this campaign is a pack of specially-themed new questions. See the Stretch Goals for details.  \nCool Thing #4 - Covers for Unused Betting Areas\nThe covers to make it super-clear where you can't bet (which varies with player count). The game is now drunk-proof.\n    We have a bunch stretch goals to unlock. Our lucky number. Every stretch goal is a specially-themed pack of new questions for the game. Here are the first 4:   \n          Our own Bruce Voge III takes us on the Vegas grand tour:\n       You might be able to tell this next guy really likes the game. \n  If videos aren't your thing, check out this written 5-star preview from MeepleGamers or this review from The Gaming Gang.\n  Shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge at checkout\nThe prices listed above are for single copies. We've also added pledge levels that allow you to get two copies of Vegas Wits & Wagers ($50 pledge level), or two copies of Vegas with two copies of Wits & Wagers Party ($80 pledge level). For these levels, the shipping is doubled. \nThere's a way to save on shipping if you're in the US and you don't already own Wits & Wagers Party: pledge the $25 level, and then buy Wits & Wagers Party at your local Target (Target also offers the game online).\nThe estimated delivery date is November 2017, but bear in mind this is an estimate. And If you back the $40 level, your copies of Vegas Wits & Wagers and Wits & Wagers Party may arrive at separate times.\nWhy no international shipping?\nVegas Wits & Wagers is physically heavy, and ships in a large tube to keep the huge mat crease-free. The tube also requires that Vegas and Wits & Wagers Party must be shipped in separate packages and from separate locations. These factors make international shipping prohibitively expensive (as you can see from the table above, even getting these games to Canada costs more the games themselves). In addition, Wits & Wagers is a North American-centric game with many questions that only people in North America would have any idea about. These factors have lead us to decide to offer this game only to North American backers.\n   Vegas Wits & Wagers\nEnormous Honking Play Mat\n30 poker chips, in $500 and $1000 denominations\n7 Dry Erase Answer Boards\n2 Elvis Betting Tokens\n1 Dry Erase Pen\n2 Betting Space Covers\n1 Full-color Rules\nAs many new trivia questions as we can unlock in the stretch goals\nIf you choose the pledge level that includes Wits & Wagers Party (you'll need it to play Vegas Wits & Wagers), you will also get:\nWits & Wagers Party \n210 Questions \n50 Poker Chips \n6 Dry Erase Answer Boards \n6 Dry Erase Pens 1 Permanent Answer Board (with a \"1\") \n12 Betting Tokens (6 in $100 denominations, 6 in $200 denominations)\n1 Full-color Rules\n    This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNorth Star Games has been publishing board games for almost 15 years.

To do that, you'll be crafting items to send heroes on quests, earning treasure, and upgrading your guild with new specialists and rooms.\nEach turn you get to take one action \u2013 gathering resources, crafting items for heroes, or purchasing upgrades for your guild.\nGathering Resources\nThere are four main resources \u2013 cloth, leather, metal, and wood. On your turn, you can gather three resources of the same type, or two resources of any kind. Resources are limited and so is your storage space, so you'll need to plan ahead to use them wisely.\nWith the proper upgrades, you can also access gems and magic \u2013 special, higher quality resources that allow you to craft jeweled or enchanted items.\nCrafting Items\nTo craft an item for a hero, you spend the resources indicated on a quest card, and then gain coins for the item you crafted. Once a hero is equipped, they go on a quest, bringing back treasure and joining your guild.\nSome heroes need two items to go on their quest. If you're the first to craft an item, you earn coins right away, but don't get treasure until the second item is crafted. You get to place your guild mini on the quest, which means the hero will join your guild when the quest is completed.\nUpgrading Your Guild\nWhen you upgrade your guild, you pay coins to hire a specialist, build a new room, or both. Specialists are each unique, but only a few are available at a time, while the rooms are all available from the start of the game.\nYou have limited room for specialists above your guild, and rooms must be placed adjacent to your existing guild structure. You can earn bonus resources or coins when you cover up certain areas of your player board with a room.\nEnding the Game\nWhen the Council of the Wise arrives in Greycastle, each player gets a final turn and may make an offering to the council. Players reveal their treasures and score prestige for everything they've accomplished.\nThe guild with the most prestige earns the title of The King's Guild and their leader takes the throne!\nRulebook\n     Retailers \u2013 Message us on Kickstarter or email us at mirrorboxgames@gmail.com for special retail packages at wholesale prices.\n    (Some reviews refer to the game as Guild Masters, the title we used while in development.

They feature decision driven games embellished with interactive fiction, meaning that the outcome of your current game can affect future games. Each book features game rules, double-sided game sheets, and thematic fiction. The game sheets are perforated for easy removal and designed with writing (and possibly erasing) in mind.\n    We dedicate at least 100 pages to game sheets, meaning that depending on the number of players, you could potentially play the game 100 times. This varies depending on the game. Blood Royals features 50 2 player plays. Star Maps has 100-25 plays for 1-4 players. In addition, if you back for a physical copy, you also get the PDF with full color and printer-friendly printing options for unlimited extra game sheets!\n     Rules included. Plays 1-4 players.\n  These game books change as you play them. Depending on the game, this happens in different ways.\nBlood Royals\nIn Blood Royals, players take on the role of would-be monarchs competing for the throne. When you take a game sheet, it marks who you are. You and your opponent will always be political rivals (ex: Ulthar and Theonid). After you play, the winner is significant. In your next game, you'll circle the name of the character who won the last game. In this way, it creates a \"lineage\" of kings during your campaign. In addition, you'll read the fiction specific to the new King. That fiction will set up the next game, often asking the players to adjust their sheets in some way.\nExample: \"If Ulthar Won Age I: King Ulthar secured his throne, the power quickly affecting his mind. He ordered the construction of a massive castle situated in the center of Blackwallen and has forbidden the lower class from his capitol, denouncing them as would-be assassins. He sees attempts on his life around every corner as his paranoia grows. As the castle is built, so ages Mad King Ulthar. His ambitious distant cousins, Keltor and Diomel have set plans in motion; the kinds of plans that steal thrones from madmen. Help destroy the castle walls to claim the throne, end the madness and reclaim your family name.\"\nStar Maps\nIn Star Maps, the book changes in two ways as you play. First, the winner of a game will be able to name a star on a special star map in the book. Eventually, winners will be able to build a constellation using those stars. At the end of the book, this will be your great discovery, the cooperate hard work of all games played and won.\nThe second way is through technology. Players who don't win can unlock new technology. Unlocked technologies gives Bonuses players can use during the game. In future games, any player can use any available technology. In this way, both the winners and the not-so-winners get to affect the story elements.\nSolo players will have a score guide they'll utilize. Depending on how you score, naming stars (making constellations) and unlocking technology will occur. You can absolutely play through the entire book on your own and have quite the achievement-filled game book at the end!\nFor more information about progression, we're making campaign updates about them.

Two years ago I presented you a 'Cosmic Journey' which was so successful thanks to you. Now I'm now asking you to join me again in this Astral Adventure. Recently I announced I was giving up freelancing completely in order to pursue my own artistic endeavors! This Kickstarter is to help fund those dreams!\nWhat exactly is this Project Funding?\nAs I transition to my own independent work, I'll need all the support and help I can get along the way. I'm beginning to develop worlds and art projects involving those worlds. I've already started collaborating with wonderful game designers and writers on exciting new ideas so all of the proceeds from this Kickstarter are, in some way, going to help fuel that work while those projects evolve.\nI'm also continuing to expand my personal work and reach. As I do the demand for new products increases. Another goal of this Kickstarter is to help me cover the costs of a new print run of my standard products like playmats and mousepads. Everything beyond that funding goal will go directly into ordering and trying new types of products, including little extras to give to all of you wonderful supporters! \nYour help will not only allow me to provide an entirely new line of products but also fuel creating new and unique art!\n Below is the collection of Artwork that I'm presenting on as \"The Astral Adventure\"\nThe 6th piece I'm working on as the Kickstarter is running! Its a very important piece to me and also inspired by the community/fanbase! I'll be making consistent updates with it's progress! It's already underway so I have no doubt it'll be done before the end of the Kickstarter. \n                         Add-Ons\nAdd on any value below to your pledge to receive that item at a special quantity discount price and save on shipping! I'll ask you after the campaign what add-on you wanted.\nMousepad - $10\nMousemat - $15\nPrint - $20\nPlaymat - $30\nPoster - $45\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NolanNasser\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nolannasser/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nolannasser/\nDeviant Art: https://nolannasser.deviantart.com/\nWhere is the money going?\nIt's expensive stocking all of my products and materials for conventions. The last order I made was close to $3000 and the new print run I need to do will be roughly $1500. Then there's the 8%-ish KS fee which will be $160. That leaves about $340 that I'm allocating to marketing expenses. Beyond that everything is going into funding new products! None of this is going into my pocket, it's all being funneled right back into N3 Art (LLC Pending) and in turn that business is how I stay afloat! I'm very transparent about my operations and finances so if you have any more questions, just ask! Thanks again for all of your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks associated with this project!

Overpopulation is destroying the planet. Time is running out. Elite factions are exploring the cosmos for a new home, new technology, new allies, or the resources needed to repair the plight of their damaged home world. With nothing left to lose and on the brink of madness, these warring Earthlings, equipped with deep-space warships with expansive cargo holds, will do whatever it takes to claim the glory for saving humanity...Before The Earth Explodes!   \nBefore The Earth Explodes uses clever tactics and intuition to secure victory in 1 of 4 ways:  \n*Advance to the top of the Tech Track  \n*Colonize 7 new planets  \n*Destroy the opposing faction  \n*Meet a variable victory condition revealed during play\nIn the game, players choose actions simultaneously to determine their course of play. Using a Rock-Paper-Scissors-style of action resolution, a scout will attack an invading ship while an invading ship will damage an away party or a mining vessel while a mining vessel will defend itself against a scout. If a player is able to avoid taking damage they will get to carry out special actions based on the card played. These actions allow players to increase their technology level, encounter an ally ship, clone an opponent's ability, take control of a new planet, or mine for resources.\nBefore the Earth Explodes is 2-player space epic in a small package. Each game takes 20-30 minutes to play. The game was created by the prolific design team and members of Game Artisans of Canada, Daryl Andrews and Adrian Adamescu (Sagrada, Mine All Mines, and the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Showdown).\nGame Setup:\nHere's a basic rundown on how the game is played (see video above for more in depth overview!):\n  Players choose and reveal their action cards simultaneously.\n  At the beginning of this phase, players resolve the icons on the portion of the card with the image.\n  In Phase 1, players may gain ship cards, deal damage, and cancel their opponent's action.\n  As long as players haven't been dealt damage they may resolve their actions (on the bottom portion of the card) in alphabetical order.\n    Next, as long as they haven't been damaged, players may spend resources to colonize a planet. Planets provide one-time use abilities as well as move players towards victory.\n  In the final phase, resources, planet cards, and ship cards are refilled to prepare for the next round.\n  There are several paths to victory that require outthinking your opponent and being attentive and flexible to the changing landscape or the game!\n Check out Jason giving an overview at Origins Game Fair:\n    As with every Green Couch Games title, we try to pack a big experience into a small box so you can easily get our games to the table with casual and hardcore gamer's alike!\nWe think Before The Earth Explodes is GREAT but don't just take our word for it!

Hurry, before we run out of time!\n         At the Captain Level and beyond, your pledge includes a killer custom playmat for organizing your play area! These playmats are cloth with rubber backing and measure 12\" by 18\" and 1/16\" in thickness. These will not be available in stores!\nYou can add-on one of our previous games by adjusting the amount of your pledge! The prices below include shipping. You can add this amount to your pledged amount and we'll collect information about the games you added at the end of the campaign. We'll also ship the add-on games out before Before The Earth Explodes, right after we receive the funds (about two-three weeks after the Kickstarter closes).  \nHere's the prices including shipping (which are cheaper than buying them from our webstore): \n                        Before The Earth Explodes is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US! International Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.  \nAdded Shipping as follows:\nExplorer Pledge Level: US-Included!, Canada-$5, Everywhere Else-$8 \nCaptain and General Pledge Level: US-Included!, Canada-$10, Everywhere Else-$17 \nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is CUSTOMS FRIENDLY. The low price point and small box for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the recent rate increase in the US Postal Service, and we must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game below MSRP while covering the first $5 of shipping costs for all backers. We'll also be adding some extra content at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course).\nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Before The Earth Explodes that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components to make this cool game even cooler! We have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a peek at the first couple stretch goals! We'll announce more and funding thresholds as we get closer to funding!\nThe cloth resource bag is unlocked! Onward and upward!\nCustom wooden tie breaker token is unlocked! To the cosmos!\nAt $9000, we upgraded to a box cover with Spot UV to help the awesome artwork standout even more! \nSpot UV is a process that involves adding a varnish to specific spots of the printed material to draw the eye's attention and give it a super fantastic visual pop and added texture.\nAt $10,000 we'll have the game logo added to the cloth resource bag!\nAt $11,000, we'll increase the size of the player boards from standard sized cards to tarot sized cards!\nIf you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the Work-in-Progress Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! The rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the feel of the art and graphic design.  \nThe rules are hosted on BoardGameGeek and will require a free account to download.

By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.\nOver the course of the last year, we've released over 3000 copies of tiny Twin Stars sets (a full game is 1 scenario & 2 characters) via Kickstarter stretch goals and Patreon monthly rewards. Some were sent out in huge numbers (Rule The World) and some were in very limited numbers (Stop The Virus). \nNow we have gathered everything together, packaged it all up and added some new cards for Twin Stars: Adventure Series I. This group of 6 scenarios and 12 characters, makes for 396 unique combinations and tons of solo replayability. \n The game comes in a few versions. \nWallet Game (above) - Including 12 Characters, 6 Scenarios, provide your own dice and tokens. (4 dice and 10-12 coins/tokens)\nDeluxe Game (below) - Including 12 Characters, 6 Scenarios, 4 dice and 30 custom printed punch out tokens.\nCatch Up Packs - Custom orders to pick up anything missing from your existing collection.\nHere's a quick run through the actions of a turn. \nYou will continue until you fulfill or fail the scenario requirements.\nFor a full game walkthrough, check out the video below.\nCheck out the complete rules here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mujbdswca30lq7l/TS-Rules.pdf?dl=0\nAnd try the print and play of Escape the Brig here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvp7c2gwigayu8j/TWINSTARS-PNP.pdf?dl=0\n\"The game is incredibly well balanced, providing that you remember to do the skill checks when called for and actually play by the rules (I may have messed up a couple of times). The game forces you to make tough choices.\" -Jeremy Davis, Everything Board Games\nhttp://www.everythingboardgames.com/2017/07/twin-stars-collection-kickstarter.html\n\"I enjoy the system a lot. It\u2019s got a good challenge to it, and can be played very quickly in a small space. I think it\u2019s great that there are a number of scenarios and characters out there \u2013 this system lends itself to expansion. My favorite of the scenarios right now is probably Stop the Virus because I think it\u2019s the most different, but they\u2019re all good (at least the four that I\u2019ve tried). If you\u2019re interested in solo microgames, this is definitely one to check out when the Kickstarter goes live on July 19.\" -Jesse Hickle, Boards and Bees\nhttps://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/0676/\n\"For anyone that regularly plays board and card games solo, Twin Stars is a no-brainer, especially at its price point.

Don't panic! Click the image to be automatically directed to where you can order Overworld!\n  Overworld is a competitive tile-placement, territory control, and exploration board game for 2-4 Players with a 1-player Solo Quest Variant! It was designed by Nemo Rathwald for ages 14+ and plays in about 30 minutes. The most beautiful thing about Overworld is its elegance in simplicity; it takes only 5 minutes to teach but mastery will only develop after many, many plays.\nIf you enjoy games like...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTakenoko\nTsuro\nThen Overworld should especially resonate with you!\nIn Overworld, players act as explorers piecing together bit by bit the map of the Overworld by placing specially designed interlocking tiles drawn from a bag onto an expanding world map and adding your explorer tokens onto any new tile you explore. The interlocking teeth will only allow you to place your tiles in legal locations, making gameplay very smooth and easy to learn. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\" \nEnclosed gaps will eventually form in the landscape, and in these gaps are where elusive Dungeons are discovered. Discover the Dungeons furthest apart from one another and control the most territory with your explorers riding Umbirds and Ships to win!\nOverworld is the second installment of our Super Nano Enhanced Series, which began with Fire of Eidolon (shipping now worldwide!) This project will undergo several ENHANCEMENTS during the campaign which will upgrade the components and content of Overworld, and can be unlocked via Backer total Stretch Goals, Funding Stretch Goals, and Social Media goals, which will all be explained in detail below.\nEVERY BACKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Overworld is mechanically like a Euro-game but is also highly thematic and heavily inspired by the 16-bit era of Role Playing and Adventure video games of the 1990's. It is visually stimulating and loaded with stylistic parody and in-jokes that fans of retro videogames will appreciate while still being accessible and wholly enjoyable by everyone all within a unique, original, and compelling game that stands entirely on its own. We started the Super Nano Enhanced Series with Fire of Eidolon and we continue the tradition as you explore that world in ages past...in Overworld!\nOverworld came to Magic Meeple Games as a fully complete publish-ready game called Mirage which had been nearly published by another company before coming to us at Origins a couple years ago. We absolutely loved Mirage and saw an opportunity to re-theme the game to fit into our Super Nano Enhanced Series. With a new title and theme, Overworld has been under iteration and development for years and we feel it is finally ready for everyone to enjoy!\nEasy to learn and teach, difficult to master, immersive theme, and a new board every time you play!\nHere are some of the features you'll find in this game and in our Kickstarter campaign:\nGreat Gameplay! - High praise from reviewers, gamers, convention-goers of all ages for Overworld! \nHigh Replayability! - Overworld uses a brand new PUZZELOCK TILE SYSTEM and is never the same game twice! Procedurally generate the world as you play to make every game a brand new story!\nHigh Accessibility! - Overworld uses a very simple set of rules has an extremely gentle learning curve and is extremely easy to pick up and play! The game can be taught in about FIVE MINUTES and after playing a few times will players begin to understand the depth that Overworld offers!\nBacker-only Discounts! - After all Enhancements from this campaign, Overworld will have an MSRP of at least $35.99. Our Backers can get it right now for just $25 no matter how much content is added on through Enhancements and Stretch Goals! That's a savings of nearly $11 per copy!\nENHANCEMENTS! Stretch Goals! Achievements! - Your pledge WILL make the game better! Together we will make it awesome! Every backer matters!\nInteractive Kickstarter campaign - Throughout the campaign we will make decisions about Enhancements and features based on the feedback YOU provide in our update polls! Leave your mark on tabletop gaming history!\nSimplest Bundle Pricing on KickStarter! - Order as many copies of Overworld as you want at $25 each and pay shipping only for the first one! Just add $25 per extra copy and enter the total at the pledge confirmation screen. Boom. Done. No spreadsheets. No tricks.\nCustomer Support - It is our duty and honor to put your concerns at ease throughout the ENTIRE production process. Frequent updates during the campaign and no less than one update a month post-campaign until delivery. If you have a question or just want to say hello, reach out to us!\nand now for something NEW:\nMONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're borrowing a page from Stonemaier Games and offering a Money-back guarantee with the Overworld project! Within one month of receiving Overworld, if you're unhappy with the product and customer service you've received, just send the game back to us and we'll issue a full refund of your original pledge!\nNemo Rathwald's Puzzelock Interlocking Tile Design solves the #1 problem with tile-placement games!\n  Did you run out of play space? You can actually move this board and everything stays IN PLACE!\n  Questions? We're here to help! We aim to have 24-hour or less response time to all inquiries during the campaign!\n \nSuper Nano Enhanced Series games undergo many ENHANCEMENTS throughout the campaign, many are achieved like normal Stretch Goals, but some are special and will require involvement in the comments or on social media!\nHave a look at what we'e accomplished so far!\n      Click the image to visit our Twitter page!\n  And click HERE to visit our Facebook Page! \n  Measure the X/Y limits of your map and calculate your score much faster with this handy tool!\n  Towns and Sidequests now part of the Overworld package!\n  LINEN FINISH NOW INCLUDED!\n  You asked for it, and we've been saving it for the epic finish! Can we reach this high?\n    Your turn in Overworld is 4 simple steps: \n                                           Draw a Land Tile (from the bag) \nAttach it to another tile on the board (IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!) \nAdd Explorers to the Tile you added (one per segment, Umbirds for land, Ships for Sea) \nResolve Gaps! (Check for Dungeon discoveries!)\nJust how easy is it to play Overworld? Have a look!\nThe game will begin with a single Coastline Tile on the board. Begin your turn by drawing a Land Tile from the bag.\n  You may choose to place the tile LAND side up or SEA side up, as long as there is a place to connect it where the teeth fit without obstruction. IF THE TEETH FIT, IT'S LEGIT!\n  After placing a Land Tile, place three of your Explorer tokens on it, Umbird tokens explore LAND, and Ship tokens explore SEA. Each player gets seven of both to Explore the Overworld!\n  Yellow's turn is over, play continues in this way as Red and White each get a turn...until a gap is created into which no other tile can fit, then a Dungeon is discovered!\n  Dungeons are Discovered by counting up all of the Explorer tokens belonging to each player in all regions connected ORTHOGONALLY to the gap. Yellow has the most Explorers connected to this gap and gets to claim the Dungeon discovery.\nExplorer tokens (Umbirds or Ships) that are used to Discover a Dungeon (i.e. those belonging to the player that had the most and placed their dungeon door in the gap) are returned to that player to be used again, the others stay on the board!\nTake note that player White placed the tile that gave player Yellow that Dungeon! This is a very important tactic that you will need to deprive your opponents of territory!\nIf there is a tie, the player who placed the tile gets to decide who breaks the tie and gets the Dungeon Discovery. \nPlay continues until no more tiles remain in the bag, then scoring begins.\nEND OF GAME\nYou collect points for the Explorer tokens you still have in play, and the total distance of the shortest path (in Orthogonal spaces) around all of your Dungeon doors in play, door-to-door-to-door. Like this:\n  Click here to see the complete End Game scoring ruleset!\n    CURRENT GAME CONTENTS:\nThis list will change and evolve as we unlock Stretch Goals and add Enhancements! \nBox & Rulebook - Similar size and style as a 16-bit video game's box and manual!\n32x PUZZELOCK Land Tiles - Double-sided and Die-cut with our special Puzzelock design that physically prevents invalid tile placement. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\"\n28x Umbird Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n28x Ship Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n12x Dungeon Door Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n4x Quick-Reference/Faction Cards - Poker-Sized Cards - Never forget a rule or which color belongs to which player with these handy Quick-Reference/Faction cards! THANK YOU TO OUR DAY-1 BACKERS!\n1x Tile Bag - For randomization of tiles, through Enhancement goals, this could become a luxurious drawstring cloth bag with an embroidered design!\nExtra Zip-Lock Baggies - To carry everything and keep it organized!\nEXPANSION CONTENT PLANNED - To be revealed via Stretch Goal Enhancements. Planned content includes: Solo play and more than one Mini-Expansion!\nBONUS! Every copy of Overworld sold here will include an exclusive promo for our previous project, Fire of Eidolon! Thank you to all of the backers that helped us get here today!!\n  Throughout the campaign we will add additional goals to meet beyond our base funding goal. Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Overworld. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different and put more focus on Backer Participation.                       \nThere are several ways to help support the Overworld project, here is more information about each available Pledge level to help you decide how you can support our project!\n                                                                                                                                                                                              Not enough Reviews for you?

Optimized sheets now consume 15% less ink!\n  WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nThe best thing you can do to help improve Overworld is to back our project. The SECOND best thing you can do to help Overworld is to spread the word and share our campaign on all of your favorite Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\n      Or, use this to make your own and we'll post it here!\n  Increase our total reach by FOLLOWING Magic Meeple Games on Twitter!\n  Visit us on Facebook and LIKE our page to help us unlock additional ENHANCEMENTS!\n       Adding additional copies of Overworld to your Pledge will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. Add $25 to your Pledge for each extra copy if our built-in Pledge levels do not suit your needs. We will discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Overworld in each order!*\nRewards for this project will be shipped primarily from the USA. Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs. For the Fire of Eidolon project, we ultimately opted for a combination effort using Amazon and SFC (Ship from China) as many highly successful Kickstarter projects have done and the results have been favorable!\nRather than lock ourselves in to a specific method of shipping, we analyze the order distribution at the time of manufacturing to find the most cost-effective and time-effective distribution options available to us. This is our commitment to you in our goal for constant process-improvement and to provide the best possible products that we can!\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address. \nResidents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $20 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries. \nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partners offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. If any VAT taxes or customs fees would apply to your order, we make sure those are pre-paid to make it easier for YOU! \nWhile we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in our ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. If all of our efforts still do not meet your expectations, you are still protected by our Money-Back guarantee! Pledge with Confidence!\nDelivering your reward responsibly\nOur primary goal and responsibility as Magic Meeple Games is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for, at the level of quality they expect, and as quickly as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Overworld well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. \nSo far, Magic Meeple Games has produced and shipped two feature projects. Darkrock Ventures, which has fully fulfilled; and Fire of Eidolon which has been partially fulfilled already and will complete fulfillment before this Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nWe have run into slight speedbumps with each of these projects which hinged on the final completion of graphics. We can be proud of the fact the amount of delay was reduced dramatically with the fulfillment of FoE as compared to DRV, but we can do better. This time, we have a fully graphic-designed rulebook completed IN ADVANCE for everyone to enjoy which means we won't be waiting on it before manufacturing. This project focuses on the physical components of the game and less on artwork, this will also help us accelerate our manufacturing process and get the game made that much faster.\nIn fact, it is our goal to enter manufacturing on this project by October, and ALREADY have prepared art, graphics, and rules all in advance to make this a realistic goal. We are challenging ourselves to make Overworld our best-record for delivery, we have laid out even more groundwork ahead of time and together we can make this possible! Thank you for your support!\nWe do not plan to use use the built-in survey system for the Overworld Campaign, after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate or hidden Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous projects, Fire of Eidolon and Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional products added beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n    Seven hundred playtests. Two laser cutters. Twelve BoardGameGeekGold. Six Pez dispensers. The heat of a thousand suns. Boardgame designer Nemo Rathwald has most of these things. \nNemo's game design goals are:  \nInteresting choices\nLittle downtime\nLots of gameplay from as few rules as possible \nMultiple viable paths to victory \nComponents that physically don't let you break rules, so you don't have to remember them.\nNemo started searching the shelves for boardgames which turned out to only exist in his imagination. So he started making them so he could play them. He got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.\nIn 2010, Nemo discovered i3Detroit hackerspace, a nonprofit community workshop with an educational mission in art and technology, where he volunteers as a Board Director, an Officer, and an Instructor. There, he upgraded his ability to make lavish show-stopping board game prototypes. Due to his experience in publishing, he fully illustrates and preps his games and rulebooks for pre-press in advance. In 2013 he changed careers from graphic design to web development. In 2014 he signed his first board game publishing contract at Protospiel, a convention for board game designers. \nNemo Rathwald carries a wheeled suitcase of board games in the trunk of his car at all times.\nHere is an unboxing video of our last production, Fire of Eidolon, so you can see the standard of quality we aim for with our projects!\nMagic Meeple Games, LLC. is a tabletop publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. By gamers, for gamers, we are Magic Meeple the Boardgame People! \nFounded, co-owned, and operated by a husband/wife team; We are passionate, lifelong tabletop gamers and we want to show that passion through the games we choose to design, develop, and publish. In our first campaign, Gamelyn Games partnered with us to elevate Magic Meeple Games to their level of quality and customer satisfaction straight out of the gate and we upheld that standard as we moved forward with our first solo campaign, Fire of Eidolon! Now we return for our THIRD Kickstarter project with hopefully many more to come.\nMagic Meeple Games origins began in the industry in 2007 through independent game design, company co-owner Ian Stedman is a published designer himself and has worked on several projects for several other publishing companies as a consultant and designed Magnum Opus for Clever Mojo Games. \nThis is the third core entry into our publishing catalog, and we drawn from the experience of designers, developers, publishers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers all over the world.

It is prone to many surprises and problems, even for experienced publishers. \n\nFortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, Retail sales, and Graphics Design.\n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. Our first solo project, Fire of Eidolon was also a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur previous project fell a couple months short of our target Shipping date, and we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again.\n\nFor this project, we are focusing on a game which came to us very much complete. Additional features have been added and small tweaks have been made here and there, but suffice to say, the game is already finished and manufacturing-ready. All that is left is to put in the add-on content that is unlocked in the campaign, update the already designed fully-graphical rulebook (something that has been a challenge in the past) and send off the files. We have never been in a better position to go straight-to-print.\n\nWe are also expanding our horizons as we seek manufacturing and distribution, we are adapting to find better solutions to save time and money, this began by working with Discover Gaming Fulfillment with the distribution of Fire of Eidolon. Thanks to them, most of our backers have already gotten their rewards!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay that we could not control. This is just an example as things such as this cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributors, and our manufacturers and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially on profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\nThe Trade Federation specializes in generating large amounts of Trade and in gaining Authority (increasing your score).\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs.\u201d While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more-daring human traders.\nThe Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. \nThe Star Empire is a combat-oriented faction that draws many cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion.\nThe Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\nA New Frontier\nIn the early days of space travel, the need for fast and efficient colonization drove the corporations of Earth to invest heavily in warp gate research, headed by Nathan Martin, a brilliant scientist ahead of his time. Martin's team executed many successful tests of this new technology, and the decision was made to create a massive deep-colonization fleet to send through the gate.\nDespite Martin's protests that more testing was needed, the fleet was assembled and colonists chosen. After the colony fleet were sent through, people of all nations watched in growing horror as the automated probes on the other side of the gate never recorded the fleet's arrival. The entire fleet had been lost!\nWith thousands presumed dead and staggering financial losses, a painstaking investigation was initiated. A fatal flaw in the warp gate generator was discovered. Each use of it had made tiny fractures in space time, and that had made each future use more likely to fail. The technology was abandoned.    \nHundreds of years later, after humanity was split by the arrival of the Blobs, the Trade Federation quietly started up Martin's research again. Unsatisfied with their share of plunder from the Colony Wars, the Trade Federation had grown desperate for new, uncontested worlds to exploit. Research funding again poured into the ancient warp gate technology and a breakthrough was achieved.  \nThe Trade Federation began to explore and colonize distant planets, far from previously explored space. Their exclusive access to this remote region of space was short lived, however. Hackers stole the warp gate research and sold it to the highest bidders amongst the Star Empire, Machine Cult and the Blobs.\nNow, all the factions race for a foothold in this new frontier!\nVideos and Reviews\nThere are many videos and reviews of various Star Realms sets online. Here are a few:\n    Project Notes\n\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our shipping hubs in the United States, the EU, or elsewhere, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in the EU may receive product before backers in the USA, or vice versa. \n*Kickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nKickstarter exclusive cards and sets will eventually (in a year or two) be remade with new art for general sale. The Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art.\nNothing is final until it is printed.\nWe are still doing playtesting and development of these sets, so cards may change. All art, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change.

I'll send you a couple of super-high-quality PDFs that mirror the files sent to the manufacturer.  This means full bleed on each card, and handy cut lines to ensure you make a beautiful game that you print out at home.\n$30: Extra Copy of Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture\nYou will only be charged for shipping on your original pledge--any additional copies of Oaxaca you purchase will have free shipping!\n$15: Roll-up Play Mat\nIf you're pledging for an extra copy of the game, consider grabbing an extra play mat as well!\nI am pleased to be able to say that Oaxaca will be my first EU-friendly project--in fact, it's also Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia friendly too!  If you're unfamiliar with the term, this means that a portion of the games will be sent directly to the those destinations after manufacturing, and then they'll go out to all the respective backers--this means backers in those destinations won't have to worry about import or customs fees.  I pay them!\nThe exception to this is the collector's edition, which will need to be assembled in my home before I mail it out--unfortunately, I cannot offer import-friendly shipping on this pledge level.\nUS shipping for all pledge levels is free.  For backers outside the US, a $15 shipping charge will be added to your pledge to help pay the cost of shipping, except for Mexico which is $5, and Brazil which is $20.  For the collector's edition, which will be sent with one-of-a-kind handicrafts and insured, shipping is $50 for international backers ($75 for Brazil).  \nBecause of how quickly the $100 collector's edition has sold out, we're offing an $80 version that is the same, but includes no Oaxacan woodcarvings--sorry!  The shipping prices outlined above apply to this pledge level as well.\nCurrently, backers from all other territories will have their games shipped from the US, though I am working on Canada-friendly shipping right now.\nYou may pledge for additional copies of the game by adding $30 per copy to your pledge--no additional shipping charges will be imposed. \nWhen I first laid eyes on Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture back in 2015, it was under a different working title: In the Ruins. Designed by Sarah and Will Reed, In the Ruins had an archaeology theme where players would visit dig sites, gain artifacts, and research them for points. It was a really fun game with, well, a competent and well-represented theme.    \nSimilar to Sarah and Will\u2019s Project Dreamscape before it, I knew pretty early in my first play-through that I wanted to publish In the Ruins--it was fun! My favorite thing about the game is how it rewards planning by giving you opportunities to create combos and wipe multiple Craft Tokens from your cards in a single turn. But when it came time to actually publish the game--when we put our heads together to develop it--we had some difficulties coming up with an art direction we liked. While archaeology is the focus in many of my favorite games such as Thebes, Artifacts, Inc., and the aptly named Archaeology: The Card Game, I didn't find it to be compelling subject matter to explore in such a well-represented genre. That\u2019s when I brought up a Oaxacan theme, and I think all three of us were a little surprised at how quickly everything came together.  \nI\u2019ve been fascinated with Oaxaca\u2019s handicrafts for years now, ever since my wife surprised me with my first alebrije while she studied abroad in the beautiful state. I\u2019ve collected little bits of barro negro pottery and tin art here and there, and I\u2019m still spellbound by the incredibly specific processes Oaxaca\u2019s artists employ when crafting their beautiful art--often using raw materials right there in the state! You really won\u2019t find anything quite like it anywhere in the world.\nOver the last two and a half years, Sarah, Will, and I have spent many days and nights honing the game into what you see now. Ideas and mechanics have been suggested, adopted, discarded, tweaked, and boiled down into a beautiful game that we\u2019re all really proud of and eager to share with you. The following play-testers made this possible:  \nGreg Amaral, John Brieger, David Bruglia, Davey Chacon, Angel Elkins, Cassie Elle, Jareth Elkins, Sarah Graybill, Noreen Gwilliam, Owen Gwilliam, Ashley Hershey, Vincent Hirtzel, Jon Knight, Jacob Knoester, Ashley Leaphart, David Leaphart, Marty Lewis, Walter Jay Little V, Johnson Luong, Jason Newman, Connor O\u2019Hare, Cody Parcell, Jenni Parcell, David Reeser, Robert Salls, John Shulters, Roland Strebe, Jason Taylor, and John Vang.\n  I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with Derek Bacon in the past--he illustrated many of the cards in Baldrick\u2019s Tomb (as well as its two expansions), and he illustrated everything in Tower. Knowing the art direction we wanted to take with Oaxaca, Derek Bacon was the obvious person for the job.  \nAnd speaking of art direction, if you\u2019re already familiar with Oaxaca\u2019s many handicrafts (or better yet, if you weren\u2019t familiar with them but this Kickstarter page prompted you to look them up), then you may be a little surprised at the artwork in this game.  \nThere are many table top games out there named after places and events that are really good about producing authentic artwork that perfectly portrays the tone and setting--games like Thebes, for example. One aspect of Oaxaca\u2019s development that was particularly challenging for us was that, to an extent, we actively avoided a certain degree of authenticity.\nSounds a little odd, right? Well, the interesting thing about Oaxaca is that we\u2019re portraying handicraft traditions that are alive and well today. So, out of respect, we opted for a more stylized approach to avoid inadvertently miming actual artwork made by real Oaxacan artisans. In fact, if you look through some of the illustrations (especially the pottery and textiles), you\u2019ll see that Derek specifically avoided using well-known designs and patterns.  \nThe result is a wonderful collection of artwork that is vibrant and colorful--a collection we believe captures the beauty and diversity of Oaxaca\u2019s many handicrafts--but also one that aims to be respectful to the beautiful source material. \n  A lot of people wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of just waiting to get it later in retail. The biggest reason not to do wait with Oaxaca is that it is planned to be Kickstarter limited. We currently have no plans to release this in retail settings because we don\u2019t have the right connections to get it into distribution. Thus, if you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have that many extra copies to sell through UndineStudios.com and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\nKickstarter Limited \u2013 the game will be hard to find after the campaign.\nSubsidized Shipping \u2013 we\u2019re making it free shipping to the US, $20 to Brazil and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs, whatever they may be.\nDiscounted \u2013 after the campaign, we will be selling some copies, but for $35 instead of the $30 you\u2019d pay now. Also, actual shipping will be charged then.\nHelp Us Improve Oaxaca \u2013 we have a lot of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality and add more content to the game for everyone!\nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT.\nAnd most importantly, without backers, this game would not get made. We really appreciate every person\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter campaign (the third for a tabletop game--I ran one earlier this year for an audio book). I learn a lot each time. My first campaign, Tower, ran into some issues during fulfillment (it was a few months late), but went smoothly overall. My second campaign, Project Dreamscape, ran very smoothly and delivered on time (though I did go over budget and had to spend out of pocket). \n\nThe majority of the challenges with Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture were faced during development--we tried to be very careful about presentation and routinely sought outside opinion on the art and theme. \n\nFor this campaign, my priorities are a timely delivery, coming in under budget, and real Euro-friendly shipping (In the past, my games have simply been small/inexpensive enough that there were no issues for backers in Europe). I'm in talks right now with several European fulfillment companies to have a portion of the games shipped directly to them. Beyond that, should we be fortunate enough to reach our funding goal, most of the art is ready to go and files can be submitted to the manufacturer shortly after completion of the campaign.\n\nIf things run behind schedule, I've found the best approach is to always be up front and communicative with backers.

We love playing cards, but we couldn\u2019t really find anything that was quite suited for our minimalist way of traveling. When you travel as much as we do, you don\u2019t want to carry anything extra around. Every item makes a difference. We\u2019re big fans of improvement, and decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The making of the Air Deck has taken us through several countries, and we\u2019ve met many wonderful people along the way. Now we have the prototype ready and we\u2019re proud of the result. Meet our new travel companion, the Air Deck. The world's first truly travel optimized playing cards!\nThe Air Deck team\nKey Features:\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nPremium printing with a protective matte varnish\nMade from extra durable premium PVC\nSlightly textured back, smooth front \nSturdy deluxe matte tuck box \nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\nPerks:\nFree world-wide shipping\nFree PDF \u201cCard games from around the world\u201d\nOption to buy the Air Deck in white color\nHere's a mock-up of how the Air Deck will look in red color.\n  With the Air Deck with you can play everywhere anytime. It fits easily on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table.\n  Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, but we've designed the Air Deck to be extremely durable.\nQuality\nWhile we wanted a compact and light deck, we didn't want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high end plastic materials. The materials were taken through  scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want.\nThe cards have a premium feel to them.\n  The Air Deck is designed to be brought anywhere. It takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket.\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and it\u2019s totally waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub.\n  The cards are washable. Liquids and dust rinse off easily.\n  The Air Deck is a surefire convesation starter.\nHandling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on the back, while the front is plain. This provides excellent handling and a good grip.\nThe Air Deck shuffles easily\n  Our goal was to make the Air Deck both visually interesting and simple to read.\nDesign\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to create a fitting minimalist design for the Air Deck. For us, it was key that the cards are uncluttered, symmetrical and easy to read. We also wanted to create something fun and \u2018out-of-the- ordinary\u2019. The Air Deck\u2019s unique design will no doubt act as a conversation starter on your travels. The deck consists of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers and measures 87mm X 32mm. Despite the smaller footprint we\u2019ve retained all the features of standard decks. The length ensures that it handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nJack, queen, king and ace of hearts.\n  The Air Deck comes with a solid tuck box. It's laminated for extra protection and features spot UV printing.\n For this campaign we\u2019re offering the cards in two different colors; black and white.\nThe Air Deck in black color\n  The Air Deck in white color.\n  The Air Deck in red color\nWe hope that you are as excited about the Air Deck as we are. Support our project, and give yourself, or someone you care about, the perfect playing cards for traveling.\nAdd a nice view to your game.\n  The Air Deck is incredibly strong and flexible.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe do not anticipate any major challenges to this project, and we promise to stay transparent and update you every step of the way. \n\nMuch of the work is already done. The design phase of the cards is finalized and we\u2019ve made the prototype you see in the video. We\u2019ve had personal meetings with the manufacturer and agreed on all details, and we've gotten several quotes for fulfillment and shipping from reliable partners.

Essentially, Rage of the Trolls has everything from the original Gruff and more.\" -Matt Mitchell, PopWrapped\n\"These mechanics do make for an interesting cooperative experience. Our playtesting team felt challenged and encouraged to really study their shepherds, gruffs, and cards to make sure they were playing with optimal strategies. Its a great feeling to be forced to make adjustments between games like this because the thrill of victory is a great payoff for experimentation.\" -Stephen Duetzmann, Engaged Family Gaming\n\"It\u2019s absolutely one of my favorite card battle games of all time.\" -Rob Kalajian, A Pawn's Perspective\n\"I enjoy a good solo game, and Gruff: Rage of the Trolls did not disappoint. The only difference between solo and cooperative gameplay is the player count. Even though it was just me against the troll, I still felt as if I was playing against a worthy, real-life opponent, having to outthink and outplay it just as I would a friend playing against me.\" -Benjamin Kocher, Everything Board Games\n\"All-in-all I give this game another seal of approval. This game does it wonderfully! If you like cooperative games as well as competitive card games, this game is going to be a nice addition!\" -Michael J Wright, Unfiltered Gamer\nIn Praise of Gruff...\n\"In every sense, Gruff has been a labor of love for the folks working on it, and you can see it in every monstrous detail of the fun but terrifying art style. Gruff\u2018s simple concepts allow for both new gamers to have a competitive card game experience, while still giving seasoned players the depth of a full collectible card game.\"  \n- ROBERT HORNBEK, Geek & Sundry\n\"What I like most about Gruff is how it speed-injects the feeling of other constructed deck games in its own tight format. I was a big Magic player for a long time, and what I loved most about it was playing big creatures and cool spells. Gruff distills the constructed experience, with the creatures providing the mana and lots of synergies between cards, so that you get a lot of that satisfying feel at a fraction of the time investment.\"  \n-Andrew Fisher, Gameosity\n\"A card game stemming from the likes of Magic, but similarities end with the cards.

We are in the final hours and hoping to unlock a few more stretch goals before we close! \nSo far, we've unlocked a system logo button for the core game at $45k, a \"Mutton Ben\" button in the funvelope at $55k, a Fight City Mapple map at $60k, and additional cards for the funvelope at $65k.\nNext up are Button Murderers from Kill Doctor Lucky at $70k, a Skully patch (the \"o\" in Button Men) at $75k, and Button Men Pairs at $80k! We'll also unlock a Button Men coin at $85k and bring Fight City back at $95k. You can read more about these in Update #10.\nButton Men is a quick, clever dice game designed by James Ernest. It's easy to learn, loaded with strategy, and one of the best games we've ever made.\nEach player selects a character card, and uses the dice described on the card. Players start by rolling all of their dice, and then take turns capturing each other's dice.\nYou score points based on the size of the dice you capture (and keep), and the player with the most points wins.\nWith endless variations of character recipes, unusual die types, and some simple new 'campaign' rules, Button Men is a game you can enjoy again and again.\nHere's a how-to-play video that explains the basics:\nWe first released Button Men in 1999. It won two Origins Awards, for Best Abstract Board Game, and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. (And it doesn't even have a board!) A few years later, the web version, Button Men Online, also won for Best Play by Mail Game.\nButton Men has had dozens of expansions, from Cheapass Games and many other publishers. To date, the game has had more than 300 different official characters.\nAnd now we want to bring it back!\nButton Men started on pin-back buttons. The biggest difference with this new edition is that we are printing the characters on trading cards.\nWe will still make character buttons available, but the trading card format makes the game much less expensive. We can make a starter set with 48 characters and 30 dice for about the same price as a set of 12 buttons (and no dice). If that starter set does well in stores, we can make expansion packs that are just decks of cards.\nThe new starter set of Button Men is set in Fight City, a 1950's gangster town somewhere on the US Gulf Coast (think New Orleans, but not real). A \"Button Man\" is a low-level gangster, so the title still fits, even without the buttons. We've stretched the definition a bit, to include a wide range of criminals, male and female, at many levels of the power structure.\nThe Fight City set is divided into four factions, each with a different style of play. Those from Downtown (\"The Core\") use normal dice only. Characters from The West Side have Shadow dice, which make attacks upside-down. Those from the Delta region use Poison dice, which are worth negative points. And characters from Uptown have Rush Dice, which can capture two dice in a single attack! \nYou can read more about the different factions and their special rules in Updates #2, #4, #6, and #8.\nThe basic Button Men rules haven't changed at all, so every existing Button Men character is compatible with the new set. The set's new rules include Rush Dice, rules for drafting characters and dice from a limited pool, as well as several  \"campaign\" variations that let you play multiple characters on each side.\nThe Button Men starter set will be $35 in retail stores, and you can get it here for the same price, along with our famous \"funvelope,\" which is a bundle of cool stuff that you can only get from us. You can also get your favorite factions on buttons, if you want to pledge a little more. You can even become a Button Man yourself with the Drawn In levels.\nHere's the Breakdown:\nThe Funvelope: In every campaign, we add a few cool freebies as our way of saying thanks. The Button Men funvelope will include the following:\nEight additional character cards\nA souvenir poker chip\nA \"Skully\" logo button (the skull inside the \"O\")\nMore cool stuff  - check out the stretch goals!\nWe have a $15 pledge level that includes only the funvelope, for backers who are on a budget, and for anyone who would rather wait and buy the core game from their favorite game store.\nButton Men: Starter Set. The Button Men core game will include 48 characters on trading cards, 30 polyhedral dice, and the game rules. \nThe pool of 30 dice includes 20 light dice and 10 dark dice (most likely ivory and black), in sizes d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20. This is the minimum functional dice set, which allows you to play any combination of two characters against each other, although sometimes you may have limited choices for your Swing Dice. You can always add your own dice for more flexibility, but we chose this assortment to maximize gameplay and minimize cost.\nThe $35 \"Button Men\" pledge level includes the core game as well as the funvelope.\nThe Cards Alone: A few of our backers asked if they could get just the character cards, because they already have enough dice. We have added two inexpensive levels that include just the pack of 48 cards, and not the full starter set. One level is the card pack alone for $15, and the other also includes the funvelope, for $25.\nThis pack of cards won't have a box. It's just 48 cards in shrink wrap, not packaged for retail. If you would prefer to wait, you'll also be able to get this assortment of cards from our friends at Drive Thru Cards after the campaign has shipped.\nA Note on Production: We will print the game components in the USA, and use genuine Koplow dice (which are made in China). This is not the cheapest way to make this game, but the components will be of the highest quality, and we prefer it that way. You can read more about this decision in Update #7.\nAdding Factions: Do you love buttons? So do we! We're going to make individual pin-back buttons of the Fight City characters available after the campaign, but if you'd like to add a block of buttons to your pledge, we have four pledge levels that include one or more factions of 12 characters. The factions are:\nThe Core (art in Update #2)\nWest Side (art in Update #4)\nThe Delta (art in Update #6)\nUptown (art in Update #8)\nCustom Artwork: Our talented artists Cheyenne Wright and Nate Taylor have agreed to draw ten backers apiece! Backers at the original \"Drawn In\" level will receive everything from the \"Add Four Factions\" level, as well as a character portrait based on themselves (or someone they choose), both as an art print and a digital copy. You will also receive ten pin-back buttons featuring your character and unique Button Men recipe!\nBonus Levels: Two more Button Men artists have signed on to add to the Drawn In levels! Ryan Kinnaird and John Kovalic now each have their own Drawn In level.  You can read more about these artists in Update #5.\nNote: The Drawn In characters will not appear in the core set (the timing isn't right), but we just might be able to include them in a future set. Only if we have permission from the individuals, of course!\nAlso Note: Nate and Cheyenne will each draw ten backers for the original Drawn In level. If you have a preference for one or the other, we can't promise that you will get him, but we will give preference to those with earlier backer numbers.\nWe've crushed our initial funding goal, and now we want to make the game even better! Here are some stretch goals to help us take Button Men to the next level.\nFirst, an Announcement: After reviewing samples from China, we've decided to print Button Men in the US. This is what we usually do, but with all the dice in this game, we thought we would at least give China a shot. You can read more about what went into this decision in Update #7.\nAchieved! System Logo Button. We'll add a button to the core game so that people can show that they play! We talked about making this a simple \"Button Men\" button but there are some thoughts that this should be a playable character. Either way, it's a pin-back button in the game box, unlocked at $45k.\nAchieved! $50k: \"Mutton Ben.\" A few of you had a lively discussion about adding a new character, \"Mutton Ben.\" We'll make him into a trading card for the funvelope, unlocked at $50k.\nAchieved! $55k: Better \"Mutton Ben.\" We have Ben, now let's make him into a button for the funvelope. An upgraded Mutton Ben, unlocked at $55k.\nAchieved! $60k: Fight City Mapple Board. We have a clever little territory control game called Mapple. We'll make a Fight City board for it, unlocked at $60k.\nAchieved! $65k: Four More Cards in the Funvelope: Let's add four more bonus character cards to the funvelope. This stretch goal is more than it seems: at this point we also get to print these cards alongside the core game, so they will match the others in size and paper stock. That's actually a pretty big deal! Unlocked at $65k.\n\nNOT UNLOCKED (YET):\n$70k: Button Murderers: We'll release a set of 12 new Button Men on Drive Thru Cards, based on our favorite murderers from Kill Doctor Lucky and Doctor Lucky himself.\n$75k: Skully Patch: We'll add a  a 2\" embroidered patch of our wee mascot Skully (the \"o\" in Button Men) to the funvelope.\n$80k: Button Men Pairs: We'll create a new Pairs deck at Drive Thru Cards featuring characters from the new edition of Button Men, as well as a new game variant to go with it. This might even turn into multiple decks!\n$85k: Button Men Coin: We will add yet another goodie to the Funvelope: a 39mm metal coin. This coin will be similar to the coins we have made for other projects, with a Cheapass Games logo on one side, and a round version of the new Button Men logo on the other.\n$95k: Fight City Returns! We'll post the two original Fight City decks (with updated full-color borders) on Drive Thru Cards. And we'll post the rules for free at cheapass.com, of course.\nNote that we have expanded our original \"Drawn In\" levels, and we have also added new ones featuring Ryan Kinnaird and John Kovalic. Send us your photo, and you can become a custom Button Men character, drawn by one of these illustrious illustrators!\nOur main goal in this campaign is to get a new Button Men starter set produced for retail stores. If that succeeds, we can start making new sets of characters as 12-card booster packs, for a fraction of the cost of the old pin-back buttons. \nWe're already talking with some big-name game publishers, to license their characters and art for some interesting crossover sets. We'd love to do more characters in Fight City as well, perhaps in different time periods. And we have already announced a partnership with Dyskami Publishing to release the Sailor Moon Crystal Dice Challenge this fall!\nButton Men has been around for a long time, so there is plenty of material out there. Here are some new and not-so-new resources, if you want to learn more about the game:\nHow to Play Video: Created for this campaign, this video shows the basics of Button Men using two characters from The Core.\nCheapass Games: See the new trading cards based on the earliest and best Button Men sets, at our own double-secret website.\nButton Weavers: The original \"Button Men Online\" site is alive again at buttonweavers.com. Sign up to play, and help test the open alpha of this new site!\nBeat People Up: Our original Button Men information page is still online, with a fresh coat of paint. This is a great resource for more in-depth strategic analysis, and lists of the characters from the early days.\nDrive Thru Cards: Our friends at Drive Thru Cards have a unique resource that lets you create custom Button Men. Check them out and print your own playable characters.\nBoard Game Geek: The Internet's premiere resource for hardcore tabletop gamers actually has a few nice things to say about Button Men, where the game still ranks as #109 on the \"customizable\" list (and #2772 overall). Let's get some new content up there!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our tenth Kickstarter project, and we are not too concerned with production issues.
