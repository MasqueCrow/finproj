Dennis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "F\u00fcr eine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung bitte nach unten scrollen.\nThe Sphere:\nPLAY\n\nIn this very sphere, every one of the 380.000 lasered dots is not only a star, but an entire galaxy with billions of stars. A journey through our entire galaxy, the Milkey Way, would last 120.000 years...with the speed of light! and it contains of 300 billion stars. A journey to our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, would last around 2.5 million years with that speed. And there we are, at the first tiny dot, next to our own tiny dot in the center of this very sphere. If you add the next 100 000 Galaxies you can see the structure of Laniakea, our home supercluster. Laniakea is around 160 megaparsec in size and of cause surrounded by even larger structures.\nThe diameter of the cloud of galaxies in the sphere is around 250 megaparsec (Mpc). One Parsec is equal to 3.2616 lightyears, which means, that the cloud is 815.400.000 lightyears in diameter. 815 million years of travel, with the speed of light, captured in an 8cm glass sphere. \nWith all these information, this sphere convinced me, that we can\u00b4t be alone in the universe. \nHow is it made?\nI took a katalogue of galaxies and chose every galaxy in a radius of 125 Mpc. I converted the data and found a company, which was able to laser these 675 758 galaxies into a glass sphere. Some galaxies were to close to each other, so they merged together. There are in total 380 000 dots in this 8cm (3.14\") sphere and it weights 0,8Kg (1,76lb). The inner structure reflects light, so it looks really nice, if you put it on an LED, but it is also really good to see without an extra light. The brightness changes with the perspective, so you can spend hours looking into the Sphere. It comes in a black gift box with black velvet inside.\nPLAY\n\nUniverse Sphere in it\u00b4s box.\nExtension:\nThese are some pictures of the Sphere on the polyamid bases on the LED-Base Plate.\n\"LED fitting Base\" on the \"LED Base Plate\"\nI finished the first bases you could buy as an extension. They will be 3D-printed in different colors and materials such as polyamid, steel and some precious metals like pure silver and gold coated brass.\nPLAY\n\nHexagonal Grid Base, Pure Silver\nHexagonas Base, Black Plastic\nRound Base, Black Plastic\nMy Motivation:\nThe idea of the Universe Sphere came to me, after I was watching the video \"the power of ten\" and the more recent video \"a cosmic voyage\".It showes how incredibly huge our observable universe is and I wanted to see the structure of our universe in 3D with my bare eyes. So I decided to create a more concrete view of it, by lasering this tremendous structure in a glass sphere. I was so impressed by what came out of that, that I decided to make it available for all the universe-loving people outside, who try to understand the gigantic dimension of the place we exist in. To make it affordable, I need to order a large amount of Spheres and for that...I need your help!  \nYou can watch the clip \"A Cosmic Voyage\" on youtube and I promise, it is mindblowing.\nDeutsch:\nZu der Struktur im Inneren:\nJeder gelaserte Punkt entspricht nicht nur einem Stern, sondern einer ganzen Galaxie mit milliarden von Sternen. Eine Reise durch unsere eigene Galaxie, der Milchstra\u00dfe, w\u00fcrde 120.000 Jahre dauern, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit! Sie besteht aus ca. 300 milliarden Sternen. F\u00fcr eine Reise zu unserer Nachbargalaxie, der Andromeda Galaxie, w\u00fcrden 2,5 millionen Jahre ben\u00f6tigt. Und da w\u00e4ren wir nun bei dem n\u00e4chsten kleinen Punkt neben unserem kleinen Punkt angekommen. F\u00fcgt man diesen beiden Galaxien noch weitere 100 000 hinzu, erkennt man den Laniakea Supercluster, der wiederum von weiteren noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Strukturen umgeben ist.\nDer Durchmesser der Punktewolke entspricht ca. 250 Megaparsec (Mpc). Ein Parsec entspricht 3,2616 Lichtjahren, was bedeutet, dass die Wolke einen Durchmesser von ca.815.400.000 Lichtjahren hat. Diese unvorstellbar gro\u00dfe Struktur, in der es 815 millionen Jahre dauern w\u00fcrde, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit von einem Ende zum anderen Ende zu fliegen und in der 380.000 Punkte enthalten sind, kann man jetzt in einer 8cm gro\u00dfen Glaskugel in seiner eigenen Hand halten. \nDiese unvorstellbaren Mengen an Galaxien mit jeweils Millionen von Sternen, haben mir gezeigt, dass wir nicht alleine im Universum sein k\u00f6nnen.\nWie wird sie gefertigt:\nIch habe aus einem Galaxienkatalog alle Galaxien in einem Umkreis von 125 Mpc ausgew\u00e4hlt und diese so umgewandelt, dass eine Firma sie in eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Aus 675 758 Galaxien wurden 380 000 Punkte, da einige f\u00fcr den Laser schlichtweg zu nah aneinander lagen. Die Kugel misst 8cm im Durchmesser,  wiegt ca. 800gramm und wird in einer schwarzen Geschenkbox geliefert. Die Struktur im inneren reflektiert Licht, sodass sie von verschiedenen Perspektiven unterschiedlich hell wirkt. Man k\u00f6nnte sie gut auf einen beleuchteten Sockel stellen aber auch ohne Lichtquelle sieht sie fantastisch aus, sodass man Stundenlang ins Innere der Kugel starren kann.\nErweiterung:\nMomentan arbeite ich an 3D-gedruckten Sockeln f\u00fcr die Kugeln, die ich freischalten m\u00f6chte, sobald das Projekt sein Finanzierungsziel erreicht hat.\nMeine Motivation:\nDie Idee der Universe Sphere kam mir, nachdem ich das Video \"a cosmic voyage\" auf Youtube gesehen habe. Es zeigt, wie unglaublich gro\u00df das beobachtbare Universum ist und in was f\u00fcr einer fantastischen Struktur die Galaxien angeordnet sind. Diese Struktur wollte ich gerne mit blo\u00dfen Augen in 3D sehen k\u00f6nnen. Daraufhin habe ich recherchiert, woher ich die Koordinaten der Galaxien bekommen kann, wie ich diese umwandele und letztenendes habe ich eine Firma gefunden, die mit meinen Daten eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Das Ergebnis war so erstaunlich, dass ich mich entschieden habe, mein erstes Kickstarter Projekt zu starten. Um den Preis der Kugel von \u00fcber 90\u20ac auf unter 50\u20ac zu bekommen muss ich allerdings eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Menge bestellen.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Up to 9 Spheres", "descp": "In this Reward you can pledge for up to 9 Spheres.

We need it to see\u2014when in cars, when finding keyholes, even when we\u2019re outdoors. We have noticed that many everyday carry, or EDC, essentials are too dull, and current EDC flashlights are too big and bulky, so we set out to create our own.\nIt all started when I needed a flashlight one evening after I dropped my phone under my car. I immediately needed a light but did not have one. I thought to myself, \"It would be great to have a flashlight, but the size of a bullet.\"\nInspired by the 9mm round.\nA sleek, minimal, and beautiful design, we present to you BULLET, providing a strong LED mini flashlight in its most minimal form, while eliminating bulky flashlights from your everyday carry. Minimize your life. \nEveryday Carry Done Right\nWe believe that your everyday carry items are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET\u2019S functionality, beauty, and minimalism make it the best everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available. The easiest way to carry your flashlight is on your keys! Save the space in your pockets for what truly matters.  \nA quick quarter rotation on the head of the BULLET to turn it on, and a quick rotation back to turn it off. We wanted to get rid of unnecessary buttons to keep it slick and precise. A built in key chain allows you to carry BULLET with you everywhere you go.\nBullet clipped on a backpack.\nAvailable in Matte Black, Gunmetal, and now Blue!\nWe took the smallest, sleekest possible design, and combined it with aircraft-grade aluminum and an anodized finish to bring you a powerful tiny LED light, perfect for everyday use. We believe that the shape, and size kept the design minimal, functional and easy to carry, completely hassle-free in any situation.\nMeasuring in at an incredible 10.5mm x 30mm and weighing only 6 grams, BULLET is the perfect size flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 15 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. \nWhy BULLET?\nWe like keeping things simple, and easy to carry around everywhere you go. What makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.\n Compared to other alternatives, the choice is simple.\nPLAY\n\nDesigned with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized finish, the BULLET is built for any situation possible. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, the BULLET will illuminate in any weather, helping solve any problem. \nAn LED light is ideal for everyday use over a long period of time. Never worry about breaking the light, since no glass or filament is used, or replacing it, since LEDs can last a lifetime. Battery's also last much longer with LED light, saving you both time and money in the long haul. \nWhat is an LED you ask? Well, for all you who don\u2019t know, LED\u2019s are the most efficient kind of light bulbs out on the market today. One small bulb can last you anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 hours. Of course you'll still have to replace the batteries periodically.\nWe went through many iterations, finishes, and housings for the design of BULLET.\nWe decided to use the bottom twist due to the leverage provided by the key ring. By holding onto the keyring, twisting to turn on was easiest. Furthermore, the triangle ring offered increased stability when on a keychain.\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 1\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 2\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 3\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: 6 Grams\nWidth: 10.5mm\nLength: 30mm\nMaterials: Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy\nBattery: LR41 Button Cell\nType of Bulb: LED 5mm\nSpecial Features: On/Off Twist Setting, and Mini Keyring Attached\nColors: Matte Black/ Gunmetal\n    Slughaus is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional, all at the same time.

They allow you to be more creative & versatile in the kitchen, help produce better quality food, and if well-made should last a lifetime.\nA good Chef\u2019s Knife is the single most important tool in any kitchen. From mincing garlic to breaking down meats, it\u2019s the workhorse behind virtually every great dish. There's an almost indescribable joy to effortlessly slicing through foods with a razor-sharp blade.\nBut between confusing, unexplained features and needlessly expensive price tags, finding the perfect blade can be difficult. That didn\u2019t seem right to us, so we spent the last 18 months making something better.\nAn amazing knife at an honest price.\nWhat Makes a Great Knife?\nGreat knives do two things very well: feel good in your hand and hold a sharp edge. But behind these deceptively simple concepts are centuries of tradition, technology, design and craft.\nWe went through dozens of prototypes to create a handle that not only provides comfort for every hand, but also encourages a proper grip for better control. To ensure true sharpness, we experimented with various blade shapes and high-carbon steels until we found the right match.\nAn Honest Price\nMost knives cost so much because of traditional retail markups. You\u2019d be shocked to know how little many well-known \u201cpremium\u201d knives actually cost to make.\nBy partnering closely with our factories and selling directly to you online, we\u2019re able to offer an incredible knife at wholesale pricing. Better materials, lower price. Save your cabbage for the cutting board!\nOur Knife\nHow We Got Here\nHundreds of sketches. Dozens of prototypes. Countless tomatoes, onions and carrots cut (but none wasted!). The last 18 months have been spent building, testing, learning and improving.\nWhere We Are\nWe have a knife design that has been heavily tested and refined at every step along the way. We have partnered with craftspeople, factories and raw material suppliers across the world and built a strong supply chain network. We are ready to go!\nWhat We Need\nWe need your help to raise $25,000 in order to fund the first production run of the Misen Chef's Knife. More specifically, this money will go towards the initial custom molding, raw materials and skilled labor required to make our knives.\nTimeline\nNote on the above timeline:\nWhen we launched this campaign, our original timeline had production ending February, and delivery slated for March 2016. Due to the increased volume of knives that now need to be made, we updated our timeline as consistent with Update #3 that was sent to backers (please read the full update for more information).\nWe thought it prudent to add a buffer of one to two months (April - May) to account for the unknown. Why? Because we'd rather ship a great knife slightly later than an average knife on time. Thank you so much in advance for your understanding.\nWho We Are\nWe're a team of passionate cooks, designers and operators that love great food and well-made objects. We have extensive experience bringing products to market and operating companies both large and small.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk to our project is timing.\n\nWe have our supply chain partners ready and able to help us manufacture our knives, but unforeseen bumps can happen along the way.

It's more than a camera bag, it's your day-to-day essential carry workhorse, and it does things other camera bags can't.\nIt comes in Charcoal...\n...and in Heritage Tan...\n ...and it will make your everyday carry experience wonderful, no matter what you're doing.\n                                                                                             When something is \"totally dialed,\" that means that every last bit of it does its job perfectly and fits together flawlessly. This bag is totally, indubitably, unequivocally dialed. See why:\nTo reiterate:\nIt adapts to your gear and lifestyle.\nWhat do all camera bags have in common? Foam cubes. Big ones. Bulky ones. Square ones. What do all cameras and lenses have in common? They're not square.\nFlexFold\u2122 dividers: instantly customize them to organize your gear and maximize your space for everything else. Fold 'em over and stack gear on top. Note that the final divider color is the same as the rest of the inner bag.\nLike we said before, The Everyday Messenger is not just a camera bag, it's an everyday bag. And since no two days are quite the same, we designed a shell that expands greatly to accommodate the perpetual \u201cone last thing,\u201d and also lets the bag maintain its shapely figure when your load is light. \nFlexFold\u2122 dividers allow the bag to expand and contract depending on load. Typical camera bag dividers are about 3x the thickness and designed to have a fixed width. Note: final divider color will be the same as the rest of the bag interior.\nThe semi-rigid shell expands from a capacity of 13.5L to 20.5L without the need for slack material. \"I like a floppy messenger bag,\" said no one, ever.\nLastly, it adapts to your activity too. No more switching bags when you travel or hop on your bike\u2014one bag, with straps that let you wear it in a multitude of ways.\nThe main strap is made of internally-padded seatbelt webbing, and it adjusts for messenger or shoulder carry style. Removable stabilizer strap can also be worn as a waist strap to take weight off your shoulder.\nCarrying a tripod? We've got you covered. Slip your tripod leg through the sleeve in the main flap, fold the flap over, and place the silicone band (included) around your tripod legs. Carry a tripod will full access to the rest of your bag.\nThe versatile straps can be configured for easy, secure luggage carry. Use the shoulder strap to sling your bag around large rollers, or use the stabilizer strap as a standard luggage band.\nIt gives you instant access to everything you need.\nYour hands are always full. Full of cameras, toddlers, beer...sometimes all three. Hence we invented a new way to open and close a bag:\nThe patent-pending MagLatch\u2122 is a digital-safe magnetic latch that opens/closes securely, blindly and one-handedly. It can latch onto 4 different catchpoints, depending on your carry load. There's no other piece of hardware quite like it.\nStill, you don't always have time to open a flap. Unlike traditional messenger bags, The Everyday Bag has quick-zip access to the main compartment, as well as an outer pocket layout designed around the workflow of photographers, commuters and travelers.\nFront access panel has 8 stretchy mesh pockets for bits-n-bobs. Water resistant top zip gives instant access to main compartment. See images at the top of the page for final interior pocket colors.\nWhat's faster than getting your camera from inside your bag? Getting it from outside of your bag. Peak Design started as a company that made Capture\u00ae, a clip that lets you carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Naturally, we had to incorporate the perfect Capture attachment point:\nYou'll find 2 diagonal straps on the side walls, designed for attaching the Capture Camera Clip. Keep your camera secure/accessible and free up carry space. Capture is included in our $375 Reward, and also available in our Add-On Menu below.\nA dedicated, protected 13-15 inch laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve and document pocket makes this truly an everyday bag, even if you're not carrying any photo gear.\nThere's a clever place for every bit and bob imaginable, like the pen sleeve in the laptop compartment and the Anchor link key/ID tether in the side pocket.\nIt protects your stuff like a boss.\nOur favorite messengers are roomy and built to repel water, mud and unwanted flotsam. Our favorite camera bags are padded and protective cradles for our digi-babies. The Everyday Bag had to be both.\nThe shell, made of lightweight Kodra\u00ae synthetic canvas, is waxed and DWR-coated to repel water. It also contains high-density tessellating foam pads to protect from bumps and bruises.\nThe super soft poly-spun twill interior is soft on your photo gear, but will hold up to years of stuffing and re-stuffing your bag with you-name-it.\nBar-tacked stress points, reinforced with ultra-tough Hypalon. Beautifully anodized aluminum hardware.\nWe built The Everyday Bag to last a lifetime. In fact, we guarantee it will.\nIt looks totally dialed, with zero slop.\nDangling strap ends, cheap internal fabrics, cookie-cutter plastic hardware...these are what we call \"slop.\" Many bags out there have slop because it's cheap and it's easy. We designed this bag with a strict no-slop policy, and the result is a product that looks, feels and functions like a premium product should. \nNo corners were cut in the building of this bag.\nThe form of The Everyday Messenger took a cue from the past, incorporating timeless elements and shapes from classic messengers and camera bags. Then we fused that with modern materials, custom hardware and Peak Design\u2019s less-is-more aesthetic.\nYou use the inside of a bag just as much as you do the outside. So, we designed an inside that you'll want to look at again and again.\nClassic lines and textures, but with refined hardware and technical materials.\nWe\u2019ve created 2 color schemes - Charcoal with red accents and Heritage Tan with blue accents (shown above). Pledge now, choose your color when the campaign ends.\n                                                      Behind every good bag is a wing-bag. The Field Pouch\u2122 is a manager of cords, hard drives, toiletries, socks, Pogs slammers and all those other pesky doo-dads that can\u2019t seem to get along with the big boys.\nHello. Is it keys you're looking for?\nKeys, hard drives, laptop chargers, pens, and even small lenses can fit inside the stretchy mesh pockets that line its interior.\nThe Field Pouch fits in both the main compartment and the front panel of The Everyday Messenger. It\u2019s made from the same materials, contains 5 stretchy mesh pockets, and holds a lot or a little without losing its shape. It also comes in Charcoal or Heritage Tan.\nStowe The Field Pouch in the main and front compartments of The Everyday Messenger.\nLike its big bro, The Field Pouch expands and contracts depending on what's in it. It saves you space and saves itself from looking embarrassingly floppy and misshapen. Note that this animation depicts an older prototype.\nYou can even attach Peak Design straps to the Pouch (via Hypalon loops on either side) and attach Capture on the front Hypalon strap. It becomes the perfect excursion bag for you and a mirrorless camera.\nAttach any Peak Design camera strap to The Field Pouch and have yourself the perfect excursion bag, which is a type of bag that is not at all like a man-purse.\nThe Field Pouch and The Everyday Messenger. 2-gether 4-ever.\nTo pre-order The Everyday Messenger, click the button below and pick a reward that contains The Everyday Bag. Simple as that. If you want more stuff that isn't in your reward, then follow the instructions in our Add-On Menu (scroll 2 sections down). Once you have pledged, sit back and relax. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment info when this project is complete, in late September.\nOnce you pledge, you're in for a fun ride. Throughout our campaign we'll be updating backers with footage of our latest production units and having live Q&A hangouts with Trey Ratcliff and the PD team.\nNot sure how the Add-On Menu works? Scroll down below.\nWant to add additional items to your reward like another Everyday Messenger or Field Pouch? Perhaps you want to add on a Capture clip, so you can carry your camera on the outside of your bag. Either way, adding stuff to your reward is easy:\n1. Choose a reward level.\nEverybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward\u2014you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want. For example, you cannot order the PD Dream Pack and switch out CapturePRO for an extra Slide. See the FAQ for why we can't do this.\n2. If you want to add something, check out the Add-On Menu.\nIf (and only if) you want something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add a Peak Design product that is not in the Add-On menu, don't worry. We will give you a chance after the campaign is over to add additional products to your shipment for a special discount. See the FAQ for further explanation.\n3. Relax, you're done for now.\nAll details like shipping information, color preference and add-on specifics, will be collected via survey after this campaign has ended in late September.\nCaptureLENS and Lens Kit are 2 new products that let you change and carry lenses easier than ever before. Watch this video to see it in action:\nWe launched CaptureLENS halfway through this Kickstarter campaign, and right now it is only available to Kickstarter backers through our Add-On Menu. Instructions on using the Add-On Menu are above, and below, and in the FAQ. How's that for a helping hand?\nIn our opinion, CaptureLENS + The Everyday Messenger is the most convenient, rapid-fire lens changing solution in the world.\nRight: Lens Kit has loops for attaching Peak Design Anchors, letting you sling a spare lens across your body. Left: CaptureLENS works on any belt or strap.\nOther specs you should know about CaptureLENS:\nIt works with Canon (EF mount), Nikon (F mount) and Sony (E and FE mount) lenses. You'll specify which mount you need in our post-Kickstarter survey.\nCaptureLENS ($80 add-on, $90 MSRP) includes a standard Capture clip (nylon backplate) plus a Lens Kit adapter plate. It does not include a plate for camera bodies.\nLens Kit ($40 add-on, $50 MSRP) includes just the adapter plate. It's for people who already own (or plan to own) a Capture clip. Lens Kit is compatible with all versions of Capture.\nHow to pre-order CaptureLENS and Lens Kit:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that. Join at any reward level (or, don't select a reward level). Already a backer? Click here instead.\n2. Add $80 to your pledge (for CaptureLENS) or $40 (for Lens Kit).

After this project is complete (late September) we'll send you a survey where you can specify which model you'd like.\nSlideLITE is a new camera strap designed specifically for mirrorless and small DSLR cameras.\nFor those familiar with our other camera straps (all of which were launched here on Kickstarter) SlideLITE sits smack-dab in the middle of our lineup. Not too bulky, not too skinny, it's perfect for your ultralight mirrorless companion.\nSlideLITE contains the same adjustment hardware that Slide does. But SlideLITE is a skinnier 3.7cm (1.25\") and does not have internal padding.\nWear SlideLITE as a sling, neck strap or shoulder strap. It connects to your camera with our patent-pending Anchor link quick-connect system. And, it looks damn good.\nHow to pre-order SlideLITE:\n1. Become a backer of this project. Click here to do that.

Want SlideLITE sooner? Pre-order it from one of our retail partners. There's a list of them in this update.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Peak Design's 5th Kickstarter project. We don't want to toot our own horn too vigorously (nobody likes an overly vigorous tooter) but we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues, and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a giant heap of preorders for our new products. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science. While this ain't our first Kickstarter rodeo, our forecasting capabilities aren't the same as what you might expect from a big company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk \nAs Peak Design continues to mature we're getting better and better at managing our supply chain. For example, two years ago we set up two fully-operating parallel supply chains to shore up our ability to make quality products, at high volumes, on time. We're totally stoked on how far we've come. But it's safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new parts doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule\u2014even if padded\u2014can start to slip.\n\nActs of God \nWe're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, God forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

The production for the Polar Ice Tube will be completed a little bit later, till the end of August, because it is a stretch goal. Hence, delivery time is going to be between mid September to mid October. Once the time is up for the project, we will start to collect your shipping address. Unfortunately, we only provide one time shipping, so the Polar Ice Tube is not available if you wish to receive the Polar Ice Tray in August.\n Why do we need a Polar Ice Tray?\nNo more ice chiseling, and no more ice machines.\nAre you wondering why the drinks you make at home don't taste as good as the ones you buy at a bar? Do you know that ice has huge impact on drinks? Do you have to spend a lot of time chiseling ice before you drink? \nThen Polar Ice Tray is what you need.\nPerfect for drink lovers and home parties, Polar Ice Tray is the first ever patented device that allows anyone to make a sphere of crystal clear ice in an ordinary home refrigerator. \nNow let's see why Polar Ice Tray, and clear ice, can make things all better.\nFeatures\n  CRYSTAL CLEAR ICE: the unique, patented design separates water molecules from impurities. Clear ice brings out the best taste of drinks.\nEASY TO USE: add water in it, put it into a freezer, wait for some hours, the end. \nFROSTBITE PREVENTION: the Polar Ice Tray is made of PU foam and silicone mold; it never causes frostbite. \nMELTING SLOWER: ice made from our tray has a round shape and a relatively big size, so it has less surface area than general ice cubes. That means the clear ice in your drink melts slower, and your drink stays colder for longer without dilution.\nFAIR PRICE: an 50% off the average selling price of similar products!\nWhat's so special about crystal clear ice? \nIt enhances the taste of your drink.\nThe ice that comes out of your freezer contains air bubbles and other impurities, which can ruin the taste of your drink. Crystal clear ice, on the other hand, is flavorless and odorless.\nBy lowering the serving temperature of your whiskey or mixed drink, clear ice enhances your beverage by adding a cold, crisp taste.\nIt looks fascinating. \nShining with dazzling brightness, or glimmering under dim light, crystal clear ice in your fancy craft drink transforms your beverage into an exquisite work of art.\nMoreover, adding a flower or piece of fruit between the silicone layers can turn your clear ice into an amazing show piece! It's perfect for a romantic occasion and it's a great way to impress you friends!\nYes, for the sake of health. \nNo air bubbles or impurities in your drink that's soon going down to your stomach.\nHow does it work?\n(Size: L108 x W108 x H108mm; Ice ball produced: 6 cm diameter)\nWe've been researching how to make clear ice since 2008. Our goal was to find a simple, elegant solution. Existing techniques only partially solved the problem. That's when we turned to the nature to find our answer!\nInspired by the natural ice-forming pattern which takes place in lakes and rivers, we've designed a dual-chambered system that separates the clear ice from the impurities in the water.\nOrdinary ice trays allow ice to freeze from the outside in, trapping air and impurities to the center. Polar Ice Tray insulates all sides of the tray except the top, so only the surface of the water is exposed to the cold. As a result, the water starts to freeze from the surface.\nBy allowing the water to freeze gradually from top to bottom, layer by layer, air and impurities are compressed to the bottom, forming a layer of opaque or \"white\" ice. Our dual-chambered technology allows easy separation of clear and white ice.\nHow to use it?\n1. Place the silicone layer on top of the perforated layer, and then put the perforated layer on top of the plastic layer. Ensure each piece has a tight seal to prevent leaking.\n2.Slowly pour water into Polar Ice Tray via the hole on top of the silicone layer, until the water flows out of the hole. (Do this slowly because the air needs time to get forced out of the tray.)\n3.Place the assembled components into the insulated base. Next, place the Polar Ice Tray into the freezer and wait 8-12 hours. \nUsage Tips \nTo make crystal clear ice, set your freezer to medium (-0.4F/-18C). Leaving your freezer at a warmer temperature takes a longer time to freeze, while using a colder temperature may cause needle-like bubbles to form. \nAfter pulling your Polar Ice Tray out of the freezer, let your tray rest 3-5 minutes. This makes it easier to remove the clear ice.\nTo store your crystal clear ice, put it in a ziplock bag and keep it in the freezer.\nMore ideas on making your life prettier...\nTimeline\nIn addition,\nPolar Ice Tray comes in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors!\nPolar Animals \nThis tray makes two crystal clear ice balls at once! Each ball is 6cm in diameter. The Polar Animal embossed on each ball is a reminder to protect our natural resources.\nPebble\nThe Pebble is the largest and most versatile tray in the polar ice tray family. It is unique because the tray plus the lid serves as an ice bucket after the ice is made. The Pebble makes a crystal clear Inukshuk (ice Man) sculpture (250 ml) or a large ice block (600 ml), which can be cracked into asymmetric pieces and served in your drink.\nRewards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. The predicted quantity of product order at this moment is 4000. If the order quantity exceeds 4000, delay in shipment might occur. The order will be processed in sequence, in a first-come first-served manner.\n\n2. The effect of crystal clear ice may be affected by the condition of freezers and water.\n\n3.

Places like the B.C. coast\u2014remote, lightly populated and mostly roadless\u2014have often been treated as 'nowhere' areas that don\u2019t have much value beyond the resources can be taken out of them. But in reality, this is a place that\u2019s full of life, has an amazing culture and history, and is absolutely priceless to protect. For myself, my family and many others here, this place is everything. So to me, this book is about deconstructing the idea of nowhere and demonstrating that places like this have a value that goes far beyond money.\n16\" x 24\" framed Fortune Bear. (For reference. Reward prints come unframed.)\n5\"x7\" Art Cards\nSet to publish in August 2015, This is Nowhere will be an 11\u201d x 11\u201d clothbound hardcover with 144 pages and 100-plus photos. I\u2019ve chosen to have it printed on FSC-certified paper at Hemlock Printers in Burnaby, B.C., a carbon-neutral company that does amazing work like Kinfolk Magazine and The Great Discontent. For me it\u2019s important to use a printer and paper that\u2019s more sustainable, even if it takes more money to do so. By doing this project through Kickstarter instead of a traditional publisher, I'll be able to retain full control of both the creative content and the production process. With the support of a community of people who believe in my work, I\u2019ll be able to publish a unique and beautiful book worthy of the places, people and living things it portrays.\nThis Is Nowhere - Black debossed text on black clothbound hardback cover\nChapter Story\nFull frame images with varying layout\nFull frame images with varying layout\nThis is Nowhere \u2014 black debossed text on black clothbound hardback cover\nSome further detail:\nThe foreword will be written by Dr. Chris Darimont, Science Director of Raincoast Conservation Foundation and professor at the University of Victoria. The book is divided into five sections: Air, Water, Earth, Fire and The Unknown. The introductions to each section are being written by people I\u2019ve learned from and worked with over the years: my dad, Patrick Koreski, along with Noah Cohen, Keith Malloy and Malcolm Johnson. The designer is Chris Allen.\nThe money I raise through the Kickstarter campaign will fund the final production and printing of This is Nowhere. Also, as a member of 1% for the Planet, I'll be donating 1% of all sales to Raincoast Conservation Foundation and Central Westcoast Forest Society.\nBook Specs\n11\" x 11\" (28cm x 28cm)\n144 Pages\n100+ Photographs\nFour-Colour Process\nHardback / Clothbound", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve hoped to publish a collection of my work for a long time, but I didn\u2019t want to put anything out unless it was something I was truly proud of.

So for me as an independent photographer, the biggest challenge is raising the necessary funds to print the book. \n\nAnother risk of any publishing project is errors in production, but having This is Nowhere printed close to my home means I\u2019ll be able to oversee the entire process and be present for press checks to ensure the images are reproduced exactly how I want them to be seen.

There simply is nothing else like it. From its original shape to the sidearm throw to it's mesmerizing flight; the ZipChip is unique. And it fits in your pocket for fun anytime, anywhere.\nDISTANCE: The ZipChip is designed to be used at various distances. Play catch at short range for leisure or spread way out to test your skill. We've gotten the ZipChip to fly over 200 ft. / 65 yds. Can you?\nPOCKET-SIZE: The ZipChip is ultra portable. This enables spontaneous fun in never-before-played locations. Take it everywhere. We do.\nSTABLE FLIGHT: This is what makes throwing and catching possible. Level release = level flight. Angled release = curved flight. That equates to predictable and accurate throws.\nFLOATING: The ZipChip is buoyant and ready to be played with at the beach or pool.\nSOFT and FLEXIBLE: Our goal was to make the ZipChip soft for confident catches. The elastomer material is even recyclable.\nMANUFACTURED in CONNECTICUT: \u201cMade in our backyard, played in yours\" is our motto here. Conception through construction the ZipChip is a local endeavor. We are partnering with an injector and mold maker in-state so we can be hands-on every step of the way.\nThe ZipChip works best as a game of throw-and-catch between two or more people. Start close to get dialed in and warmed up. Slowly spread out to really ramp up the fun. You will notice that due to its light weight, arm fatigue is low which allows for extended sessions. This makes the ZipChip great for kids.\nCatching can be done with one or two hands. We recommend starting with two as you get accustomed to how the ZipChip flies. It zips in a unique way. Once you've got a beat on it, test your skills with one-handed catches.\nSomething interesting happens when you use the ZipChip in public. Complete strangers will marvel at what you are doing and many will approach inquiring, \"What is that?\". As Kickstarter backers you will be the first to own the ZipChip and as such are bestowed the honor of introducing it to the world. Proudly educate the onlookers while you relish your position as an original ZipChip Pro.\nThrowing the ZipChip is just like skipping a stone, except you're not trying to skip it. Imagine you're standing waist-deep water. Now, try to skip the ZipChip on the fictitious water's surface. This means the ZipChip is designed to be thrown forehand, not backhand as you would a Frisbee.\nThe more you throw the ZipChip the better you will get, and the more fun you'll have. The following graphics are to show you how it's done. Get ready to \"Grip it and Zip it\".\nHold the ZipChip in your throwing hand with the domed side up. Place your index finger in the groove around the ZipChip's perimeter. The exact placement of your other fingers is less critical. The thumb may be on the top or edge. The remaining three fingers will be underneath the ZipChip. Experiment with different grips to maximize performance. Just remember that the grip should be gentle.\nNow you're ready to Zip It. Every successful throw combines the following two factors upon release: Spin and Angle.\nSpin: Maximizing spin will combat the enemy of the ZipChip; wobble. Generate spin by rolling the ZipChip off the index fingertip. \nAngle: The ZipChip must be released level for a straight flight. To do this, the forearm must be horizontal (like the arm of the ZipChip PRO logo).\nOne added tip: don't be afraid to zip it with some force. This will help you get the correct amount of spin. \nIt turns out the physics of a flying disc are quite complex. Even after some serious math, accurate flight predictions are hard to ascertain. As such we called upon our two friends Trial and Error for help during ZipChip development.\nEnter prototyping. We began by casting rubber into the bottom of household cups, glasses and bowls. It soon became evident that the limited possibilities of pre-existing shapes were not going to work. We needed to start from the ground up. This meant hand-turning pieces of wood on the lathe. \nThe lathing enabled us complete control of the shape; the freedom to test out all variations of the ZipChip's form. We reconciled several balancing acts simultaneously: aerodynamics vs. ergonomics, rigidity whilst throwing vs. softness whilst catching, and size vs. weight. After many prototypes we achieved the characteristics we sought and performance the ZipChip deserves.\nE pluribus unum\nFinally, we tested numerous colors for visibility both in the air and on the ground. Neon yellow was the winner.\nPackaging Mock-up", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'll do everything we can to avert bumps in the road, and those we encounter will be taken head on.

Wilma Mankiller, the first woman elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, is omitted from most history books despite ranking among revolutionary leaders like Harriet Tubman or Eleanor Roosevelt. She was an activist and a champion to a nation \u2013 and it\u2019s time the world remembers her name.\n(Credit: J. Pat Carter/The New York Times)\nMANKILLER is a documentary celebrating a leader who defied all odds to make a difference for her people. During a time when American Indians found themselves disenfranchised and undervalued by the United States at large, Wilma emerged as a champion of the Cherokee Nation and became its first female Principal Chief in 1985.\nThis film is the passion project of director/producer Valerie Red-Horse (owner/founder of Red-Horse Native Productions, Inc.) and producer Gale Anne Hurd, the \u201cFirst Lady of Sci-Fi\u201d. Although Gale is best known as the producer of iconic science fiction including THE TERMINATOR trilogy, ALIENS, and AMC\u2019s THE WALKING DEAD, she previously produced two documentaries directed and produced by Valerie \u2013 TRUE WHISPERS and NAVAJO CODE TALKERS. Now, she and Valerie are bringing to life the true story of a Cherokee leader who possessed the same heroic traits as Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor. Both Valerie and Gale are passionate about Wilma\u2019s story and have joined forces with their friends and colleagues to share it with the world.\nWILMA'S STORY\n\"It is crucial to tell stories like Wilma's that inspire women across the globe to have their voices heard. I am happy the documentation of her struggle will be in the capable hands of Gale Anne Hurd and Valerie Red-Horse.\"\n-- Liz Garbus, Emmy-winning and Academy Award-nominated documentary filmmaker (THE FARM: ANGOLA, USA; BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD; GHOSTS OF ABU GHRAIB)\n 117 years after the US relocated the Cherokee Nation from their traditional homeland in Georgia and North Carolina \u2013 and forced them to walk 2,000 miles in winter to Oklahoma \u2013 Wilma endured her own government-mandated relocation from Oklahoma to Northern California. It was there, standing on the front lines of the civil rights movements of the 60s and 70s, that she developed her politically revolutionary mind. She carried that passion for progress with her into the office of Principal Chief decades later.\nUnder Wilma\u2019s leadership, the Cherokee became one of the strongest Indian Tribes in America. Wilma\u2019s focus on economic development and national healthcare helped the Nation to re-assert its self-governance. During Wilma\u2019s tenure, the Cherokee Nation saw its population of registered citizens nearly double, from 68,000 to 170,000. Beyond her policies and programs, Wilma enabled the Cherokee to come together, taking pride in its history while planning for its future.\nNone of Wilma\u2019s accomplishments was easily achieved. When she came into office, the existing Cherokee leadership was unconvinced that a woman could handle the job of Principal Chief. Wilma endured rampant sexism \u2013 including personal and physical attacks. In the midst of this struggle, she demonstrated a quiet strength and unwavering resolve that won over her opposition.\n\u201cPrior to my election, young Cherokee girls would never have thought that they might grow up and become Chief.\u201d\nIn 1998, President Bill Clinton honored Wilma with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She enjoyed brief mainstream attention when Ms. Magazine named her their 1987 Woman of the Year, and she was even inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. Despite this recognition, we are in danger of losing her story to time.\n(Credit: Associated Press)\nMANKILLER seeks to capture Wilma\u2019s revolutionary life on film and preserve it for years to come. Our goal is to make \u201cWilma Mankiller\u201d a household name, to give her the same recognition as the trailblazers that came before her and to serve as an inspiration for future generations. A mix of biography and historical storytelling, it will illuminate, entertain, and galvanize viewers to follow Wilma\u2019s example and rebel against the status quo.\nOUR APPROACH\nA message from director and producer Valerie Red-Horse:\n\u201cBeing a Native American female, the opportunity to tell the inspiring story of Wilma Mankiller\u2019s life and legacy is extraordinary. The support and interest we have garnered, even thus far, from subjects and organizations are tremendous. I am thrilled to be reunited with award-winning producer, Gale Anne Hurd. Gale and I have been very fortunate in that our past documentaries are embraced by the Native community. We have fostered and garnered trust as filmmakers to be true to our subjects.\n(Credit: http://www.cw4w.com/)\nIn our documentary, the audience will follow Mankiller\u2019s life through personal, community, political, and family stories. Charlie Soap, Wilma\u2019s widower, is on board as one of the documentary\u2019s producers with Kristina Kiehl (Wilma\u2019s close friend and manager of her campaigns) and Gina Olaya (Wilma\u2019s daughter) also joining the production team. We will gain unique access to subjects, materials, and rare footage that will bring her story to life.\n\u201cWe must trust our own thinking. Trust where we're going. And get the job done.\u201d\nMANKILLER will shed light on important issues raised in Wilma\u2019s life, such as sexism, racism, community empowerment, self-help, and team building. The documentary itself is designed thematically, as an inspiration to encourage further research, exploration, and discussion about Wilma and her contributions to the Cherokee Nation. There will be media links, classroom viewer guides, and social media networking, so that the audience can be encouraged to explore more about Wilma\u2019s legacy, the Cherokee Tribe,  cultural traditions, the path to healing, community organizing, bridge building, and the Cherokee philosophy Wilma lived by: GA-DU-GHI , \u2018being of good mind.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cReal Native American stories are grievously absent in America's film lexicon. A descendant of the horrific Trail of Tears, Wilma Mankiller grew up in government squalor, yet she managed to become one of the most significant activists for Native American rights, working tirelessly to improve conditions for her people. Mankiller broke down barriers with humility and grace, becoming the first female elected principal chief of Cherokee Nation. Mankiller's story is a triumph, proving that not even genocide can hold a people down. This is a great American story that needs to be told. Please help these filmmakers tell it.\u201d \n-- Jillian Ke'haunani Moul, Documentary film and television editor FAME HIGH (Tribeca Film Festival Best Documentary Nominee), NATIVE SOIL (Oscar Shortlist), TIME OF DEATH (2014 IDA Award for Best Limited Series) \nWHO WE ARE\nValerie Red-Horse, a director of Cherokee ancestry, is the owner/founder of RED-HORSE NATIVE PRODUCTIONS, INC., which has become the preeminent collaborator with American Indian tribal nations to bring important Native stories accurately and respectfully to the screen. Red-Horse\u2019s body of work spans over two decades of film and television content creation and production; always providing insightful, sensitive and unique perspectives for both the historical and contemporary indigenous story.  The Company\u2019s premiere feature film, NATURALLY NATIVE, was an official Sundance Festival selection, which Red-Horse wrote, produced, co-directed, starred in, and distributed.  Red-Horse followed with the WWII PBS/ITVS award winning documentary TRUE WHISPERS: THE STORY OF THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS, produced with Gale Anne Hurd of Valhalla Entertainment. Red-Horse also produced/directed a follow up program, again with Hurd, CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS (Vision Maker Media/PBS). \nGale Anne Hurd, known as the \"First Lady of Sci-Fi,\" is a producer of Academy Award-winning films and Emmy-winning programs that shatter box office and ratings records. Hurd\u2019s career as a Producer was launched when she produced and co-wrote THE TERMINATOR. This success was quickly followed by ALIENS, which received seven nominations and two Academy Awards, and the Academy Award winning films THE ABYSS, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, and THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. Hurd\u2019s additional feature credits include the Academy Award-nominated ARMAGEDDON, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, TREMORS, DANTE\u2019S PEAK, \u00c6ON FLUX, THE PUNISHER, DICK, and THE WATERDANCE. She also produced two documentaries on Native American subjects, TRUE WHISPERS: THE STORY OF THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS and CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS. Hurd is Executive Producer of THE WALKING DEAD, which currently reigns as the most-watched scripted drama.\n\u201cThe secret of our success is that we never, never give up.\u201d\n(Credit: www.thebluegrassspecial.com)\nREWARDS\nIn case you missed our updates, we posted some new AMAZING rewards that are still available, including:\n- A customized outgoing voicemail message recorded by Norman Reedus, Michael Rooker, or Danai Gurira from THE WALKING DEAD!\n- A spaghetti dinner with Hershel himself, Scott Wilson\n- Go shootin\u2019 with Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) at his private shooting range\n- A 10-minute Skype call with THE WALKING DEAD\u2019s Steven Yeun (Glenn)\n- Tickets to a live taping of TALKING DEAD hosted by Chris Hardwick (you can attend a recording of the Nerdist Podcast, too!)\n- Gorgeous prints by Cherokee artists Bill Rabbit and Traci Rabbit. \n- This original canvas giclee by Bill Rabbit!\n- These beautiful, one-of-a-kind framed animation cels by Native American artist Dawn Jackson (Saginaw Chippewa).\n- A 5-piece set of Native American jewelry, created and signed by Zuni artist Anselm Wallace.\nOf course, we can't forget about some of the original rewards!\nJOIN US!\nMANKILLER is a passion project for us.

This is because of natural curiosity. I want to encourage that curiosity as well as the imaginative thinking that comes with it. I want to remind people there's still so much to discover and explore. \n \"Nanotechnology. The science is good, the engineering is feasible, the paths of approach are many, the consequences are revolutionary-times-revolutionary, and the schedule is: in our lifetimes.\" - Stewart Brand\nWhy is Nanotechnology Important?\nNanotech is a disruptive technology. It creates new possibilities and makes things that once seemed impossible very real. Ferrofluid is just one small example of this. Researchers are currently creating other meta-materials that sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie or video game. \nFor example, we have created objects that can bend light completely around themselves, making them invisible. We have business suits already on the market that use carbon nanotubes to make the fabric bullet proof. The potential game changing uses for carbon nanotubes alone generates a list too long to post here. New applications and discoveries are being made in this field regularly. \nAdditionally, nanotech fuels Moore's Law...\nExponential growth is explosive. Every 25 years the processing power of computers grows by a factor of 1000!\nMy Past Experience\nI often collaborate with a group known as CZFerro. CZFerro is a ferrofluid knowledge bank that specializes in ferrofluid displays. Members have been offering ferrofluid displays for sale on the internet for over 5 years and have worked with ferrofluid since 2008. Inspired Designs, LLC will have full access to CZFerro members and their expertise if needed.\nThe Science\nOkay, if you've read this far your probably interested in the science behind it. Good for you!\nFirst, I want to highlight the size 10 nm because that is the size of the nanoparticles in the ferrofluid...\nWhat is ferrofuid?\nAs you can see, ferrofluid is a magnetic liquid.\nThis is something special because all known magnetic materials lose their magnetization when they get too hot. And this always happens long before the material reaches it's melting point. The trick is to suspend tiny pieces of solid magnetic material in the liquid.\nNormally, solid particles mixed in a liquid will eventually settle to the bottom because of gravity. Much like mixing sand in water. But, if the particles are small enough (say 10 nm) they won't be pulled down by gravity. This is because of a force called Brownian Motion. \nBrownian Motion is the tendency of liquid molecules to be constantly moving around. As a result, they bombard other particles in the liquid. And when the particles are very small in size this force is strong enough to counteract the force of gravity.\nIt's a lot like a balloon being bounced around by a crowd of people. The sea of waving hands will keep bouncing the balloon back into the air.\nWhy does it spike?\nThe spiking is the result of a few different forces competing with each-other. On a fundamental level these would be the van der Waals force (attractive/repulsive forces between molecules), gravity and the magnetic force. \nIn this case, the first two forces (van der Waals and gravity) manifest themselves as surface tension and play a very big role in how the ferrofluid spikes. \nObviously, the magnetic force plays a major role in forming the spikes because we only see the spikes when we apply a sufficient magnetic field. What's really happening is we are attracting the magnetic nanoparticles with the magnetic field and this creates an uneven distribution of particles, or gradient, within the ferrofluid. This gradient follows the magnetic field lines and rearranges the nanoparticles in the ferrofuid.  \nWhy does it rise and fall (The Inspiration)?\nInitially, the ferrofluid is more dense than the clear liquid and sits at the bottom. But,the ferrofuid changes it's density when it absorbes heat from the lamp at the bottom and becomes 'lighter'. This allows it to float to the top. Then, it begins to cool and it's density changes once again. As it cools it gets 'heavier' and falls back down. Then the process repeats itself.\nWhat are Other Ferrofluid Applications?\nCooling in loudspeakers for better sound\nLiquid O-rings for making computer chips\nMagnetic hyperthermia for better chemotherapy\nTargeted drug delivery for cancer treatment\nVanessa of Ferrotec wrote a wonderful blog post where she explains these applications and more.\nBacking This Project\nBacking our Kickstarter is simple and secure, and open to people from all around the world.

Sharing is caring!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as research and development is concerned, I feel I have adequately covered everything imaginable. However, it is true that ferrofluid is well known for throwing curve balls. Sometimes there are unexpected snags in the manufacturing process. I have been through this many times over in the past. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't possible this could happen with these new products as well. But, I do have a track record of troubleshooting these issues very well on previous projects with the CZFerro team. I also will take any complaints very seriously and do my very best to resolve any problems as quickly as possible. I will replace anything damaged during shipping free of charge. I will be as transparent as possible with my backers during order fulfillment and keep you updated on the progress as well as any speed bumps that may pop up along the way.\n\nI've watched previous ferrofluid kickstarter projects by others in the past fumble both the R&D as well as transparency and do not wish to follow in their path. This is why I have applied 3 years of R&D before filing for patent pending status and launching a kickstarter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "New Project Launch: Outer Space Ferrofluid Collection", "update_content": " Make 100: Outer Space Ferrofluid Collection"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "New Project Sneak Peek (Exclusive Rewards and Early Backer Discounts)", "update_content": " Magnetic Dice \nOur friends are launching a Kickstarter this week for some really cool magnetic dice trays!

So we made some new ones... (see below)\nWith us hitting the original high goal with two entire days remaining, we have no choice but to offer you Over-Stretch Goals...\nLet's knock these 3 Over-Stretchers out.\n1 Down - 2 to go!\nLook for Frozen Tundra & Gamma Dice in Halfsies 2.0 in mid 2015.\n\"Why the increase in the pricing curve in the Over-Stretch Goals?\"\nThe original campaign was designed and budgeted around shipping up to 9 sets.  Beyond that our shipping costs take a turn for the worse (something we've chosen to help mitigate for you beyond 9 sets).  Unlocking more sets also reflects a larger number of backers, which in turn demands higher production runs for some, and eventually all, of the colors.  In order to cover our increased production and shipping costs, we need to take the curve up a notch.  We kinda wrote the book on Kickstarter budgeting, and promise you that these exciting Over-Stretch Goals are budgeted both accurately and honestly.\nThanks for pledging!\nLet's do this!\nA quick FAQ note about A.D.A.P.T.\nA.D.A.P.T. is our newest game, and our next release.  It is a strategic battle card game for 2-3 players, that has never before seen mechanics (that's the way we like to do things), and is a total blast as you forcibly adapt your Guppy into a Master Fish with all manner of fun fish (and not-so-fish) parts.  The PnP takes about 5 minutes to print and set up; the rules take about 8 minutes to read, and the whole thing will cost you less than $1.50 print (if that).  It's a fun way to be the first to playtest our newest game, and maybe even offer feedback.  Heck! You've already helped design some of the Fish and Parts we'll flavor the game with. : ) \nOh, and p.s.... the big secret is... It requires a full set of dice to play! ; O\nHalfsies Dice are all new full dice sets that feature a beautiful new half-&-half color-split design, have a pearlescent swirl within each color, and are semi-translucent for stunningly vibrant colors.  \nAesthetically pleasing, and professionally manufactured these dice are a perfect addition to any collection.\nDice Details\nHalfsies Dice are manufactured in high impact resin with smooth corners, on preexisting, industry standard dice molds for a clean and reliably-balanced roll every time.\nHalfsies Dice have been prototyped in a number of color sets for you to see, but can and will be designed in any color arrangement you can imagine.\nAll sets are complete, the industry standard 15-20mm by die, and include the standard 7 dice:\n*backer favorite renders shown - full sets will be all the same colors\nThese dice sets fit perfectly in any collection, whether you are a casual gamer, a dice collector, or just like shiny objects.\n\"These are your dice.\"\nHere are some dice closeups so you can compare what you have at home to what Halfsies Dice look like.

After that, you choose the rest!\nSet #1) Mithril\nMithril Lore - A legendary metal first mined by the dwarves of Moria.  Some say it is actually an organic metal that can be found forming the scales of certain dragons. Beautiful and engaging, these silvery blue dice make a great companion for any noble gamer.\nSet #2) Orichalcum\nOrichalcum Lore - A rare red metal found only in the sunken city of Atlantis.  Its strength and molecular commonalities with gold made it abundantly valuable.  Bold and strong, this set can roll with the best of them in any dungeon crawl campaign.\nSet #3) Adamantium\nAdamantium Lore - Once known as the indestructible metal Adamantine that held the Greek titans captive in the underworld.  Now, its popular alloy has been used to create some pretty sweet claws.

The drawback to this state is that they can no longer beget new trees; they produce seeds, but those seeds can't germinate as they too have a consciousnesses of their own.  These are your Treant Dice.\nSet #8) The backer chosen: The Heir -Now Available!\nThe Heir Lore - On March 17th 2014, The Heir was discovered.  On November 23rd 2015, 2014, The Heir was born.

Though we welcome you to view the updates to see the results.\n1) We need your help. \nAs big fans & collectors of various dice sets ourselves, we invented this new half & half design to honor a promise made to our The King's Armory Backers and to bring a brand new style of dice to the tabletop.  We have even begun prototyping them to ensure the idea would work.  Successful in prototyping, these dice can become a reality - with your help.\nPlus by backing, you'll have access to participate in the Backer-Only Dice Selection Surveys.\n2) Our motto is \"This is your game\", and is so for a reason.\nIf you followed our first campaign, you know that A) We love your involvement, B) We believe in transparency, and C) We have a tendency to give away free stuff.\nInvolvement: The majority of dice sets (sets #4-8) will be chosen by Backer Vote.  Sure, we could pick them all ourselves, but that's not the way we roll.\nTransparency: All Pledge Tiers are already displayed and available from the start.  No mysteries about pricing as the campaign progresses.  We even posted our budget in the FAQs at the bottom of the page, and have reduced international shipping costs 3 times over the course of the campaign.\nFree Stuff: We've added a \"Better the Odds\" Tier, in which you put your faith in this campaign to see ALL Dice Sets unlocked, bettering everyone's odds of unlocking Stretch Goals, and we in turn give you the Yin Yang Dice Set for FREE when we hit that point.  Plus the Saint Patrick's Day Tiers, now the Gift Package Tier!  Free stuff!  ...we're kinda obsessed with free upgrades. \n3) These dice are the lowest prices they'll ever be.\nWe have priced the Tiers as low as we can to make them accessible to everyone, while still guaranteeing successful production & delivery.\nIn retail, these dice will MSRP at $9+ per set + full price shipping.\nHere on Kickstarter you can get them for as low as $7.00 (or less) per set!\nFor designer 2-tone dice, that price can't be found anywhere online.\nDetails and a little math:\nEven at the first Tier, since shipping is included in your order (USA full; International in-part), they are already cheaper than ordering retail from most online retailers (because they charge full shipping in addition).  And these dice get less expensive per set with each Pledge Tier. \nPricing by Tier:\n1 Set Tier - $12.00\n2 sets tier - $11.50 per set\n3 Sets Tier - $11.00 per set\n4 Sets Tier - $9.75 per set\n5 Sets Tier - $8.80 per set\n6 Sets Tier - $8.17 per set\n7 Sets Tier - $7.71 per set\n8 Sets Tier - $7.38 per set\n9 Sets Tier - $7.33 per set (Booyaa!)\n10 Sets Tier - $7.30 per set\n11 Sets Tier - $7.27 per set\n12 Sets Tier - $7.25 per set (Booyaa!)\n**18** Sets Tier - $7.17 per set\n**27** Sets Tier - $7.00 per set\n**34+2** Sets Tier - $6.61 per set - Tier now available\nAt the \"6 Sets Tier\" the price per set is notably less than other designer 2-color dice available online.  ...even after International Shipping.  And it only gets cheaper as you add more!\nA quick check:\nCommon online retail pricing: $9.95 x 9 sets = $89.55. \nPlus $5-25 shipping = Total: $94.55 - $114.55\nThis Kickstarter: $7.33 x 9 sets = $66.00.\nPlus our max of $23 Shipping = Total: $89.00 \u2026to anywhere in the world ...at max!\nCompare these prices with any online retailer of specialty 2-tone dice.  We think you'll be rather pleased.\nHow are we able to do this?  We kicked this with zero margin on these dice.  We've offered up our profits for your savings.  We'll make a couple bucks selling the left overs after the campaign.  But you get them crazy cheap for investing your trust in us.  That's the way we do things.\nStill unsure? \nWe invite you to back us at the lowest Pledge Tier so you can join in the comments, surveys, and updates to see we do things.  If at the end of all things you're not happy with your time with us, simply cancel your pledge.  You have nothing to lose. \nJust give us the chance to wow you.\nEach Pledge Tier represents a quantity of Dice Sets.  The more sets ordered in a single pledge the less each Dice Set costs.\nAll Tiers include: A number of Dice Sets in plastic dice cases, a shipping subsidy, and entry to Backer-only voting.\nFinal color choices for your order will be made after the campaign closes, at all Tiers.  Pledge early, choose later.\n\n\"Can I order multiples of certain color sets, so this campaign hits all its goals?\"\nAbsolutely!  To do so...\nClick the green \"Back this Project\" button at the top of the page.\nSelect the Pledge Tier that corresponds to the total number of sets you'd like to receive.\nGo tell your friends about these dice, so they can pledge too.\nAt the close of the campaign, simply tell us what color sets you desire; repeats welcome.\nAll shipping charges will be collected after the campaign.\nWe chose the \"pay for shipping after the campaign\" method because it keeps the Funding Goal & Stretch Goals more transparent & accurate, while it also reduces your final shipping charges. \nWe just hacked down International Shipping CONSIDERABLY... again. (3/7/15)\nShipping costs - detailed by quantity of sets ordered, by area.\n\u2020 = \"Friendly Shipping\" with VAT & Customs Fees pre-paid.\n\u2021 = Yes, we managed to successfully unify ALL OF EUROPE, Western, Central, and even Non-EU, etc. for shipping rates.  EU Europe is also \"Friendly\"; while non-EU Europe may be subject to VAT by locality.\n* As we have successfully reached $69,000 in funding.  These prices are locked in.  Congratulations!\nPlease DO NOT add the shipping rate to your pledge. \nShipping will be collected after the campaign during Pledge Management.  Because...\nWe continue our pledge: If we find prices less than the ones we've already quoted, we will reduce the shipping accordingly.  It's already happened THRICE so far...\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced as of 2/18/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced further as of 2/28/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced HUGELY as of 3/7/15\nShipping Q&A:\n\"International Shipping got cheaper with each Stretch Goal?\"\nPer set, yes. We budgeted in a sliding scale for shipping subsidies within our Funding & Stretch Goals, so that we could guarantee that USA shipping remains free with every unlocked Tier.  As the USA subsidy grew, so did the international one.  That means, the higher our funding goal grew, the less international Backers have to pay, on average, for shipping!\n-\n...the lost prototypes...\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving already begun manufacturing on The King's Armory - The Tower Defense Board Game, we have gained a lot of experience with game production - including custom polyhedral dice - and we put that experience to work reducing the risks and challenges. \nIt also allows us to foresee potential issues, and solve them in advance.\n\nFor example: we can't be 100% certain what final International Shipping is going to cost for each Backer's unique order, so we did extensive research with multiple companies in order to provide very accurate estimates, and ultimately chose to collect shipping post-campaign. This way there's no \"we ran out of money for shipping\" faux pas, because each person pays what they owe by order and by region.\n\nOur Commitment to Your Excellence: \nIf you get the wrong dice, experience excessive production delays, or are in any way dissatisfied with the way we fulfill your pledge, whether it be our fault or any others', we'll fight on your behalf to make it right. We've done it for our TKA Backers, and we'll do it again for you.\nAnd if we can't make it right, we'll refund your money; thus mitigating YOUR risks and challenges.\n\nGiving Back to Those That Have Helped Us: \nOur experience with game production during The King's Armory campaign really has taught us a lot.

Imagine never again damaging your nicely painted walls with loads of extra holes. And imagine never seeing another tilted frame on your wall. Sounds a bit improbable, right?\nNot any more. Introducing the Beehive Picture Hangers! In about 5 minutes, you can hang nearly any size frame, right where you want it. And the process is so easy, you may even enjoy hanging pictures \u2013 something you never would have imagined!\nThe honeycomb design of the Beehive Picture Hangers is key to their incredible functionality. Once the hangers are placed on the custom designed Support Pins, your frame can be quickly and easily adjusted in any direction. You simply lift the frame from the Support Pins (more about these later), and adjust up, down, left, right or diagonally. It really is that simple! \nNo more removing nails from the wall and starting over. No more repositioning the hardware on your frame. No more swiss cheese walls. About 5 seconds or less is all it takes to adjust your frame in any direction. \nThe Max hangers have 143 hexagonal openings in each hanger, giving you the option of 143 different positions to adjust your frame, on each corner. The Original give you 68 positions for adjustment.\nCheck out the clip below. We've attached the Max hangers to a plexiglass frame so you'll have a clear view of how the hangers work. This also gives you a close-up view of a Support Pin after it has been inserted into the wall.\nEach Beehive Picture Hanger has a small point that projects from the center of the hanger. These are called the Positioning Points. The Positioning Points allow you to hang a single frame, or an entire series of frames without taking a single measurement. That's right. You can ditch the tape measure and ruler next time you hang a frame.\nHow they work. After the Beehive Picture Hangers are attached to your frame, simply hold your frame up to the wall in the approximate position you want to hang it, and press the top corners of the frame against the wall. The Positioning Points will make two small indentations in your wall (one for each hanger). These indentations are where you'll insert your Support Pins into the wall to hang your frame.\nThe clip below shows a demonstration on using the Positioning Points, as well as the custom designed Support Pins.\nNotice how the Support Pin does not fully penetrate the drywall (sheetrock). This feature eliminates any concerns of hitting pipes, conduit or wiring, which is a common problem when using nails, hooks and other standard hardware. In addition, there's no need to locate a wall stud (or worry about hitting one). The Support Pins are uniquely designed to hang frames up to 30 lbs. in standard drywall alone.\nWhether you're planning to hang 1 frame or one thousand, this product is for you. The Beehive Picture Hangers can be used on just about any size or shape of wooden frame or canvas.\nNo special skills are required for installation. You'll simply need a small phillips head screwdriver for attaching the hangers to your frame, and a hammer (or shoe heel) to tap the Support Pins into your wall.\nThe Beehive Picture Hangers now make all other picture hanging hardware, obsolete.\nBeehive Picture Hangers are the brain child of inventor Herb Bigelow. \nSome of you may already be familiar with a product similar to the Beehive Picture Hangers (formerly Beehive Hangers or Honeycomb Hangers) which were also designed by Herb. These were originally being distributed primarily as a wholesale product through frame shops and canvas suppliers. Shortly following, the Beehive Hangers were signed into a licensing agreement and were being manufactured by a third-party company. The licensee was unsuccessful in their promotional efforts and the agreement was amicably dissolved. During the agreement period, inventory for the Beehive Hangers was depleted. \nHerb has since made an innovative change to the design, adding the Positioning Point, which virtually eliminates any need to take measurements.\nIn 2014, after several years of perseverance, Herb was granted a Utility Patent, securing his production rights to this amazing innovation.\nBoth the Original and Max hangers are rated up to 30 lbs. This rating is based on using two hangers on each frame, along with the included Support Pins.\nBoth the Original and Max hangers are equipped with the new Positioning Point (described above) and come standard with the custom designed Support Pins and screws \u2013 all the hardware you'll need!\nThe Max hangers have been specially designed so they can be attached across the miter joints of your frames. This will add additional support to larger, heavier frames, helping prevent separation of the joints over time.\nFor you left brain thinkers, we're including a technical drawing showing the details and dimensions for both hanger sizes. \nTooling\nManufacturing of the tooling for the Beehive Picture Hangers will be our first priority. Funding for tooling will be apportioned to the Original and Max hangers (which incorporate the new Positioning Point), in addition to the Support Pins.\nManufacturing\nIn effort to keep production costs and unit prices down, we'll need to meet minimum order quantities with our manufacturer. Exact numbers will be determined by the success of our Kickstarter campaign. Our first order from the manufacturer will include the inventory required to sustain sales for a period of approximately 4-6 months, as well as fulfill your Kickstarter pledges.\nE-commerce Site\nWe're well into the design, and now in need of capital to move things to the next level. Your funding will help us design and maintain a shopping cart and set up a shipping calculator, as well as implement the SEO needed to generate and maintain website traffic.\nRetail Packaging\nOur goal is to place the Beehive Picture Hangers into retail in Q1 of 2016. After meeting with several of the world's largest hardware manufacturers and distributors over the past several months, we're confident the Beehive Picture Hangers will quickly find their way into big box, hardware and home improvement stores around the nation as well as around the world. With your pledge, we'll be one step closer to making this a reality. Imagine seeing the Beehive Picture Hangers at your local retailer, knowing that you helped make it happen!\nMoving Forward\nOur current Beehive Picture Hangers are designed for wood frames only. But stay tuned! We're designing a secure 'clip on' version for metal frames. This will be a 'no screws required' design. Our goal is to have this line extension in production by Q2 of 2016. \nWe've also designed a unique hanger that will be offered to picture frame manufacturers. This version will provide manufacturers with a cost-effective solution to adding the Beehive Picture Hangers directly to their frame lineup before their products reach the wholesale and consumer markets.\nIn Summary\nWe have a fully developed, proven, and patented product that is ready for production. We've aligned with a highly qualified manufacturer that has the ideal facilities and capabilities for production of the Beehive Picture Hangers. The retail packaging has been designed and sourced, and is set for production. \nWe're now we're ready to hit the 'go' button on production and fulfillment. With your help, the Beehive Picture Hangers will soon be a household brand!\nAre you ready to be a part of our dream? \nWe've prepared a series of reward levels. Based on the amount you pledge, you'll receive sets of the Original or Max hangers. In two simple steps, you'll be on your way to not only making your life just a bit easier, but also the lives of people around the globe!\nNOTE: After giving a great deal of thought to our rewards, we decided to forego the cute t-shirts and fancy widgets, and base our rewards on what really counts. The product. We thought this was the best way to put your hard earned dollars to work!\nMake your pledge count! Keep in mind that you're allowed to choose just 1 reward level. However, during the Kickstarter campaign, at any time, you can increase your pledge to 'boost' your rewards.\nRemember, this Kickstarter campaign is our endeavor to get the Beehive Picture Hangers into production! Once the Kickstarter is successfully funded, the hangers won't be available online for another 4-5 months, after our goal is met. This means the only way to get your hands on a set of shiny new Beehive Picture Hangers is to choose a pledge amount and back our project! Don't be the last one on your block with crooked frames!\nYour pledge, big or small, is vital to the success of our project. It's not going to happen without you. And regardless of whether you're able to pledge or not, if you believe in the Beehive Picture Hangers, you can help us a ton by sharing our Kickstarter project with your friends and family.\nSpreading the word is essential to a successful campaign.

Disposing of standard batteries is an increasing problem because although their uses are various and many, disposing of them is not healthy to the environment. Lightors resolves these issues from a different perspective in providing an easy-to-use alternative. Now, not all batteries are created equal.\nLightors are extremely convenient batteries for use whenever and wherever.\nUnlike other rechargeable batteries, you don\u2019t need an additional charger to house the batteries while charging. Micro-USB cables are the standard when it comes to charging most smart devices today, which makes it much more convenient than having to keep track of an external charging cradle.\nLightors could help potentially reduce battery waste from 10 billion to\n20 million annually!\nDetox the earth, Innovative battery 'LIGHTORS'\nThe Environmental News Network reports that annual global consumption of batteries is at a staggering 10 billion (the US makes up 3 million alone).\nOf the total number of batteries consumed, approximately only 2% (200,000) get properly disposed of for recycling while the remaining 9.8 billion are simply thrown out thus contaminating the environment further.\nLightors is an eco-friendly and innovative product that protects the planet by reducing discarded battery waste by 1/500 (from 10 billion to 20 million). Regularly disposed batteries can bring tremendous harm to the environment. \nOne Lightor battery provides the same value as 500 standard single use batteries.\nExtremely cost-effective and affordable, Lightors offers users a way to reduce costs in battery spending (+$48 Billion Industry). If purchasing one batter was $1, you would be saving $499 inadditional battery spending. This is not only incredible cheaper, but a substantial reduction in resources used to make, store, dispose of extra batteries.\nThrowing away batteries after a single use is probably the most convenient, but isn\u2019t there way to solve major problems in the world that affect people and our earth? Isn\u2019t there a way overcome the disadvantages of using a traditional battery cradle forrecharging?  Our product was developed to address this problem.\nHowever, there were issues with producing AAA batteries due to size and fitting in the PCB and mechanisms in a much smaller form factor.  \nFinally, we were able to come up with a working model recently in December 2014 to offer two different sizes of Lightors batteries.\nLightors is a young company that contributes to the development and distribution of advanced eco-friendly products adding innovative new products to your daily life tomake a difference in the world. The origin of our brand name means \u201cpeople that make light\u201d.\nLight makes for a better society, meaning brightening and making positive changes, and it\u2019s important to focus on creating valuable work that brings light to this world.\nWe want to extend our apologies once again at the mishap we had yesterday revolving our prematurely posted update. Again, the update was posted without receiving proper approval, which has caused some negative feedback and loss of faith from some of our backers.  \nAlthough a lightning port stretch goal is something we would love to include, at this time we cannot verify its feasibility and thus have decided to create new stretch goals in its place.  \nOur first stretch goal will be for the same amount of $150,000. This stretch goal is to double the number of uses for Lightors. Currently, we can guarantee that Lightors can be used at least 500 times. This stretch goal will allow the development and guarantee of at least 1,000 uses.  \nThe second stretch goal is for amp increase. This stretch goal will be for $200,000 and will guarantee a 10% increase in mAH for both types. The AA batteries will increase from 1500mAH to 1650mAH while the AAA batteries will increase from 600mAH to 660mAH.  \nAgain, we want to extend our apologies for our previous error and hope it will not deter current and future Backers from supporting our campaign.  \nPosted above is our current domestic patent and our international patent is currently pending. (PCT/KR2014/011245) Just to clear the air, Lightors is a unique product that does not exist anywhere else in the world and we stand by our product.\nAs a recognized Hi-Seoul Brand company, Lightors has received recognition for being a promising and representative small-medium enterprise by the city of Seoul. \nOnly those companies that offer globally competitive innovative technological products are able  to receive this special recognition in hopes of expanding Korea's domestic export enterprise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLightors is a relatively young manufacturing and distribution company of eco-friendly innovative products that add high value to our daily lives and make a difference in the world. \nWith our flagship product, we\u2019re entering the smart accessory market to match other smartphone peripherals.\n \nLightors = \u201cLight\u201d+ \u201cors\u201d \n \nThe origin of our name means \u201cpeople that create light\u201d.\nLight provides for a better society and brightening peoples\u2019 lives with positive changes.\nAlways focus on creating something positive and bringing light to the rest of the world. \n \nFrom a technical point of view, the main challenges we faced when creating Lightors were \u201chow will we offer USB charging while minimizing circuit discharge\u201d, \u201chow can we maximize Ni-MH capacity\u201d, and \u201chow will we minimize power loss in the circuit configuration\u201d.

So do I. Please consider making a kickstart pledge as a way to help build greater awareness and positive change for the planet and for plant medicine.\"  \n          - Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability, Traditional Medicinals\nAs an herbalist, have you ever felt uneasy about where the plants used in your remedies are from? As a consumer, have you ever wondered if you can trust the label on the bottle of supplements or tinctures on the grocery store shelf? And have you found yourself reaching for the cheaper bottle, doubting those extra dollars really make of a difference?\nI\u2019ve wondered all of these things for years and that\u2019s why I launched the Sustainable Herbs Project.\nWHAT IT IS:\nThe Sustainable Herbs Project is a new project by the producers of the award winning documentary, Numen: the Nature of Plants, the first feature length film on the healing power of plants. We are creating an interactive documentary following medicinal plants through the supply chain to provide you with the information needed to feel more confident about the herbal remedies you purchase. With stories, videos, and facts, we\u2019ll bring the supply chain to life with interviews with men and women involved in all aspects of the industry.\nOur vision is to use this site to launch a more educated and responsible consumer movement supporting high quality herbal remedies and sustainable and ethical sourcing. We want this interactive multi-media website  to be available for free and so we have launched this Kickstarter Campaign to cover our costs up front. Proceeds will go to the design and development of the website/interactive documentary and to birthing an organization to carry on this work. \nReach Goals ~ Help us Reach $65,000!\nChina is a key and questionable source of so many herbs in the industry and being able to include research and footage from cultivation/collecting sites and processing centers in China would make this project even more comprehensive. If we raise $65,000 we can add a research/filming trip to China. The budget for our $54,000 goal is lean. Having a bit of padding will allow us to be more flexible and take advantage of opportunities as they arise...\nWe are confident we can reach this goal, but we need your help to do so! \nConsider what it is worth to feel secure that the plants in your medicinal tea and herbal remedy have been sourced responsibly and that the remedies actually are what the labels claim them to be. And then contribute what you can!\nAnd then share this project with friends!\nImportant questions on wild-collected plants: Were they correctly identified and harvested at the right time? Were they over-harvested? Were they collected from a clean place, away from roads and industrial run off?\nThe Sustainable Herbs Project (SHP) will provide the resources you need to find companies who really are doing the hard work of building sustainability into their supply chain and to encourage the industry as a whole to adopt better practices. Modeled on new, cutting edge interactive documentaries, we will create a user-friendly multi-media site that is educational, inspiring, and fun!\nThe SHP site will include:\nFACTS: A general overview of the botanical industry, tracing and mapping the different supply chains of key products such as essential oils, medicinal tea, liquid extracts, super critical extracts, etc.\nSTORIES: Video interviews and photographs following medicinal plants from different regions of the world through their supply chains, bringing the journeys these plants make alive through the voices of individuals we do not typically see when we reach for a herbal remedy on the shelf or order bulk herbs online.\nACTION: An outline of challenges to quality, sustainability and equity in different supply chains; action steps consumers can take to support responsible sourcing; best practices for companies wanting to improve their sourcing and processing.\nPROGRAM DEVELOPMENT: We are forming an advisory group to guide the development of the project and website and to help develop our long-term strategy. This will either include maintaining the Sustainable Herbs Project as a separate organization/project or partnering with an herb school that includes an educational track on the herb industry and herbal medicine-making.\nAdditional questions include were workers paid a fair wage and on time? How are plants dried and stored?\nPlease make this vision a reality!\nYour contribution will help cover:\nThree Research trips to Eastern Europe (Hungary, Poland, Serbia), India, North Carolina, and Oregon to film and interview wild collectors, processors, and finished-product manufacturers. We selected these regions because they are important sources of medicinal plants for the international market and represent different issues in the industry.\nStaff time to conduct and compile the research, edit video footage, and prepare written material for the website.\nCreation of the interactive documentary.\nDevelopment and launch of the Sustainable Herbs Project website.\nSeed money to cover staff costs to keep the project updated.\n8-10% covers Kickstarter and Amazon costs.\nReach Goals ~ Help us Reach $65,000!\nChina is a key and questionable source of so many herbs in the industry and being able to include research and footage from cultivation/collecting sites and processing centers in China would make this project even more comprehensive.

I love teaching the the craft of creating eye-catching images and LightBox Photography Cards will give me the chance to reach out, on a global scale, to share my vision, pass on the techniques I use in my own photography, and help propel your own image making to new levels.\nBackerClub.co\nhttp://backerclub.co/Each card back features a different quote from notable image makers of the past to the present . . . from industry legends to contemporary shooters, it's my hope you'll draw the same inspiration from these valuable words of wisdom as I have.\nNow here's where the fun begins . . . the card faces are where all the action happens. Here's the concept - you are in need of some creative inspiration. Maybe you just got a new camera for the holidays . . . or are simply looking for new things to shoot . . . You grab your deck of LightBox Photography Cards, give them a shuffle and pick a card.\nThe face of each LightBox Photography Card will showcase a different photographic challenge. Assignments like:\nCard #005: Photograph Machinery\nCard #017: Photograph Solitude\nCard #048: Photograph Patterns\nUnder each challenge is a small write-up to better define the assignment. The cards are also numbered for easy reference. There are icons to consider as well - these are highlighted in orange when certain gear, like a tripod, flash or filters are recommended. \nThe image found on the face of each card is my own challenge solution with some camera settings that factor into the creation of that particular image. \nEach card offers up a different challenge, some designed to be simple and easy to accomplish, while others will push your creativity and ingenuity to new heights. How long you spend on the assignment is up to you . . . an hour . . . a day? As you'll read below - the assignment doesn't just stop there. With all the social media surrounding this project, you'll be able to share your image and get some constructive critiques and instruction from other LightBox users!\nAll the assignment cards have been designed and locked in. The three samples above are just the tip of the iceberg! I'll be releasing more of the face cards during the campaign, but not all - where would the fun be in that?\nIn the spirit of teaching and instruction, every deck of LightBox Photography Cards comes with some bonus cards. One of which will be a 3-in-1 Grey card that will help you to easily color correct your images in post production (look for an update with a 3-in-1 tutorial soon!). The other is a photography cheat sheet to help remind you of the different settings your camera might offer.\nThere will be a whole social media aspect to this project, too . . . where we'll all be able to share and converse about our shooting experiences. This particular aspect is what has me most excited! \nFacebook\nGoogle +\nTwitter\n\nThose who backed the Foto Grafis cards might remember all the \"no-obligation\" add-ons achieved through stretch goals! Our first stretch goal will be reached at $4,500 and will come in the form of a more durable 3-in-1 card, printed on plastic! Look for an update with a 3-in-1 tutorial soon! If we hit this goal, every backer will get one of these cards at no additional cost and no additional shipping! \nNew Stretch Goal!  \nEvery backer will get one free printed check list of LightBox Photography Cards if we hit $20,500!\nLets talk about Add-Ons, backers can add on as many decks of LightBox Photography Cards as they wish. I've offered up some group packages, but in an effort to keep things as simple as possible, backers can add on decks for $9.00 (International backers, please add on $2.00 for each additional deck to cover overseas postage). The photo below showcases additional add-ons, which I'll go over in more detail with unique updates - I am particularly excited about the Photo Notes!\n BRAND NEW ADD-ON!!\nOne of the pledge tiers I am most excited about is the \"Education Ambassador\" tier. For your support of $100, you will get 10 decks of LightBox Photography Cards . . . in addition to your rewards, I'll be sending an additional 10 decks to the school of your choice. I do a lot of talks at high schools about photography and it's just about the most rewarding experiences of my career. Pledging for this tier will help me spread the joys of photography into your community schools!\n I'd like to thank you for considering backing LightBox Photography Cards . . . I can't wait to achieve our goals and get these cards into your hands! Here's to a wonderful and creative 2015!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project of this size, obstacles are bound to happen, but with over 20 years in the publishing/graphic design industry, I know I can produce these cards with little or no hiccups on the production side. I am partnering up with the amazing folks over at AdMagic (http://www.admagic.com), who made my last project, Foto Grafis, and am thrilled to be working with them again! To me, nothing is more important than putting out a quality product - especially one that my name has been attached to it - and I know the team at AdMagic feel the very same way!\n\nI've learned a lot from shipping out Foto Grafis and will again be using U-line boxes to ship out all rewards and minimize any potential postal mishaps. While this does cost a bit more, shipping with U-line boxes proved very effective during the last campaign with not a single deck damaged en route!\n\nAs far as risks, there are none that I can see outside the obvious - I'll be crushed if this project doesn't achieve its final goal.

With 3Doodler 2.0 we\u2019re continuing to make 3D creation and 3D design accessible to everyone!\nHow does it work?\nCompact and easy to use, the 3Doodler extrudes heated plastic that cools almost instantly into a solid, stable structure; and with no computers or software needed, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination. Simply plug your 3Doodler into a power socket and start drawing anything within minutes.\nIf you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.\nBut you don't need to take our word for it...\nSince we first showed the world that drawing in 3D was possible, we have sold over 130,000 3Doodlers. Our community has been using their 3Doodlers to create amazing things, going far beyond even our wildest expectations: from jewellery, to fully 3Doodled remote control planes, 3Doodled dresses, architectural models, and even writing braille! The creative possibilities are endless (and at times a tad unusual too!).\nSo just like the Backstreet Boys, 3Doodler's back, alright!\nIt was thanks to the support of the Kickstarter community that we were able to make the 3Doodler dream a reality. It was also here on Kickstarter that we began the process of building a vibrant community of artists, makers, designers, educators, as well as others eager to lift their imaginations off the page. Doodle by Doodle you have pushed the boundaries of 3D art and creation and inspired us further!\nTo say a big thank you for all of your help and inspiration, we decided to come back to the place where it all began, and bring 3Doodler 2.0 to you first! We are eternally grateful for all the support you gave us the first time around, and want to give you first dibs at creating with the new 3Doodler. It's your funding that will help make this a reality!\nWhat\u2019s new with 3Doodler 2.0?\nCompletely redesigned from top to bottom, 3Doodler 2.0 is the result of over two years of research and development, and feedback from thousands of users. Our aim? To give you the best 3Doodling experience ever! The result? A smaller, more ergonomic, and even more kick-ass 3D pen. We've also housed the new 3Doodler in a sleek metallic casing, so that it's jaw-droppingly beautiful and feels great in your hands.\nAnd there's lots more...\nAs well as being the world's smallest 3D printing pen, we've packed the new 3Doodler with loads of other enhancements for smoother doodling in every dimension:\na fully re-engineered drive system (the part that feeds the plastic through the pen), for even smoother 3Doodling\nan entirely new nozzle design, for better performance and crisper Doodles. As well as being technologically better it also looks way cooler\nenhanced and quieter airflow, to cool your plastic more efficiently and make it even easier to Doodle in the air from the get-go\ndual speed control, for a more customized Doodling experience (and specially for those of you who just can't get enough speed!)\na new double-click function for continuous flow, so that you can Doodle non-stop without having to hold down any buttons\nmanual temperature optimization, for minor flow adjustments and expertly consistent 3D Doodles\nmore efficient and stable heating (or in other words, no stopping and starting while doodling!) and\ndrastically reduced power consumption, under half the voltage of the original 3Doodler\nIt's also easier to use than ever before thanks to a whole host of other design adjustments. These touch on everything from the shape of the pen, which allows you to Doodle into really tight corners, the more intuitive button design, as well as the positioning of the LED indicator light and cooling fan.\nAccessories & Plastics\nWith the launch of the new 3Doodler on Kickstarter, we are also releasing a series of exciting new accessories to supercharge (and beautify) your 3Doodling. These include:\na DoodleStand for your pen and plastic \na JetPack, a portable power pack that gives you the freedom to Doodle on the go (2 hours of non-stop portable Doodling with ABS and 3 hours with PLA!)\na Nozzle Set equipped six changeable nozzles + a smoothing tool\na foot Pedal, for more versatile 3Doodling.\nWith the new JetPack we're certain you'll be putting Banksy to shame in no time - bring on that 3Doodled street art!\nSo which pledge level is right for you?\nWe\u2019ve tried to create pledge levels to suit everyone, from the novice Doodler to the seasoned designer or engineer, and for those of you looking for a bit of 3Doodling fun. Simply scroll down the right-hand side of the page and pick the combination of plastics and accessories that fits you best.\nEvery pledge level comes bundled with a mix of 3Doodler PLA and ABS plastic strands so that you can start 3D drawing right away!\nEach pledge level is limited to one pledge per backer. However we have also created special double pledge levels for the 3Doodler 2.0, Accessorize, JetSetter and PowerDoodler rewards, as well as a special Family Pack with four pens and a bunch of accessories + plastic strands.\nAnd if you're having trouble deciding which pledge level to go for, please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch to ask us any questions that may help!\nEducation\nThe teaching potential that comes with being able to draw in a new dimension has been truly inspiring, and something the whole 3Doodler team has been eager to get behind. Together with teachers and educators, we're working to make the 3Doodler a standard classroom tool, used for everything from teaching geometry, to making award-winning art, or producing learning aids for the visually impaired.\nTo support the use of the 3Doodler in education, we have created a special EDU pledge level for only US$1,000 (worth almost US$2,000), that allows you to send a full class set, loaded with x12 3Doodler 2.0 pens, a ton of plastic and accessories, as well as curricular materials to any school, university, library or non-profit makerspace of your choosing. You\u2019ll also get a 3Doodler 2.0 and full set of accessories for yourself!\nNote: We will require you to designate a recognized educational institutional or non-profit makerspace (as well as a contact there) in order to claim this pledge level. Full instructions will follow in an Update, and further details can be found in the FAQs below.\nWhat if \"I'm not artistic\"?\nIf you can dream it, you can 3Doodle it! (Or so the saying goes.) The more artistically inclined of you will be sketching castles in the air in no time, but even those of us without that kind of talent can use the 3Doodler to draw on flat surfaces, peel off the Doodled pieces and join them together to make awesome 3D designs and creations. And based on what we've seen so far, previous artistic ability is not a prerequisite for 3Doodling greatness. Even those who considered themselves to be \"not artistic\" have gone on to Doodle breathtakingly impressive pieces!\nThere are a ton of places to find 3Doodling inspiration, including our Community Site, which has hundreds of freely downloadable projects and stencils, how-to videos, and images. Our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages are also frequently updated with Doodles of the Week, Community \u201cDoodle-Offs\u201d, and cool creations from around the world.\nWhen will you get your 3Doodler?\nWe have been working on 3Doodler 2.0 for over 12 months and are inches away from pressing \"go\" on full production. That means we\u2019ll go straight from this Kickstarter campaign to making your pens. Our first backers will get their new 3Doodlers within a few weeks of this campaign closing, and the majority of you will have your pens by April.\nFor those of you curious about the exact stage we're at: All R&D and prototypes (along with compliance testing) were completed in December, all components and suppliers have been locked down, we have finished our final pilot runs (those are the pens you see in the video and images), and the assembly process is being fine-tuned so that we can run as smoothly as possible when full production begins! All that's left to do is put the final touches to tooling and place our first large orders with our suppliers. Then we'll be moving like lightening and hassling our shipping partners day and night to get your pens to you ASAP.\nWe shipped our original Kickstarter 3Doodlers on time and we're determined to do the same, if not better, for 3Doodler 2.0! \nNo waiting six months (or even a year) for this one\u2026 ;)\nThank you!\nWe can\u2019t thank the Kickstarter community enough for being part of this amazing journey, and we\u2019re super excited to give you a first shot at the new 3Doodler. We know that you'll make the most of this incredible tool and use it to create Doodles that will blow us away.\nFor anyone who has not experienced the 3Doodler yet, now is a great time to start! And for those of you backing us for the second time, thank you again!\nThank you from the 3Doodler Team!\nIs there anything else you need to know?\nYes! To help with this we\u2019ve compiled an extensive FAQ section below, covering everything from the plastics that will ship with your 3D pen, to the shipping methods we\u2019ll be using, details relating to taxes & duties (*sigh*), product safety, as well as the procedures for claiming the School Set pledge level, and much more.\nWe\u2019ll be adding new FAQs as we go along, and we\u2019ll be keeping you up to date with Kickstarter Updates, messages, and via the Comment wall.\nAnyone who backed the original 3Doodler will tell you that we\u2019d much rather reply to your messages than sleep, so please feel free to reach out to us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe worked on the original 3Doodler for almost a year before we launched our first Kickstarter. Since then we\u2019ve had two additional years of production experience, our team has also grown, and we\u2019re doing things better than ever.\n\nWe\u2019re ready to begin full production on 3Doodler 2.0 as soon as this campaign ends, but as with any physical item there are challenges to getting it right and there is always the possibility of delays (sometimes due to factors outside of anyone's control!). In our efforts to avoid delays and produce the best 3D pen possible, we are selective in how we choose our partners, conservative in setting our timelines, and, as always, we intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.\n\nFortunately the 3Doodler 2.0 and the JetPack have already been FCC and CE approved (so that's another hurdle out of the way!), and our plastics are amongst the best certified on the planet, having passed full toxicological risk assessments and heavy metal testing.\n\nQuality control remains a major focus for us. We have implemented systems to catch as many product issues as possible before your pens make their way into your hands.

We want to talk. Give us a shout here to talk about how The Public Radio could fit into your next fund drive!\nIt's radio monogamy.\nOur interaction with FM radio today is simple - we just turn on and off the power. We rarely change stations, and *never* use those seek and scan buttons.  \nWe've gotten rid of all the parts of FM that are now obsolete, leaving only what matters. The Public Radio has all you need - just an antenna and a volume knob.\nHow it works \nLet's get one thing clear: The Public Radio only tunes to one station - your favorite one. When the campaign ends, we'll ask for your station's frequency & call letters, and will tune your Public Radio to that station before it ships.\nThe Public Radio is secured in place with the Mason jar's screw-on ring. The telescoping antenna screws through the lid, and batteries are accessed by removing the radio and installing them inside.\nTech Details\nAt the heart of The Public Radio is a Silicon Labs Si4831 FM IC. Its output is passed through a Texas Instruments TPA2005D1 class D amplifier which drives a 4 ohm 1.25\u201d speaker by Dayton Audio. The Public Radio is built on sturdy FR-4 printed circuit board, and houses a couple custom components, including a switched audio taper potentiometer and a seven segment telescoping antenna. The entire assembly is sandwiched together with our stamped stainless steel lid.\nWe spent a lot of time trying different assembly configurations and hardware specs. If you've got a hankering for details, shoot us a note - we're happy to geek out about it :) You're also welcome to check out our GitHub page, which has open-source versions of our EagleCAD files.\nSo... Why a Mason jar?\nHonestly? It was an accident. At first, we imagined an enclosure with a more contemporary aesthetic. But we needed to evaluate speakers in the meantime, and used a jar and a piece of cardboard as a stand-in. After trying it for an afternoon, we realized that it was just more fun to use something that was *literally* on our shelves.\nThe standard version of The Public Radio comes with its own 250mL square (ish) Ball jar, but you can swap the hardware out into any wide-mouth jar that you like.\nProject History\nWe've been working hard on the Public Radio for the past eighteen months, iterating our designs and building on feedback we received from our beta launch on Grand St. We've gone through seven PCB revisions to date, and have learned a *ton* about FM reception and circuit design in the process.\nFor the last three months we have researched, designed and ordered a handful of the custom parts necessary to make a small production run of The Public Radio. This includes the radio's custom potentiometer and antenna, both of which we received this June. We've also spent countless hours poring over our bill of materials, searching for ways to drop costs - and have researched & vetted our supply chain along the way. \nSome of the radio's hardware components (such as the custom lid) require big setup fees, and we need your help to cover them. Support the project by pre-ordering your own Public Radio and help make this a reality!\nWho we are\nWe're Zach Dunham and Spencer Wright, two childhood friends now living in Brooklyn. We ran around together as kids, and then went on to be hardware design, project management, and audio aficionados. After taking MIT's circuits & electronics class, we started hacking together on weekends, and eventually came up with a fun, compelling idea - that we finally had the skills to complete. \nWe had *tons* of engineering help from Todd Bailey and Andy Warner. Special thanks to Alexis Arkus-Duntov, Jonathan Bobrow, and Daniel Fishkin for their concepting help, and to Colin Reilly for cinematography. \nWe also couldn't have gotten this far without the help of our beta testers - thanks to Robert K, Ross W, Kristen S, Elana O, Harry J, Shawn F, Tracy L, Greg A, Ada P, Jacob C, Robert C, Paula P, Janna L, Cheryl R, Linnea J, Saralyn C, Robert L, and Henry L!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident with our mechanical and electrical design, but some logistical questions remain. Foremost in our minds is building a system that allows us to tune and then track unique radios to each of our backers as they come off of the production line. It'll be a bit tricky, but our fabrication partners are aware of the issue and have a preliminary plan to deal with it.\n\nWe're also anticipating some work in the management of vendors and manufacturers of our custom parts. We have parts coming from about a half dozen suppliers, and tracking their progress and dependencies will be a full-time job. But we've managed jobs of greater complexity before, and ultimately this will not be an impossible task. \n\nAnother expense (and logistical hurdle) will be the FCC tests that we're subject to. These will cost a few thousand dollars and will inevitably require a bit of effort and management. But ultimately, our production and testing partners are well-versed in this territory (and the specifications we need to pass are relatively easy), so we feel confident that it won't be a major issue.\n\nWe also need to find a clever use for all of the standard Mason jar lids that will come with the Public Radio's jars. We'll probably end up using them to make pickles, and there's always the chance that we ship out jars of those instead of the radios... but we're pretty sure we can keep them straight ;)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Holiday sale + an open report on The Public Radio's operations", "update_content": "Friends-\nOn this Cyber Monday - really the most American of holidays - we've got two things to share with you.\nFirst, one that should be a pleasant surprise: For everyone (you!!) who backed our first Kickstarter campaign, we're offering a whopping 35% off all orders when you use the offer code \"LONGTIMEMONOGAMIST\" at checkout on our website: thepublicrad.io/purchase\nSecond, and perhaps less expected: As part of our ongoing effort to bring transparency to our operations, we published , as well as on our end.

When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

We are also honored to present the music of Syrian composer and Tufts University faculty member, Kareem Roustom, with a special piece for this project. Our residency \u2013 a partnership with Questscope, a visionary non-profit organization dedicated to creating social, educational, and entrepreneurial opportunities for marginalized youth, and the world renowned Institute for Global Leadership at Tufts University \u2013 will also include music education activities for the youth and children at Za\u2019atari camp. \nMary Ann Mumm works with youth in Jamaica\nTHE ROAD TO ZA'ATARI CAMP\nThe good news is that with the generous support of the Dr. Jean Mayer Global Citizenship Fund from Tufts University's Institute for Global Leadership and our longtime friends George Landegger and Parsons & Whittemore Inc., we have already raised $15,000 of the $20,000 we need for travel, housing, and local expenses.

These include the logistics of international travel, different nationalities, language, and culture. \n\nWe have already had to reschedule this residency owing to other projects that we and our partners were handling. We are almost ten years old and this sort of recalibration is familiar territory. We are also well into the preparations for our next major global humanitarian effort \"THE SCHEHERAZADE INITIATIVE: Celebrating the Resilience of Women and Girls Facing Violence\". It is certainly a challenge to have multiple projects moving simultaneously.\n\nA vast refugee camp in the Jordanian desert is a different kind of performing venue from the most prestigious stage in the world, Carnegie Hall, with its amenities, where our previous efforts been located. We are bringing music and healing, we hope, to a community that is only a few dozen miles away from the horrific realities of war in a region that is tense with many different kinds of conflict. The landscape shifts not only daily, but sometime by the hour. Our Artistic Director George Mathew has made two trips to Jordan in preparation for this project, and our staff have ensured that we are prepared for any wrinkles that may arise.\n\nWe have handled the bumps as they have appeared and even thrived with the challenges, which have actually helped us to look at ourselves and our work with new eyes and ears.

Unfortunately the typical designs are extremely outdated and until now the best skillets have all been antiques.\nThe US produced the finest cast iron cookware in the world before space age aluminum pans took over. FINEX\u00ae is now making heirloom quality cast iron cookware in America for the first time in over half a century!\nA Modern Heirloom Quality Skillet in Every Kitchen\nFINEX is a completely new approach to the traditional cast iron skillet. Typical skillets have a handle that is pretty much designed to burn you - they are flat and narrow and get just as hot as the pan.\nThe FINEX skillet has an ergonomic \"Speed Cool\" polished stainless steel spring handle with a brass cap for easy hanging. The spring design allows the handle to cool much quicker than a standard skillet and it's shaped to fit the natural curve of your hand.\nErgonomic \"Speed Cool\" Spring Handle\nTypical skillets are just too rough and food sticks to rough surfaces.\nThe FINEX skillet has an ultra-smooth computer machined easy release cooking surface.\nCNC Machined Easy Release Cooking Surface\nNo other skillet on the market has this feature and it's one of the reasons antique skillets are so sought after - they are finally smooth after decades of use. Yours is smooth out of the box.\nAnother Smooth Move\nTypical skillets are awkward to pour from when loaded with food.\nThe FINEX skillet has our patented octagonal \"Multi-Pour\" design for 6 pouring directions. This distinctive shape creates natural angles and even makes it easier to slide a spatula under your food when cooking.\nPatented Octagonal \"Multi-Pour\" Design\nJust Like Its 12\" Big Brother\nOur 8\" FINEX skillet is lighter but no lightweight in the kitchen. It has all of the benefits of our 12\" skillet in a more compact size. The outer diameter of this 8\" skillet is 8.75\" from rim to rim.\nDialing in the CAD Model Before 3D Printing\nThis is your perfect everyday skillet and the design will make you want to give one to all your friends and family members to share the joy of cast iron cooking.\nCarefully Assembling the 3D Printed Prototype\nOur 1st skillet, the ultra-smooth 12\" FINEX shown below with the 8\" 3D printed prototype for comparison, was a runaway success on Kickstarter last winter with over 1,500 backers.\n2/3 as Big with 100% of the Performance\nThousands of FINEX No.12s are now in use around the world doing what cast iron does best - perfectly searing, grilling and saut\u00e9ing your families favorite foods.\nThe Iconic FINEX No. 12 (Included for $240 Pledge!)\nBut Where Can I Place My Hot New FINEX Skillet?\nOur team has your back, so we created this beautiful, laser-cut American cherry wood trivet to showcase the exceptionally clean and timeless FINEX logo created by iconic graphic designer Aaron Draplin.\nCherry Wood Trivet Dimensions: 8\" wide x 8\" tall x .5\" thick.\nFunctional art for your wall or table - this cherry wood finished trivet has precision laser cut detail, cushioned feet and is available in limited numbers for a $35 pledge.\nThe 12\" FINEX Cast Iron Lid is Coming Soon!\nTesting the 12\" Cast Iron Lid Prototype\nAre You Cast Iron Crazy?\nNo doubt about it! I'm passionate about cast iron because every pan tells a story. Each skillet holds an entire history of meals and memories. 20 years, 30 years, even just one year, all imbued with flavors, experiments, laughter and conversations. Your history is built one meal at a time and it deserves to be made in a premium American skillet.\nBy pledging towards the innovative 8\" FINEX skillet you'll personally bring heirloom quality cast iron cookware back to America.

In order to give you precise and sharable wind readings on the spot, we created the first Vaavud wind meter and launched it here on Kickstarter. People loved it!\nNow we are back to launch the world's first handheld wind meter that actually measures wind direction, as well as of course wind speed.\nThis is made possible by our unique asymmetrical rotor design (for further details scroll down to the technical stuff).\nWe have gone through countless iterations on the rotor design and we have obsessed about every little line and detail, to make sure that both performance and looks are second to none.\nThe Vaavud app\nThe new device will work with the popular Vaavud app, which features the world's first real-time graph on a handheld wind meter; a global live map; your personal measurement history and much more to come.\n              Device compatibility\nCurrently we have confirmed the new device to work with the following phones and tablets, and the list keeps growing!\n\n*iPods do not have a compass, so on those the app will show wind speed, but not wind direction\nTimeline\nWe are working towards a shipping date in November 2014, and so far all is set to achieve that target\nRewards\nStretch goals\nColour choice: The third colour will be the one that gets the most votes from all backers, once the campaign is over. More info on this will follow when we get there\nMount + data export: The mount will be printable on most common 3D printers, and will be designed to work with a standard jack-stick extender cable. The design files will be made available, so you can do all the modifications you want to. The data export feature will upload a time series for each measurement as a CSV file to a dropbox folder of your choice\nSpecial carry case: This will be a neoprene hard case similar to the ones known from Oakley sunglasses etc. but tailor made to the Vaavud wind meter. We are quite happy with the current neoprene bags, but this will be something special; a snug fitting, robust, exclusive case made just for your Vaavud V2.0\nWelcome on board!\nOur Kickstarter legacy\nComments from backers and press about our first Kickstarter campaign\nThe technical stuff\nWe are using an optical sensor that measures 40.000 times per second, so we can detect even the slightest variation in rotation speed. By making the rotor of the wind meter slightly asymmetrical we get it to accelerate a bit when the largest part is hit by the wind. We can then compare the point with the highest speed to the compass direction and derive the wind direction. At the same time, data from the highly accurate sensor can be used to derive the average rotation speed and thereby the wind speed.\nThe graph below shows the change in velocity during one full rotation for one of our prototypes. For this one the difference in speed is a bit more than 3%, and the maximum speed is reached at about 45 degrees from start.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny hardware project faces risks - there is no denying that. But we are at a point, where we have eliminated practically all technical risks, so now it is a matter of getting the final design details in place, source the components, and get production started.\n\nThings can of course get delayed in the production process, because rework is needed after seeing the initial production samples, or because a component from a sub-supplier is delayed or turns out not to be in the right quality etc. etc. etc.\n\nHowever, we learned a lot from launching our first product here on Kickstarter. It went pretty smooth, but we can also see lots of big and small things that we can improve. Furthermore we have teamed up with a great design & engineering company here in Denmark, to help us with finding and managing suppliers - something they have a lot of experience with. So we are doing everything we can, to identify any bumps on the road well in advance, and on managing our way around the ones that will inevitably appear.\n\nFurthermore we have our entire logistics set-up in place.
