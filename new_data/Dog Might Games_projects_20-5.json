The 2014 Gold Banner Edition of I Say, Holmes! will keep that idea going with the addition of the competitive campaign, which has a variety of ways for you to score victory points in each hand before Holmes retires in His Last Bow.\nWhen Victory Point Games (Facebook | Twitter) was founded by Alan Emrich in 2007, it started in Alan\u2019s attic, with the games having a \u201cgarage\u201d feel; the focus was squarely on the gameplay rather than fancy components and flashy graphics. Moving forward to 2014, whether the game is designed by a VPG insider or an outside designer, we now develop and manufacture everything in our own production facilities in Costa Mesa, CA. Over the years, we\u2019ve slowly increased our component quality to our modern standard, known as Gold Banner; this includes printing in the full CMYK range, laser-cut counters, custom-cut paper components, and packaging games in Victory Point Games boxes with custom-produced slipcovers.\nNow that we have all these tools available, we want to give the Gold Banner treatment to I Say, Holmes!, and one of the last component upgrades we need to present you with the best version of the game possible is improved card quality \u2026 which is where Playper comes into play.\nPlayper is a specially designed type of paper from Arjo Wiggins for high-end, mass-produced playing cards that can be used in a regular commercial grade printer, like the kind we have at Victory Point Games. This will let us make cards that are similar to those in other high-end games, since Playper is used to make a number of titles, including some extremely popular CCGs (collectible card games). We created various Playper cards from the samples we were sent and you can see the difference between our current and new card quality in the main video above. \nAs a Kickstarter backer for I Say, Holmes! you\u2019ll not only be one of the first people to receive a copy of the new Gold Banner version of the game, but you\u2019ll receive your game in a Kickstarter Exclusive slipcover and the front of the rules will have matching art.\n***FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Contact us for add-on shipping costs.***\nRichark Wilkins (Box of Delights Board Game Reviews) has a video review of I Say, Holmes!\nChris Meussen has written up a review on Today in Board Games! Click here to read the review.\nAll rewards have U.S. and Canadian shipping and handling already included! International backers, please add additional stated amounts in each pledge for shipping and handling to everywhere else in the world. We did a country-by-country breakdown of the actual packages and weights to determine these average amounts. All sales are final. Packages may be insured by your request, and all claims for damaged packages/goods must be made with the shipping carrier.\nBulk Orders\nAnyone who would like to place a bulk order, such as retailers or distributors, should contact us directly at distribution@victorypointgames.com or through Kickstarter and we\u2019ll be happy to work with you to get you set up with whatever you need.\n  Comic Quest, one of our local comic and game shops, graciously allowed us to film some of their game night attendees playing I Say, Holmes!; we want to thank Comic Quest for helping us to prepare our video for Kickstarter as well as supporting our company in numerous other ways.\n*Appearance of Final Published Product May Differ From Images Shown.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe at Victory Point Games have a long history of developing and publishing games, with over 100 titles released since our founding in 2007; in 2013 alone we released 22 full titles, 4 expansions, and 2 mini games (known as Bagged Game Originals). At this point, we\u2019re completely ready to release I Say, Holmes! as a Gold Banner Game and could do so immediately, but we need your help to get the Playper to make this game truly shine. \n\nThere are two potential risks with this project:\n\n1. Meeting Demand: As everything is done in-house at our Costa Mesa, CA, location, games are produced at a slower rate (approximately 75 to 100 games a day) than at the mass-production facilities many other publishers use. However, we can start manufacturing games as soon as the Playper arrives, which we\u2019ve been told should be just a couple of weeks after payments are made. Additionally, since games are produced in small batches, we don\u2019t have to wait for all of the games to be built in an overseas facility, shipped to us in the US, and then out to all of our backers; once we have the Playper, we can immediately start production and we will start to ship games out as soon as they\u2019re available.\n\n2. New Materials/Processes: We have tested Playper in small batches, so we know it will work with our machinery, but one of the biggest reasons we want to make this change is that Playper is actually better aligned with our equipment specifications while also increasing quality. Our current paperstock for cards is slightly too thick for our printer and cutter, which causes the paper to slip and increases the margin of error; Playper will decrease waste and increase our component quality without requiring any change in the way we do things.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "A Game You Will Dig!", "update_content": "Greetings, backers!  \nYour friends at Victory Point Games have launched a new Kickstarter campaign for a game we think you will really enjoy: Gem Rush second edition. \nIn this fast, smart-playing game of hand management and tile placement strategy, you will feel the surge of molten adrenaline through competitive or cooperative (even solo!) gameplay, typically in an hour or less.

While you and the other wizards may in appearance be working together to kill all the monsters, only the player that deals fatal damage to the monster gets to add the kill to their collection and get the fame for it.  \n\nThe first phase of the game has wizards in town learning their spells via an auction-based draft.  The wizards then enter the dungeon with their deck of spells where they will be clearing out the dungeon.  \nArt has been updated\nSteep Discount: Over a 50% MSRP discount for Kickstarter backers!  \nWe need you: We can not print this game without your help. We've covered the initial costs, but we can not manufacture and ship the game without your support.\n Pixel Glory is being published by the Zafty team. The game was designed by Frank Alberts and Russell Ng with art by Russell Ng. Frank is an industry professional working in project management roles as well as being the game designer of SNAFU and other projects to be released by publishers later this year. Russell is a jack of all trades, fresh out of school with a Computer Science degree from Hunter College. Frank and Russell gained a large amount of inspiration for Pixel Glory while playing old-school games on Russell's home-made arcade console.\nSnafu is a real-time cooperative party game that plays in sixty seconds that is being published by the Zafty team. It's a mix of Go-Fish, Curses, Kings, and Pit.

It is easy to learn, lightning-fast to play (typically under 30 minutes), and does not have player elimination. \nDespite the elegantly simple design, Sakura offers a wide range of strategic options as you build the map, collect resources, recruit an army and attack other cities. There are elements of modular map building, dice-based attacks, and modifier cards. Fans of Japanese culture will notice the historical setting and the custom kanji calligraphy. You will love the organic, wooden soldier pieces which in themselves pay homage to the traditional Japanese game Shogi.\nSakura, meaning \u201ccherry blossom\u201d, is an important symbol in Japanese culture. Poets have sometimes compared cherry blossoms to soldiers within vast armies. These ethereal blossoms can also represent the souls of the fallen.\nClick here to download our rule book as a PDF document.

They are a group of gamers who meet twice a month and help play-test board games as they are being developed. The Guild has put Sakura through the gauntlet. We have received praise and constructive criticism. After months of effort, Sakura has earned the Guild's coveted stamp of approval. This signifies that we have a thoroughly solid rule book and game mechanics. This is a stamp that we will proudly display on the cover of our game box.\nDo you have a printer and a pair of scissors? With a little elbow grease, you can make the print-and-play version at home months before the regular production version is ready! Your pledge at any level will get you a link to a printable Sakura PDF. \nFor backers of the full production game, both regular and heirloom edition, we offer 2 extra, unique maps as an Add-On item for $10. We will include them with your game at no additional shipping cost. This will bring your total maps to 6, and give you that much more variety for your 2-4 player games!  \nWe're making a limited number of beautifully hand-made Sakura games. These deluxe editions will include all stretch goals. The game is housed in a carpenter-made cherry wood box with our Sakura kanji etched onto the top. Soldier pieces are also laser etched. Game maps are backed in wood. 4 custom wooden abacuses are included to help tally resources. Coins are made of hand-forged pewter. You will be playing on a work of art. Now shipping internationally and EU friendly!  \nCrowdfunding is awesome. We love how Kickstarter gives the \"little guy\" a chance to share big ideas with the world. Sakura is my big idea, and I want as many people to enjoy it as possible.\nFree shipping within the USA!\nCanada, Mexico: Please add $15 to your pledge\nEU: Please add $25 to your pledge\nAustralia: Please add $30 to your pledge\nEverywhere else: Please add $35 to your pledge\nWe are proud to offer EU-friendly shipping! This means that Sakura will ship from within the EU, and EU backers will not have to pay additional customs, etc. on top of their pledges + shipping. Brad, our manufacturing manager, has years of experience shipping to the EU. We've got your back! \nAt this time, only the regular version of Sakura will be shipped internationally. If you live outside the USA, please add the correct amount on top of your pledge in order for us to ship you your game. For example, if you pledged at the SUPER EARLY BIRD level with $48, and you live in Germany, your total pledge would need to be $48 + $25 = $73.\nEach international backer outside the EU is responsible for customs, etc. which may be charged upon delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter project, but that doesn't mean we are jumping into this blindfolded. On the contrary, we have spent a year in close contact with the Board Game Designer's Guild of Utah, along with several Kickstarter veterans in preparation for our own debut. We've heard horror stories and success stories, and we're committed with all we've got to be a success! \n\nCommon risks with Kickstarter board games: \n\nProduction delays - It's hard to anticipate manufacturing delays, errors and miscommunication. We have already submitted several prototype designs to our manufacturer and they have processed all costs involved and manufacturing dates. We're as prepared as we could be in this department... but rest assured that we will be incredibly open with all our loyal supporters in what our status is along the way. If we're late for any reason, you'll know why. We won't be satisfied until we have a game that matches our vision.\n\nShaky game mechanics - This is a huge deal for me. Sometimes a start-up company can have a great original idea, but lack the skills to bring it to its full potential. That is not us. With Sakura, we have exhaustively play-tested it with hundreds of gamers. We have earned the coveted stamp of approval from the Board Game Designer's Guild of Utah. They drag games through the gauntlet, and only approve games with solid game mechanics and rule books. We will post our rule book and video walk-throughs so you can be familiar with Sakura before you support us. We're confident you're going to love it!\n\nShipping problems - At first, this seems inconspicuous, but shipping issues are among the most migraine-inducing challenges for any Kickstarter. Despite being a small start-up company, we will deliver quality customer support. Yes, we're shipping internationally, and we hope our international backers will be patient with the mail carriers.

Click here to see that forum once it launches.\nIf you'd like to follow updates specific to this project or order some dice for yourself, this link will bet set up to bring you to the right place.\n----------\nHelp us provide the gaming community with customized 16mm (standard size) D6 dice - with more colors, shapes, and sizes available when we reach higher funding levels!\nNote: Remember, your reward can be divided into multiple designs and even multiple shipments. When splitting it into multiple shipments, you just pay the shipping charges on any shipment after the first.\n\nExample: If you pledge for two dozen dice, you can get 24 of the same design OR 4 each of 6 different designs OR 24 completely different designs (or anything in between). And your reward can be split into as many shipments as you like.\nThese add-ons are available to anyone with a pledge level of $6 or more (anyone actually receiving a shipment). You can include as many add-ons with your pledge as you like.\n\nShipping: No additional shipping charges required for add-ons.\n\n\nRight now, if you want to make custom dice for a game prototype, print-n-play game, or just to customize your old Yahtzee! game, it'll cost you several dollars per die - before shipping.\nWe see a way to provide the same quality engraved custom dice at a fraction of the cost. But we can't do it without your help, we need funds to purchase the necessary supplies and equipment (primarily meaning thousands of dice and a Trotec laser engraver)!\nHere are some examples of people we've teamed up with so far to bring you cool designs:\nWe've teamed up with Potluck Games, the creators of Dungeon Dice, and have some exciting news as a result! They are designing an official die for Dungeon Dice that will be available exclusively through CGL.\nPlus they have agreed to allow us to use a bunch of the official art from Dungeon Dice. The art will be available on our website so you can design your own custom mods, expansions, and house rules for Dungeon Dice and the icons on your custom dice will match those on the originals!\n\nWe've also teamed up with Common Man Games to create a custom dice pack for their award winning game Police Precinct. And if enough people are interested in that pack, they'll receive a mystery die for SNITCH Free of charge! That die will also become available for others to claim with their pledge rewards once it's unlocked. More details on Update #8. Both Police Precinct and SNITCH are available through their current KS project.\nWith the announcement of full-color printing, we also announced a collaboration with Nick Hayes to bring his game Chunky Fighters to the masses.\nTesh of Project Khopesh ran a successful Kickstarter project several months ago for metal Tinker Dice and would like to see those designs made reality in plastic as well. So he has shared with us the designs for d6 Tinker Dice as well as Fudge Tinker Dice. Here's what the design looks like as well as a picture of the finished product in metal.\nWe've teamed up with Sarcastic Robot to make Firewall, a strategy dice game, available.\nP.D. Magnus is working with us to produce dice featuring the suits of his award winning six suit deck of cards, the Decktet.\nCheck out Update #11 for a much fuller list of collaborations.\nThese are just a handful of those that have shown us their designs. And there are many more of our 1,000+ backers with design ideas they haven't shown us.\nThese designs will all be available when the project gets funded, but what should be even more exciting is not the designs I've created, but the opportunity for ANYONE to create their own custom design and make it available to the world. There are literally infinite possibilities. I hope the few I've posted here can help inspire some ideas.\nShipping: Shipping to the US is included with all reward levels, additional $7 required for international shipping.\nSharing is caring! One of the most critical aspects of making this project a success is getting the word out to everyone that might be interested. But we need your help to do it.\n\nIf you help us out by sharing the project URL on Facebook or including it in one of your Tweets, we'll reward all of our backers by unlocking new colors of paint to fill the designs with. We figure this is better than paying for advertising because it allows us to reward even more for your support!\n\nWhile you're at it, feel free to follow us on Twitter @CustomGameLab and like our fanpage on Facebook:\nJust for clarification, these are not new colors of dice, but new colors of paint to fill the engraved designs with. New colors of dice will be unlocked through monetary stretch goals.\nDesigns we can promise to be available upon success of this project, include the following themes: Promo dice, Elvish script, weapons, winner's dice, loser's dice, tetrominoes, moon phases, standard d6, dragon dice, chess dice, ninja dice, card suit dice, crown and anchor dice, fudge dice (standard and outline), text based dice, cheater's dice, binary dice, weather dice, Mayan dice, Emoticon dice, Chinese dice, Roman numeral dice, hexadecimal color choosing dice, RGB color choosing dice, and math constants dice. The Myst based D'ni numeral dice have also received approval for commercial licensing from Cyan Worlds Inc and will be available.\n\nWe also fully expect hundreds if not thousands of other designs to be made available soon after our website launches as our backers begin to create their own designs and make them available for others to order. Rest assured you will have plenty of great options to choose from!\nIn fact during the course of this project, we have already begun working with some designers to announce designs they will be making available on our site. We've been sharing these in our updates, but also plan to add some of them to our main project page. There's some exciting new partnerships forming - go check out the updates to see some of the cool designs you'll be able to choose from!\n\nCredits: Music for the video, \"Please Listen Carefully\" by Jahzaar available on FreeMusicArchive.org under Creative Commons licensing, and some of the graphics on this page came from various contributors on Game-Icons.net There will be more specific attributions for the graphics on our site once it is launched, if you would like more info feel free to contact me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will be working with multiple manufacturers to source all of our equipment and supplies from lasers to dice to paints.

However, I have already been in contact with each of these companies to ask questions and receive samples. Each of them is a reputable company and has been very responsive so far.\n\nI've been asked what I will do if this project is wildly successful - will I still be able to deliver? Not only will I still be able to create your dice, but the process get's streamlined even further the more it scales. If it does well enough, I will be able to buy an even faster laser with a larger engraving area allowing me to engrave more dice at once. If necessary, I have room in my shop to add more than one laser as well (plus available help as necessary).\n\nIn short: Overfunding is a good thing, it would allow us to get better equipment, potentially more equipment (which will both speed things up), and more dice options for you!\n\nAs with any Kickstarter, this will be a large time investment not only in creating dice but also in delivering them.\n\nI have worked from home for the past couple of years, and am prepared to dedicate the time needed to deliver your rewards for this project!

On each turn, all players will select one card from their hand and play it simultaneously in an attempt to collect Good Eggs that are worth VP while avoiding the nasty Exploding Eggs that lose VP!\nTypically, the player who played the highest Adventurer chooses an Egg first, then the player with the second highest Adventurer picks an Egg, and so on until all revealed Eggs are collected. Ah, but it's not that simple! Each Adventurer has a unique power that can affect the order in which Eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and different.\nOutwit your opponents to collect as many Dragon Eggs as possible \u2014 while avoiding those wicked Exploding Eggs!\nStory\nEggs from the dragons of Ridback Mountain are valuable \u2014 not quite as valuable as gold following the last market fluctuation, but still TOTALLY worth the hassle, especially since it's not like YOU are climbing the mountain and searching through dragon caves. That's what peasants are for...\nAll the empires have sent their intrepid Adventurers out to collect Eggs, but not all will succeed! It gets crowded on Ridback Mountain, and there are only so many dragon Eggs to go around \u2014 not to mention that the dragons have started mixing Exploding Eggs into their nests, and those hurt.\nPledge Info\nWe wanted to keep this campaign very simple. Eggs and Empires is a great game offered at a great price! Simply select the reward to the right based on your location. Shipping and handling and all stretch goals are included in the price! \nThere are NO add ons or extra costs, but additional copies can be added to any pledge level at the cost of that pledge level. So for three copies, a US backer would pledge $16+$16+$16 = $48. Canada backers would pledge $50 for two copies, $25+$25.\nCanadian and international backers should make sure to take advantage of the 4 pack to save on shipping costs!\nThis project is EU friendly!

People are largely mediocre.  Cheeseburgers are dry and flavorless.  But, one remote planet may hold the key to epicness.  Nay, make that UBER EPICNESS!  As the general of your own rag-tag army of mercenaries, it's time to seize your destiny. \n-- Draft your fighting force from among 12 unique characters\n-- Build your base\n-- Defend your flag\n-- Capture your opponent's flag\n-- Scavenge the battlefield for powerful Artifacts\n-- Achieve Epic Goals\n-- Forge alliances or go it alone\nThe team with the most points is the winner.\nSo draw your weapons.\nShame your friends.\nClaim victory.\nBecome UBER EPIC. \nAnd have the best cheeseburger ever.\nUBER EPIC is a turn-based, social strategy, board game of attack, defense, and revenge.   \nHow many players?          2-12\nHow old?                          Ages 13+\nHow long to learn?          10-15 minutes\nHow long to play?            Games average 60-90 minutes\n3D movement and line-of-sight (LOS) targeting\nThe concepts of turn-based movement and of LOS targeting aren\u2019t new. But UBER EPIC brings them to life in ways never seen before. In UBER EPIC, every player has the ability to customize the layout of his/her headquarters with 3D wall pieces that can provide cover for your characters and obstacles for your opponents. But don\u2019t get too comfy. Walls can be scaled, or even destroyed. And anything you can see, you can shoot. The reverse is also true.\nA combat system that DOESN'T take a calculator and degree in philosophy to figure out\nWe designed the combat in UBER EPIC to be both simple and intuitive. Farther-away enemies are harder to hit but earn more points. Closer enemies are easier to hit but earn fewer points. Melee attacks are based on the higher dice roll between two characters. There is a nifty Targeting Meter that tells you exactly how far away an enemy is, and exactly what you need to roll to score a hit. Hit characters are paralyzed and inactive for the next round. Pretty easy, right?\nVendetta Shots\nRemember those old Westerns where the good guy gets shot, but with his last, dying breath, fires one final bullet to exact his vengeance? We wanted that for UBER EPIC. If your character is hit with a ranged attack, you get one last Vendetta Shot to take your attacker down with you. Successful Vendetta Shots can stop your opponents\u2019 plans cold.\nUBER EPIC is unpredictable \nUnpredictability and randomness are built into the core of UBER EPIC, making not just every game, but every turn, unique.  We've created several game mechanics that will keep you guessing.  \nChanging turn order \nEvery round, the character movement order is randomized.  Going early and going late both have distinct advantages.  If you go early, you set the tone for the round.  You shape the board, and you have first dibs at deciding which characters to try and eliminate.  But going late can also have major upsides.  If you survive to the end of the round, many of the foes blocking your path may have already been eliminated, making the going much easier.   Either way, things change quickly from turn to turn, so being able to adapt your strategy on the fly is a must.  \nArtifacts \nArtifact tokens are strewn across the battlefield.  Step on an Artifact token, and randomly draw one of the 25 potential Artifact cards from the deck.  Some Artifacts will give you a huge advantage at a crucial moment. Some Artifacts will actually harm you. Scavenge at your own risk.\nUBER EPIC accommodates multiple play styles\nSince each character has his/her own unique strength and special ability, victory in UBER EPIC can be achieved through a variety of play styles and strategies.\nAre you a zerger? Did you idolize Leroy Jenkins?  Do you want to run full bore at your opponent's flag and never look back?\nAre you a camper? The cautious sort?  Is your idea of fun hunkering down inside your own base and taking pot-shots at your opponents as they come creeping by?\nAre you a hoarder?  Do you want to scavenge the battlefield to collect all the Artifacts so no one else can have ALL THE FUN that you're having? \nAre you a sneaker?  The sort with a good poker face? Do you think you can secretly fulfill the conditions of your Epic Goals without your opponents being any the wiser? \nUBER EPIC doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously\nWhen we created UBER EPIC, we wanted something that would be easy enough for casual gamers to pick up, but also fun and strategic enough to impress even the most hardcore Gamer. UBER EPIC is the perfect party game. It\u2019s fun to play, easy to learn, and allows for plenty of opportunities to shame your friends. We also wanted a game with a sense of humor. If you feel like a change from game writing that sounds like it came out of The Wheel of Time\u2019s \u00ae reject pile, you\u2019ll love UBER EPIC.\nBLACK-LIGHT!!!!!!\nFulfilling our Kickstarter goal will allow us to produce every piece and card of UBER EPIC with black-light compatibility.  If you've never played a game in black light before, you're in for a treat.  Just take a look at some of our play test footage!  (NOTE: black-light bulbs not included in UBER EPIC game set).\nThe finished, boxed set of UBER EPIC will include:\nGiddy Games isn\u2019t a huge gaming company, and we\u2019re not trying to be. We are gamers just like you. We were playing D&D\u00ae out of the red box and we always try for the \"longest road\" in Settlers\u00ae.\nUBER EPIC started out as a pet project that we created to play with our friends at gaming conventions and parties.  The first prototype was made out of Playmobil\u00ae, Legos\u00ae, and handwritten index cards.  Both kids and adults really seemed to like it, so we decided to jump right into the world of game making.\nWhy did we choose a Kickstarter campagin for UBER EPIC? Because the internet is an awesome place (metaphysically speaking) where dreams come true. Ten years ago, none of this would have been possible. Seriously, take a second to think about just how cool all of this is \u2013 thousands of people independently coming together to help great projects get made.\nWe want to self publish because we want to see UBER EPIC grow into a community. We want people like us to write their own variations of the game rules and post them on our website for others  to enjoy. We want people to suggest ways to make it even better.\nUBER EPIC has been a passion and a dream many years in the making.  Through a lot of collaboration and hard work, this dream is nearly a reality.  GiddyGames, LLC has a lot of people to thank:\nTo the creative team at Imaginigami:  Kevin, your imagination and belief in our dream made all of this possible.  We wouldn't be here if not for you.  Paul, your artwork is creative, beautiful, and dynamic all rolled into one.  Jarrett, you are the funniest, most creative thinker we've ever met, even if you don't ever remember meeting us.  Thanks for convincing us to keep the Fish of Good Fortune card. \nTo MakeIt Labs, Bow High School,  and Karen at Printers Square, thanks for working with us through thick and thin and helping us get the prototype established. \nTo our friends and family, thanks for the many MANY rounds of play testing we forced on you.  You helped tweak and mold UBER EPIC into the awesome, exciting game it has become. \n\"Weirdly, I find myself attracted to The Evil Genius.

Where Kickstarter hopefuls are injected with a drug that makes them drop dead if they miss the deadline. Ooooooh. \nBut anyway, that's a project for the future.

My protagonist is a youngster eager to break out of his dull life who should really be careful what he wishes for. As his adventures unfold and he comes closer to realizing those dreams, he realizes that ascending to the big leagues is nothing to be cavalier about, and the joys and pleasures he's hoping to attain come with a lot of responsibility and loss. Is it worth it, in the end? Whether he thinks so is ultimately the question that the book, and any sequels it might spawn, will explore.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk, obviously, is that I die, get abducted by aliens, or am highly overestimating what I can accomplish under pressure.

Visit our website for details, and thanks for stopping by here!\nLagoon: Land of Druids is a game about forging the destiny of a world. Players lead circles of druids in search of enchanted sites that offer magic powers and the energy you'll need to bend Lagoon's destiny. Each site belongs to one of three different energies that compete to dominate Lagoon:\nEvery action you take alters the balance of power among these three energies. The energy with the most sites on the board at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny. Position yourself on the winning side of destiny, and you win!\nLagoon: Land of Druids supports 1-4 players. Most games are completed in 60 minutes or less. A game with 4 is a team game. \"The team actually works really well,\" says UndeadViking in his video review below (\"What People Are Saying\" section).\nThe recommended starting tile setup for new players is shown below. Like all setups, it includes one site of each energy to ensure the game begins in a place of balance between the three energies.\nGame setup for two players.\nPlayers alternate turns, using their druids to perform various actions. Common actions include exploring a new site from the bag, moving around the world, summoning a fellow druid back into play, and unraveling a site to remove it from play. \nAdditionally, every site on the board offers a unique magic power. If your druids occupy a site, you can use its power. A fun twist is your druids share their site powers with one another. So if you have five druids on different sites, each of them could use any one of the five site powers. This opens up a lot of tactical play and fun combos.\nMidpoint of 2 player game. Each player has a stack of unraveled sites and acquired seed tokens at bottom left and right.\nThe heart of the game comes down to manipulating how many sites of each energy are on the board, and this is where you'll be trying to outmaneuver your opponents by making better use of all the site powers to carry out your agenda. Explore new sites aligned with an energy you want to support, and gain a seed token matching that energy. Unravel and remove from the board the sites of energies you wish to oppose.\nAt the end of the game, the energy with the majority of sites in play becomes Lagoon's destiny. If you supported that energy better than any other player, you win! The game tracks loyalty to the dominant energy as follows. Seeds of the dominant energy remaining in your supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it's removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.\nUndeadViking Video Review\nGame play explanation begins at 5:35.\nTestimonials\nAdam P. McIver, Designer of Coin Age: \"Lagoon is a board game oxymoron. It somehow manages to feel immediately familiar while also being fresh and different. It simultaneously seems like a classic game and the hot new thing. The rules are easy to teach, learn, and understand but they combine to give you seemingly endless combinations and countless strategies.\nDavid has done something really extraordinary here. He's effortlessly walked the line between Eurogame elegance and Ameritrash atmosphere, blending theme and mechanics so perfectly that it should make every game designer jealous. I really hate him. (JK, I love him but reluctantly.)\nMy impressions of Lagoon were solidified while the game was still a prototype with no real visuals to speak of, and now that I've seen the artwork, my eyes have exploded right out of my head. I have no idea how I'm managing to type this right now, but convincing you to support Lagoon is that important. It's that good. Trust me.\"\nJason Tagmire, Designer of Pixel Lincoln: \"Lagoon feels like Magic the Gathering meets Summoner Wars meets a very thinky game of rock, paper, scissors. A very subtle, beautiful game.\"\nBen Pinchback, Co-Designer of Fleet, and Eggs and Empires: \"Lagoon is a gorgeous looking game and a real brain burner under the hood. Each decision is meaningful and fun. This is the type of game you think about long after you're done playing.\"\nDarrell Louder, Designer of Compounded: \u201cLagoon is a fantastic game where options and gameplay grow as the game goes on. It\u2019s a brilliant puzzle that I love to unravel every single time I play. Probably the best game I played at BGG Con 2013.\"\nMichael Mindes, Founder of Tasty Minstrel Games: \"Lagoon is fun, intriguing, and as you can see the artwork is amazing. I will be an excited backer on day 1 and I expect great things for this game and its designer David Chott.\"\nKyle Hendricks, Game Designer and Player Extraordinaire: \"There is a damn good chance that Lagoon will end up being in my top 5 favorite games of all time.\"\nThe components included in one copy of Lagoon are listed below. Every single one of the 54 sites has a gorgeous, unique illustration to vividly bring the world of Lagoon to life on your table! The hex tiles are a large 3.5 inches wide (as big as Eclipse tiles for those familiar with that game).\n1 rulebook \n1 round-bottomed drawstring bag for randomizing site tiles \n1 token draw bag for solo mode\n4 player reference cards \n4 player markers / exploration aids\n16 Elemeen seed tokens \n16 Vowelon seed tokens \n16 Deonin seed tokens \n40 cardboard druid tokens (5 each of Mushroom, Hare, Stag, Fern, Owl, Dragonfly, Turtle and Moon)\n40 WOODEN, screen-printed druid tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n36 WOODEN, screen-printed seed tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n24 double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n3 advanced double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n1 BONUS site tile!\n* Prototype components, graphics may change in final version. Forthcoming art will replace gray placeholder illustrations.\nI believe in Lagoon, and want you to believe in it too. So I've made a FREE print and play version of Lagoon: Land of Druids available for anyone to download. Print a copy and play at home today!\nDownload the Lagoon Print and Play\nDownload the Lagoon Rulebook\nI've worked hard to ensure my first board game design will be produced to a high standard of quality. The art will enchant you, and you'll have fun exploring all the possibilities of Lagoon's rich game play. But I have plans to make Lagoon: Land of Druids even more alluring if the project overfunds.\nMy philosophy for stretch goals is that they should make the game better without jeopardizing the schedule or the ultimate success of the game. There's a ton of exciting enhancements we can do within these parameters, and I have a succession of sweet options in mind! \nThe most effective way to achieve upgrades to the game is by sharing this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Please share Lagoon far and wide the world over!\nFirst Stretch Goal - $22,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nA 5th druid circle will be included in the game! \nBackers chose the Owl to be the emblem of the 5th druid circle! This provides an alternate art design for the emblem representing your druid circle, as you boldly forge Lagoon's destiny.\nThe initial four druid circle designs included in the base game are shown above, and the owl design will be completed early this coming week!\nPlease note, however, the addition of these tokens does not allow Lagoon to support 5 players. The balance of Lagoon's game dynamics is excellent with 2 and 3 players, but it does not scale well to 4 or 5 individual players. This is why the 4 player game is played with teams, which feels different but truly makes for a very fun, balanced experience.\nSecond Stretch Goal - $25,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTHICKER COMPONENTS! \nThe Lagoon: Land of Druids punchboards will now be 2.5mm thick instead of the original 2mm. This will make all site tiles, druid tokens, seed tokens, and player markers/exploration aids thicker! Thicker components are more durable, are easier to pick up, and feel more substantial and satisfying to use. They also look a lot more impressive on your table.\nThird Stretch Goal - $30,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSOLO PLAY MODE!\nLagoon: Land of Druids will now be playable for a single player! This will be a great way to play when you're a druid circle of one, or when the game first arrives and you're eager to learn it on your own. More details on this experience will be added soon.\nFourth Stretch Goal - $35,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nCHUNKY THICK COMPONENTS!\nThis enhancement will increase the thickness of the punchboards once more, from a thick 2.5mm to a chunky 3mm! That's right, we're on the threshold of magnificence, where .5mm tips the scales and pushes us into chunky land!\nThis is the thickness every prototype of Lagoon has used for its tiles, and I'm thrilled that this upgrade is well within reach. Considering most board games use 2mm or even 1.5mm thick chipboard for components like Lagoon's tiles, I think you'll love the heft of 3mm tiles in your hand and how impressive they look on your table!\nFifth Stretch Goal - $40,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTWO ADDITIONAL BACKER CHOSEN DRUID CIRCLES!\nA 6th and 7th druid circle design will be included in the game. Note this does not increase the player count above 4, as explained in the first update.\nBackers are nominating nature-themed emblems on the comments page now! To promote druid diversity, the two new emblems will be non-plant, non-fungus, non-bird, non-mammal emblems, as those are already represented. Lastly, I reserve the right to filter out suggestions that aren't thematic.\nSixth Stretch Goal - $50,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSIX ADVANCED SITES ADDED!\nSix \"advanced\" sites will now be included with Lagoon! That's three additional site tiles. Check out Flaming Lotus below, one of the advanced Vowelon sites! \nThe six advanced sites offer potent magic to your druids. They didn't initially make it into the base game because their usefulness is less straightforward, or they're a little tricky to use. But exceedingly useful they are! Now you'll be able to swap out three tiles from the base game for the advanced tiles, or play with all 27 tiles if you want a slightly longer game.\nSeventh Stretch Goal - $60,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nWOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nEvery Kickstarter copy of Lagoon will now include FOUR player sets of wooden druid tokens. That's 20 total druids, which is the full complement for the largest player count of 4. The tokens will be 4mm thick wooden discs, 1mm thicker than the punchboard druid tokens. Also included will be emblem stickers to label the members of each circle of druids.\nThese wooden tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter. I want to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, and that's why these wooden components will not be standard equipment in the retail version of the game. They won't be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, but they will be free to you.\nEighth Stretch Goal - $65,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSCREEN-PRINTED WOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nThe four wooden sets of druid tokens added previously will be upgraded from stickers to screen-printing. The druid circle emblems will be painted directly on the wooden discs. More attractive and durable than stickers, screen-printed wooden druid tokens make a classy and refined addition to Lagoon. And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nNinth Stretch Goal - $75,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nEIGHT SETS OF SCREEN-PRINTED DRUID TOKENS!\nA full eight sets of screen printed wooden druid tokens are included with every backed copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids. That's a total of 40 wooden druid tokens! This includes the four original emblems (Stag, Hare, Fern, Mushroom) as well as the four chosen by backers: Dragonfly, Owl, Turtle, and Moon.  And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nTenth Stretch Goal - $80,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nLAGOON ART DIGITAL WALLPAPER 3-PACK\nThree digital wallpapers of Lagoon art have been unlocked! If you can't wait until then, the sixteenth update has a nice treat for you!\nEleventh Stretch Goal - $90,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n16mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nRendering of seed tokens. Final design may differ.\n36 wooden seed tokens with screen-printed seed designs on both sides are now included with backed copies of Lagoon. This is in addition to the 40 wooden druid tokens unlocked previously, tricking out your copy of Lagoon with a grand total of 76 wooden tokens! This will complete the upgrade of all tokens from punchboard to painted wood.\nSeveral things to note about these tokens:\nThey will NOT be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter!\nThe game will still include all the punchboard seed tokens.\nThese seed tokens (16mm) are smaller than the punchboard seed tokens (19mm). If that saddens you, please take a look at the next stretch goal.\nThis goal provides 12 wooden seed tokens in each energy, whereas there are 16 punchboard seed tokens in each energy. Twelve tokens is actually the number all prototypes of Lagoon have used, which is plenty. We're doing more punchboard seeds because having extras may be handy and we have space for them.\nTwelfth Stretch Goal - $100,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n19mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nAll 36 wooden seed tokens are now upgraded from 16mm to 19mm. The larger size is the same as the punchboard seed tokens.\nAchieving this stretch goal makes every Kickstarter copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids a deluxe experience with a full 76 wooden tokens that will not be included in the base retail version of the game. That's 40 druid tokens in 8 different designs, as well as 36 seed tokens in 3 different designs. \nThirteenth Stretch Goal - $125,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nBONUS PROMO SITE!\nEach backed copy of Lagoon will include a bonus site tile! This promotional tile will introduce a new site type to Lagoon, the totem. Totems are game changing sites that don't behave like the others. Just one totem can completely change the feel of a game, so this bonus site will pack a punch! \nThis promo tile will NOT be included in the base retail version of the game.\nFourteenth Stretch Goal: $150,000\nWEEKLY LAGOON LORE!\nI will lovingly write and share with you a new chapter of Lagoon's lore and history once a week until the game goes out to backers.\nThe first chapter would be delivered by the first week of April, so we're talking at least 18 chapters! Each chapter would profile a new character, give background on a significant location, or cover some overarching topic in the world of Lagoon. We're not talking book sized chapters, but there'll be enough meat on these bones to flesh the world out.\nI could not produce Lagoon without the faith and support of Kickstarter backers. To respect this trust placed in me, I promise that backer copies of Lagoon: Land of Druids will be shipped out before the game is available for purchase at conventions or retail stores. \nI also pledge to keep my backers well informed at each step in the process of producing and delivering Lagoon: Land of Druids. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this project, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nLastly, I'm pleased to announce Lagoon: Land of Druids is now an EU Friendly project!\nIf you've made it all the way down here, thank you for giving my game your attention! Lagoon is the culmination of a dream going back many years to publish my own board games. My favorite games have evocative themes that are tightly woven into the mechanics. I love opening a game box and discovering an entire world beckoning me inside. When I sit down to play a game, I want to feel like I'm exploring a living system filled with mysteries to be solved and dynamics that grip me but aren't easily mastered. To me, that's magic in a box. That's what I want most when I sit down to play a game. \nI've put a lot of love into this game, and I hope when you sit down at your table to play Lagoon that your experience has a handful of these sparks pulling you in and creating memorable experiences with your friends and family.\nI have a big vision for this game and its future, and a dream to publish other outstanding games that are also set in the world of Lagoon. If this world resonates with you, I'm delighted that we've connected! I believe so strongly in what I'm doing that I actually quit my job four months ago to devote most of my time and energy towards building Three Hares Games. It may sound crazy, but I'm taking a leap forward towards forging my own personal destiny, and I'm grateful to anyone who plays a role in it.\nI started a blog to document this wild journey, and invite you to follow along if you like.\nCheers,\nDavid\n Three sizes available in three designs.\nGrizznant, Ancient Forest Lord\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\n Jokulmas, Trickster\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\nElixona, Queen of Dreams\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for this project are possible delays with art, manufacturing, shipping and fulfillment. The schedule includes several weeks of buffer time at different stages in order to absorb a decent amount of unforeseen delays without jeopardizing on-time delivery.\n\nMost of the art has been completed already, and the remaining pieces are scheduled for completion before this campaign even ends. My graphic designer has worked in the board game industry for many years and has the experience to ensure the pre-press phase goes quickly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Panda Game Manufacturing, a very reputable company I've established a good working relationship with going back to August. I'm working with a well-recommended and responsive freight company to manage the logistics of getting the manufactured game from China to warehouses in other countries.\n\nI've analyzed several different fulfillment scenarios to get games to backers, and have evaluated three vendors to handle most of this process for me. I believe I've settled on the most efficient approach for fulfillment. As the project proceeds, I will continually monitor this aspect and shift my strategy if a more efficient approach is possible.\n\nAnother factor I want to disclose is that I will be on a family trip to Alaska at the beginning of August, which could overlap the timeframe that rewards are being distributed to backers. Fortunately, I am not planning to directly handle fulfillment myself, so I don't anticipate this causing problems with that process being carried out by my fulfillment vendors. I do mention this though because problems could arise in that timeframe that require my attention. I have verified that internet access will not be out of reach where we are staying, so I should be able to work productively while on this trip if required.\n\nI am prepared and motivated to meet any obstacles along the way, and diligently resolve them. My backers can count on honest and open communication from me about any such challenges. You are my primary stakeholders, and I will honor my obligation of transparency as a project creator.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "GenCon, Lagoon Story Game", "update_content": "Greetings!

We want to create a webshow about gaming, gamers and food. The first of its kind, we believe, and the first to be produced in the UK too! \nWe want to launch the first season of a web show called Dice & Slice. This is the first show of this kind produced in the UK \u2013 as far as we know! \u2013 and we want to involve the gaming community. We are going to produce 15 episodes for everyone and one episode extra for every stretch goal we hit. The episodes will show you how to play boardgames and roleplaying games ... but with a twist!\nWhat do we have in mind?\nNothing brings people together like gaming and eating, so we thought it'd be pretty cool to have a show in which both activities are combined and we can demonstrate how to play some of the best games out there and help you prepare easy to cook and healthy meals for your friends... like the recipe below!\nPlease don't lick the spatula at home if you're cooking with raw eggs. It's not a good idea. I do it because I love it and my stomach is made of Titanium, but it's not a good idea generally. \nHope you enjoy the recording AND the muffins!\nThis show is not about us, though. It's about you, the gamer out there. We have set the pledge levels so you have a big say in how the show is run. You'll decide what games are played and what recipes are cooked. You could even come to play the game with us, or join us to record an unboxing video! \nIn order to do that we need additional equipment and we need your help.\nWhat is this really about?\nOver time we have bought a pretty hefty amount of equipment but now we\u2019d like to \u201clevel-up\u201d our production by adding the ATEM Television Studio. This is a recently launched video switch from the prestigious company BlackMagic. It allows us to mix up to six cameras in real time with the aid of a computer and produce more material more quickly. The funding goal has been set to allow us to buy this machine plus all the accessories we need to operate it and pay the relevant fees.\nHowever, hitting stretch goals will allow us to buy better equipment and produce even better quality shows. Below is a list of the equipment we could get and the money we need and we have tons of ideas for further stretch goals!\nWe know the studio is a massive push, but hey! We can dream and we can count on the most awesome supporters out there ever. That's you!\nAnd if we go further?\nIf we manage to go over the \u00a315,000 stretch goal, for every \u00a32,000 we get, we will invite a game designer to come and play with us. We will pay for their flight and accommodation and get them to record one of the episodes and help cook the meal.\nThis stretch goal has been inspired by Jay Little (of Warhammer Fantasy RPG, X-Wing and the recent Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars RPGs) and therefore he'd be the first one to be invited.\nNow that would be really, really cool!\nWho are we?\nHello! I am Paco Garcia Jaen and I have been playing games for over 20 years. In June 2010 I started a blog called G*M*S Magazine which soon turned into something much bigger. It now contains over 2,000 reviews, articles and items of news. In February 2011 I started the G*M*S Magazine Podcast. Later in the same year my partner and I began video production of game unboxings, together with interviews at the leading conventions in the UK and at Spiel in Germany. To date, we have produced over 100 videos.\nJust in case you've seen none yet, here's a sample!\nThe not-so-small print: If you pledge for any of the levels that allow you to join us during one of our unboxings or one of the episodes of Dice & Slice, you'll be responsible for making your way to and from our home in the south of England. You'd be welcome to stay the night with us, but we can't pay for your fares.\nIf you pledge to have your game featured in Dice & Slice, please remember you must send us the game unless it is one we already have in our collection. The game must be fully produced and commercially available \u2013 no Print & Play games and no prototypes either. Sorry!\nIf you pledge to choose which game to unbox, we will send the list of available games. Selection will be on a first-come first-served basis \u2013 the first person to pledge has first choice, and then the list will go to the next person, etc. \nIn the media!\nThe rather excellent guys from Dicing With Design podcast interviewed Martin and I just a few days ago.

What, are you nuts?\nWe have made some counter-intuitive decisions for this Kickstarter, and it's our hope that you'll prove us right, not just for this project, but for future game projects by other creators.\n1. We have chosen not to do any exclusives as part of this campaign. That means we are lacking the \"rare components\" incentive. Many will simply choose to wait for the game to hit retail. We understand the risk, but think it will be better for the game in the long run. If you agree, this is a chance to show that exclusives are not needed to succeed.\n2. In lieu of exclusives, we have decided to offer the game at the ridiculously low price of $15, but only to Kickstarter backers. This is not a micro game. It is a game with over 125 cards that has a high level of strategy & theme, world class art, and first rate graphic design. The MSRP on Draco Magi will be $25.  Our hope is that a $15 Kickstarter price will encourage you to back this project instead of waiting. By backing the Kickstarter you will get the game for just a tiny bit over wholesale and you will have it in your hands before the general population. \n3. All stretch goals that we reach will apply to every game we manufacture.\nIf you agree that rewarding Kickstarter backers with a significant discount is a better road to take than selling at or above MSRP with exclusives, you can help by pledging! \nThis campaign will only run for 24 days!
