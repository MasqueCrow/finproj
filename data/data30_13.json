Allison was raised by classically trained musical parents, and began performing in front of audiences at age 5. She studied piano, flute, violin, dance and voice from elementary school and holds a BA in Linguistics / Music Vocal Performance and an AA in Italian. Allison's vocal palette has been colored by her experience in a variety of musical genres throughout her life, from a cappella Elizabethan madrigals to punk rock to country to commercial jingles. Since 2005 Tucker has found the most natural fit to be jazz. The genre's freedom of expression and intellectual tilt were both appealing, as was its openness to absorb styles and accents from throughout the vocalist's travels.Growing up on the border with Mexico, Allison was exposed to intermingling cultures and her love for languages and world cultures also began at an early age. She has studied and sings in 6 languages besides her own, lived in Japan and Spain, and has traveled to over 15 countries. This \"wanderlust\" is present in the music she chooses today\u2014 with rhythms, melodies, and lyrics of Brazil, Italy, France, Latin America, Japan, and the US. For Allison, it's all about the human connection, and music is the universal language.Allison's debut album \"Come With Me\" (Allegato Music 2008), co-produced by jazz guitarist Peter Sprague (Dianne Reeves, David Benoit, Chick Corea, Sergio Mendes) and arranged by Kamau Kenyatta (Gregory Porter, Hubert Laws, Earl Klugh, Patti Austin), received international acclaim, was nominated for Best Jazz Album 2009 by the San Diego Music Awards, and continues to receive airplay on radio stations in 18 countries.Allison's sophomore album \"April in Paris\" (Allegato Music 2014) celebrating songs of springtime from around the world, was recorded in Paris on UNESCO's 1st Annual International Jazz Day at the end of a 9-concert tour through Italy & France with international musicians and arrangers from five countries. Arrangers include Kamau Kenyatta, Danny Green, Emmanuel Massarotti, and Jovino Santos Neto.Given 4 stars by DownBeat Magazine, Allison's third album \"WANDERlust\" (Origin Records 2016) was recorded in New York City under the direction of award-winning producer Matt Pierson (Brad Mehldau, Milton Nascimento, Joshua Redman, Jane Monheit). WANDERlust features a stunning all-star ensemble that not only bridges west and east coasts but adds flavors from around the world. Allison and Los Angeles pianist Josh Nelson are joined by New York jazz heavy-hitters Chris Potter, Matt Moreno, Scott Colley and Antonio S\u00e1nchez, along with percussionist Rog\u00e9rio Boccato and guitarist Romero Lubambo (both from Brazil) and French guitarist St\u00e9phane Wrembel. The songs on WANDERlust are musical postcards from distant points of interest, from Rome to Paris to Takeda, Japan--and even destinations that exist purely in the mind's eye.Allison returned to New York City in January 2019 to revisit her pop-punk past and record her fourth album RETRO Trilogy. RETRO - a trilogy of jazz re-imaginings of 3 decades of music from the 1970s, 80s, 90s including an original song, will be rolled out in 3 separate EPs across streaming platforms, and available as one CD. Musicians include Kevin Hays piano/rhodes/melodica, Tony Scherr bass/guitars, Kenny Wollesen drums/vibes, Yotam Silberstein guitar, Peter Sprague guitar, and Bashiri Johnson percussion. Arrangements by Allison, Kevin Hays, Josh Nelson, Danny Green, Yotam Silberstein, and Peter Sprague.As a session artist, Allison's voice can be heard on national commercials and on the video game \"The Saboteur\" soundtrack singing French jazz in the company of Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, Madeleine Peyroux, & others. This has resulted in a cult following by the typically \"non-jazz listening\" gamer audience, causing her interpretation of \"La Vie En Rose\" to become one of the top downloads on iTunes, Pandora, and Spotify worldwide.As an international artist, Allison has entertained audiences in Japan, Europe, Mexico, and the US, including performances in the Blue Note New York, Ronnie Scott's London, Herb Alpert's Vibrato Los Angeles, San Jose Jazz, The Jazz Kitchen Indianapolis, Idyllwild Jazz in the Pines Festival, Hawaii Public Radio, Takatsuki Jazz Street Festival Osaka, Body & Soul Tokyo, Le Baiser Sale' Paris, Music Inn Rome, Lucca Jazz Donna Festival Tuscany, among others.", "websites": ["AllisonAdamsTucker.com", "facebook.com", "youtube.com", "twitter.com", "instagram.com"], "url_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/146239659", "name": "Allison Adams Tucker", "no_of_backed_proj": "Backed 3 projects", "location": "San Diego, CA", "joined_date": "Joined Mar 2012"}, [{"title": "Rebecca Kleinmann Tour Support", "content": "Support Tour of Brazilian and Flamenco Jazz featuring Fabiano do Nascimento and Rebecca Kleinmann's Quartet with Alex Conde!", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rebeccakleinmann/rebecca-kleinmann-tour-support?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/rebeccakleinmann", "backers": "by Rebecca Kleinmann and 54 backers"}, {"title": "nura: headphones that learn and adapt to your unique hearing", "content": "Headphones with in-ear and over-ear design that automatically tune to your unique hearing profile in 30sec.

Amazing!  Thank you!I am a Nashville-based songwriter, band-leader, and full-time touring artist.  By the grace of modern science, my husband Joe and I have a 10 month old daughter who we named Annabell Jane after my great-aunt Ann Bell from North Carolina.  Aunt Ann Bell was pistol and so is our girl.  We started bringing Annabell on the road with us when she was three months old and since then we've been taking her with us everywhere we.  She is extremely social and adaptable so she's really slotted right into our unique lifestyle.  I'm so grateful that I get to be a mother and continue to play music.A little history:I grew up playing and singing with my dad in northern New Jersey.  My dad plays the banjo and the guitar and sings like a bird.  He loves old country and folk, bluegrass and old-time, the Beatles and the Byrds, Bill Monroe and the Blue Sky Boys.  All of that wonderful music was a big part of my childhood and I picked up the guitar when I was 14.  My dad and I still play and sing together every chance we get.I attended New York University and got my degree in English Education.  I landed a job teaching high school English at a charter school in Brooklyn.  I worked really hard.  I remember walking to school in when the moon was still high in the night sky.  (If any of my ex-students are reading this, please post inspiring testimonials here, or on my FACEBOOK page.)In my third year of teaching I had a revelation: I was a successful New York workingwoman; I had achieved exactly what I\u2019d been working towards and yet, I was not happy.  I had always wanted to be a musician and I realized, if I\u2019m ever going to go for it, I need to do it NOW.   So I put in my notice, finished out the school year, then packed up my Honda Odyssey Minivan, and moved to Nashville.  (yes, it is cliche, but it is also the truth.) Over the next year, I wrote and recorded my first album, put together a great team to help me promote it, and hit the road.I love touring.  I also love the amazing community of musicians I'm now a part of, both here in Nashville, and all over this great country.  I am one hard-working, lucky girl.
