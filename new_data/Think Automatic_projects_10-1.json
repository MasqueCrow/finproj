This is unnatural and has significant implications to our sleep, mood, immune system, weight management, and overall well-being.\nArio is a WiFi-connected lamp and lighting system that mimics the light of the sun to keep your body clock in sync and improve your health.\nArio throughout the day\nArio uses advanced LED technology and cloud connectivity to make your life healthier and easier.\n                                                Light Matters!\nHumans evolved to live according to rhythms of the sun. We respond physically and mentally to the light around us. Today, we live in a world in which our sleep/wake cycles are easily disrupted. We often feel groggy in the morning, lethargic during the day, and restless at night.\nOur bodies respond to light direction, color, intensity, and time, releasing hormones that control our body processes - physiology, sleep, metabolism, behavior, and mood. \nBased on over 15 years of scientific research from Harvard Medical School, NASA, and the NIH, Ario delivers lighting optimized for your health. \nWe created Ario to help you -\nWake up naturally with sunrise-like lighting\nIncrease focus and productivity with energizing blue-rich light \nRelax in the evening with sunset-like amber lighting\nSleep better at night\nImprove health: manage weight, reduce stress, increase antioxidant levels, and boost immune system\n                                     Imagine Your Life with Ario\nArio provides a more natural way to wake up when you want to, with gently increasing light.\nBlue-rich light energizes like a sunny day.\nArio's calming amber light creates a relaxing atmosphere.\nArio's downward-directed light prepares you for sleep. Ario can turn itself off or act as a nightlight that won't disturb sleep.\n                                             How Ario Works\nSo, how does Ario actually work? We believe technology should make our lives simpler, not more complicated as many connected home devices currently do. Ario is easy to set up and use. Just plug it in.\nSetup:\nPlug your Ario lamp into the wall.\nConnect Ario to your WiFi via a simple phone app.\nSit back and enjoy, while Ario figures out where you are and comes up with a lighting schedule that evolves with you over time.\nArio works automatically. If you unplug your lamp for days or weeks and plug it back in, Ario knows what to do, even if your WiFi is down.\nPhysical Control: User buttons (on/off, bright/dim, color) on the lamp or wall switch you already have.\nMobile and Web Access: Everything the physical controls do and more! You are in control of how to start and live your day.\nSunrise alarm\nTime zone\nSchedule update\nRemote control\nColor temperature range\nWhat about data? At Ario, we believe the data Ario learns about you are yours! You can safely and securely access your data via your personal account to see how you are living and make daily adjustments to live healthier. \nOther cool stuff: Ario can help you prepare and recover from jet lag naturally. Ario is also compatible with other connected home devices and wearables. We would love to hear your thoughts on what you might want to connect with Ario, and the data it collects.\n                                          Science Behind Ario\nDecades of research from Harvard Medical School, NASA, and leading institutions around the world have revealed a great deal of information about how light impacts and regulates our health. We designed Ario based on this large body of knowledge and on recommendations of the National Institute of Health and American Medical Association. Here is a summary.\nOur body learns what time it is from light in our environment. Non-visual photoreceptors in our eyes, discovered fairly recently, are sensitive to changing levels of blue light from above. These receptors provide signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a tiny region located in the hypothalamus responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm, or body clock. This in turn influences the production of hormones regulating bodily process.\nToday\u2019s static artificial lights throw off our body clock by as much as three hours. While we don\u2019t perceive this directly, this changes the balance of our endocrine system, generally reducing levels of body process regulating hormones both day and night. These changes to our basic physiology affect our metabolism which in turn impacts our sleep, behavior, mood, and general health.\nMedical and lighting professionals recommend the following to promote healthy circadian rhythm, restful sleep, and overall well-being. Ario is designed to deliver what is recommended:  \nBlue-rich light from above stimulates cortisol production in the morning to synchronize circadian rhythm and awaken, and during the day to maintain alertness.\nAmber-toned light with very little blue and a relatively dark ceiling, at the end of the day. This makes it easier to relax and prepare the body for sleep by facilitating the release of the hormone melatonin which is inhibited by typical light exposure at night.\nExamples of Those Who Have Seen the Light\nNASA  Astronauts experience extreme light conditions in space, which result in circadian rhythm disruption. Over many years, NASA has learned how to use proper lighting to help astronauts compensate for significant changes in their sleep/wake cycles.\nSeattle Mariners  Recently, the Seattle Mariners redesigned their clubhouse, introducing a state-of-the-art lighting system. Players now use blue light to recover from jet lag and prepare for games and amber light to help them wind down and recover afterwards.\n                                                Our Innovation\nWe built Ario\u2019s patent-pending combination of features specifically and uniquely to support your body clock while providing beautiful light. We\u2019ve improved upon technology that has previously been complicated and expensive, making it available for personal use. By cloud-connecting Ario via WiFi, we enable a wide array of features that can grow over time.\nLight delivery: We provide a bright, 2400 lumens, wide color range for Ario, from 6500K blue-rich white light (mid-day sun), to 1800K amber white light (candle/fire light). We selected high-performance LEDs used in large volumes by the general lighting industry to keep costs low and use custom light sources for the low end of the color range.\nDirectional control: Ario has two light engines, a purpose-built and highly-integrated LED controller, and Particle P1 WiFi module which together provide Ario\u2019s lighting power and control. To get the most brightness while maintaining comfort, we\u2019ve carefully engineered efficient large diffusers and properly shaded them to reduce glare.\nAutonomous, easy control: Ario is equipped with a battery-backed real-time clock and program storage so it operates properly, and awakes after power-down knowing what color and direction are called for, even if your router or internet is down. Ario responds to buttons on the lamp, the switch on the wall, or remotely with your mobile phone, tablet, or computer.\nLearning algorithms: Over time, Ario safely and securely identifies patterns in how you use the lamp through machine learning and refines its schedule to deliver lighting specific to your needs. It does this using cloud computing as part of the Ario web service available from anywhere.\nEnergy-efficient and long-lasting: Since Ario is solid-state, it uses only 1/5 of the energy of equivalent incandescent lighting. Our LEDs are properly driven and heatsinked to deliver more than 35,000 hours of life. The power supply is sized for minimum quiescent power draw and maximum overall efficiency. To save power further, Ario may be turned off completely like any lamp and still delivers light color and direction appropriate to your saved schedule.\n                                                Ario Spec Sheet\n                                                     Team Ario\n                                                    Our Story\nWe started with a simple concept of improving people's health through lighting. We worked through countless research papers, development projects, prototypes, tests, and early marketing activities. We've received amazing encouragement and support along the way. Now we're ready to go to market and are asking for your help to gear up for manufacturing and development.\n                                                     Timeline\n                                                     Rewards\nRewards are explained on the right above.\nShipping cost will vary depending upon the location. Shipments within the US will be $25 and will vary anywhere else in the world. If we are not able to arrange shipping, we will reimburse contributors. VAT will need to be covered by the recipient.\nArio comes with a one-year limited liability warranty that protects you against manufacturing defects.\n                                                    Resources\nWe did a lot of research in the development of Ario.

You can track energy usage, see how much of a difference your changes are making, and compare your home\u2019s efficiency against similar homes. It\u2019s the first energy monitor that is compatible with natural gas, propane and oil heating systems.\nMeasure the results of your efficiency efforts & how much that\u2019s worth\nMonitor your carbon footprint\nReducing energy use and saving money as a bonus!\nSet energy goals and track your progress\nKnow when to get your heating system serviced (efficiency loss)\nAvoid getting surprised by high energy bills, by knowing every day\u2019s usage\nMonitor your tank level and make sure you never run out (for propane and oil systems)\nMonitor vacation homes remotely\nReceive alerts (text message or email) upon abnormal heating system operation (eg. it's below freezing outside and your heating system hasn't turned on for over 10 hours)\nThe HeatMeter sensor attaches to your furnace or boiler magnetically, like a refrigerator magnet. It detects when the flame in your heating system turns on and off. It sends this information over the internet through your home\u2019s WiFi connection, where it gets combined with some basic information about your home. When setting up your HeatMeter, you type in your home\u2019s square footage, zip code, and heating system model. This all gets processed and sent to your smartphone. You can also view this information from your computer.\nThe hardware does not interfere with the operation of your heating system. No electricians, plumbers or technicians are needed for installation.\nBelow is a video demonstration of the HeatMeter on an oil-fired boiler; the same method works with furnaces as as well, whether fired by oil, propane or gas.\nBecause of its ability to time the duration of the flame directly, the HeatMeter is much more accurate than smart thermostats, which only have one-way communication with the heating system. A thermostat can only know how long it commands the heating system to turn on, but can't know exactly how long the flame was on and how much fuel was consumed.\nMeasurement Accuracy Comparison:\nFor heating systems with furnaces:\nHeatMeter: within \u00b1 2.6% of actual\nSmart thermostat: within \u00b1 10.2% of actual\nFor heating systems with boilers:\nHeatMeter: within \u00b1 3.1% of actual\nSmart thermostat: greater than 50% error\nHardware:\nQuick and easy to set up\nHigh-strength magnets for easy, secure attachment\nCompatible with almost every furnace or boiler that runs on gas, propane or oil\nData is updated every time that the heating system turns on and off\n\u201cset-it-and-forget-it\u201d, no maintenance, no batteries to replace\nSensor dimensions: 4.41\u201d x 2.44\u201d x 1.25\u201d\nDurable, injection molded case\nManufactured in the USA\nSoftware:\nCloud-based interface; nothing to download or update\nMobile-optimized, works with apple, android and blackberry phones and tablets\nLogging Capabilities:\nThe HeatMeter sensor can log up to one month's worth of heating system operation (or 50,000 on/off cycles) in on-board memory, without a WiFi connection. It will then upload this data once it re-connects to WiFi. This is useful in case your home briefly loses internet connectivity; your data will not be lost.\nThe HeatMeter:                                             The T-Shirt:\n\u2022    HeatMeter sensor + power cable                 \u2022    XS, S, M, L, XL or XXL\n\u2022    Free monitoring for life\n\u2022    Free software upgrades for life\nWe live in the northeastern US, where an average home can pay over $2,500 per winter for heating. We wanted to lower our consumption, but saw that there was nothing out there for tracking energy the usage of oil, propane or natural gas systems.\nThe questions we wanted to answer:\nHow do I know that my consumption went down because of my own actions, or just because it was warmer outside today?\nAm I paying more for heating because my house is larger?\nOr, because I keep my house warmer?\nOr, because my house is older and less efficient?\nI know that adding insulation helps, but is it really worth the investment?\nWe noticed that our neighbors had the same problems. So we set out to create a tool that allowed people to make informed decisions on truly reducing their energy consumption, not just relying on guesswork and rules-of-thumb that are not very accurate (especially for engineering geeks like us). Tracking your progress and seeing your savings in real-time is a great motivator too.\nTeam Members:\nMarian Gogoana: electrical engineer with 30+ years of experience designing industrial automations controls.\nRadu Gogoana: mechanical engineer, specializing in thermal modeling and data analysis\nJim Whittaker: business development and strategy advisor, retired navy admiral, experience includes running a $20 million dollar private software company and managing automated warehouse systems.\nManufacturing plan:\n\nAs our 3rd generation HeatMeter sensor, we designed it for manufacturability from the start. Our plastic enclosure is injection-molded and what you see in the video are the final production parts, not prototypes. Our circuit board is designed from the start for automatic assembly and will be populated by a supplier we have worked with in the past.\n\nFulfillment plans: final major component assembly, packaging and order fulfillment is done from our company's facility in New Hampshire.\n\nPrevious manufacturing experience: Our team founded two companies, Yshape and Flex-In, which have supplied laminated catalogs for clients such as Ikea North America since 1999. We designed our own automated manufacturing equipment, and every sheet in every catalog has to leave our facility with no mistakes! Our experience in equipment design, manufacturing, quality control, supply chain management and order fulfillment carries over directly into this project.\nWe want to help reduce the amount of fossil fuels that are burned each year for residential heating (natural gas, oil and propane). Awareness inspires action, and we are now able to provide homeowners with key efficiency metrics that were previously very difficult to get. This allows people to make better decisions on improving their home, reducing their energy use and saving money as a bonus!\nStudies on the impact of energy monitors for electricity have shown a reduction of up to 17% across hundreds of homes, from homeowners simply being able to see a live dashboard of their energy consumption and tracking the impact of their behavior. The HeatMeter now makes this possible for oil, gas and propane heating.\nWe aim to reduce energy consumption in a way that\u2019s affordable, convenient and beneficial to everyone who has to pay the heating bill each month.

With a powerful computer and WiFi connectivity, there\u2019s no end to the ways the Light by Moore\u2019sCloud can work for you. It\u2019s the light you\u2019ll live your life by.\nBeneath its stylish exterior beats a smart heart - an embedded Linux computer. Light by Moore\u2019sCloud is more than just a lamp - it\u2019s a lamp with a LAMP stack! With the full Internet connectivity and power of Linux behind it, all sorts of amazing applications become possible.\nThe Light by Moore\u2019sCloud can respond to commands from a local smartphone, a tablet - and anything else with an HTML5-compliant browser, or respond to a computer on the other side of the world. The temperature in Vladivostok can alter the color of a Light in Santa Fe. \nCapture the color of a dress, a flower, or the sky with a smartphone camera, and the Light will immediately adjust itself to generate that color. Mood lighting has never been so easy, or so versatile.\nPrograms on other computers can also control the Light, via standard web protocols, through its REST-based interface.  This opens the door to \u2018Illumination-as-a-service\u2019.  This makes the Light a fantastic status indicator:  are my servers still running?  Has my build failed?  Look into the Light and you\u2019ll have an answer.\nGo further - stream a continuously changing set of colors to the Light.  Synchronize with a broadcast to add dramatic lighting to a scary movie, or build it into a children\u2019s e-book, so that as they follow the text, the lighting adapts, to accentuate the story.  DJs can broadcast \u2018party lighting\u2019 to go along with their dance sets.\nThe Light by Moore\u2019sCloud can talk to other devices - other Lights, or pretty much anything else on the Internet.  We are seeking integration with LIFX, SmartThings, Ubi and Ninja Blocks and should be able to integrate with most open automation software.  This means Lights can act in concert, coordinating their activities.  For example, if you wake up in the middle of the night and tap on your bedside Light, it can tell the other Lights in your house to light up, creating a \u2018landing strip\u2019 that will help you find your way around.\nThe Light by Moore\u2019sCloud has the power to display beautiful, evocative animations - candles and flames, fireworks and rainbows - each sweep their way through the Light in a play of color that will delight and mesmerize. \nWe want everyone to sculpt with light, and to enable that, we\u2019ve created a software platform - WuVoxels - that allows anyone with modest programming experience (today in \u2018C\u2019, soon, Python) to create their own procedural animations.  Everyone, regardless of experience, will be able to use Moore\u2019sCloud Studio, browser-based animation software that will ship with the Light. \nWe\u2019ve built an accelerometer into the Light by Moore\u2019sCloud, so it knows when it\u2019s touched.  You don\u2019t need to fumble for the switch in the middle of the night, just a tap will activate the Light. Spin the Light in your hands and watch the colors change, and use the sensor to create your own games and applications.  \nThe Light by Moore\u2019sCloud has a range of apps and animations that you can access through a smartphone-like interface.  Search for more apps, install, configure, and manage them all from a browser.  \nSet a timer, and the Light will fade to black at the end of a long day; set an alarm and it can wake you with gentle light. Dial into \u2018mood channels\u2019 that lighten your spirit with a play of light.  Stream from your favorite music app (with an appropriate plug-in) and create your own light show.  \nOutside the home, a boutique can tune its lighting to match the time of day, the fashions, or the decor.  A nightclub or cafe can establish or change ambiance instantly.\nThe commercial applications for the Light by Moore\u2019sCloud are just as numerous: as a \u2018dashboard\u2019 to warn of emerging problems; as a signal to indicate failure of a build, a server, or a connection, etc...  \nIn November, we integrated the Light by Moore'sCloud with Atlassian Bamboo, a continuous integration & deployment package used by software development teams around the world. A distributed development team can now be informed of the status of the build - with a glance at the Light:\nWe've added a new feature to the Light by Moore'sCloud - battery power! Just pull the plug and get up to four hours of brilliant illumination - perfect for games, events, anywhere you want beautiful, intelligent light.\nWe keep inventing interesting applications for the Light by Moore\u2019sCloud, and there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll be able to create all of them ourselves. We see the Light as a platform that enables people to make amazing applications.  Our job is to develop the platform, so that you can have fun with it.\nMoore\u2019sCloud Light contains an embedded computer running Arch Linux, so all of the great tools and services you expect to make development easy - Apache, Python, ssh, the GNU toolchain, and everything else - are available.\nWe believe in openness.  All of our work - both hardware and software - everything from PCB layout to case design to the electrical schematic to animation framework, system software and firmware  - is already being released under open source licenses.  (Creative Commons for the hardware, MIT License for the software.)  We want the community to take our work and build upon it - without limits.\nIf you'd like to build your own Light, we've already published everything you need to know to DIY. Just visit our dev blog, grab a soldering iron, and get started!\nOur commitment to openness extends beyond hardware and software.  We are documenting our process - at blog.moorescloud.com - from conception, through execution, and into what we hope will be success - so that others who want to launch their own Kickstarters can look at what we\u2019ve done, how and why we\u2019ve done it, and learn from both our successes and mistakes.  We promise to keep you well-informed during the entire process, from Kickstarter to delivery. \nWe've taken all of the financial models used to develop our funding needs - which drive the revenue projections for our Kickstarter campaign - and have made them available for your review, beginning with an article on our blog, exploring our budget in detail. We invite you to read By The Numbers to learn about how your money will be spent. You have a right to know. \nWe have prepared three versions of the financial projections, available in Open Office, Microsoft Excel, and PDF formats. The Open Office and MS Excel spreadsheets are more fun, because they allow you to \u2018run the numbers\u2019. Download them and have a play!\nThere's still a lot of software that needs to be written to make the Light by Moore\u2019sCloud both functional and a pleasure to use. We're developing the kinds of UX and UI needed to talk to a whole household or workspace of connected devices. (Our preliminary design is pictured below.) It's a big task, one we know will only be partially complete by the time we ship our first Lights.  We'll ship useful software, but it won't be as beautiful as we really want - that takes time, testing and lots of feedback.\nWe invite you to join us on our development blog - dev.moorescloud.com - where you can participate in the development and design of all aspects of the Light.  Even if you're not particularly technical, your ideas and imagination will help us along. With your input, we can make a better Light.\nMaking a beautiful, useable and durable piece of consumer electronics contains plenty of traps for the unwary. Several members of the Moore\u2019sCloud team have experience in consumer electronics design and manufacture, and we have partnered with internationally renowned industrial and manufacturing designers Tiller Design to develop a product that is both eye-catching and manufacturable.  We are ready to initiate the manufacturing engineering process - taking our prototype and turning it into a mass-manufacturable design - as soon as we reach our Kickstarter goal.  With Tiller Design\u2019s strong commitment to ISO 31000 risk assessment &  ISO 9001 quality control, we have the processes in place to ensure that we deliver the Light by Moore\u2019sCloud on schedule.\nDimensions: 150mm x 150mm x 135mm \n(roughly 6\u201d on a side)\nPower: 5VDC, 3A (power supply included)\nBattery power: 4xAA NiMH (batteries not included)\nIllumination: 52 full-color LEDs (7 bits each of R, G, and B):\n9 LEDs on each outer face in 3x3 array\n4 LEDs on each inner face in 2x2 array\nProcessor: Freescale iMX233 @ 454 Mhz\nMemory: 64MB DDR SDRAM\nStorage: 2GB microSD\nAccelerometer: Freescale MMA7660\nWiFi: Nano USB 802.11 b/g/n (replaceable)\nAccess to I2C and serial connections for hardware extensibility\nOperating System: Arch Linux 2.6.x (hopefully 3.7 by release)\nGNU toolchain, Apache, sshd, Python 2.7.x\nOther Arch packages can be installed by you.\nSoftware:\n- WuVoxels animation libraries (both 'C' and Python);\n- 'Sing', a Processing-like framework for animations;\n- Moore\u2019sCloud Control, a web framework for connected devices, providing rich interactivity from the browser;\n- Moore\u2019sCloud Studio, an easy-to-use browser-based tool for creating rich and beautiful animations;\n- Lots of examples in 'C', Python, and HTML5.\nYou can get more information about the technology behind the Light by Moore'sCloud on our development blog - dev.moorescloud.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGetting the product ready, designed and shipped.

In Spain the housing market went sideways. The predatory nature of the country's mortgage industry finally showed through. In Greece the financial meltdown of the continent, was the straw that broke the camels back. Crisis soon came to be the word on the tip of every commentator's tongue. \nSince 2008 there has been a constant race in mainstream media to assert blame and victimize. Pundits have a tendency to reduce the word, crisis, into a simplified notion of a fixable phenomenon. There is a hope that if economies are made more \"efficient\", further crises can be averted. So while the economic disparity between those that have too much and those that have too little continues to grow, the very structural components that guarantee this disparity are privileged in the hope of salvation.  De-regulation, privatization, and the liberalization of the labor market were the same economic and social forces that devastated local economies globally.   \nThere is an alternative understanding of this crisis that unfortunately gets very little air time in mainstream media. This understanding reveals the present situation as not an individual historic event: a crisis with a single cause, and a solution. Rather, crisis has become a paradoxical state of being. It is a state of being defined by it's simultaneous hopelessness and resistance, abandon and renewal, victimization and solidarity. In some parts of Europe this state of being; is the new dominant economic/social paradigm. Rather than a blip in the history of capitalist economies, it is the natural development of international capitalism.\nHelp me document this alternative and seemingly hidden vision of crisis. \nThe Project.\nFor this project I've chosen to document, through photography, two different European communities living the same crisis. Athens, Greece, is often understood as the focal point for the outbreak of the crisis in Europe. L'Hospitalet, Spain, is one of many ground zeros for the Spanish mortgage disaster. For the last 6 months I've been researching and shooting in l'Hospitalet.  I've also made two short trips to Athens. But in order to complete the story I need to return to the Greek capitol, for the month of November 2012. With your help, in Athens I will mirror the work I've already completed in l'Hospitalet. \nThe final product of this project will be a photo-reportage made up of portraits, details, landscapes, and text. It will compare the experience of crisis in both communities. I posit that the only solution to crisis is one constructed from within the lived crisis itself. I believe documentation is the first step towards to supporting this construction. \nWhen I am finished I will do an exhibition in both l'Hospitalet and Athens, sharing my work with the very communities I documented.  The exhibitions will be followed by an open discussion that seeks debate, input, and feedback from all those participating in the project.  \nMy research and photography in l'Hospitalet has been made possible through the generous collaboration of the neighborhood association of Sant Josep, and various other individuals. In Athens I have already developed a list of contacts. As a result I believe I am well positioned to finish the story. \nDue to the incredible importance of the European Union for the global economy, I believe this story is both of news relevance and documentary importance.   It is my intention to seek the publication of at least one series of photos or an article from the project. \nGuiding Questions.\nWhat do people hold on to when they realize they've been living in a collective dream? What happens to people in the transition from stability to constant uncertainty? How does one navigate the architectures of exclusion? How does one look forward when society seems to be moving backwards? Where does one find pride in abandon? How is the human condition defined by our conceptions of solidarity and fraternity? \nThese are some of the questions that guide my work as a journalist in the communities I've decided to document.\nWhy Wil Sands?\nFor the last 10 years I've lived in Barcelona and been an active participant in a variety of different social movements. Moreover, I have been fortunate to travel widely and frequently.   As a photographer I am particularly interested in stories that complicate dominant public discourses.  As a writer, I find I do my most powerful storytelling when I'm passionate about the subject matter.  Participating in local social/political movements, I've witnessed first hand the popular response to crisis.   The close personal relationships I've developed gives me a unique access and perspective that are visible in the project. \nFor more information about me, please read the bio in the sidebar. \nTo see examples of my work please visit the following links-  \nWilliam Sands                                                                                                 Fractures Photo                                                                                                 Pulitzer Center\nFunding Breakdown:\nTravel expenses (roundtrip ticket from Barcelona to Athens)-                  250 euros\n\nDaily expenses (food, communication, transportation)- 70 euros x 30 days 2100 euros\n\nLodging expenses- 70 euros x 30 days                                                   2100 euros\n\nRewards costs-                                                                                         500 euros\n\nStringer, Translator expenses                                                                        600 euros\nTotal:   \n5,550.00 Euros = 7,100.00 Dollars   \nRewards.\nWhile I know that the majority of you will support this project for its merit, I'm really happy to offer a complete set of valuable rewards.

The tickets have been purchased and the reservations have been made. I fly into Athens next Thursday, the 15th. I've rented a relatively cheap apartment just a block from Syntagma Square (where the Greek Parliament is located). Preparing for the trip and refining the project, I've decided to focus my time in Greece on visually exploring the impact of the crisis on the healthcare system. Recent articles in the international press have raised serious concerns about the state of Greece's public healthcare system. For example AIDS/HIV transmission among intravenous drug users has gone up more than a 1,000% in recent years. Austerity measures have all but gutted publicly subsidized harm reduction programs. In a another example of the economic crisis' impact on public healthcare, many pharmacies have begun rejecting prescriptions fulfillments for patients using the public system. Pharmacists argue it has been months since they've been paid for the prescription medicine they've sold. Many have seen their businesses severely affected by the cuts in public funding for prescription medicine. I'm interested in developing a story about those doctors and patients that are on the frontline of this collapse.

My work in Barcelona continues to develop and the relationship I have with my contacts is advancing. Unfortunately the situation in Barcelona, and Spain as a whole, is increasingly bleak. More and more families are finding themselves homeless or dependent on food banks.

That's why SmartThings will be a completely open platform. Our core mission for SmartApps is to enable developers to unleash their creativity in the real world just as easily as they have been able to on the web and mobile devices.\nThere are two paths to creating new SmartApps. Basic, and Advanced.\nAt the Basic level, you can generate new SmartApps using a web based interface with full access to existing triggers and available actions within the SmartThings cloud.\nAt the Advanced level, we are creating and exposing an SDK for the physical world of non-smart devices \u2014 enabling them to plug into the digital one and become smart.\nWe give your front door an API. We give your bed an API. We give your toilet an API... your imagination is the only limit.\nWe are working hard to make sure that our APIs are both straightforward and secure. You can use your preferred development language and tools to do amazing things with the physical graph that SmartThings is bringing online.\nWe are ready to integrate with all of your favorite web services.\nThe uses are endless, so don\u2019t be shy. Let\u2019s work together to make the physical world smarter.\nA SPECIAL NOTE FOR MAKERS\nWe\u2019ve got dozens of ideas to share for how to make our lives smarter, but we're also eager to hear yours. Tell us about them in the Comments section.\nBut, if you\u2019re handy with a soldering iron, know that a breadboard isn\u2019t just for cutting Rye, can casually slip Arduino into daily conversation, and are ready to hack your own physical world, we\u2019re ready to support you.  For you makers and open hardware buffs, we\u2019ve got:\nSmartThings ThingModule - add cloud intelligence to any device\nSmartThings ThingShield and Sketch for Arduino - make your existing project smarter\nSmartThings Software Development Kit (SDK) - develop SmartThings-friendly software\nCloud Platform API - integrate your device or app directly with SmartThings\nMobile App Extension Template - embed controls for your project in the SmartThings mobile app\nTell us about your project and we\u2019ll help you bring it to the world.\nPROJECT TIMELINE\nWe currently have working prototypes of the key hardware and software components of the SmartThings Packs that you are backing as part of this Kickstarter project, including the hub, end-devices, maker tools, cloud platform, and mobile app.\nHere is our timeline for putting SmartThings into your hands:\nSEPTEMBER \nFinal stage of design and certification process for SmartThings Hub, Packs, and Maker tools\nOCTOBER\nCertification completed for SmartThings Packs\nInjection molding and final packaging design\nNOVEMBER\nVolume manufacturing of SmartThings Packs (Hubs and Things)\nDECEMBER\nDistribution - Kickstarter backers get their SmartThings Packs \nSDK ready for Developers and Makers\nSmartThings Mobile App available including SmartApps\nMEET THE FOUNDERS\nThe SmartThings founders share a vision: A product experience that is beautiful, functional, fast and revolutionary. We can\u2019t wait to get SmartThings into your hands. Reach out to us in the Comments section if you want to speak with any of us directly.\nAlex Hawkinson\nAndrew Brooks\nBen Edwards\nJames Stolp\nJeff Hagins\nJesse O\u2019Neill-Oine\nScott Vlaminck\nHISTORY AND EVOLUTION\nThere were two major \u201caha moments\u201d that inspired us to develop SmartThings.\nLike most innovation, SmartThings started with a flooded basement. During a power outage, the pipes at Alex\u2019s cabin froze and burst, flooding the basement. In looking for options to get notified about temperature drops and flooding, it became clear that available solutions required a separate Internet connection. Even if the cabin had one, it would have shut off in the power outage.\nSo the concept of \u2018it just works\u2019 for SmartThings was born. We built a platform that easily connects everyday things to the Internet. Our vision is to include always-on cellular connectivity in every SmartThings Hub, so you just take it out of the box, plug it in, and it\u2019s connected. Even better, when you buy new devices, what we call Things, from the ThingStore, they\u2019ll be pre-assigned to your SmartThings Hub. Plug them in or turn them on, they show up in the app, and you\u2019re immediately in control.\nOur real inspiration came when we realized how intelligent everything in our lives could become through the power of computing in the cloud - SmartApps were born. Installing applications into your real life should be as easy as it is on your phone. SmartApps let you combine schedules, events, notifications, information from the Internet and many sensors and devices to create useful solutions that make life easier and more fun.\nTHANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Update 41: SmartThings + __________ = Even Smarter Homes", "update_content": "SmartThings Blog Launched\nWe've created a resource that helps to explain who we are, what we're doing, and why it's important.

Based on the need to interact with devices and poll devices, there are scenarios where we can exceed that limitation. This is core functionality, so we\u2019re evaluating either firmware modifications to dynamically address and throttle the polling and radio, or fixed strategies to reduce our polling frequency based on device type and other variables.

Check out SmartThings here. ***\nNew Video: Ubi & SmartThings\nUbi - Always on. Always ready to help.\nUbi is a voice-activated computer that plugs into a wall outlet. You talk to the Ubi and it talks back. It directly connects to the Internet through wifi.\n\"Look ma, no hands!\"\nWe believe people want to do things when they're at home - they clean, they fold laundry, they cook, they eat, they spend time with loved ones. These are all things that (for the most part) take up use of our arms and hands. When we're at home, we'd rather use our limbs for other activities than typing, scrolling, or swiping.\nUbi is short for ubiquitous computer because it's always on, always listening, always ready to help. It can scribe, listen, analyze. Ubi will either talk back to you the information you seek or indicate information through multi-color lights. \nUbi listens to its environment and senses it through sound, temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. It can record this information or use it to trigger events and communication.  \nWhat can it do? \nUbi can be used for potentially hundreds of applications. The applications we plan to ship with the Ubi are:\nVoice-enabled Internet search \nSpeakerphone \nIndicator light (light changing based on events, e.g. weather, stock, email) \nHome speaker system with sound piping \nVirtual assistant (audio calendar, feed reader, podcast etc) \nVoice memos \nAlarm clock \nIntercom system \nBaby monitor \nNoise pollution monitor \nControlling the climate of your home perfectly (through web enabled thermostats like Nest)\nA Helping Hand\nWe see a huge potential for Ubi to assist those who have visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. With its indicator lights and talk-to-activate functionality, Ubi is super simple to setup and use. We want the Ubi to make it easier for our parents and loved ones to stay connected with us and the world. \nYour Kickstarter Contribution \nWe're serious about making this technology of our dreams easily available to everyone. Your Kickstarter contribution is going to allow us to get safety approval (FCC and CE) so that it can be used everywhere. It will also help driving down the cost of making the Ubi so that everyone can afford at least one.  In a nutshell, your contribution will:\nAllow us to meet regulatory approval\nGet our first production run in place (tooling, machining, and chip printing - we are working with local firms who are very talented)\nAllow us to complete the initial apps we're going to deliver with the Ubi\nRewards\nEach Ubi reward above the $1 level comes with one Ubi unit that has wifi and a slew of other functionality. It also includes the Ubi web, iPhone and Android app and access to the Ubi portal to monitor and setup the Ubi remotely. You'll also get early access to the API.  \nUbi is available in arctic white or midnight black. Please specify which is your preference when you back the project.\n$1 - Access to backer-only updates and early offers when product is launched    \n$149 - Early backers - 1 Ubi (limited to first 100)\n$189 - Single Ubi \n$349 - Two Ubis \n$479 - Three-pack of Ubis \n$649 - Five-pack of Ubis\nNEW! - $1249 - The Inner Sanctum - The Ubi 10-pack and much more\nHow it works \nUbi plugs into a wall outlet and accesses the Internet through a wifi connection. It has a microphone and speakers and listens for commands. Saying \"Ubi\" wakes up the Ubi for receiving verbal commands. You can then instruct the Ubi to do your bidding. Ubi will receive plain language commands. Ubi communicates back to you through speech or by using lights.\nOnboard the Ubi are sensors to monitor your environment: \n\nTemperature\nHumidity\nAir pressure\nAmbient light\nThis data can be stored online or used to trigger alerts to your mobile device or email. \nThe Ubi runs Android with a powerful processor to perform voice recognition and also has the ability to connect to other devices. You can plug in speakers, USB drives, or connect through Bluetooth directly to your iPhone or Android device. For developers, you can also communicate with potentially thousands of devices (through RF, wifi, or Bluetooth) and we're making the device open so peripherals and other applications can be used with it. \nTechnical Specs on the Ubi \nAndroid 4.1 Jelly Bean \n800 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 Processor\n1 GB RAM \n802.11 b/n/g Wifi Enabled (WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption)\nHi fidelity speakers and omni-directional microphone \nUSB 2.0 with 5 V power supply \nBluetooth 4.0 \nTemperature, humidity, and air pressure sensors \nAmbient light sensor \nRF Transceiver Module \nPlugs into a standard NA 110 V, 15A power outlet (world versions to be forth-coming)  UPDATE: NA two-prong plug, but 100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz support! UPDATE #2: worldwide plug support available!\nDimensions (approximate): 4.0\" x 4.0\" x 1.1\"\nWhere We're At \nWe've been working for over ten months on the concept, design, and prototyping of the Ubi and we're now at a point where we're ready to bring it to the Kickstarter community. We've also built an early working prototype and have been refining the design to make it more compact and easier to use. We've been in contact with manufacturers and suppliers and have spec'ed out the costs for bringing the Ubi to market. Ubi is currently slated to work in English with North American voltages. We hope to expand this to other regions and languages. \nWe're working with local and overseas suppliers for sourcing the Ubi's electronics and plan on completing the machining, assembly, testing and certification of the Ubi in the Toronto area. We've also worked with certification authorities for pricing of safety and communication testing of the Ubi and inspection will be completed at the final point of assembly.\nOur team is experienced in working on dozens of projects for engineering research institutions. All of our team members have engineering backgrounds and have delivered on real engineering projects in the past.\nSample Data from the Ubi \nBelow is an example of some of the data that will be available from the Ubi as it monitors different aspects of its surrounding environment. The Ubi can constantly monitor your home to provide triggers or feedback. \n    Special Thanks and More\nThanks to all of our backers for helping us get this exciting project off the ground! We'd also like to thank the other Kickstarter projects that have inspired us like Twine, t\u014dd and Pebble.   \nA HUGE thanks goes to our extremely talented friend, Joe Sarafian, of RapidParts.ca for his help in creating our Ubi prototype. \nA special thanks also goes out to El Cantador for allowing us to use their music in our Kickstarter video.

Support for iPhone will trail Android by ~2 months.\nUpdate 3:  Data Sharing Apps/Pachube Support\nSensordrone is an open platform for all kinds of sensor and bluetooth peripheral device apps. Every app shown in this project will be available for free. Many new apps are under development, like data sharing apps so you can combine sensor data with smartphone capabilities and share on Google+, Facebook, etc. Support will be available for data recording sites like Pachube.\nUpdate 4:  Expansion Modules - Connect Anything to Sensordrone\nConnect to a printer or another wild idea you have!  New rewards include ambient CO2, pH & Dissolved Oxygen expansion modules.\nPeople Sense the Possibilities of Sensordrone!\nAndroid Police - \"...mind-blowing...applications of Sensordrone are simply astounding\"\nEngadget  - \"...slightly Star Trek, with the device connecting across Bluetooth to share a wealth of data on what's going on around you\"\nFast Company - \"Flash forward a few years and imagine millions of people carrying around tiny but powerful sensing units like these. People will then be able to join networks of individuals who share and/or sell their sensing data.\"\nGeek  - \"Sensordrone really looks like an incredible gadget, and clearly something that takes us one step closer to having a Tricorder for your mobile device\"\nGuyism - \"They even use the Star Trek font and refer to the Tricorder. NEEEEEEEERDSSSSS!... It\u2019s actually pretty useful, a kind of technological Swiss Army knife.\"\nMashable - \"...Tricorders don't exist quite yet, but the Sensordrone currently on Kickstarter is a step in the right direction\"\nOhGizmo! - \"Yeah, we\u2019re getting into Star Trek Tricorder territory here, and we\u2019re pretty excited...\"\nTechSpot - \"...the Sensordrone is a Swiss Army Knife of environmental input\"\nTreeHugger - \"For years, scientists have talked about putting sensors into cell phones to be able to collect environmental data...it's not so easy. At least not until now.\"\nSensordrone Lets You Run Hundreds of Previously Impossible Sensor Apps\nSensordrone can fit on your keychain, monitor your environment, and talk with your smartphone via Bluetooth.  Sensordrone already includes more sensors than anything else available, so you can run hundreds of new apps.  Apps that are surprisingly useful in your daily life, fun apps, scientific apps, and more.  \nHere are just a few examples.\nIf you have a Sensordrone, you can run apps like these.\n__________________________________________________________\nDesigned to be Simple\nEverything is included in the Sensordrone's sleek & compact metal/plastic housing.  No configuration is required. Just run an app, and it works. There are no switches or dials to adjust. You don't have to buy new sensors to do anything shown in the video. Just run an app. Truly a major extension of your mobile device, everything is controlled by the app. Here are just 6 apps that we're already running with our Sensordrones.\nIf you have a Sensordrone, you'll also be able to run apps like these.  In addition, there are plenty more in development, by us and independent developers. More developers are welcome and will be supported.\nSensors to Make Your Life Better\nSensordrone is a sensor computer. \nJust like a computer can run many different applications, Sensordrone can run many sensor applications. And, just like the best computers using the best processors, we put the best sensors available into Sensordrone, including our own sensors.\nIf you have a Sensordrone, you can run apps on your tablet or smartphone to monitor carbon monoxide and air quality, find gas leaks, measure your child's temperature, log the weather, and much more.  \nFor example, appsusing the capacitance sensor can work as a stud finder, a proximity monitor, or a liquid level monitor.  Apps using the pressure sensor can work as a barometer, an altimeter, calculate elevation differences so you can measure the height of a building, be hooked up to a pressure cuff to work as a blood pressure monitor, and more. Humidity sensing is not just for weather, it determines comfort level for infants, finds the optimum conditions for storing foods, and could even help prevent mold from growing in your home\nSensordrone makes any sensor application as easy as running an app!\nIf you've ever wanted a Tricorder like in Star Trek, this is a step in that direction.  If you join the Sensor revolution, this is how your smartphone can look soon.\nAdvanced Sensor Apps\nIts only limit is your imagination.\nMore Than Just Data \nThe sensors in Sensordrone don't just give you data, they guide you to smart decisions. Sensor apps will teach you, help you, and guide you. You'll be informed enough to demand action. For example, the carbon monoxide sensor will measure carbon monoxide, but combine that with an Air Quality Index guide, and you'll get much more information than just a number.\nCarbon Monoxide Air Quality Monitor + Guide\n___________________________________________________\nConnect & Share\nThe Sensordrone can give you data anywhere you go.  Maybe you'll find a gas leak or a polluted area and want to share that information with your colleagues. Maybe you'll use it as a breathalyzer after having too many drinks and it will automatically have your phone call a designated driver.  Since the Sensordrone is essentially an extension of your internet connected smartphone or tablet, you can easily share vital data via your preferred web service. This includes Twitter, Facebook, sensor sites like Pachube, and much more.\nShare your data!\n____________________________________________________\n3 Modes of Operation:\nYou'll have full control over the Sensordrone, like LED colors and timing, which sensors are on, how often to collect data, and when to transmit the data. \n1.  Call-Respond Mode - (just give me the most recent data now).\n2.  Streaming Mode - (keep sending real-time data.)\n3.  Data Logging Mode - (store data in memory until called upon, then download and export to a .csv file)\nData logging mode - record and export weather or any other sensor data you want to gather\nState of the Art - Nothing Else Comes Close\nWho Are We?\nWe are Sensorcon. We develop and make Sensors. Sensors are our passion. Sensors are our life. We are not sensor hobbyists, we are sensor fanatics!\nSensorcon\nhttp://www.sensorcon.com/sensordrone/\nWe created the Sensordrone because it is what we wanted, a single device that can replace many others. We started out doing sensor R&D for DARPA at MIT, and now we are a small manufacturer producing toxic gas monitors in the heart of the rust belt. By using our own sensor technologies combined with the latest other sensors/chips available, we've created a product that is much smaller and more integrated than anything ever offered in the consumer electronics market. \nUncut/the future of Sensordrone\n***Attention*** Unlike the main video, these are just unedited explanations by our team.  Sorry, no special effects here, just our random thoughts. \nMark W. - Chief Dreamer (a.k.a. Mr. Feature Creep)\n.\nBen M. - Super Engineer (a.k.a. The Beard)\n.\nMark R. - PhD (a.k.a. Overqualified)\n.\nBrian C. - Software Guy (a.k.a. Canadian Exile) \nOpen Source Software:\nHardware is very expensive to develop. So we're making the Sensordrone's application level software open source so anybody can combine a suite of new sensors with powerful mobile devices to create great new apps. An API & sample code will be made available.\nWe are currently offering Android compatibility, but if this project is successful, we will port to iOS and Blackberry platforms, and possibly Windows.\nOne Device...Endless Possibilities\nApplication examples:\nAir quality\nBreath alcohol\nColor matching\nNon-contact thermometer\nWeather monitoring\nCrowd sourced Sensor Data\nGames (totally new concepts)\nFlatulence (use gas sensors for both serious and not so serious measurements) \nTotally new applications/Multi-sensor mayhem!\nTechnical Details:\nThe Sensordrone has all the sensors your phone doesn't have.  It is meant to extend your mobile devices capabilities, not duplicate them (so we didn't include motion or magnetic sensors which are common in phones/tablets)\nIncluded Sensors\nPrecision Electrochemical Gas Sensor - Calibrated for Carbon Monoxide (Also can be used for precision measurements of Alcohol, Hydrogen, and others)\nGas Sensor for Oxidizing Gases - MOS type for Chlorine, Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, etc.\nGas Sensor for Reducing Gases - (MOS type for methane, Propane, alcohols, other hydrocarbons, etc.)\nTemperature - Simple resistance temperature sensor type\nHumidity\nPressure - can be used for Barometer, Altimeter, Blood Pressure, etc.\nNon-Contact Thermometer - Infrared sensor for scanning object temperature\nProximity Capacitance - fluid level, intrusion detection, stud finder & more applications\nRed Color Intensity\nGreen Color Intensity \nBlue Color Intensity\nIllumination - combine RGB & illumination for color matching\nDigital & Analog Interface - Expansion connector for connecting anything you want to your mobile device through the Sensordrone\nExpandable!\nAnybody can connect any device/hardware project to the Sensordrone via a standard 0.1\u201d pitch header, supports digital (RS-232, I2C) and analog signals. This makes Sensordrone an \"Easy Bluetooth Interface\" for your project. First for Android, then for iOS and other platforms.  We're making external expansion modules that will connect to the expansion connector.  To give you a sneak peak, one expansion module we're working on is a complete air quality monitor for precision measurements of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) & Ozone (O3).\nSensordrone Interface Pin-Out\nEasy Bluetooth Interface for Your Project\n____________________________________________________________\nA Sensor Revolution!\nThe government can tell you that the air quality is good based on data collected at their monitoring stations, but unless you live next to such a station, they can't tell you what the air quality is where you live. The air quality where you are may be very different, especially if you're near a highway, an industrial facility, or even just in a parking garage. \nCrowd sourced data from Sensordrone users can dramatically expand the existing pollution/Air quality and weather station network, potentially leading to improved health and better weather forecasting. \nCompare the official Air Quality Index network for Carbon Monoxide in New York State (~10) vs. what a Sensordrone network could be (1,000s+).  \n                                 VS.\nThis is what happens when you de-centralize data and put it in the hands of the people. \nUnbelievably Small Design...\nAll the sensors are enclosed in a unique, fully custom plastic & metal housing. The Sensordrone is the \"swiss army knife\" of sensors.  It's so small, and light, you can carry it everywhere, on your keychain, or perhaps on a necklace...\n _____________________________________________________________\nWorld's 1st Practical Tricorder (with your help)\nMonitor everything, everywhere.  This is real, this is ready, this is the Sensordrone, by backing us you'll become part of the movement, and help us move into full production and develop many more apps and external expansion modules.\nDesigned AND Made in the USA\nUnlike many others, you won't hear us complaining about how difficult it is to manufacture in the USA, we already do, and we're doing so in the rust-belt.  \nThe Sensordrone was designed by engineers from Buffalo & Toronto.

This app will give you direct access to:\nAlerts\nGraphing\nData collection \nThis app will be available for most computers (PC, Mac) and mobile devices (iPhone, Android).  Knut uses email technology to send and receive data. This allows Knut to have great battery life and will never require subscription fees.  To be clear, you will not be bombarded by emails.\nSetup Up Is Simple\nYou can set up Knut using the Knut Interface app or a web page stored in Knut. There you can:\nGive your Knut a name\nAssign your Knut an email address\nSet how frequently your Knut checks its sensors (Time critical sensors such as accelerometers and switches are checked whenever they change)\nChoose acceptable ranges for every sensor connected\nSelect your notification preferences (If you would like to receive an email or text message alert if a sensor goes out of the acceptable range)\nHow It Works\nKnut spends the majority of the time asleep.  Every so often, Knut wakes up, checks and then records the status of all connected sensors.  When the memory in Knut is full, Knut sends its recorded information to a designated email address. \n\nThe Knut Interface app periodically checks this email address and stores this data on the computer/mobile device. \n\nWhen the you would like to see the status of a sensor, the app loads the information which is stored on your device. Because this is simply a system of sending and receiving emails, multiple Knuts and Knut Interfaces can be associated with the same email address.  \n\nWhen the Knut Interface is used on a desktop computer, the Knut Interface can export a spreadsheet file (.CSV) so you can work with this data in any spreadsheet application.\nWhat Knut Can Monitor\nKnut has a high accuracy temperature sensor and a battery level sensor built in. If you want to monitor more than just temperature, you can connect an external sensor or multiple sensors using the 3-port hub. Currently we have functional humidity, vibration, door, water proof temperature, and water presence sensors.  \n\nWe plan to offer more sensors based on your suggestions. If we don't offer the sensor you need, you can always hook up your own sensor using the breakout board.\nOur Plan\nAfter 3 years of development and 5 complete redesigns, Knut is almost ready for you. Our shortcoming is our interface applications - and this is where we need your help. We have a functional and almost final iPhone application and other Android and Windows based applications are in the pipeline.\nSo, Kickstarters, we need your help to make our vision reality. \nWith your help, we will:\nBuy raw materials \nHire programmers\nHire a human computer interface specialist\nFinish Android and Windows applications\nTake your input and build a better product\nGet this product into your hands\nProvide basic technical support\nCurrently, we possess a laser cutter and a pick and place machine. For our prototypes, we have our blank circuit boards made in Oregon and our cases made in California. We cut the necessary holes in our cases with the laser cutter and place the components on bare circuit boards with the pick and place machine. It's a fast and straightforward manufacturing process.\n\nBecause of Jay's involvement with sales of electronics, he has extensive experience managing shipment of thousands of items on a daily basis. He also has many close connections with electronic component distributors worldwide, giving us direct access to hard to find and long lead time components. \nWe think we have a decent manufacturing capability. So, for orders of fewer than 300 Knuts, we will manufacture in-house, at our shop in Boston, MA.  We can build up to 30 Knuts in a day, so it would take no more than two weeks for us to manufacture the entire order. For larger orders, we will contract with a Massachusetts-based manufacturer.\nWho We Are\nJay graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a degree in Operations Management and went to work in sales in the electronics industry. Jay has always been interested in building things by hand.\nAfter studying Electrical Engineering for two years at Northeastern University, Richard left to start an aquarium construction and maintenance company. \nRichard landed a job maintaining the aquarium at Jay's office. They became friends and soon found themselves building a very large aquarium together.  This aquarium, with its multiple lighting systems, automatic water changing system, flow switches, water level detection, battery backups, and myriad other features required some kind of control system. They looked for off the shelf solutions, and when they realized that what they needed didn't exist, they built it: a fully automated multi-sensor aquarium controller.\nAfter this controller was built, a friend inquired about a method to monitor the temperature of multiple apartments in a condominium complex. Richard realized that this aquarium controller could be easily adapted for his friend's needs as well as an endless array of other applications. The result is Knut.\nKnut Spec Sheet\nWe want to ship a product that we can call complete.  For the technically inclined individual who really wants to know the capabilities of Knut, we have written out a spec sheet.  This spec sheet outlines what will be supported in the release of this product. Most of the specifications in this sheet are already functional so it is likely that additional sensors and features will be added to Knut by the time we ship.  These additional items may or may not be completely functional.\nDimensions: 2.6\" x 1.6\" x 1.1\" / 66mm x 41mm x 28mm\nKnut Interface App:\nKnut can be setup and monitored using the \"Knut Interface\". The Knut interface is available on Windows, Mac OS X, iOS (iPhone, iPod, iPad), Android and Windows Mobile. \nKnut Interface supports:\nSetup of Knut\nSetup of Alerts from Knut\nAutomatic graphing of data from sensors connected to Knut\nRemote modification of most of Knut's features and settings\nExporting CSV files (Windows, Windows Mobile and Mac OS X only)\nWi-Fi:\nKnut connects to the internet using commonly available Wi-Fi. \nKnut supports:\nSpeed: 802.11g\nSecurity: WEP-64, WEP-128, WPA, WPA2. Does NOT currently support WPA Enterprise or WPA2 Enterprise.\nType: Infrastructure, AdHoc\nRange: 100 meters. Obstructions (such as walls) will reduce range.\nSensors:\nHigh accuracy temperature and battery level sensor are integrated into Knut. Serial and Non Serial devices cannot be mixed with the exception of waterproof temperature sensors which can be mixed with 1 non serial sensor. Some sensor devices contain more than one sensor.\nSerial Sensor Devices (8 maximum):\nWaterproof Temperature\nHumidity (Contains 2 sensors: Humidity and Temperature)\n3-Axis Accelerometer (Contains 3 sensors: X axis, Y axis, and Z axis)\nNon Serial Sensor Devices (2 maximum):\nDoor switch\nWater presence\nBreakout Board(Simulates 2 sensors. Either can be digital or analog)\nEmail:\nKnut communicates using email and requires its own email address to do so. Multiple Knut's can and should be used on the same email address. The user should not interfere with this email address. This email address must support checking email remotely (IMAP or POP3) and sending email remotely (SMTP). SSL support is optional. Most free email accounts support these features.  \nKnut can send alert emails and text messages.\nBattery:\nKnut operates for about a year on two AAA alkaline or lithium batteries using default settings and no external sensors. Battery life can vary from 2 weeks to 10 years based on choices that you make. \nVariables that affect battery life (in order of importance):\nDistance from the Wi-Fi access point\nHow often Knut sends emails\nTemperature of Knut (very cold = bad battery life)\nSpeed of your internet connection\nReliability of your internet connection\nWhat type of sensor is connected\nHow many sensors are connected\nHow often Knut is set to check sensors\nEnvironment:\nKnut cannot get wet or be exposed to harsh chemicals. The sensor leads of the water presence sensor and the probe tip of the waterproof temperature sensor can be submersed but they cannot be used with strong acids or solvents. \nKnut's electronics can handle extremely hot and cold temperatures but standard alkaline batteries lose a significant amount of capacity when cold. We don't recommend using Knut above 55C (131F) or below 0C (32 F) for extended periods of time. If you would like to measure temperature outside of this window, we recommend using the external waterproof temperature sensor. We have successfully tested Knut in a -22C environment but the battery life was significantly reduced.

We've opened a pre-order site where you can support us and receive the same benefits of our Kickstarter backers. Just go to shop.infinitec.com to pre-order your Pocket TV. In the future we'll also be adding more accessories and other goodies for your Pocket TV. Check it out and tell your friends about it! \nNew updates\nYou can watch our hands-on demo video and get a better feel of the power of the Pocket TV and what the Air Remote can do.\nWe're also working on upgrading the design of the Pocket TV. Check out the new look:\n*Scroll down for more pictures\nIf you want to hear more, check out this podcast where Mind of the Geek interviewed Infinitec founder Ahmad Zahran.\nZDNet \"It\u2019s becoming difficult to spot the potential gems in the crowd-sourcing crowd. Geeks should check out the Pocket TV, which puts an Android computer on a USB stick designed for use with HD TVs.\"\nPC Magazine \"A thumb-sized dongle that plugs directly into HDMI ports on existing TVs, bringing the power of Android to living rooms everywhere.\"\nAndroid Community \"This little device packs a punch.\", \"The Air Remote option makes this truly versatile.\"\nMind of the Geek \"We can only say two more words about the Pocket TV: MIND. BLOWN.\"\nHot Hardware \"A big selling point of the device is that it\u2019s portable, so you can slap it into any TV, anywhere--on vacation, in the boardroom, at your parents\u2019 house, etc.--and you have your computer up there on the screen.\"\nTechchee \"It\u2019ll be very useful for showing off some Android apps or Android games on big TV screens to your friends or anyone that you encounter in your daily run.\"\nConvert your TV into a Smart TV\nThe Pocket TV is a small pocket-sized dongle that connects to the HDMI port of any regular TV (even your 5-year-old TV) and converts it into a Smart TV. It's basically a fully functioning micro-computer the size of your thumb which runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) much like today's latest smartphones. The processing power in the Pocket TV will allow you to display Android on your TV turning it into a mega-sized tablet (just imagine a 50 inch iPad). You can download apps from the Google Play Store to stream videos, play games, connect with your friends on Facebook, catch up on news, do some work or simply surf the web. You can even attach a video camera to do Skype video-calls\u2026 Yes, all that on your TV!  \nWhy do we call it a Pocket TV?\nThe device is so small that it fits in your pocket and you can conveniently take it anywhere you go. That\u2019s important because you can carry your Pocket TV with you anywhere, even when you travel abroad. And when you get to your destination, hotel room or office you can easily plug it into any monitor or TV and you will get access to all your information, games, TV streaming channels, work documents and your entire digital life. You\u2019ll have all the benefits that you get from carrying your smartphone but with the ability to display it on a much bigger screen. Imagine walking into a meeting and doing a presentation without a laptop. All you need to do is plug the Pocket TV into the projector and your presentation can be played from the cloud (like a Dropbox account) or locally from the SD Card.\nWhat can it be used for?\nStreaming video: Imagine being able to watch YouTube on your TV rather than on a small computer screen. Or even your other video subscriptions such as Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Video Services. You can now do that right on your home theater system instead of your tablet or phone. Oh and it\u2019s all displayed in HD with up to 1080p resolution.\nListen to music: The Pocket TV even acts as a streaming device for music so you can play all of the content that\u2019s on your computer or home network drive (NAS). That means you access not only your downloaded music but also your movies, TV shows and even your holiday pictures right on your home entertainment system.\nGaming: Why wait for Angry Birds to come to Xbox360 or PS3 when you can play it on your Pocket TV? Or how about racing and strategy games? Wouldn\u2019t they look better on your TV than on your phone?\nSocial Media: For all you social media addicts who can\u2019t go 15 minutes without checking your Facebook and Twitter feeds we wouldn\u2019t deprive you of that. Trust us, we\u2019re just as hooked as you are!\nNews: Get CNN and BBC on demand. The story you want, when you want it, right on your big screen TV. For those who are less addicted to news you can access all your feeds with Google Currents, Pulse, Flipboard and similar apps.\nWork: Edit documents, read PDFs, review PowerPoint, send and receive emails and even do video conferences.\nGoogle Maps: Tired of squinting at your screen trying to find road directions? Yes we know you won\u2019t be able to take your TV with you on the road, but the satellite imaging is insane on a 50-inch plasma!\nWeb Browsing: And of course you can to that too. Use Dolphin browser, Opera, or even Chrome and sync it with your laptop's browser.\nThousands more apps: The Google Play store is full of apps for all types of users and most of them work on the Pocket TV. Dropbox, Evernote, IMDB, ESPN\u2026 The list is endless. Go exploring and let us know what you like. If there\u2019s a specific function you would like us to develop to better use a popular app let us know and we can work on it.\nRemote Control\nA Standard IR Remote is shipped with every Pocket TV. This remote uses infrared signals just like your TV and gives you the ability to control the Pocket TV using up/down/side arrows and several buttons. You can also program your universal remote to control the Pocket TV if you don\u2019t want to have yet another remote lying around the house.\nAn Air Remote is also available for backers who prefer this option. The Air Remote has a gyroscopic sensor that allows you to control your Pocket TV just by moving it around (like a Wii controler). Move your hand up, down or sideways and the cursor on your screen will follow you. This makes your TV experience a lot more interactive and a whole lot more fun!\nControl it from your smartphone. If you want you can also use your iPhone or Android smartphone to control the Pocket TV. Just download the Google Remote TV app from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and your phone will become your remote. We\u2019re also working on our own app for your phone with some very cool features.\nHow does it work?\nThe Pocket TV has a Cortex A9 processor packing 1GHz of power and run Android 4.0 (which works similarly to Apple's iOS for you Apple fans!). It uses the HDMI port for display and can be controlled with either a standard IR remote or the more interactive Air Remote. You can connect it to any standard TV set as long as it has a HDMI port and it will display up to 1080p resolution. It also has a USB port so you can attach an external hard drive, a wireless keyboard and mouse or a video camera for video calls. Oh and did we mention it also has a Micro SD card slot so you can add extra storage?\nOpen Source Software\nThe Pocket TV runs Google's Android which is open source project and we want to build on that with your support. If you're a developer and want to develop Apps, MODs or even ROMs for the Pocket TV, we want to work with you. Drop us a message and we can work together on your idea or project. Who knows, maybe we can even bundle your app into the device for when we start shipping in November. \nHardware Design\nWe\u2019ve tried to think of everything to make your Pocket TV experience as intuitive and fun as possible so we\u2019ve packed as much technology into this tiny device as humanly possible by combining the best hardware and software together. Below are the technical specs.\nNote: Specs have been recenty upgraded to 1GB RAM\nWhat have we done so far?\nWhat you see in the video are actual working units. We've developed several prototypes that we're using for testing and to develop the software on. Our Hardware design is complete and our software is in Beta at the moment but it's very stable so we're very close to finalizing it. \nWhy do we need your help?\nWe need your support at Kickstarter to help us to fund our first production and manufacturing run. That means making thousands of these devices to ship around the world. We also need your help to spread the word about the Pocket TV. You'll be amongst the first to have one so you can tell your friends and the whole world too.\nWhat's Next?\nWe\u2019re now getting ready to start production of the Pocket TV but we need your help to accomplish that. With the support from Kickstarter we'll be able to start  our first manufacturing run and we hope to start shipping them to you by September or October 2012. \nHere is our plan for the next few months:\nJune: Finalize the software development\nJuly-August: 1st production run\nSeptember: assembly, testing and packaging (possibly start shipping)\nOctober: Start shipping\nRewards\nSince we're not in the US like most Kickstarter projects we'll ship all the rewards using FedEx Priority Shipping so that you can get your Pocket TV delivered to your doorstep faster (within 2 business days) and without moving from the comfort of your home. Please bare with us and don't forget to add the FedEx shipping cost to your total pledge.

It\u2019s as easy as downloading an app.\nElphi is the first smart plug built for the 21st century.  With it you can monitor, control and even share devices with your friends from anywhere in the world.  Simply plug your devices into the Elphi plug and connect them to the Elphi cloud with our free app.  Our streamlined setup process usually takes less than sixty seconds.  We've designed our system to work with your existing WiFi network so you don't have to buy any additional hardware.\nELPHI GOES EVERYWHERE\nThe Elphi smart plug can be used to monitor and control all of the things you plug into the wall.  We have been using it to turn on the espresso machine on the way back from work, for turning on heaters and lights, and to check whether my grandmother is ok by looking at her power usage over time.  How will you use it?  Elphi is limited only by your imagination.\nHow does it work?\nThe Elphi plug and app communicate via a cloud service in real time.  The plug uses a dual core Wi-Fi chip to connect to local Wi-Fi networks and is designed to minimize vampire power usage by backing off the relay switch\u2019s coil current via pulse width modulation.  The plug\u2019s firmware is also being designed to allow for updates as our system improves and evolves.\nThe app talks to our API and receives push notifications for events such as turning on the plug with the physical button or your friend turning on your lights from his or her phone. We plan to open up the API to users and developers in the near future.\nThe Elphi cloud is a secure, reliable service that ties together phone apps with the physical devices you use in your everyday life.  We have built it to handle the constantly fluctuating loads associated with even the most demanding smartphone-driven lifestyle. \nCompatibility\nThe Elphi smart plug is compatible with iPhones running iOS 5.1 and will be compatible with Android shortly.\niPhone 3GS, 4, 4S running iOS 5.1\nAndroid devices running 2.3 and higher\nWiFi type 802.11b (also works with b/g/n networks) \nStandard 3 pronged U.S. plug (safely powers anything you plug into your wall socket- up to 15amps, or ~1875 watts)\nElphi Features\nOur goal is to transform the devices you use into a seamless, virtual extension of yourself, and we are building the tools to make this a reality.  Currently with the Elphi system, you can:\nMonitor loved ones (elderly or latchkey kids) by looking at the power use patterns on their devices.\nInstantly turn on and off any device from anywhere via smartphone - from your couch or from across the world\nUse the button as a manual override if a smart phone is not present\nSet timers just like you set your alarm clock on your phone - set your coffee machine to turn on every morning\nLocation awareness - your phone can notify you or control devices based on your location (i.e. curling iron turns off when you leave the house)\nMeasure the power usage of any device, and monitor it over time\nPlug two Elphi plugs into a single outlet with our space efficient design!\nUpdate Elphi plug firmware from your phone\nSynchronize state changes across multiple users\u2019 phones\nAutomatically turns off if device plugged into Elphi plug is drawing too much power\nWhere we\u2019re at\nWe\u2019ve been working for almost a year to integrate our cloud service with our custom firmware, hardware and phone apps.  The Elphi system you see in the video and pictures is a real, working prototype that we\u2019ve been using since the beginning of this year.  Our final prototype was built with a 3d printer, hand sanded and painted with glossy paint.\nWe want to bring Elphi to your home. Your contribution will fund:\nProduction tooling for injection molds, plug prongs\nFCC, UL regulatory approvals\nHigh volume parts pricing\nWe have a contract manufacturer lined up, and are ready to go!  Once we know how many Elphi plugs to produce, we will move forward to create the custom tooling to produce our enclosures, boards and metal prongs.  After the constituent parts of the Elphi plug are finished, we will be free to start final assembly and ship to you!  We estimate we will be able to ship in October.  We'll keep you in the loop with updates!\nRewards\nEach Elphi plug has a glossy plastic exterior with an LED back lit button.  The form factor is small enough to fit two in a standard U.S. wall outlet. We are also offering an early adopter t-shirt, an exclusive invite to our launch party, and of course, the the Elphi plug itself.\nFAQ\nQ: How do I set up the Elphi? A: Download the Elphi App.  Plug in the Elphi plug, which in unconfigured state emits its own wifi network.  Press the \u2018+\u2019 add button to add another device on the app.  If you have an iPhone, switch to the \u201cElphi\u201d WiFi network, and return to the Elphi App.  Enter a name, and location for your new device.  Enter your WiFi network name, type in your password, and you are done.\nQ: What kind of WiFi does Elphi use?  A: Elphi operates on type 802.11b, but will work with any backwards compatible WiFi router (b/g/n).\nQ: What additional hardware do I need to make Elphi work?  A: None\nQ: Does Elphi work with Android?  A: Yes\nQ: What is the lifespan of the Elphi? A: Roughly 100k use cycles; in normal use cases at least 3 years.\nQ: What known issues exist? A: The Elphi system is only as reliable as your WiFi network.  It is vital to have a good wifi router with a good internet connection. Additionally,  the Elphi plug is unable to do web authentication; if your WiFi network uses a website to authenticate, the plug will not be able to connect.\nQ: Do I have to pay a subscription fee for the service? A: No.\nQ: Is the Elphi Smart plug available overseas? A: Not currently. There are many obstacles and costs associated with launching a power electronic device in many countries- different tooling for each plug shape, regulatory approvals, legal issues, potential IP threats and servers in the same geographic area to provide low latency. Long term we absolutely want to make our system available to users everywhere, and we will announce when we make it available more widely- email us at international@elphicloud.com to get on the international announcement mailing list.\nQ: Do I need to have a static IP address or forward a port on my router like with other home automation systems? A: No! Our goal from the start was to automate as much as possible and avoid having a 30-step installation process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Cameron Colpitts\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nElphi began as an idea to automate an espresso machine.
