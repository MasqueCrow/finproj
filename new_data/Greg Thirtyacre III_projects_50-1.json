The patented feeler easily docks on your interdental space, press the Wingbrush and you are done. Stop searching and start finding the interdental spaces!\nYou do not longer have to bend or injure yourself in front of the bathroom mirror while using floss. Use the Wingbrush while watching TV, checking your smartphone or quickly after every meal. Interdental cleaning made simple!\nThe use of interdental brushes is associated with lower risk for periodontitis, tooth loss, heart attacks and diabetes. \nWe did a scientific study on 1000 interdental spaces. The results were clear. With the Wingbrush test persons could reach significantly more interdental spaces than with a conventional interdental brush. On top, the test persons preferred the Wingbrush. It's so easy, that you start cleaning your interdental spaces regularly.   \n  Where can I use the Wingbrush?\nWhy is the Wingbrush better than floss, sticks and oral irrigators?\nAbove, we explained the importance of interdental cleaning. But do you clean them every day? You probably don't. All available devices have weaknesses: \n  Change the size, not the system:\nWe are starting with 3 replaceable brush sizes. It is necessary to offer more than one size, because every mouth is unique and needs individual prophylaxis. \nISO 0 (small): Fits in every gap, especially for small interdental spaces, patients with brackets or retainers.\nISO 2 (medium): For wider gaps or teeth with crowns, bridges or implants.\nISO 3 (large): Conically shaped bristles, serves a wide range with a small wire. Perfect size for patients with periodontitis or wide gaps. \n   As seen on:\n  We need wings to make our campaign fly. Hit one of the buttons below and show the Wingbrush to your friends.\n Our Story: \nDuring Louis' study of dental medicine, he recognized dentists usually act when it is too late. Dentists repair teeth or extract them because of caries or periodontitis.\n \nNobody is born with bad teeth. Daily oral care routine is the key for healthy teeth and healthy gum. Interdental cleaning is a important part of this. So, the main question we tried to solve was: How is it possible that everyone is aware of the importance of interdental cleaning, but nobody is doing it? We found the reason in the devices available for interdental cleaning. They either have a bad handling or a bad cleaning power. \nIn 2012, our dentist Louis quickly got the idea to combine the feeler, known of his oral irrigator, with his interdental brush. After first tests with lots of superglue all over our teeth, we knew that it could work. Market research of Burak and Marc showed, that nothing similar is available in the market. \nAfter convincing M+C Schiffer GmbH, the biggest manufacturer of oral care devices in Europe, of our patented idea, we started making the Wingbrush reality. With each prototype, interdental cleaning became more simple and pleasant. A scientific study of the University of Bonn with almost 1000 interdental spaces showed a great advantage in handling and reachability of interdental spaces. \nThe results motivated us to found our company called LUORO. The vision is to simplify oral care with innovative products. The Wingbrush is our first product.\nWe are ready to start, please support us to establish the Wingbrush in every bathroom. \nBelow you find just some sources highlighting the problem with flossing and the importance of interdental cleaning:\nMedical benefits of dental floss unproven\nThe effectiveness of interdental brushes\nWhy should I use interdental brushes?\nIs flossing your teeth a waste of time?\nA little bit more scientific evidence for all dental nerds out there:\nEvidence suggests that interdental cleaning with interdental brush is the most effective method for interdental plaque removal.\nNo studies reported the effectiveness of flossing plus toothbrushing for preventing dental caries.\nUse of floss/interdental brushes is associated with lower risk for new cardiovascular events.\n   Rewards:\nStretch Goals:\nPostcards:\n      Travel Case:\nOur timeline:\n      This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.

Simply put, HICKIES\u00ae is a smart and easy to use lacing system that connects each pair of eyelets independently and makes your shoes look fit and perform better. With the HICKIES\u00ae lacing system you can turn your shoe into a slip-on that securely adapts to your foot\u2019s movements, and renders knots and bows to be a sloppy look of the past.\nSneakers have evolved in every way except for shoelaces \u2013 they've been around since 3500 BC. Today shoes are made using the most advanced materials and latest innovations: we walk on chambers of air, wear custom memory foam insoles, and have threaded adaptative uppers. SO WHY DO WE KEEP LACING UP OUR SHOES WITH STRINGS?\n  The HICKIES\u00ae lacing system connects each pair of eyelets separately. This allows you to customize the fit with different tension in different parts of the shoe. Instead of a single lace running through the length of your shoe, each HICKIES\u00ae strap expands and contracts independently responding to each movement of your foot.\n    Your sneakers will feel more comfortable and perform better than ever before.\n   Here is our Press Kit.\n    HICKIES\u00ae is the only lacing system that allows you to adjust your fit and have different levels of tension along your entire foot. This is because the HICKIES\u00ae Lacing System is modular, meaning instead of one lace running through the length of each shoe, you have one strap per pair of eyelets. This gives you maximum control when it comes to customizing tightness, comfort, and style. The HICKIES\u00ae lacing system fits any sneaker. Experiment to find your perfect fit.\nWould you like to watch a real demo? Join us on our livestream sessions. Please leave a comment with your questions here or email us directly at social@HICKIES.com and we\u2019ll answer them in the next live stream.\n  Evolution never stops, neither do we.

You can use our different lacing techniques to tighten or loosen your shoes to make your shoes more comfortable.\n     Whether you're rocking shoes from New Balance or Vans, HICKIES\u00ae lacing system works with many types of shoes as long as they have eyelets. HICKIES 2.0 give you two size options: one slightly longer for adults (12 years and up) and HICKIES Kids for children (between 4-11 years old).\n    HICKIES\u00ae 2.0 comes with 14 units per pack, and HICKIES\u00ae Kids with 10 \u2013 both enough for 1 pair of shoes!

Our happy backers can attest that we deliver on our promises of quality and timeliness.\nWe've built mechanisms into our timeline to ensure we can deliver rewards on time even in the case of a massive campaign. That\u2019s why we set some rewards to be sent before the holiday season and others after. Our several prototypes have been tested over and over again and we are 100% committed to following through on our word.\nIn preparation for this new Kickstarter campaign, we made arrangements for production and delivery. The factory is lined up and we\u2019ve gone with Backerkit for the survey and fulfillment to ensure that everything runs smoothly and that our backers get their HICKIES laces in time for the holiday season. Now, we just need to know how many sets to produce and we can get started.\nIf despite our meticulous planning, under rare circumstances out of our control, our delivery deadline cannot be met, we promise to be transparent with our backers and keep you informed every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1x KICKSTARTER PRICE", "descp": "Get a package with 14 Hickies 2.0 for your favorite sneakers!

One of the few women recognized as central to the New York art scene, she had over 20 group shows scheduled for 1970 in addition to being chosen for a cover article in ArtForum Magazine. When she died in May, 1970 the life of one of that decades\u2019 most passionate and brilliant artists was tragically cut short. And although she had only a single one-person show of her sculpture during her short life, the subsequent years have seen multiple retrospectives and purchases for the permanent collections at major museums from the Guggenheim to the Tate, from MoMA to the Pompidou.\nPhoto of Hesse by Barbara Brown circa 1963, from a newly uncovered cache of photos by this photographer. Quote from Hesse's journals.\n An Extraordinary Woman \n\"Eva Hesse\" is a feature-length documentary exploring the journey of this extraordinary woman; an artist whose life was in dynamic interplay with the development of her ground-breaking work. The story takes place in the excitement of 1960\u2019s NY; the downtown art scene with the creative community, in their studios and on the streets plays a major role as does the burgeoning feminist movement. The film also explores Hesse\u2019s youth as a Jew in 1930\u2019s Germany, a country she would return to in 1964 to face her past and forge her future. \nHesse in front of \"Metronomic Irregularity\" 1966. Photo by Norman Goldman.\nHesse Unpublished Journals, Newly Uncovered Photos & Rare Footage\nInterviews with major art world figures including artists Dan Graham, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, Robert and Sylvia Plimack Mangold and Nancy Holt (in her final filmed interview before she passed) expand the focus of the film beyond Hesse's own experience into the community of artists that populated downtown Manhattan in the sixties.\nPhoto by Gretchen Lambert, 1966\nNicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Museums, Whitney Curator Elisabeth Sussman and writer Lucy Lippard, all of whom curated important Hesse exhibitions, add another perspective. The interviews are mixed with archival footage from the period, newly uncovered still imagery and rare home footage as well as beautifully lit shots of Hesse\u2019s art which capture not only the story of this artist but also sketches a vibrant landscape of the time. \nDetail \"Vinculum\", 1968\nThe narration, primarily Hesse\u2019s words spoken with wonderful sensitivity by Selma Blair (Hellboy, The Fog) is excerpted from her voluminous and passionately written journals and gives an understanding of what she was thinking and feeling, adding a deeply personal and emotional element to the film.\nSelma Blair voicing Hesse's journals\nEva wasn't the only writer in the family and Bob Balaban (Girls, Moonrise Kingdom\" voices Hesse's father reading from William Hesse's wartime journal and from deeply moving letters to his daughter. Eva also corresponded often with her close friend and colleague, Sol Lewitt who is voiced by Patrick Kennedy (Boardwalk Empire).\nHelen, William and Eva Hesse circa 1942\nHow We Got Here\nFour years ago, we embarked on a journey that has taken us thousands of miles, engaged us for thousands of hours and called upon hundreds of crew members, interviewees, researchers and supporters to band together so that we could tell this story before it slipped away. Eva was born in 1936, and many of the folks who knew her are in their 70's, 80's and beyond. We knew that this was a now or never opportunity. Happily, many individuals and organizations both in the US and Europe agreed. \nLetter to Rosie Goldman, written during Hesse's artist residency in Kettwig, Germany 1965\nThere is now a finished film which will debut in April of 2016 at Film Forum in NY and then play around the country and throughout the world. So here we are on Kickstarter, looking to expand the project's community of support which will carry the film through this next exciting stage. Read on for more about Eva, her creative community and the work for which she is justly celebrated.\nInstallation View of \"Chain Polymers\", Hesse solo show at Fischbach Gallery 1968\nCreativity and the Engaged Life\nEva Hesse explores the universal challenge of living an engaged life; a life of courage, discipline and joy even when the world is telling you that you have little chance of success. It is a story about art and about life; and how the two combine to create one of the most universal of life\u2019s experiences.\nPhoto by Hermann Landshoff, 1968\nMore pics and words on...\nfacebook Eva Hesse Documentary pinterest Eva Hesse Documentary\ntwitter @evahessedoc / instagram @evahessedoc / tumblr @evahessedoc\nEva and Tom Doyle on roof of 5th Ave. loft.

Time to Move Ahead\n\nNow that we have a finished the film it's time to get it out there. That's where you come in! There's a lot of interest from theatrical venues and museums but in order for us to move forward we need funds to market and distribute the film. We need to deliver a great trailer, build a dynamic website, hire someone to get the word out and create a high quality package of deliverables for our distributor. \n\nThe challenge for us right now is to be able to move forward while all the energy is buzzing about the film. It's time to share it and we are looking to build a community to help us carry the project into this next stage. We got this far with the support of foundations, a grant from the German government, European pre-sales and close friends and family.

This will fund color correction and sound mix on the almost-completed film. This is essential to portraying the sights and sounds of Afghanistan, Texas, and Micronesia as vibrantly as the real thing.\nA huge, overwhelming, heartfelt THANK YOU to our early supporters who helped us reach our initial funding goal.\nThank you, Kulo, Kinisou, Kalahngan, Kamagar & Sa Hachigchig! \nLove, Nathan, Bryan and Fivel\nISLAND SOLDIER is a feature-length documentary that tells the personal stories of young Micronesian soldiers serving in the U.S. military. The film follows them from a remote island in the Pacific to boot camp in the U.S., an outpost in Afghanistan and back. \nArthur Nena, boot camp and Kosrae\nBy sharing intimate stories of these soldiers and their families we can: humanize the impacts of U.S.-led foreign wars, show how a small island nation is caught up in a global power struggle, and let people know about Micronesia's uncertain future as it faces frightening economic and environmental changes.\nWe think it is important to ask, \"Why are so many young Micronesians leaving 'island paradise' to fight another nation's wars?\" Thousands of Micronesians - from a small population - leave family and deep community ties, and put their lives at risk. At times, there are multiple generations of Micronesian families serving in the US military together. And because it is a small nation, the repercussions of war are visible and deep. \nThe film is already supported by many amazing cultural and media organizations, and we were recently recommended for production funds from Pacific Islanders in Communications for $50,000!\nBut, there\u2019s a catch.\nThey\u2019re requiring us to produce matching funds for that $50k before being awarded the money. To that end, we\u2019ve been able to raise $15,000 from other sources, which means we now need just $35,000 more to unlock the original funds. That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching this Kickstarter -- to get us over that finish line.\nNow is the time to tell this story because Micronesia and its citizens at home and abroad are at a critical crossroads. Micronesian soldiers, once they return home after duty, have no access to veterans medical benefits (there is no VA in the FSM). \nWe are uniting friends, family and soon-to-be friends in a supportive community around ISLAND SOLDIER. We're taking our cue from Micronesia, where \u201cwealth\u201d is valued by how much you share resources and support friends, family and even strangers. By contributing to this campaign, you are becoming part of the ISLAND SOLDIER community.\nNathan Fitch - Director, Island Soldier\nI joined the Peace Corps in 2004, and was assigned to the island of Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, a former U.S. territory and independent nation since the 1980\u2019s. I fell in love with this tiny volcanic island in the South Pacific, with its lush jungles, white sands beaches, and close-knit society. But I also discovered that since 9/11, Micronesia had become a \u201crecruiter\u2019s paradise\u201d for the U.S. military, and that a disproportionate number of young Micronesian men were now fighting on the front lines in Iraq, on the other side of the globe.\nI had so many questions for them: Why are you fighting for the U.S. in Iraq, when I, a U.S. citizen, am not? What is it like to leave such a peaceful place for the turmoil of war? What is it like to return? It was these questions, and the somewhat guilty understanding that they were serving in my place, that is the impetus behind the documentary ISLAND SOLDIER.\nOver the past 3 years, we\u2019ve been filming with the film\u2019s main subjects all over the world -- in Micronesia, Hawai\u2019i, Texas, Georgia, and Afghanistan. To date, we\u2019ve captured roughly 80% of the footage necessary to tell the personal stories contained within the film. A rough cut of ISLAND SOLDIER has already been assembled, and is simply awaiting the final footage to be shot.

He puts his life on the line every day, driving an armored vehicle for the explosives ordinance disposal unit in a remote province of Kandahar.\nMaryann Nena\nSapuro Nena\nMaryann Nena is the mother of Sapuro Nena, a Kosraen soldier killed in action in Afghanistan.  \nMadison Nena\nArthur\u2019s father, Madison, advocates for a more traditional Micronesian life, even as he watches all his children depart Kosrae for oppertunities abroad.  An important community leader, Madison is part of a task force that is attempting to plot a sustainable course for the islands after US funding is slated to end in 2023.\nMaking a movie on opposite ends of the world is very expensive. The money will mostly go directly towards funding final shoots in Micronesia and Hawai\u2019i, post-production (editing, sound mix, graphics), and to your donation rewards.\nAnd there are rewards for your contributions at every level.

With that in mind, we all work as professional filmmakers, yet this is a \u201cpassion project.\u201d We have dedicated hundreds of unpaid hours to getting it to this point. Fundraising, editing and outreach are enormously time consuming. Yet, foundations want to know that people are getting paid to steer projects like this. Paying our team members means the project is far more likely to be completed and encourages accountability. That is why this Kickstarter campaign is so critical. It will demonstrate our professionalism to major foundations, and therefore we\u2019ll far better odds at receiving future funding. \n\nOne of the greatest hurdles to a fantastic documentary is \u201caccess.\u201d Documentary filmmakers need the subjects, and often their friends and families, to be on board. Nathan has already spent many years of his life dedicated to being involved with Micronesian communities in the U.S. and abroad - from his Peace Corps service in 2004, developing Micronesia\u2019s first skateboard team and learning a local language, Kosraen, spoken only by about 8,000 people.

But even \u00a310 donation will help us get there! \nBackground: Since our launch at Sundance in January, How To Change The World has had a fantastic press and audience response at festivals and in cinemas. But now we want to take this story to the widest possible international audience with an US Oscar qualification campaign and \nGreenpeace founders embarking on the first campaign against Alaskan nuclear testing\nFROM DIRECTOR JERRY ROTHWELL\nIt's taken 7 years to bring the story of the founders of Greenpeace to the screen, since first discovering over a thousand cans of 16mm film in the vaults of the Greenpeace archives.\nWhat drew me to the material is that shows a unique attempt to effect global change by a small group of committed, idealistic pioneers. At the same time it is the story of all nascent groups. The men and women who came together in those early years were an eclectic gang whose different skills contributed to a group that combined scientific rigour and engineering savvy with beliefs in the I-Ching and First Nations mythology...\nDirector Jerry Rothwell (right) filming behind-the-scenes of \"How to Change the World\"\nCONTINUED...\nSome were in it for the politics, some for the science, some just for the adventure. But like a band with an unexpected hit song that catapults them to global fame, the media success of their first anti-whaling campaign forced them into a maelstrom, which at times threatened to destroy everything they had accomplished.\nThe Greenpeace founders\u2019 reflections on this period speak not only of environmentalism, but of all movements for change, and also of the dilemmas of growing up and growing older: the tension between youthful idealism, ego and courage on the one hand, and maturity, pragmatism and political manoeuvring on the other.\nI think their experience has a lot to teach us, at a time when action for the environment is more urgent than ever. \nHelp us reach our goal and bring the film to cinemas worldwide.\nGet a Community Screening in your City or Town with our rewards, exclusive to Kickstarter\nTHE FILM\nIn 1971 an eclectic group of pioneers \u2013 hippies, journalists, musicians and scientists \u2013 set sail from Vancouver in an old fishing boat. Their mission was to stop Nixon's atomic bomb tests on a tiny island off Alaska. Amongst them was Bob Hunter, a charismatic journalist who, over the next five years, somehow managed to bind the \u2018mystics and the mechanics\u2019 into a group with a single purpose, often at huge cost to himself.\nAlongside a group of passionate and idealistic young friends, Hunter was instrumental in creating the global organization we now know as Greenpeace, changing the way we look at the world and our place within it.\nA prizewinner at Sundance Film Festival, How To Change The World draws on interviews with the key players & stunning footage of their jaw-dropping actions, bringing these extraordinary characters and their intense, sometimes eccentric & often dangerous world alive.\nThe Filmmakers & Family of Bob Hunter at the Canadian Premier, Hot Docs International Film Festival\nWHY DO WE NEED THIS STORY NOW?\nAt a time when we need to engage with environmental & wider political problems on a global scale, this story of the impact one small group of people can get us thinking not only about how we act individually but in partnership with each other. The film is launching in the lead-up to the Paris UN Climate Summit - the most important global meeting on climate change this decade. Our aim is to inspire a new generation to believe in our ability to make change with as many worldwide screenings as possible.\nBOB HUNTER -  A life well spent for the planet\nBOB HUNTER is the main character of our film and a visionary icon in the movement. He joined Greenpeace for the first campaign against nuclear testing, and thereafter became the leading figure in the movement. As the organization\u2019s first president, his media savvy and political ideas helped define the character and methods of early Greenpeace. He led the first anti-whaling campaigns, which led to a ban on commercial whaling. Later on, Hunter began a career as environmental reporter for Toronto\u2019s CityTV and published 13 books. In 2005, he passed away from terminal cancer, but his legacy still lives on today \u2026\nScene from the film of Bob Hunter, first president of Greenpeace and main character of the film\nREWARDS - exclusive to Kickstarter\nWe have lots of great rewards as thanks for supporting our worldwide release.

Because we want to make the world more beautiful by saving important resources and offering products made from the best alternative to traditional paper. A material made out of waste products - stone paper. \nWe will offer hardcover and softcover ROCKBOOKS in three different patterns. And we'll make your 'familiar', usually boring stationery but then stylish, like ROCKVELOPES, ROCKPADS, POCKETROCKS, ROCKMEMOS, and we might even offer ROCKCUPS. So actually, anything you can think of stationery-wise, we will make. From stone. \nBut we\u2019re not there yet\u2026\nWe\u2019re just getting ready to ROCK\u2026\nWhy this Kickstarter campaign?\nWith this Kickstarter campaign, we want to fund our first project: the METAMORPHIC ROCK TOOLS debut collection, that holds all the basic stationery we use in daily life, to realise ambitions and let creativity roam freely.\nFrom product designs, to testing samples, to realising the first product and building up relations with manufacturers, we\u2019ve done it all. We work closely together with the innovator of stone paper in Taiwan, as well as a very experienced production facility. Both were visited by our ambassadors, who are of invaluable importance to us, and who assist us in all our activities. So, we\u2019re all set.\nBut we need a community of ROCKSTARS to help us start to make a change, and make it last.\nRight now, we need to start doing things differently, to keep our planet a healthy place for future generations. The paper industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, and a suitable alternative exists: stone paper. So, why not start using it on a bigger scale? That\u2019s where On The Rocks comes in.\nWe believe that saving invaluable resources such as water and trees, thus the air we breathe and the soil we live on, is of vital importance. By offering this first Metamorphic ROCK TOOLS collection to a community of ROCKSTARS, we can make a contribution.\nBut there's more. We will donate 5% of our profits to a horizontal reforestation foundation in South Africa. We promise to be good by doing good. That\u2019s also why we're on our way to become a Pending Benefit Cooperation\nand we're building a social community of Rockstars! Come find us on Twitter and Facebook & share the love!\nWith various experiences in entrepreneurial projects, working experience in marketing and community-building (but a background in European Law and History...) Anne is the leading force behind On The Rocks. \nThe creative brain and design rockstar involved, is Sietse. With over 10 years of working experience in design, illustrations, UI development and brand building, he brings with him a lot of talent and experience. \nEva is our website/webshop- and social-media mastermind. She really knows how to rock the digital world. Having worked in these areas for a host of different companies she now also joins our team of rockstars. \nWithout the help of talented photographer Philip we wouldn't have been able to show you our prototypes this stylishly. We're already looking forward to his pictures rocking the stage in our future projects.\nOur movie was made in cooperation with the very talented people from Cloudshaped/Arteffects. \nApart from this team, we have Ambassadors that rock! They assist us in everything we do, and fully support our project. We can always count on their guidance and (life)lessons. \nThe details\nWith this Kickstarter campaign, we will be able to produce our METAMORPHIC ROCK TOOLS basics. All designs are finished and ready for production, but funds are lacking. \nWe've already been prototyping our ROCKBOOKS for some time. First, Anne went for a very basic small notebook. \nEven though the result was nice, it lacked 'spice'. So, that's when Sietse and his creative magic came in. He designed three lines of products, based on natural stone formations.\nAnd then we decided, this needed some color to make it rock. \nBecause it's not all about the outside beauty, but also inner beauty, we've added something nice inside the ROCKBOOKS as well. \nTo give you a space to write, doodle and mind map at the same time, the lines in our 64 sheet ROCKBOOKS are very subtle. Just enough for you to see them, but not too much to distract from what really matters - your content. \nBesides that, all our hardcover ROCKBOOKS, will come with a back pocket, a pocket for you to fill with the best memories. \nAnd, all of our hardrock ROCKBOOKS, come with three ribbons. Yay for that! We're sure that with all the things you need to keep track of to make your ambitions and dreams a reality, this will come in pretty handy.\nPlus, what's a hardrock ROCKBOOK without an elastic to close the thing? Can't forget that one.\nFor this campaign, we thus offer our ROCKBOOKS as a reward. Including, one special limited edition! Inspired by - of course - mountains. Very famous mountains indeed, Huangshan in China. \n                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat we will be able to do after this campaign\nMost of the money we raise, will directly be used to produce and ship all rewards. An exciting ordeal for us, also since we are of course very curious to find out your unsalted opinion about your real life ROCKBOOKs!\nThe product designs for all of the other elements of our Metamorphic ROCK TOOLS debut Collection (ROCKPAD, MINIROCK pocket notebook, ROCKVELOPES) are finished, and we will be able to start sampling and producing those. \n We'll also be able to do the plate-making, so that all of our Metamorphic hardcover ROCKBOOK covers can be embossed with the Metamorphic design. Cool, right?!\nAfter production of all of our ROCK TOOLS is finished and we're all satisfied with the quality and how they've turned out, we'll invest in opening up shop for everyone. No worries, we'll make sure, you'll be the first to know so you can keep your pioneer position. Exciting!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter the successful funding of this project, we will be able to launch our METAMORPHIC ROCK TOOLS. But, as with all things in life, sometimes it can get messy. Even when you least expect it.\n\nFor us, there are a couple of interesting challenges ahead. \n\n- Shipment: we will ship worldwide, but will of course do the final-final-final quality check ourselves, and will pack all the rewards for backers ourselves. So that whole logistics part might become challenging. We're in touch with a couple of different shipping agencies right now, to find out how we can get the rewards out as fast and as good as possible.\n\n- Leading production from a distance: We'll manufacture the ROCK TOOLS in Taiwan, close to the source of stone paper. With our previous experiences in working long-distance, sometimes this can lead to miscommunications or is it just very difficult to explain details of our designs. Even though, when really necessary, we can travel to Taiwan, we hope we can deal with this and build further on the great relationship we have with our manufacturers. \n\nApart from that, we can't think of significant risks or challenges. Our designs are solid already, we know what our manufacturer is able to do and know that they will deliver high quality products, made with eco-friendly ink, glue and production methods.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "On The Rocks\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nOn The Rocks was founded by Anne Pleun van Eijsden, an ambitious 27-year old from the Netherlands.

But we've become frustrated at the lack of a mason jar fermentation airlock that will let you \"set it and forget it\", mind the cliche. We wanted to create something that eliminated the need for monitoring your jars everyday, and took care of a bunch of other inconveniences at the same time. \nThe Pickle Pipe has made fermentation easier and more fun and we think you\u2019ll love using it in your own home.\nOne-Piece | Food-Grade Silicone | Waterless\nThe benefits of lacto-fermentation are truly too great to list. They range from promoting strong gut health to improved digestion and nutrient absorption, they have detoxifying powers, and even help reduce sugar cravings. No wonder fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and real pickles are referred to as the modern day Superfoods. \nReal pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut.\nLacto\u00ad-fermentation is an anaerobic process (complete absence of oxygen) which encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria commonly known as probiotics. Exposure to oxygen can encourage the growth of surface scum and microbes and often leads to fermentation\u2019s nemesis: mold. Oxygen can also deprive your ferment of Vitamin C, and lead to soft or soggy food without any crunch as well. For these reasons it is critical that no oxygen is allowed to enter your fermenting environment. \nOnce the process is underway, carbon dioxide is produced as the probiotics convert the natural sugars in your veggies into tasty amino acids (this is what you\u2019re seeing when your jar is bubbling). \nFor these two reasons, an airlock becomes a critical component serving two very important functions:\n1) Allowing carbon dioxide to escape the jar and avoid it from exploding\u037e and\n2) Keeping oxygen out of the jar to prevent mold from spoiling your ferment.\nThe Dos and Don'ts of Lacto-Fermentation\nComplicated, inconvenient, expensive. \nSimply put, current airlock solutions are over-complicated, inconvenient, expensive, and after all that, still require regular maintenance and monitoring. \nSay goodbye to multi-piece airlocks!\nA popular airlock solution uses a three-piece plastic water-filled airlock system whereby gas can escape one way but not re-enter. The problem is the airlock is made from brittle plastic which is prone to breaking and requires an additional three-piece lid mechanism to attach it securely to a mason jar. The end result is a clumsy six-piece contraption which is designed to relieve you of checking on your ferment to \"burp\" it. Ironically, it still must be monitored regularly to ensure the water has not evaporated, allowing oxygen into the ferment, and rendering the airlock useless. \nEven with these drawbacks, these water-based systems regularly sell for over $15 each! And that does not include the inevitable costs to replace a broken airlock from time to time.\nThe Pickle Pipe solves these problems by eliminating the need for multiple components AND the use of water. The Pickle Pipe is a super simple one-piece waterless airlock that allows gas to escape as necessary without letting any contaminants back flow into the jar, and it screws into place using any standard mason jar band. FDA food-grade certified, waterless, dishwasher-safe, and more compact... the Pickle Pipe is the natural evolution of the mason jar airlock. \nOnce screwed into place, you can forget about the Pickle Pipe for days, or even weeks.  \nThere is ZERO maintenance or monitoring required at all.\nWe sent samples of the Pickle Pipe to some incredibly knowledgeable experts in the fermentation community. The feedback they provided helped shape this campaign, and also let us know that we had created something with real value that actually simplifies a key part of the fermentation process. Here's what they had to say: \nJane Campbell, Fermenter's Kitchen\nKate Payne, Hip Girl's Guide to Homemaking\nSharon Peterson, Simply Canning\nMarisa McClellan, Food in Jars\nThe Pickle Pipe relies on a tried and tested engineering component: the one-way valve. One-way valves are designed with the simple purpose of allowing the flow of a material (usually gas or liquid) in only one direction, and preventing it from flowing in the opposite direction. This is the exact objective of an airlock: to allow carbon dioxide gas to flow out of the jar, and prevent oxygen (or anything else) from flowing into the jar. \nHow a One-Way Valve Works\nThe Pickle Pipe is simply placed on top of a mason jar opening and then secured using any standard mason jar screw band (not included). The flexible nature of the silicone provides a perfectly airtight seal with the rim of the jar. The one-way valve works to release carbon dioxide as pressure builds up within the jar during the ferment, and it cannot open to allow oxygen or other contaminants in the other way. It's really as simple as that! \nWe cannot do this without your support and so rewards should be just that: rewarding. Every reward will feature at least one Pickle Pipe, so backing this campaign is the fastest way to get your hands on one (or three, or six!). We're also bundling the Pickle Pipe with some complimentary Masontops fermenting tools, at up to 40% off standard pricing! \nBest of all, we are confident that we can deliver these rewards by December 25, in time for the gift giving season.     \nWe started masontops.com a year ago to help bring our first fermentation product to market: Pickle Pebbles. We saw a need for a product that was made with quality and consistency, and we delivered on those attributes. We are now the leading seller of glass fermentation weights in North America and the Pickle Pebbles have received a 94% approval rating across hundreds of reviews. This is only mentioned to demonstrate that we have a track record of delivering an excellent customer experience around a product that we manufacture. After the success of the Pebbles, we set our sights on another product that was being under-served in the market: The Pickle Packer - a vegetable tamper made from all natural Acacia wood and designed to work with regular and wide mouth mason jar ferments. The Pickle Packer has quickly become a hit with our customers, with a 98% approval across dozens of reviews in just a few short months since being introduced. \nWe love mason jar fermentation. We understand it, and we have a proven track record of developing and manufacturing high-quality products. \nExisting products have been very well received.\nWe've spent nearly a year, hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars getting to this point. 3D design engineers, testing out various valve types and sizes, silicone shore hardness levels, and much more. The Pickle Pipe is finally designed, tested, and ready to go... but production molds for silicone products are quite expensive, and the minimum order quantity is rather high if we want to bring the price of the unit down to something affordable. \nThis Kickstarter campaign has two purposes: (1) to gauge the interest in the Pickle Pipe, and (2) to help offset some of the initial expenses of bringing this product to market. We are so grateful for any assistance received that help accomplish either of these goals. \nLots of ways! In addition to taking advantage of the great rewards being offered, you can share your feedback on the product with us and with your friends and families! Tell your favorite blogger about this campaign! Follow us on Facebook and Twitter! Every bit helps and we're so appreciative of your support. \nDeveloping this product and this Kickstarter took many many hours and was truly a collaborative effort. First and foremost, we have to thank our families for being so supportive of this project and the many late nights that it demanded. In no particular order, we'd like to extend a heartfelt thanks to the following people and organizations as well:\nKickstarter Video - Jesse Cappe, Big Ticket Productions\nSocial Media Wizardry - Andrew Simon\nGraphic Design - Kelly Lemme, Kelly Lemme Graphic Design\nProduct Development Feedback - Sharon Peterson, Simply Canning | Sarah Nelson Miller, Killer Pickles | Marisa McClellan, Food in Jars | Jane Campbell, Fermenters Kitchen | Kate Payne, Hip Girl's Guide to Homemaking\nYOU!

With over 4,500 backers literally spread across the globe, determining the format of the workshop was a challenge. Hosting it in one physical location, or expecting 4,500 people in different time zones to tune into a live stream at the same time didn't seem like a very equitable (or realistically achievable) solution.

Here's one we built earlier.\nHEAT-1X - 9.3 meters tall, 1.6 tons - designed and built by this team\nKickstarter backers will get exclusive access to a real-life space mission, joining in making key decisions as we design, build and finally launch the Moonspike rocket. You can ask us questions, and give us suggestions that could alter the course of our mission. \nAs a team member you'll have access to some superb rewards, like membership of the Moonspike Academy, access to Mooncamp, a seat at mission control, your own data in the space payload, actual parts from the rocket and numerous limited edition goodies like mission patches, posters, challenge coins and pins. And of course you can follow our progress through video diaries and video chats.\nThe Moon Rocket\nWe looked at literally hundreds of design options and settled on a design using proven space technology with a few modern twists. Our intention is to build a two-stage, liquid-fuelled vehicle that is capable of lifting a small spacecraft into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). We will then send that spacecraft to the Moon carrying our payload.\nThe Spacecraft\nThe spacecraft is the third stage of the vehicle, and has a mass of 147kgs when fuelled. This little vehicle will make the transit from Earth to Moon and end it's life impacting the Moon at around 2,000m/s.\n\nThe spacecraft is largely a container for the volumes of liquids and gases used to push it towards the moon, with communications and guidance electronics, and the tiny, symbolic 1 gram payload attached. When it arrives at the Moon there will be just 35kg of empty spacecraft left.\n\n\nThe Payload\nWe named this mission after this tiny symbolic payload - the Moonspike. We chose a very tiny 1 gram payload as a demonstration, in order to make the problem of building a moon rocket as simple as possible.\n\nThe Moonspike is a tiny spike of titanium that is designed to survive a hard landing with the moon.\n\nIt's important to note that the payload is just a demonstration - the main challenge of this adventure is building and launching the rocket, and sending that tiny spacecraft 400,000km through space to the Moon.\n\n\nThe Journey\nRewards\nShipping for Christmas 2015!\nWe have had several questions about shipping in time for the Holiday season.\nThe images of the mission patch, lapel button and challenge coin are of the actual sample items, not Photoshop - we have already made the tooling, and you are looking at the real thing. This means that if we get funded by November 1, we would order those right way and should be able to ship in time for December 2015 holidays. This also applies the A2 concept art posters.\nSo if you are looking for a great Christmas gift for for your children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren or other space enthusiasts for the holidays, you know which rewards will be available.\nYour memories transported to the Moon\nThanks to the wonders of digital data, even a symbolic 1 gram allows us to carry the hopes and dreams of millions of people. And that\u2019s a core part of what you get from joining this project - you can send (almost) any digital content you want to the Moon.\n\nWhat can you send? A cherished love letter. A beautiful video of your children. A song that reminds you of your wedding day. The novel you once wrote but never published. The movies from your honeymoon. The photo of your mother and father. The home movie of the winning goal. A blessing on your family from the heavens. That software you\u2019ve been working on. Artworks you created in college.\n\nWe can transport your memories, thoughts and dreams to another world, locking it in the Moon for eternity. And in generations to come, your children and grandchildren will be able to look up at the sky and point to that monument.\n\nPhotos of the Earth and the Moon from the Spacecraft\n\nYou are sending an actual spacecraft to the Moon, and because of the novel navigation system, we\u2019re going to be able to send back photos \u2013 not photos shot by someone else, but photos your own spacecraft took during its voyage.\n\nTo commemorate that achievement, the spacecraft will take higher resolution photographs of both the Earth, looking back as we head away, and the Moon as we arrive. And you will get a high quality physical photographic print of each, signed by the team. Each photo will be 5\u201dx7\u201d, suitable for framing, on high quality photographic stock.\nMoonspike Academy\nJoin the team as a Moonspike Academy Member and get a full vote on key issues as we progress, as well as a dedicated smartphone app.\nThe exclusive members-only app will allow you to access team updates one full day before the general public, simulate the mission with a range of engine and payload variables \u2013 allowing you to show your friends what you are supporting - and most importantly vote on choices the team faces at various key stages of the project.\nYou will also be invited to join the annual Academy general meeting in person, and get a personal briefing on project progress.\nAcademy membership comes complete with an Academy membership card and lanyard. Travel not included. \nMooncamp\nJoin the team for a full week on-site at the factory. You will learn about how we design and build rockets, and get hands-on experience in the factory actually building the Moonspike rocket and spacecraft that will travel to the Moon.\nMooncamp will feature interactive sessions from all the key team members, with full details on the challenges of designing spacecraft, how we design and build engines, pump systems, navigations systems, guidance and control mechanisms.\nYou\u2019ll get to design your own moon rocket, with guidance from the team; listen in on team design meetings; and even fabricate actual rocket components that will be used on the rocket and spacecraft.\nIncludes participant t-shirt and Moonspike Academy membership, and runs in the two weeks either side of the annual Academy meeting. A perfect gift for young people who are interested in knowing more about hands on rocket design and fabrication, and an opportunity to build direct experience that might be useful on your resume.\nTravel / accomodation not included. Must be 18 years of age or older.\nMission Patch\nIt\u2019s a simple patch, but comes from a long heritage. Almost every mission into space has its own unique mission patch.\nThe Moonspike patch tell the story of the journey we are planning from Earth to Moon, and also signals to the world that you\u2019re a supporter of open access to space.\nThe custom-made 4\" Moonspike patch is 100% embroidered with an iron-on backing, perfect for overalls, jackets or backpacks.\nLapel button\nFull of vibrant detail, the 1.25\u201d gold-plated lapel button is a specially minted cloisonn\u00e9 pin that shows the Moonspike mission in full color, and discreetly tells the world you are a supporter of open access to space and the Moonspike project.\nEach button is made from a custom casting that is 1.2mm thick, and then plated with 10K gold. Each pin has an 8mm post and a butterfly clutch attachment, to ensure it stays securely on your jacket.\n\nChallenge Coin\nThis specially minted 2\u201d Moonspike challenge coin is a unique memorial of the founding of the Moonspike project.\nChallenge coins are a very old military and aeronautical tradition, with astronauts using mission coins to win bets - challenges - or make small crewing decisions. Even the President of the United States has his own challenge coins, in case of a \u201cchallenge\u201d when on a military base.\nWe\u2019ve recreated that history in the Moonspike challenge coin. It features two unique high gloss faces showing both the Moonspike mission and lunar spacecraft. The coin is finished to a very high standard, with bezel cut edges and nickel plating for robustness.\nPosters  \nCarsten Brandt has created some amazing and gorgeous concept art to illustrate the Moonspike mission, and we are offering superb A2 posters of five of his beautiful creations.\nCarsten works as an art director in the video game industry, and his credits include the Watchmen series. He also teaches video game design at the Danish Royal Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe Moonspike posters will be delivered rolled, rather than folded, to avoid any creasing, and will be printed on high quality stock to ensure they stand the test of time.\nLogo on the Rocket\nIt\u2019s the ultimate. Nothing could be more exclusive than your name on the side of a Moon rocket.\nAnd we have limited spaces, to ensure that backers that choose this reward are highly visible. Logo placement can be selected on the two stages, in two different formats. \nIt\u2019s expensive, but if you want to get your brand in a premium position on a Moonshot, this is what you are looking for.\nA Thruster in Your Name\nThe Moonspike spacecraft features 8 thrusters, and we want to give them some personality. So we\u2019re letting you choose what to call them.\nName it after your loved ones, your pet, your favorite place, your company \u2013 you choose. And from then on, we will refer to that thruster with that name in all designs, publications and documents.\nThere are some restrictions, but if it\u2019s acceptable it will fly.\nWhy back us?\nExperience\nWhile there are probably thousands of people on the planet who have theoretical knowledge of what it takes to build rockets, very few have hands-on experience of building and launching large-scale rocket vehicles.\nBut the team we have gathered have both professional training with organizations like NASA and hands-on experience building rockets at Copenhagen Suborbitals, a private team of amateur rocket builders who designed and built several very successful rockets on a shoestring budget during the past 7 years.\nThe vehicles this team have designed and launched include the 9.3m tall, liquid-fueled HEAT-1X, and the actively guided 5.3m Sapphire rocket. \nTransparency\nA typical space project will be quite secretive. We\u2019re going to be almost the exact opposite.\nWhatever happens, good or bad, we\u2019re going to be open about it, through blogs, videos, and interviews. \nInstead of hiding behind a wall, we'll let you see exactly where your support is going on a very regular basis.\nAdventure\n50 years ago sending rockets to the Moon was a genuinely amazing thing. The glory and power of the incredible Saturn V rocket ascending from the launch pad with 3 tiny, courageous human astronauts on board inspired and awed a generation of kids.\nWhen we were kids, there was a wondrous awe about space voyages, something that has been missing from the modern era. We want to get back to that feeling, of just doing this thing for the sheer joy of watching it climb into the sky and hopefully, eventually, land on the Moon.\nWhether we succeed or fail, this project is intended to be a fascinating, awe-inspiring adventure for all participants, and that includes our supporters.\nFocus\nMany space projects are very ambitious, with vast budget requirements. This is typically driven by trying to launch people or enormous spacecraft with extraordinary goals, and need billions of dollars.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a way to make a real space mission possible on a reasonable budget by focusing on a relatively simple and highly focused goal \u2013 just get something small to the Moon.\nWe think this will allow us to achieve real results. We know that we will need to raise more money the course of the project, and this Kickstarter helps us get started.\nEngineering\nWhen we thought about what it is we are trying to do, we figure it is more of an engineering task than anything else.\nMost of the technology is well documented and understood today; our challenge is making that work with a small team and a micro budget instead of NASA's billions.\nMostly it's about finding smart solutions to classic engineering issues, and that's why the pragmatic, hands-on experience of the team is crucial. \nCredentials\nOne key aspect that makes Moonspike truly unique and unusual is the track record of the engineering team in designing and building space rockets.\nAlmost all of our team come from key roles within the Copenhagen Suborbitals project, which has been one of the most successful and widely regarded amateur space projects ever \u2013 in fact collectively the Copenhagen Suborbitals team won a prestigious Breitling FAI medal for their extraordinary work on a miniscule budget. Those guys are awesome.\nMoonspike is going to continue that heritage, with a budget that gives the team an opportunity to build equally innovative and adventurous space hardware to professional standards.\nFeasibility study\nAs we said above in the transparency section, we want to be very open about what we are doing on this project, and this starts today. \nWe\u2019ve been working hard to develop our rocket and space-craft designs over the past few months and today we are opening up our feasibility study document to the public for you to review the design and understand the considerations we have worked though in the past months. \nYou can download the complete feasibility study document to review the mission, technology and design here. \nWe invite you to download these technical specifications today and check our calculations. \nWe hope you understand that we have made many design decisions and trade-offs to get to this initial design, which has a very specific purpose, so it\u2019s unlikely we will change the design significantly unless we have made some fundamentally erroneous calculations. \nNaturally if you spot any mistakes or issues we would be happy to hear from you.\nWhere will the money go?\nBasically we will use your support to get this thing off the ground, literally.\nUntil now we have spent about 9 months preparing. We raised some seed money to get this far, and now we need the Kickstarter community backing to get us up and running, to the point that we can test some of the most critical sub-systems like turbo pumps and navigation systems, and fire our first engines. \nThe main goal of this funding will be to get our factory set up, install the core members of staff, and start designing, developing, building and buying components to start actually making the rocketship.\nRent a rocket factory \nWe have already scoped out a candidate for our premises, and we will sign up for a 1-2 year lease with the one that seems to be the best fit it funded. \nEquip the workshops\nOnce the factory is available we will equip it with all the basic machines we need to start producing rockets and spacecraft - lathes, CNC machines, drills, welding tools etc.\nBuy materials and components\nA large percentage of the money we raise through Kickstarter will go directly into buying materials and components needed to design, develop and actually build the rocket.\nPay staff\nWe need a focused, dedicated team working on this project. So we want you to know transparently that some of the money will go towards paying staff (and income taxes).\nStart building\nOnce we have made initial purchases of equipment and materials, most cost are the basic running costs of a small rocket factory \u2013 electricity, internet, rocket fuel, liquid oxygen etc. With the money you generously provide we expect to be able to start taking this project 100% seriously and build some amazing machines. In parallel your support gives us a cash runway to generate the next round of funding from other sources. \nKickstarter is a going to get us off to a great start, and we\u2019re also working on many other avenues of funding to ensure we can fulfil our promises to you and get your data, pictures, movies, stories onto the Moon. \nTimeline\nWe\u2019re ready to get going \u2013 in fact some of our team members have already started work, in the expectation that Kickstarter supporters will be right behind us.\nWe have spent the past 9 months figuring out if this was actually possible and the numbers all check out.\nThe only component we are missing is your participation and help. By the end of 2015 we hope to have the rocket factory up and running, and by late next year we want to be able to start firing test engines. \nWe\u2019d love to have you all along for the ride, and ultimately transport your data to the Moon.\nWe\u2019re going back to the Moon. Why not join the team today?\nPhoto credits: NASA, Copenhagen Suborbitals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoonspike is an exciting and ambitious project. Owing to the nature of its size, scale and complexity (not to mention all of the unknowns of space and lunar exploration which we hope to learn about on the way) Moonspike is bigger and more complicated than the average Kickstarter project and so there are more risks and challenges involved and a few extra considerations in addition to those provided on Kickstarter\u2019s website. By making a pledge to Moonspike\u2019s Kickstarter project, you agree to accept the risks as we\u2019ve defined them below, and any other risks known or unknown, even if they are not explicitly stated herein. \n\nWe may have to request further information from Backers to enable delivery of the rewards; change the dates on which we estimate that the project will be finished or we will be able to deliver rewards; or make other changes. Moonspike Limited will do its best to notify you of any such changes via Kickstarter.com, its website, and/or any an email address that you provide. All questions or disputes regarding eligibility for and delivery of pledge rewards will be resolved solely by Moonspike Limited and within the legal jurisdiction of the UK.\n\nMoonspike is a unique project with many contingent parts including design, engineering, mission control, regulation, legal and financing. This Kickstarter project is to raise the funds to set up the basic infrastructure to begin developing and testing prototype parts and systems. To be clear, this Kickstarter campaign is not intended to fund the entire development process or mission. You are funding a design and development process, the initial goal of which is to begin real work on hardware and software. The final rocket launcher and spacecraft may differ from current designs and imagery. Our project may also be influenced by the Kickstarter process, and may change following the campaign based on input from technical review, regulatory oversight or commercial commitments.\n\nThe launch and operation of a new, experimental space launch vehicle and spacecraft is technically complex and involves many risks beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s control. Moonspike Limited is not responsible for any failure to perform all or part of the Kickstarter project if such failure is caused by third parties and events or conditions beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s reasonable control. This includes but is not limited to explosions, spillages, accidents, acts of nature, war, civil disturbances, acts of civil or military authorities, legal or regulatory changes, asteroid impacts, alien interference, loss of radio or other communications signals, or other causes beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s control. \n\nAdditionally, and due to the extremely experimental nature of the project, Moonspike Limited cannot be held liable for failure to perform all or part of the Kickstarter project due to errors or omissions in the design and manufacture of the launch vehicle or spacecraft.\n\nManaging the processing of many thousands of photos, videos, and data files will require automation, and we will be building a platform help simplify and streamline content uploading. No submission will be accepted outside this automated process. All Backers whose pledge contains data transport rewards will be responsible for the integrity of their own content prior to uploading. Any content supplied may be scanned for viruses or other harmful or malicious attributes. All data or images may be visually inspected for explicit, offensive, illegal or copyright infringing content.\n\nTo obtain a reward a Backer must be verified following the completion of a successful Kickstarter campaign and the full pledge payment received.

They should be in every hardware store.\" - Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-In-Residence and TED Prize Winner\nAfter four years designing and piloting underwater drones, we've taken everything we've learned and completely re-imagined what an underwater drone could be. Trident has a unique design that combines the versatility and control of an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) and the efficiency of an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). It can fly in long, straight survey lines called \"transects\" as well as perform delicate maneuvers in tight spaces, all while maintaining a sleek and powerful form factor.\nTrident is easy to use and comes ready to go. Most importantly, it is incredibly fun to fly. (Flying really is the best term, because that's exactly what it feels like when you're piloting.)\n(or email press@openrov.com)\n                Our Story\nYou may remember us. We came to Kickstarter three years ago and shared our dream of building a low-cost underwater robot that would allow anyone and everyone to explore the world below the surface. We have come a long way since that initial Kickstarter video. \n\nWe were working out of Eric's garage at the time, building the original prototype to explore a cave in Northern California with rumors of lost treasure (the full story can be heard in this TED talk). We never found the gold, but we received messages from people all over the world who wanted to help us and improve the robot. The Kickstarter project was the springboard. Since then, we've shipped thousands of OpenROV kits to people all over the world. \nPLAY\n\n Community\nThe OpenROV community is the secret sauce. We made our project open source in order to facilitate faster innovation cycles and allow others to improve on our initial designs. Thousands of people have gotten involved. You can see and follow along with the community expeditions on OpenExplorer. \nA glimpse of the OpenROV community\nTeam\nWe've also assembled a small team that works from our OpenROV HQ in Berkeley, CA to manufacture, ship and support the robots. The combination of community wisdom and the commitment of our internal R&D team (many of whom were original Kickstarter backers) have been the drivers in creating Trident. \nOpenROV Team\nAt OpenROV, we talk openly about our desire to maximize \"Return on Adventure.\" We want to make sure that everyone who comes in contact with our project - community members, customers, employees, whoever - feels that their world is more interesting and more exciting because of it. We want to give people a sense of wonder about how much out there is yet to be explored and make it possible for anyone to be a part of exploring it. Trident is our best attempt yet to fulfill that promise.\nOpenROV 2.8 vs. Trident\nTrident Performance\nEvery aspect of the Trident design has been painstakingly thought out in order to optimize performance and usability in any situation. One of the secrets of its versatility is the unique, hydrodynamically offset thruster design. This configuration allows you to move through the water fast and efficiently when you want to rapidly search an area or run a transect, but also allows you to maneuver very delicately when in tight quarters or while looking at a particular target.\nBy taking advantage of drag's exponential relationship with velocity, the off-center vertical thruster of the ROV can cause it to pitch at high speeds but also hover or change depth without pitching while operating at low speeds - similar to the way a traditional ROV works. \nWe've designed Trident to be ultra portable and ultra durable. The form factor is small enough to fit in a backpack or fit under an airplane seat. The side panels are overmolded with a strong, rubber coating, which gives it protection from underwater obstacles as well as rough handling when being transported.\nDepth: Capable of 100m (will ship with a 25m  tether - longer tethers will be sold separately)\nMass: 2.9 kg\nTop Speed: 2 m/s\nRun Time: 3 hours\nTrident Dimensions\nThe data connection to Trident is a major evolution from the connection set up of the original OpenROV kit. It uses a neutrally buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface (radio waves don't travel well in water) and the buoy connects to the pilot using a long range WiFi signal. Using a wireless towable buoy greatly increases the practical range of the vehicle while doing transects and search patterns since a physical connection between the vehicle and the pilot doesn't need to be maintained. You can connect to the buoy and control Trident using a tablet or laptop from a boat or from the shore.\nSoftware\nOur goal is to make the easiest, most intuitive telerobotic control system possible. We have embraced the latest emerging internet standards from HTML5 and webRTC to WebVR and WebGL to deliver a rich piloting experience through just a browser that runs on laptops, tablets, and modern mobile devices.\nThe software that drives Trident is a living open-source project (https://github.com/openrov/openrov-software). The same software that drives our previous ROV has been continually updated by both the community and our software team. Some of those changes included:\nSoftware plugins that allow any ROV enthusiast to deliver improved ROV capabilities to the whole OpenROV community via small Internet delivered update packages. \nUI Themes so that you can change the look and feel of the piloting experience. \nDepth and Heading hold. Until recently, only a feature on high end industrial ROVs, now available to everyone.\nWith Trident we are focused on an amazing out-of-the-box experience. We are reviewing every bit of the user experience regarding our software to ensure the most simple and intuitive experience possible.\n WHAT'S INCLUDED\nIn each of the reward levels for a Trident, the basic package will include:\nTrident. The actual drone, ready-to-dive.\nA 25m (82 ft) tether. There's a lot to see in the first 25m of depth. For many people, that will be enough. Tethers will be removable and upgradeable if you need to go deeper.\nA wifi topside buoy. The tether connects to a wifi topside buoy. You can use this to control the ROV remotely by setting it on the water or just leaving it on the boat or dock. \nBatteries. Trident comes with onboard LiFePO4 batteries, providing a run time of over 3 hours.\nADVENTURE SET ADD ON* (add $350 to any pledge level):\n*You can always get this later if you're not sure. Or only add for either the hard case or longer tether.\nHard Case. ($100 Add On) Trident will come in a sturdy package/box, but the Adventure Set will have a hard case for travel and shipment. \nAND/OR\n100m Tether. ($250 Add On) Know you want to go deep? Get the 100m tether right out of the gate.\nUSE CASES\nWe built Trident to be the ultimate tool for explorers. But we also wanted to make sure that it was useful for a whole host of utilities. One of the most interesting new features - something that sets Trident in a class of its own - is its ability to conduct long transects, meaning it can run lawn mower patterns over large areas. \nThe benefit of this type of coverage is that you can create visualizations of what the seafloor looks like using photogrammetry software to create a 3D model of the work area. Here's an example from the Fiskardo Greece Expedition run by our friends at OCTOPUS Foundation and Novalta: \nFiskardo Greece Visualization\nWhen overlaid on top of aerial drone footage, these visualizations create a \"window on the sea.\"\ncredit: Fiskardo Greece Expedition - Ocean 71\n\nIt's also a great tool for boat owners and fishermen. Whether you want to inspect an anchor line or look for shipwrecks, Trident gives you eyes underwater and adds a whole new dynamic to the experience of being on the water. \nSponsor a High School\nThe OpenROV Club at Oakland High\n\"The OpenROV project was a winner -- igniting my inner city students' enthusiasm for exploration, taking on academic and technical challenges and developing resilience to over-come set-backs.\"\n-Katie Noonan, Oakland High School\nOne of the most exciting parts of the OpenROV project has been the number of high school classes and students that have taken part. The project provides an incredibly well-rounded education experience: mechanical and electrical engineering, programming, physics, biology, ecology, contributing to an open source community, and just getting outside into nature. \nThe OpenROV kit (not Trident - the previous model of kit) is still an excellent tool for education (and other uses that require the hack-ability). We have a long list of well-deserving classrooms that can do wonders with a donated OpenROV kit. The reward pledge at the $1,000 level will further our efforts here. It will allow us to send a kit and build materials to one of these schools. \nIf you're a resource-constrained teacher who'd like to be added to this list, please email info@openrov.com with the subject \"I'm a teacher!\"\nWhere We're At\nDevelopment Prototypes\nWe have spent the last two years developing the Trident, engineering dozens of prototypes to get to what you see today. We are currently working on refining the final design and tuning it for manufacturing with veteran mechanical engineers and industrial designers.

This would allow us to reach more people and be involved in many other programs and events.\nWe want to upgrade our current equipment and purchase new equipment.  By upgrading and acquiring new tools, we will be able to reach more children and be able to have more kids have a hands on experience.\nWe desire to purchase educational equipment such as computers and projectors to help in our education process.

In the past, many men traveled to distant lands in an effort to gain knowledge and establish new lives for themselves.  Earth will not be around forever and our next great adventure will be to planets way beyond our own. With your help, we hope to inspire many youth to start looking to the future.  Astronomy uses everything they are taught in school from Science to Math and even Reading.  Let's utilize what they are learning and allow them to start thinking outside what lies in our own atmosphere.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe largest obstacles we have consist of a lack of interest due to a lack of budgets by local schools. Because of the lack of school funding, many schools do not have much educational opportunities for the children to learn about what lies beyond Earth. I have been personally surprised by how many young people know absolutely nothing about space at all. In heavily populated ares, many have not even seen a star due to man made lighting that blocks out the natural beauty of a night sky. We offer an educational experience to young people that otherwise may they never receive. Without funding, COAS will continue to be limited in what we are able to teach young and old alike. Seeing a young child see the mountains on the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, or even the Andromeda Galaxy for the first time is very rewarding to us and makes everything we do worthwhile.\n\nCOAS has been actively visiting local schools with various educational programs for a few years now. If funding is not reached to expand our program into a more mobile system, we will continue to move forward with what we are doing until we are able to acquire the needed funding.\n\nIn regards to risk, there really isn't any that we can find. The work that our volunteers do in everything we are involved in is fantastic. There is no sales goal to meet, we are not affected by any economy other than funding. If we cannot afford something, we simply do other things that are more affordable at this time.\n\nThe challenge set in front of us if we are able to obtain the funding we are pursuing is merely getting everything put together. Once we get a vehicle to create a mobile classroom, we have that work to get the mobile unit up and running. Rest assured myself and my volunteers are ready and very excited about what the future holds for us.

I have allowed the levels to reward the player through learning, allowing you to enjoy each level and progress naturally. Also, I am using the accelerometer to allow the player to tilt the device to steer the jet rather than using your finger, or buttons. This will allow the player to be able to use power ups and see the screen for oncoming enemies and blockades.\nLost in... Somewhere - Kala was out on a test flight with her F-317 jet, when all of a sudden, nothing. She blacks out. When she woke up after what seemed like hours, she looks around. Nothing is familiar. She sees stars and planets off in the distance.. but that's impossible! No, it's improbable. She has entered some sort of multiverse, where oxygen exists in this space-like environment. Go on! Move forward! She needs your help, warping through multiverses, in order to get back to Earth's multiverse!\nUnique Multiverses - Every multiverse is unique. From space to candy, to office worlds to hamburgers; you just never know what the next multiverse will bring!\nAvailable for Android Devices - With the initial funding, I will be able to finish production and publish the game to Android devices, with the help of another artist and a sound/music designer. Should I meet the stretch goals, I will be able to get a build for iOS ready, as well!\nabout Epicurus Unvorsum kickstarter\nAs her computer, your mission, for this game is to help guide Kala through the game's multiverses, and get her back to Earth's multiverse.\nEimear Studios wants to create a mobile game for everyone to enjoy, kids to adults, males and females. I have done this by keeping the game idea simple, and relying on core game play, quality 2D sprites, and quality classic 8-bit gaming music for the player\u2019s enjoyment. Everything that makes a great game.\nThe game, by definition is a hellfire/SHMUP game (lots of bullets), but instead of being so insanely difficult that you would want to break your phone, we have developed the levels to allow the player to naturally learn with the game's progression.\nMany hellfire games were designed in the old arcade days, where the goal was to get you to spend more quarters in the machines. Our goal is not to make you spend quarters, but to feel a sense of accomplishment by progressing through the game. Power ups will be available as rewards and to purchase, but they will not be required for a player to play and complete the game.\nhow does Epicurus Unvorsum kickstarter game work\nepicurus unvorsum uses the accelerometer to move the hero's jet\nControls: The game is mobile based, using the accelerometer to control Kala's jet. Tilt your device to move your jet around the screen! This allows the player the freedom to use a finger to select a power up or two (or three or more) to use during gameplay. The jet auto fires, since we don't want you to break your mobile screen, power tapping it.\nepicurus unvorsum for android mobile\nPlatforms: It is currently being built for Android mobile. If I make it to the Stretch Goals, I will be able to make a build for iOS!\nStyle: The game is a top-down viewport, arcade style hellfire/SHMUP game. It is made of 2D sprites.\nLevels and Multiverses: Currently, there are 3 levels per multiverse, with 10 multiverses. Each multiverse is unique, with new enemies, background assets, and blockades. Each multiverse ends with a boss level.\nPlayer Challenges: As the player progresses through each level, the levels will become more difficult, as will the enemies. The challenge is to become familiar with each of the enemies and level obstacles and progress with the difficulty of them.\nPower Ups and Weapons: The power ups and weapons are available for the player to use at the bottom of the screen. They can be purchased via the in game store and earned for free. There is nothing in this game that a player is forced to buy in order to proceed through and complete the game.\nBoss Battles: There are 10 unique boss battles, each with an increased  difficulty and battle style. The battle styles will play based on what the player has learned throughout the multiverse's levels. \nEpicurus Unvorsum development for kickstarter\nWith this game, I plan to develop in close networking with a community of players, and shortly after the Kickstarter completes I will open the game to backer-only early access Beta. I will rely on my backers to give feedback on the mechanics as I develop, with you as a backer playing a pivotal role in the creation of the game.\nEpicurus Unvorsum kickstarter project timeline\nDesign - done \nAlpha Playtesting - in progress \nGraphic Design - done \nPrototyping - done \nBeta Playtesting - soon after the Kickstarter ends \nEditing - in progress \nArtwork - in progress \nProduction Proofing - in progress \nDomestic Test Mailing - done \nInternational Test Mailing - done \nKickstarter Crowdfunding - Thursday, September 24 - Saturday, October 31 \nFunds Deposited - estimated Tuesday, November 17 \nPrint Run Commissioned - estimated Wednesday, November 18 \nUSA Rewards Delivered - estimated beginning Thursday, March 31 (NOTE: It may take 23 days after the postmark.

This project involves bringing to life The Spectacled Eider, who serves as the author of the book. The Spectacled Eider figure appears in the form of an animatronic puppet. He will travel with his trusty, life-sized polar bear companion, a costumed character mascot. The Spectacled Eider will ride inside a backpack on the polar bear's back. The animation and interaction between the child and the \u201cauthor\u201d will be something they have never seen before. All eyes will be drawn toward the polar bear ambling along with a talking duck, engaging in conversations with children. The Spectacled Eider will encourage the children to ask questions, while teaching them to think by advocating philosophical enquiry and promoting logical reasoning. The Spectacled Eider will offer lessons on virtues, values, and morals\u2014involving youngsters in thoughtful contemplation and problem solving.\nClick image and select \"open photo viewer\" to enlarge\nKingfisher and Wren will provide value to those concerned with the dilution of children's literature and its subtle effect of dumbing-down our youth. The book makes it possible to raise the bar in order to share stories with true meaning and value to children. Absent from today\u2019s discourse is the sense of reasoning and contemplation. Concerned parents constantly witness the extent of the media\u2019s meaningless entertainment focused on capturing attention and marketing products to children. Parents can use some straightforward guidance that helps them teach children personal awareness, responsibility, and accountability. The result will produce individuals who are able to think and express themselves in a more articulate manner. Consider the consequences of the alarming popularity of books which have simpler sentence structure, lower word count, and a simpler vocabulary. At a time when children should be developing discipline, vocabulary, patience, curiosity, and a sense of wonder, they are instead emulating and developing selfishness, greed, vanity, and narcissism.\nClick image and select \"open photo viewer\" to enlarge\nThose seeking to expand children's minds, while challenging the ideas broadcast by global corporation advertisements, will greatly appreciate this book. It\u2019s time to encourage children to believe in themselves, because they are capable of incredible things! We need to listen more and lecture less, because children are often smarter than many people give them credit. As we help children develop into free thinkers, we will reap the benefits of their clarity of thought and expression I believe children are natural philosophers and are instinctively asking questions such as, \"How is this?\" and \"Why is that?\" Questioning the world around them not only increases their general knowledge, it prevents them from becoming \"Sheeple People,\" who willfully walk around accepting everything that is happening to them, including anything that could be bad.\nClick image and select \"open photo viewer\" to enlarge\nKingfisher and Wren will encourage children to come to terms with a broad range of personal, moral, and social issues. The book aims to counter non-critical thinking, prejudice, poor judgment, and apathy towards unconventional ideas, and forces us to examine our thoughts and beliefs. The verses stimulate creative thinking and new ideas. Many books today train children to think in fallacious or illogical ways. My hope is to provide children with literature of value that relates to the world in which we live, as well as provides metaphors for our own lives. My goal is to engage readers in five important thinking skills: information processing, reasoning, inquiry, creative thinking, and evaluation. These can be used to stimulate philosophical inquiry and engage children in thoughtful discussions.\nThe Spectacled Eider character study/ Animatronic puppet study\nMy verses can be enjoyed on one level, but as thoughts develop, deeper layers of the stories will be discovered. Many of my verses are what scholars refer to as\"'polysemic\"\u2014which means having the capacity to relate the concerns and needs of people at different stages of development. Celebrated stories of humankind, such as the beloved \"Mother Goose\" stories, have within them layers or levels of understanding and significance,which readers become aware of as they immerse themselves in the writing. As children mature into adulthood they can turn to these verses again and again, for fresh insight about the basic philosophical inquiries about beliefs and  truth, a right and wrong, human relations and the self, which are relevant to people of all ages and at all stages of life.\nBear-Bear character study / Costumed mascot study\nYou can fund this project by pre-ordering a copy of Kingfisher and Wren today. Your support will turn this fantastic idea into reality! Please participate in this great journey by helping spread the message. Be a conduit, if you will, for sharing something truly inspirational and unique for our youth. Encourage your family, friends, co-workers and others to consider supporting this truly unique and valuable children\u2019s book.\nRobin Wooley character study\nWhat happens if I exceed my goal? \nFunds contributed to this campaign will be used for design, development and publication of a magical, yet practical, book for children. It will be used to reach a larger audience to entice them to read, explore and discuss a myriad of topics with children. If I exceed my goal, I have plans to possibly create a video trailer for the book and a webpage showcasing all the characters that will be featured in my series.\nThe Captain of Consciousness Character Study\nThe foundation of this book of verses will create an adventure series that takes place in a small town called Port Clinton (more famously known as Mythic Shores). The star of the series will be \"RuBert (Red) Fischer\" who inspires philosophical enquiry, while promoting good virtues, and charming children with incredible stories of virtue and good morals. Essentially, Kingfisher and Wren is a book showcasing many of the characters that complement the adventure series. Readers have the opportunity to join in and participate in the journey!\nIvory-billed Woodpecker and the Nerfler Beast Character Study\nBiography - The Spectacled Eider\nThe Spectacled Eider is a writer, philosopher, and advocate for continuous learning. He hails from the Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta and enjoys spending time on the Bering Sea. One day while visiting the sunny shores of Lake Erie, he met and befriended two young children. The boy went by the name \"Kingfisher\" and the girl \"Wren.\" They shared their concern about the absurdity of nonsense in the world today. Meaningless entertainment, instead of judicious messages, dominate the air waves. Silly is \u201cin\u201d and smart is \u201cout.\u201d Nothing is gained\u2014children are merely fed drivel when they should be nurtured with useful, honest information. Healthy brains need to be provided ample linguistic nourishment. After listening to the children, the Spectacled Eider understood their concerns. The dissemination of wisdom had been overtaken by silly promotions simply for the sake of a laugh, rather than to provide enlightenment on a subject.\nKingfisher and Wren's first encounter with The Spectacled Eider\nAfter some soul-searching, the Spectacled Eider determined it was up to him to address the problem by finding the solution. (The Spectacle Eider is quite the problem-solver!) It would be a fantastic opportunity to share his wisdom everyone, especially the two little children he met on his journey, as it was they who inspired him to create the book Kingfisher and Wren. He named the book in their honor, because they demonstrated enterprise and inspiration\u2014worthwhile traits for all young people.\nThe Spectacled Eider believes children are extraordinary; their belief system is innocent and their minds are fertile.  With proper nurturing and supervision, their discoveries will guide us to a brighter tomorrow.  As the Spectacled Eider would say, Let us plant the seed of intellect so that it flourishes within children, helping them to reach their full potential. By cultivating a fertile path in their minds, we can help children consume knowledge and wisdom, and gain insight, as opposed to idiocy and nonsense. \nThe Spectacled Eider is clever because he is able to identify sensible communication, void of silly endorsements. His goal is to create inquisitive minds in children through thoughtful encouragement and guidance.  His objective is to raise the bar through interaction and empowerment, which leads to responsibility and accountability.  And most of all, he knows his plan provides the groundwork for imparting good virtues, values, and morals. The Spectacled Eider\u2019s emphasis is on sparking innovation and creativity through imagination as children grow and begin to question the world around them!\nChildren today experience a sense powerlessness. They feel undervalued and incapable of extraordinary achievements. Often their personal interests are overlooked as they are steered toward the next big trend. Careful reflection is pushed to the wayside in order to meet busy schedules. Education should not be a laundry list of skills to check off in boxes. Education needs to be appropriate for the child, family, culture, and community where they live.\nThe Spectacled Eider is dismayed that storytelling today focuses on foolish characters whose main aim is to get a laugh, rather than a wise character who entertains and educates. \nThe Spectacled Eider is saddened by the fact that love, kindness, generosity, and dignity have been overtaken by selfishness, greed, vanity, and narcissism. Even the wisest enjoy a little nonsense now and then, but a constant diet of foolishness will only produce a fool.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDesigning and developing creative projects presents additional challenges not encountered with traditional \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products. Unforeseen hurdles and unexpected costs, along with resistance, doubt, and rejection need to be conquered in order to successfully transform ordinary into extraordinary. \n\nIt is incredibly difficult for independent artists to compete against global corporations with teams focused on marketing, illustration, public relations, distribution, and brand loyalty. Publishing houses have the ability to invest large sums of money to advertise and hype sales through promotions at national chain stores. Not surprisingly, publishers have been known to buy their way onto best-seller lists using perception management to mask value and increase demand.\n\nA solitary author is hard pressed to be able to print, promote, and distribute his or her own work. However, it can be done. Artists often have to rely on external sources supplied by publishers, investment firms, or loans. While these arrangements fulfill an important role in the process, they can be detrimental in terms of artistic control, alteration of the original work, or even cancellation of the publication altogether. \n\nIt is essential that the Spectacled Eider and his sidekick Bear-Bear have a presence in the community, including attendance at public events. The two will visually engage children's interest based on the unique nature of the event. The puppet and mascot will draw the children's attention. Curiosity will compel the children to look into what is going on, as they convince their parents to take them over to the characters. The Spectacled Eider and Bear-Bear know children are a promise for the future, so they perform as cultivators of knowledge by planting seeds for seeking wisdom. The characters will guard the innocent and trusting nature of children, all while providing a better understanding of the world around them.\n\nA child\u2019s biggest fear is a boogeyman. They are wary of an evil trickster who will harm them and steal them away from their home, when in reality the boogeyman man is already inside their home disguised as television, smartphones, computers and advertisements designed to manage their perception and manipulate their behavior. Even more important is that these tricksters lull parents into a false sense of security for their little ones. Vigilant adults will notice the subtle influence of corporations using videos and printed ads promoting products for the masses. These businesses inflate their importance with little resistance or push back by the parents who succumb to the constant barrage of their pronouncements. We must not wait until our children reach young adulthood to address these agents of influence that seek to manipulate them and use them for profits. \n\nMy innovative idea involves working with a puppet designer to create an animatronic puppet that will interact with children, providing them an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. It is imperative to create a mascot that is imaginative, yet professional in its appearance and is worthy as an adversary for corporate competition. The project involves collaborating with a puppeteer and costume designer in order that the two work together. The polar bear (costumed mascot) will carry the author (animatronic author) as he converses with children. Beyond creating the costume and puppet, endurance levels for utilizing such equipment must be evaluated and perfected to provide a working environment for its human counterpart. Considerations include donning/doffing, heat/cooling, articulations/vocalizations, and more. Preparation and planning are vital components for achieving a successful costume and puppet.\n\nIn order to accomplish my goal, I am calling on enthusiastic and forward thinking Kickstarter backers to help bring the Spectacled Eider to life, along with his companion Bear-Bear. Are you willing to take a leap of faith in an artist with an unusual idea that I believe will capture the attention of children in a way that will alter play and learning for the better?\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "The Spectacled Eider\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nThe Spectacled Eider is a writer, philosopher, and advocate for learning.

My ex-spouse did not provide the necessary support that was desired, and required, for me to passionately work towards my personal goals.

Even in the Alterations industry, I was taught that there is a way for 'this' body and there is the way for 'that' body, there was minimum wiggle room for individuality because that's \"just the way it is\".\nBut in the year that Sweetlime has been functioning out of my attic apartment and traveling for house calls, I've learned the true lack of comfort people can feel in the search to find clothes that fit their individual shape and style.\nSteph and Karen on their wedding day - both regular Sweetlime clients\n\"Very affordable, very friendly, and most important of all fantastic at alterations! She altered my chiffon bridesmaid dress beautifully!\" - Sammy T.\nSweetlime Alterations was inspired by the people around me everyday; from the trans man that settled on the ill-fitting outfit, to the larger sized women that was made to feel that t-shirts and jeans were her only options.\nSweetlime Alterations strives to be a local business that people can feel safe in. Safety meaning the lack of any kind of judgment that could make a person feel lesser than the human they are. Safety that could give clients the ability to be their truest self in a space that that encourages and supports their individuality\nChristin Rose - Owner of Savvy Seconds & 1sts in Chicago\nSo far, work on building Sweetlime has been incredible; what started as a Queer-centered idea grew organically to different types of people that  were not feeling comfortable in the the clothes they bought, and even the clothes they had already gotten altered. The thing is, I'm hitting a point where I know I can do so much more for the growing community if I had a little help.\nWith your help through this Kickstarter Campaign, Sweetlime Alterations would be able to fund industrial sewing and pressing equipment that would allow me to take on more projects and at a faster rate, secure a storefront with adequate space to both work in and sell clothes and items that support local Queer and marginalized artists and businesses, and possibly even hire individuals that are often overlooked for positions, but have the potential to be Queer Tailors themselves.\nJess Lee - Friend, Client, Radical Femme\nYou can help Sweetlime Alterations become an accessible store front by pledging and receiving your reward or by sharing this project within your own networks.\nThanks for supporting Sweetlime!\n For further updates on what Gabi gets up to, follow Sweetlime on Tumblr @ SweetlimeAlterations.tumblr.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSweetlime Alterations is taking on wide markets [i.e. trans and queer people, people of color, non-standard sizes] that often get overlooked or ignored.

The new layer of sunscreen will make the Sundikator patch clear- it's reusable the whole time you're outside.\nSudikator in opened package\nHow to Use Sundikator?\nBefore going outdoor, peel off Sundikator from backing paper \nGently attach Sundikator to your exposed skin then remove the frame\nApply sunscreen all over, including Sundikator\nHave fun in the sun, Sundikator changes color when you need to replenish your sunscreen\nReapply sunscreen and Sundikator turns invisible. It doesn't re-surface until it\u2019s time to reapply sunscreen.\nThe Sundikator patch takes the guesswork out of sunscreen- it's ideal for children, who can easily forgot when it's time to stop for another layer, for athletes who spend time at the beach, on the boat, or on the links, or for anyone who wants to make sure they have constant UV protection. It also has applications for people with UV sensitivity caused by illness or medication, or have a family history of skin disease.  \nThe sun's harsh UV rays can be blocked by good-quality sunscreen, but it's tricky to know when it's time to reapply. Sweat, water, sand, clothing- all these things can wear down sunscreen's power to protect. When you're having fun in the sun, how do you know when to reapply? Studies suggest every two hours is ideal, but throw in all sorts of other factors and that window isn't accurate enough to ensure that your skin is safe. Studies have also shown that nearly 90% of skin's visible aging is caused by UV rays. The Sundikator patch is for anybody who will be exposed to the sun for long periods of time, whether it's outside at a baseball game, at the pool or the beach, or a day of yardwork. Everyone can benefit from the extra protection.  \nWe also want the Sundikator patch to be accessible and affordable. Right now, we expect the price to be lower than some alternative solutions on the market. The alternatives are single-use only and about $1 per product. We're looking at the same price per unit, but Sundikator can function for more than a week (great for camping and boating trips) as long as it remains on the skin.  \nAiden is wearing an early prototype and ready for outdoor activities\nWe know for a fact the Sundikator patch is great for kids! It was developed when Qian noticed that his two year-old son Aiden often came in from his outdoor activities with sunburns, rashes, and irritation. Though Aiden's daycare teachers applied sunscreen, with all those children to look after it was hard for them to tell when Aiden needed more! That's when Qian, an innovator with an eye for skincare safety, came up with the Sundikator patch. Aiden's skin is feeling much better now, thanks to Sundikator's reminders for new sunscreen!\nHere is a video shows you the early proof-of-concept test!\nPLAY\n\nThe Science of the Sundikator\nAs important as it is to protect your skin from sun damage, it was surprising for us to realize that we were some of the first to take sun protection to the next level. Skin protection through topical application has not changed for decades, so much so that a running joke about the latest method is to grow a Justin Bieber haircut to protect your face from UV rays!\nThe beauty of the Sundikator is that it offers critical information about sunscreen on your skin to avoid accumulative and irreplaceable UV damage. It\u2019s a small, hidden, comfortable little patch that has a medical-grade adhesive base layer that gently attaches to the most sensitive skin. On each patch is a little ink stamp that doesn\u2019t surface until it\u2019s time to reapply sunscreen.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown: the ink molecules absorb energy from sunlight and transform into an active state that produces color when the UV rays are strongest. Once there is no sun exposure, the ink goes back to its normal color. The ink is protected by layers of micro-cells that make it both durable and waterproof so it maintains sensitivity in many different environments. What\u2019s more, the proprietary ink is only activated by sunlight so it stays colorless when you\u2019re indoors.\nPLAY\n\nWe have lined up ink manufacturers, material suppliers and specialty printing companies who are ready to scale up our Sudikator product. Please back Sudikator on Kickstarter and help Qian bring this revolutionary idea to life.\nSundikator Plan\n Sundikator Team\n How will we spend the money?\nFinancial to date\nIf we get additional funding, we will spend money to make Sundikator better, smarter and more accessible to everyone. Here is a list of things we want to do with additional funding.\nFormulate new shade/color\nComplete Sundikator product line\nHire professional management team\nExpand Sundikator to global market\nDevelop products based on Sundikator's technology to address the problem in adjacent market", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. Finalize our images on the Sundikator.\n\nAs you can see from the video, Sundikator is at its prototype phase, and the images are still generic. We want to put the best imagines and designs on the Sundikator, so everyone can enjoy using it. Thus, delay in determining the imagines can impact the final delivery schedule.\n\n2. Scale-up in printing process.\n\nWe contracted with one of our local printing companies for manufacturing the prototypes. In order to fulfill a larger amount of the orders, we have to develop a way to print larger amount of films in a reasonable time. Since the substrate has a unique surface, it could be challenging to scale-up the printing process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sundikator\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nIt\u2019s a small, hidden, comfortable little patch that has a medical-grade adhesive base layer that gently attaches to the most sensitive skin.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project is canceled": "OCTOBER 7, 2015"}, {"Project launches": "SEPTEMBER 21, 2015"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1116980277/sundikator", "project_name": "Sundikator (Canceled)"}}, {"backer": "Greg Thirtyacre III", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you Omnivore fans and friends for the incredible support over the past 15 days! \nOur initial goal is funded, Omnivore Limone will be soon on the market, and it's now time to announce our first stretch goal of $40.000!\nWe really have a thing for spices.

Absolutely no preservatives or additives will go into our Vulcano. \nWith its bright, savory, complex flavor, and a medium spice level, Vulcano is the perfect condiment to add a little bang to your eggs, potatoes, chicken, burgers, stir-fries, sausages, or to liven up deeping sauces, cocktail sauces, spreads, soups and broths.\nBring Angelo's tradition into your kitchen and help us unlock our second goal!\nNOTE: On Kickstarter, it is only possible to pledge to each project once from a single account.

Within a few months, we shared with you Sicilia a unique condiment sauce, handcrafted and locally made in micro-batches.\nAt Omnivore, our mission is to inspire a change in production practices and a new relationship with food. We are reaching a new awareness about our food supply, but many of the choices in the market are still produced in large-scale, using highly processed ingredients to prioritize profit over quality. \nWe create nutrient-packed cooking products, only crafted in small batches to ensure the best flavor and the highest quality. Our ingredients are 100% organic, and when possible, locally sourced\u2014we are inspired by our grandmothers' sensitivity and respect for nature's bounty, not by food trends.\nWe believe that cooking should be rewarding and simple\u2014all our blends will enhance the natural flavors of your ingredients, and are easy to use across any type of cuisine.\nCooking is an act of love, and we want to inspire you to do more of it.\nIt is time to grow and connect with more of you!\nThanks to the enthusiastic support of our Kickstarters backers and many loyal customers, Omnivore Salt and Sicilia are available online and in a small network of specialty stores. But our aspirations are greater! We want to grow our company, and share our products and message with a larger audience. We proudly have never accepted funding from outside investors. The success of this campaign means we get to continue growing on our terms! \nFor months, we've been experimenting with new blends, testing them in hundreds of recipes, and adjusting each ingredient until the balance was perfect. Now we are ready to present the first of a new series of artisanal seasonings, OMNIVORE LIMONE, a zesty and herbal salt blend that will bring out the best flavors of seafood and poultry!\nWhy Limone?\nLimone is inspired by my heritage, and is a tribute to one of the most versatile ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the lemon. \nI grew up on a citrus grove in Sicily, living by the seasons, cooking, pickling, hunting, and preserving. The women of my family passed down recipes from generation to generation. They taught me the value of timeless quality and great flavors\u2014how to create simple seasonings that do not compete with food, but rather improve it. \nWhile foraging as a child, I learned the wonder of herbs\u2014when mixed with salt, they give character to your food and make your cooking simple!\nMeet the new Omnivore Limone!\nLimone is a mix of of locally harvested natural sea salt and lemon zest, dill, ginger, parsley, garlic, fennel and black pepper.\nEnhancing the most subtle flavors of seafood and poultry, Omnivore Limone creates a delicate and unique experience for the palate.\nIt is made using only 100% organic, GMO FREE, OU Kosher, SQF and HACCP Certified herbs and spices. More than 50% of our ingredients are Fair Trade Certified and our salt is pure\u2014NO flowing agents, minerals or anti-cacking agents are added.\nOmnivore Limone is versatile!\nRub it on white meats or fish before roasting or grilling. Use it in a marinade or mix it with breadcrumbs to create an aromatic coating. Combine it with butter, yogurt, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to give your cooking a Mediterranean twist. Add it to your brines, soups, stewes, and sous vide recipes to enjoy a burst of zesty, herbaceous flavor.\nWith its unique, balanced flavor, Omnivore LImone will revolutionize your cooking, and will become a stample in your pantry!\nUnlike our premier spiced salt blend Omnivore Salt, Limone is not a finishing product. It is best added to your food prior or during cooking in order to rehydrate the dried herbs, and let their flavor infuse your recipes.\nLimone will be sold in a resealable, 6 oz paper bag. This new package is smaller than the original Omnivore Salt, will be easier to carry, will save space in your cabinets, and reduce overall packaging waste!\nMeet the rewards!\nSALT N STYLE - $90+ Bring Omnivore to you kitchen with this comfortable apron made of soft washable denim fabric.

However, most people never actually experience anything more than a screen reflection from their DIY version.\n[for the record this is not a hologram or 3D, but when this is done correctly the illusion appears 3D and most people would commonly conclude that it is a hologram] \nBefore we talk tech, let's answer the questions-\nWhat is it? and Why do I want one?\nThe HoloGram Pyramid is tech gizmo that allows you to view and create images from your phone that appear to float above it with the illusion of a 3D holographic image. You will quickly find yourself amazed and losing hours staring at and sharing this simple marvel of sci-fi reality. Graphic arts and science students can use it to bring their 3D models to life and kids can doze off to the perfect animated night light (you know you have an old phone in the junk drawer just for this). The older kids (at the office) can create company logos or demos to use as giveaways at the next trade show or sales meeting, teachers can add a fun and educational project to the curriculum, and many more exciting uses will be added to our Facebook page! For example; Halloween is coming up, how about amazing the trick-or-treaters with a holographic jack-o'-lantern or skull in your front porch display?\nWe know you will want to show this to everyone once you have one and it's sure to be a hit at your next dinner party or family function!\nNow, let's address the technical aspects of what creates the illusion of 3D Holographic images popping out of your phone-\nRequired criteria;\n1. The image, and therefore the Pyramid, is transparent\n2. There are 4 images, preferably recorded or created with 4 separate views each corresponding to the 4 sides of the object to be displayed.\n3. The Pyramid (square frustum) is correctly designed and positioned to seamlessly depict multiple views of the image from multiple viewing angles.\n4. The outside surface of the Pyramid is the only reflective surface.\nNow that we have established the criteria required to trick your minds eye into thinking that you are seeing a 3 dimensional object floating above your phone, let's address some common issues found in the DIY projects or other available \"clearest holograph pyramids\";\nFirst, the type of material that is used must not be a thick plastic or you may get a reflection off of the outside surface and a second reflection off of the inside of the inside surface which will cause a double blur. \nMost \"other\" pyramids use a cd case or acrylic/plexiglas and cause a double blur image that distorts the image and colors.\nOur HoloGram Pyramid uses a specially coated engineered polymer that produces the best detailed image without double blur issues.\nNext, the material used must be transparent. Using a black glass or mirror can certainly produce a crystal clear image, however, it is only an exact reflection of the image on your phone. This defeats the illusion entirely and will not trick your mind into thinking that you are looking at a Holographic image, just a solid reflection of your phone.\nBlack glass or a mirror can produce great reflections, however; without transparency the eye popping 3D holographic illusion is lost and all you have is a fancy pyramid shaped mirror.\nOur HoloGram Pyramid provides sharp vibrant images that are transparent in order to intensify the \"holographic\" illusion.\nFinally, many of the videos available online are only touching on the illusion by simply displaying 4 identical images on 4 sides. This will provide some degree of the effect when you view the corners and catch a glimpse of 2 sides of a properly aligned image that can be perceived to be 3 dimensional, however, we have found flaws in other's angle and or alignment that cause the 2 sides to jump or be misaligned and also ruin the illusion.    \nNotice how this butterfly seems to have 3 wings and the image is drastically obstructed by the corner support bar. This design completely defeats the illusion and there is no chance for your mental vision to perceive this in 3D.\nOur HoloGram Pyramid was carefully designed with the correct angles and the corners are extremely thin to minimize any visual obstruction. Notice how our UFO shows very little distortion when viewing it from the corner.\nNever fear, we have perfected and produced a very simple design that provides eye-popping, crisp, crystal clear images that will appear 3D with a holographic effect, like you have never seen before from your DIY CD, acrylic, plexiglas, black glass or mirror versions!\nWith our Pyramid we have satisfied all of the criteria needed to produce the full illusion. You may not even realize what you have been missing until you have viewed our HoloGram Pyramid. Viewing from the corners is the key, when you view the HoloGram Pyramid from a corner each eye will focus on each side causing your right eye to see the right image and the left eye to see the left image and if they are aligned correctly THE IMAGE WILL POP INTO 3D from your stereoscopic vision and mental perception! You are now able to see Pepper's Ghost images that look and feel like an actual 3D hologram that is freely floating in space above your phone.\n[An important note- Video of our HoloGram Pyramid is not able to convey the illusion since your screen is only providing you a 2 dimensional image. In order for your mind to switch into 3D perception it is necessary for you to physically view the HoloGram Pyramid in person. Your stereoscopic vision (meaning that you have 2 eyes spaced apart and your brain automatically calculates depth perception which allows you to see in 3 dimensions) can be fooled into believing there is depth and dimension when each eye is presented a separate image that corresponds to 2 sides of an object. By displaying these images on correctly angled reflective surfaces and viewing them from a corner you can be led to believe that 2 2D images equal 1 3D object, adding the transparent factor to the images further reinforces the perception of a 3D hologram. Our video focuses more on showcasing the color and clarity produced by our HoloGram Pyramid but to really see the effect you need to get one! ]\nWe are engineered polymer guys so we know a thing or two about plastics and coatings so this challenge got our attention and it became a fun project to solve.\nWe would like to see more true \"4 faces\" videos that actually use 4 sides of the image to create the best possible 3D effect, perhaps you can get one of our Pyramids and help us create more! We will provide you a link to some existing tools such as an app that is perfect for the novice to tinker with and a link to some free powerful software that is perfect for the overachievers and as this project grows we will be happy to share links to the best videos for viewing. Follow us at HoloGram Pyramid on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to view and share comments, videos, ideas and perhaps even more if all of our R&D pans out!\nIf you have never backed a Kickstarter campaign here is the perfect opportunity. This is a fun, inexpensive gadget that is a great learning tool for all ages and it makes a great gift!\nWe intend to begin manufacturing as soon as the campaign concludes and is funded. We will do everything we can to expedite fulfillment and we look forward to your comments, videos and links! \nWe have a number of Kickstarter campaigns that we are hoping to launch as soon as our R&D is complete, however; we thought this would be a quick and easy project to use as a test run so we can gain insight on the overall crowdfunding process from conception to fulfillment. Plus this helps us raise the necessary funds to cover our costs to produce and provide an actual working version of this simple but effective illusion and is further allowing us to create an even more exciting new product based on this concept!
