Each player starts with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). Each turn you get a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck.\nShared between all players is an 80-card Market Deck. The game begins with five cards from that deck revealed, creating the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions.

Fueled by military precision and an unprecedented alliance with Dragons, the Imperial Armies knew countless victories and few defeats. The Empire grew until its greatest enemy was not any of the barbarian nations to the east, but its own unmanageable size. At the frontier, victories and expansion were replaced by an endless cycle of rebellion and re-conquest. \nWeary of war, the Emperor crafted a bold new strategy: Peace through trade. One hundred and seventy years ago, he ordered the establishment of Thandar, an independent frontier trading post at the junction of the four great rivers.\nThough many argued peace with the wild tribes was impossible, trade flourished and the trading post quickly grew to a town, then into a small city, and beyond... \nHero Realms is set in the sprawling metropolis that Thandar has grown into. The city-state is now home to folk from all the species and nations of the known world. While Thandar's trade has delivered its promised peace to nations, the wealth generated by its trade spurs endless political and physical conflict amongst it's residents...\nWhile at peace with its barbarian neighbors to the east, the Empire still clings to its military traditions. Its highly-trained soldiers, reality-bending wizards, and deadly dragons comprise the best fighting force the world has ever known.\nImperial's cards will allow you to gain health, and they frequently become more powerful as you have more champions in play.\nElven kingdoms older than recorded human history, ravaging orc war hosts, savage nomadic human tribes, trolls, and deadly wild beasts can all be found in vast wild lands east of the Empire.\nWild cards can give you large amounts of combat, force your opponent to discard cards, and allow you to draw and discard to cycle quickly through your deck. \nThe fortune in trade that flows through Thandar has fueled a powerful organized crime syndicate know as \"The Guild.\" The Guild has its hand in everything from petty street crime, to bribery or blackmail of political figures, to assassinations of those who would interfere with profits.\nGuild cards will give you large amounts of gold, allow you to stun (remove from play) opposing champions without spending combat, and let you acquire cards to the top of your deck or directly into your hand.\nThe Necros cult festers in the city's underbelly, preying on the homeless, the forgotten, and any that dare challenge them. The necromancers, vampires and cultists that fill the ranks of the Necros have been granted dark powers from the demons they worship.\nYour Necros cards allow you to sacrifice cards from your hand or discard pile, culling the weak cards from your deck and improving your future draws.\nThe Art\nThe price tag for our games may be relatively small, but with all our products, White Wizard Games strives for industry leading art. Our creative director, Darwin Kastle, personally works with each artist to bring his vision to life.\n  Ordering Multiple Sets\nWe know some backers like to order multiple sets. Maybe you want to keep your set for campaigning with friends on your game shelf and have an extra copy for your back pack for pick-up games. Or maybe you want to give some as gifts.\nWhen ordering multiples sets, you only pay shipping once, so teaming up with your friends for one big order can be a great way to save on shipping.\nTo order multiple sets simply back at the highest level that you are ordering and add in the cost for the additional sets you are getting.\nFor examples, lets say you wanted to get a Character Tier and two Gamer Tiers and you live in the USA. You would back at the Character Tier level and pledge a total of $103 ($45 (Character Tier) + $8 (shipping) + $25 + $25 (2 Gamer Tiers)).  \nShipping\nWe are making some improvements based on lessons learned from our last Kickstarter campaign, most notably every shipment will be packed in a box (NO bubble mailers).\nFor those of you backing from outside of the USA, we are using Customs-Friendly shipping. Here are the details from our shipping company:\n\"Backers in the USA, Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are all covered by Customs-Friendly by Ship Naked.\nWhen a package ships Customs-Friendly by Ship Naked, we ship it through one of our many depots around the world directly to your door. This means that if you are in a Customs-Friendly region, you should not have any additional costs for receiving your reward package (customs fees, brokerage charges, etc). We pay the import costs to the local authorities when we import into your region.\nShip Naked guarantees their Customs-Friendly service. If you are in a Customs-Friendly region and you have any additional charges for receiving your package, Ship Naked will reimburse you directly for those costs via PayPal.\"\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe future of Hero Realms\nJust like with our other products, after the Kickstarter campaign is complete, Hero Realms will continue to grow. We will release an ongoing campaign of cooperative adventures, with a story that takes place over time. Make your mark in an adventure that takes place in Thandar and beyond! As the story develops, the game will develop, and the characters will progress with new options that will keep the game fresh and exciting!\nFor competitive players, Hero Realms launches with all of the deep strategy featured in Star Realms. And, just like in that game, we will continue to grow the game with optional expansions that will expand the scope and the depth of gameplay options. We will also provide support for organized play so that you can battle for prizes and fame.\nThank you for your support! We love making these games and we couldn't do it without the help of Kickstarter backers like you!\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with Star Realms and Epic, our backers are going to get an awesome game, delivered quickly.

There are so many different ways to play Hero Realms: Heads-up battles, multiplayer battles, different characters, bosses, campaigns, and character development. To give you all this awesome gameplay (and it is AWESOME), we had to do a TON of design, development, graphic design and art acquisition. All of that is very expensive, and that money is already spent.

What turned out to be endless months (years) of \u201cfine-tuning our business plan and strategy\u201d finally ended in fruition once Eric Tilley came on board and things got super serious.\nEric, Ben, and Corey\nBen and Corey have known each other for longer than Ben and Corey can remember, and have embarked on a number of business ventures together; from smashing watermelons in bathrooms to record the perfect \u201chead being crushed in\u201d sound effect, to winning prestigious awards in the field of Audio Design for Radio Plays: Subclass \u2013 Science-fiction (Birke knows). Ben and Corey can remember when they met Eric, but they don't hold that against him. Eric honed his craft independently and is a graduate of the Siebel Institute, which, again, is not held against him. Eric is a self-proclaimed malt man, while Ben and Corey are registered hop heads.\nOur plan is to open a 2Bbl brewery with a tasting room in just under 3,000sf. The location is great, but the space needs a lot of build out to get ready for brewing beer. We are 100% self-financed, and although it will be a tight race, our budget of $70k SHOULD get us over the finish line - probably not sprinting over the line, most likely hobbling over with a significant limp. However, that metaphorical finish line isn't necessarily set in stone, and the last thing we want to have happen is to pass out from exhaustion in the home stretch. We need a safety net; a cushion; a boost; a kick start, if you will.\nWe need your money cause we don't have much. If we had a bunch of money we would just offer you amazing beers and goodies, without having to first beg you for money to let us do just that.\nWhen the doors of Decibel open for the first time it will be because of the love and support offered by the lot of you and not because of our wealthy families or greedy banks. We plan to start as small as economically feasible and to grow as fast as possible.\nDecibel feels a responsibility to be as earth-friendly as possible, and we will be practicing that belief as wholly as possible. We will donate our spent grain to local farms and business to make dog biscuits and other consumables. Our water will be recycled for cleaning and sanitizing so that it is used as many times as possible before it is discarded. We will compost our used hops and recycle our packing materials. It is our intention to one day install solar panels on the roof of our building so that our beer is produced using all renewable energy.\nREWARDS!!!!\nUpdated with some new pictures of the cool stuff you can get.\n Round Decibel stickers\n16oz Belgian style beer glass with the awesome Decibel logo \n 64oz Growler\n An assortment of shirt colors, we also have black, green, and maroon.\n Blue women's style shirt\n Gray men's style shirt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenges, challenges, hmmm... where to start.\n\nNot sure how many of y'all have tried to start a business from scratch before, but if you haven't I can safely assure you that the whole process is riddled with challenges.

In the land of Van Cliburn, where classical piano holds pride of place, Jack is a former prodigy who has withdrawn to his family's land. His wife has left him, and the week of the annual county piano competition he puts his fist through a wall, threatening to derail his performance and burn his last remaining bridge to the town he grew up in. When the local corporate farm ratchets up the pressure on him to sell his land, his only allies are Phillip, the cantankerous, elderly owner of the local Mexican restaurant and Alyssa, a teenage spitfire with dreams of being a farmer. Jack Ridge is living in the past, but the future is coming for him.\nIn the spring of 2013, director David Franklin pitched the bare-bones of an idea to actor and playwright Paden Fallis.  The premise was this: a man who never lived up to his potential is stuck living on his family's farmland in Texas, unable to break free from his past.  One week later, Paden had written the first 50 pages of what would turn out to be As Far As The Eye Can See. \nHow did we get from the first 50 pages to the first day of principal photography on June 8th, 2015?\nTwo years of dogged, determined work, that's how. After those first 50 pages, Paden went on to finish a full first draft of the script. And in August of 2013, we took a big step forward when 12 actors gathered in New York\u2019s East Village to read through the script with a select group of industry friends in attendance. After hearing the enthusiastic feedback from that first reading, we knew we had a movie. We also knew we had a lot more work to do.\nSo we re-wrote. We reached out to our friends for feedback. Then there were more rewrites, and then more. In October of 2014 Paden and David flew to Texas to visit the North East corner of the state, interview farmers, musicians, and scout locations for a summer 2015 shoot. And when January rolled around, we made the decision: We would shoot in June come hell or high water. (The second part of that really did come true with the torrential flooding that plagued central Texas in the spring.) We spent the next few months lining up investors, assembling a crew, hiring a casting director, and auditioning actors. By May, we were ready.\nNeither David or I will ever forget or take for granted the many, many people (some who knew us well, some who did not) who helped - with their money, their time, their ideas, their connections and their goodwill.  To think of where we would be without them makes us shudder.  We would be nowhere.\nAnd because of them, As Far As The Eye Can See is now in the can.  But the work continues...\nNow that we are hip-deep in post-production, we realize we have a stronger film than we could have anticipated.  Working through the first edit has us aiming even higher than before.  We believe we are sitting on something special and we are seeking additional funds to help with post-production costs, along with the fees for submitting to festivals. \nWe thank you for your consideration in helping us reach our goal.  In a very real way, we've already reached it.  We've made a movie.  And, as you can see from the trailer, As Far As The Eye Can See is not an idea, not a concept, not a series of storyboards - it's a movie.  To steal a football metaphor (aptly in football season), we are at the goal line and we seek your help in pushing this thing across for a touchdown.\nThank you and bless you!\nJason made his film debut in Robert Mulligan's The Man in the Moon opposite Reese Witherspoon in 1991.

As caretakers for kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends. Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your kodama as happy as possible. Whoever cares for their kodama best will be remembered for generations!\nFrom the designer of the hit game Kigi, Kodama branches out into a fun new way to play! Grow your tree by placing cards in clever arrangements, being careful to leave room for future growth. At the end of each season, one kodama will award you points for how well your tree suits its needs. With beautiful art and innovative mechanics, Kodama is an inTREEguing game for the whole family.\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the newest Small Box/Big Fun game from Action Phase Games, playing in under 45 minutes for 2-5 players. We encourage you to view the videos directly below for more information. Or simply peruse our rule book here.\n \nThe Deluxe Edition of the game includes the below components in addition to the ones above:\nThe story of Kodama is an interesting one indeed. Initially, we sought to publish Daniel's game Kigi, but felt we could help to develop a few elements of the game. Two months later, we realized that we had a much different game than Kigi and Kodama took seed! (You can read more about this here in Daniel's Design Diary.)\nWhile both games come from similar roots, Kodama provides a very different game experience from its predecessor.\nHere are the differences in Kigi and Kodama:\nTHEME: In Kodama, players cultivate homes (trees) for the kodama.\nPLACEMENT: In Kodama, there is no pruning, but rather a 10 point scoring cap for placement that encourages diversity while leaving players with a beautiful tree by the end of the game. Additionally, players now only place branches on their own trees.\nFEATURES: Not only are all of the features updated to help represent the theme, there are now six features as opposed to five.\nGOALS: In Kigi, goals came in the form of Commission cards that were shuffled into the branch deck. Now, players are dealt four kodama cards, three of which they will score over three seasons.\nSEASONS: Play is now divided into three seasons: Spring, Summer, and Fall. At the beginning of each season a Decree will be revealed which will add or amend a rule in the game--adding more replayability and strategy to placement. After placing four branches, players will select one of their Kodama cards to score. At the end of three seasons, players score a final Kodama card and a winner is determined!\nKodama: The Tree Spirits is the fifth project from Action Phase Games and was designed by the very talented Daniel Solis. With the successful execution of our first four projects, we have become experienced as publishers. We will confidently execute this project to the same high standard.\nThe deluxe edition, containing additional content and upgraded components, will not be available in retail.\nDaniel Solis has successfully designed a game that is accessible to gamers of all ages and levels of experience. Kodama is innovative while remaining easy to learn and play. Because of these factors, we have every confidence that this game will be played for years to come.\nPeople who have demoed and play-tested this game have uniformly loved it for its original mechanics, charm, artistic beauty, and accessibility. While the game takes under 45 minutes to teach and play, it offers a surprising amount of tactical depth and replay value.\nAll of the art assets (with the exception of the 3 Become a Guardian pledge levels) are complete.\nThe game is full of charming illustrations by the extremely gifted Kwanchai Moriya, with graphic design by the equally talented Scott Hartman.\nNot only do we offer free shipping in the US, but this project is EU friendly, too.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project \u2014 we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any over-funding goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. You'll get access weeks before it's made available to everyone else!\nPledge levels vary from just $1 to several hundred dollars. And each different level opens up a new creative reward.

A return to the hardcore combat racer, bristling with heavy weapons and packing ferocious speed, the game is an intense, sensory feast.  Harnessing the awesome potential of Epic's Unreal Engine 4, GRIP will take you back to your nostalgic past, while simultaneously propelling you into a kick-ass future.\nHaving completed the initial prototype (seen in the trailers), we're on Kickstarter to ask for your help in funding the game's full development.

We want your input. We want your feedback. We want your passion.\nBecause we're making this game for you - the undying fans of combat racers who have been patiently waiting for the next one they can play with their friends until all hours of the night.\nWe want most modes to come with various options to increase replay value, such as weather changes and time of day, as well as modifiers that let you enable or disable certain pick-ups and change how they work.  Want an explosive match where racers are equipped only with unlimited mines?  You can do that.  How about disabling pick-ups altogether to make it just about the driving skill?  Sure, why not.\nThere will also be variations on game modes, like knock-out (eliminate last place driver each lap) as well as points for inflicting the most damage.\nOur aim is to supply the player with the ability to cater their experience to how they want to play.   This customization will extend to other options menus as well, including graphics, where you'll be able to tweak to your heart's content on PC.\nWe want the fans to help decide what features get put into the game. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the \u201cBacker\u2019s Choice!\u201d stretch goals.  Once a stretch goal is hit, the backers will post in the comments what stretch goal they most want to see happen.  We\u2019ll then pick the stretch goal with the most votes and cross it off the list.  This gives you - the gamers - the power to make the game you want to play.\nAn illicit sport that spread like napalm\nGRIP has its origins in the illegal street racing scene that spawned in the early 21st century. At that time the races were reasonably harmless. A danger to the public, certainly, with inexperienced drivers managing to destroy their rides in ill-judged corners. But most of the time, it was only the drivers themselves that wound-up dead. It was characterized as an underground movement, largely ignored by law enforcement, with only a handful of arrests ever being made. The world had other worries.\nThen things started to change. The scene became dominated by major players with big egos. Full of bravura, their cars evolved and became all about the speed, and with that the danger began to grow. Elements of the public started to become interested in the drama and a whole new subculture gravitated towards the action. This was racing alright, and everyone in it was out to win, whatever the cost. Accidents happened often, and that too became part of the allure. This sport was really taking off, despite the intensifying efforts of authorities to bury it.\nIn the end, the races became so testosterone-fueled and running so close to the edge that even pirate TV started to cover them. The channel known simply as GRIP became synonymous with the whole scene, which exploded with massive public interest running counter to government crackdowns on the problem. Funded by gambling income and black-market TV subscriptions, the hacker crew running the TV link became very wealthy indeed.\nThe drivers in these races quickly realized what they were missing, and they were more than just a little displeased, they were harbouring some righteous anger. Some TV network taking over their scene - taking all the rewards yet sharing none of the risks, what the hell was that about? The fury erupted, and the big dogs made their grab for power. Fierce fighting broke out between the two groups, but the network was no match for the drivers and gave way to superior force. Faced with no choice but to accept the offer they were given, a balance of power was struck, and everyone moved forward. The network retained a cut, but the drivers were now collecting an income for their risk, a real income that allowed them to pimp their speed machines even further.\nBut money corrupts, and in GRIP it corrupted absolutely. The cut from the races was split between all the drivers, those that ended first received the most, and those that didn\u2019t end at all, well, received nothing. It wasn\u2019t long before this fact was viciously exploited. The cars, originally built purely for racing, slowly evolved to become armed, and armoured. Fewer people finishing a race meant more money for those that did.  It wasn\u2019t just about racing any more, it was about destroying your rivals along the way.\nThe government really couldn\u2019t tolerate such an obscene display of violence and weaponry in their backyard. The regular police were hopelessly outclassed, so they sent in the military. But as they became increasingly involved, this just added to the whole drama of the scene. Though still very much underground, it was becoming rampantly popular. It was everyone\u2019s favourite new addiction, their guilty pleasure. For the drivers though, the military intervention was just killing it. The racing was already intense enough, but fighting on two fronts was all but impossible. Something had to be done, this was a way of life now, and it wasn\u2019t going to just stop. So the whole thing started to move, not just into the far reaches of the desert where it would be less conspicuous, but eventually off-world to try and find places where they could race to the max without wasting munition on government forces that they would much rather save to fight against each other. It was all about the winning.\nNow, in the age of streamlined interstellar travel, GRIP has come of age with its fiery cocktail of cars and carnage spreading throughout the known star systems - the organizers now crashing exotic planets and bulldozing environments to create improvised race tracks to battle upon. That is, until the region's authorities show up and try to ruin the party with a hail of gunfire and rockets. Not only are racers dealing with each other's explosive tendencies, they now contend with a fierce war between those that want the anarchy to continue, and those that would extinguish what could become the biggest televised spectacle in the galaxy.\nWelcome to GRIP.\nJust as in Rollcage, the cars in GRIP are extraordinary. With larger wheels that extend not just below the frame but also above it, with GRIP's cars there is no right way up and they can flip sides whenever they need to and just keep on thrusting forwards. But that\u2019s not all. These cars also develop a tremendous amount of down-force, so much down-force in fact that driving on walls and even ceilings becomes possible. And in GRIP, this isn\u2019t just possible, at times it\u2019s essential. It\u2019s all about survival, and getting to the end of the race, whatever it takes.\nAll of the vehicles in GRIP are heavily armed, and most of them heavily armoured. There\u2019s a variety to choose from, ranging from sleek and light thoroughbreds built purely for speed, all the way over to ironclad behemoths that can not only deal out the punishment, but also take it. Whatever your thing is, there\u2019s a ride in GRIP with your name all over it.\nUPGRADES\nYou will start with a very capable car as you enter the GRIP arena, anything less would be suicide. Slowly but surely however, you will be able to upgrade your car with money earned from scoring a decent race position as well as salvage recovered along the track while racing. The more you win, the more you earn, the faster and more devastating your car becomes. Not only that, but you\u2019ll be able to visually customize your beast with a selection of paint-jobs, rims, wheels and body armour kits.  Make your mark on the track as you exit the pit lane ready to put on a show for the carnage-hungry race fans.\nIt\u2019s not enough to just cross the finish line first in GRIP, more important is how you got there, and how much destruction you wrought upon your rivals along the way. Weapons and power-ups are now an integral part of the races that you will be taking part in. Here is a selection of what will potentially be on offer:\nWe are aware that we chose a brown desert planet as our showcase track for the prototype.  We love colour as much as anyone else, so don't worry, we've got some pretty exotic environments in store that will expand the palette.\nLiddo 5: A sphere encompassed by lush alien jungle that is very much alive.  The GRIP league drop their materials and crew through the thick canopy of trees to lay as much track as they can before the planet starts to take over again.  The world was once peppered with research facilities, but most have subdued to the plant life's lust for reclaiming its territory.\nOrbital Prime: Essentially a floating metropolis, this planet is one big city, devoid of landscape, vegetation or wild life. What it lacks in natural colour, it makes up for with its Red Sun district and flashy advertisements. Orbital Prime is mostly a seedy, corrupt place full of outcasts and criminals, and would make the perfect place to drop a race if it weren't for the affluent oligarchs running the show with the local militia rewarded well to assert their will.\nNorvos: Once a highly utilized military installation that strategically borders an opposing planet, this cold, barren landscape became just too hostile for habitation. Knives of ice jut out from the planet's hardened crust, and brutal ice storms mercilessly ravage the surface without end. Authorities rarely attempt to shut down the races here, and for good reason.\nJahtra: What we would call the very epitome of blistering desert, this arid but resource rich location quickly showed itself to be ideal for GRIP's show-downs.  With its massive surface size, access to an abundance of fuel and the ability to drop track sections in and out with ease, Jahtra quickly became a prime racing location.\n We've been lucky, and are very honoured to have such an impressive roster of musicians involved with this game.  Not only that, but they love what they see of GRIP and are making their passion clear for wanting to create some truly wicked tunes for the game.  Having Technical Itch and Dom & Roland on board is especially cool because they were on the soundtrack for Rollcage Stage II.\nThe search for the right people has been stressful but exciting, and we're really happy with how it's turned out.  This is going to be one hell of a great original soundtrack\nhttps://soundcloud.com/techitch\nhttps://soundcloud.com/solinvicto\nhttps://soundcloud.com/domandroland\nhttps://soundcloud.com/skynetaudio\nhttps://soundcloud.com/xtigma\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rex-mundi-music\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tylermichaud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ogresound\nhttps://soundcloud.com/loudcoremusic\nGRIP is set to release on PC via the Steam platform, and PS4 via the PlayStationNetwork. The game has already been green-lit on Steam in a flatteringly short space of time, and an agreement has been made with Sony to pave the way for GRIP to appear on their console too. So with the initial formalities out of the way, there is little stopping the game getting to market.\nShould we receive enough funding via KickStarter, the development of GRIP will continue directly from our prototype phase and straight into full-thrust development. From our very carefully considered schedules we anticipate that the game will be complete some time before the end of 2016.\nFollowing our main, general release on PC and PS4, we will then take a view on whether to release on other platforms. If the user figures are good, and we have the funds to do it, then we will do just that. If so, we anticipate that this will take in the order of 2 to 3 months to port, with delivery sometime during Q2 2017.\nEARLY ACCESS\nWe regard GRIP as a community-led project, one where we will be producing the best work we can, but with input and feedback from you, our backers. We have clear ideas about what we think the game should be, the story, the themes and the styling of it all. The complex, yet relatively effortless vehicle handling, fused with the brutality and violence of the weaponry. We have the key elements in place, but we encourage you to give your help in forming them. For that, we will of course be using an early access program.\nAll backers are urged to use the design forum on our web site (forum.cagedelement.com) to help shape the game\u2019s direction, and make the furious combat racer we\u2019ve all been waiting for, for so long. In addition, there are two programs to let you get access early to iterations in order to actually plug your controller in and get racing.\nThe pre-beta early access backing tier is for people that want hands-on as soon as practically possible. It will, at first, allow you to play two tracks from the game with two different vehicles, along with two different weapon types. This will give you a real feel for the game without spoiling the full experience for you. You get a taste of what GRIP is, and to offer early feedback, while looking forward to what the full game has to offer when we\u2019ve finished forging it from iron and steel. Oh yes. You think we use mere code for this game?\nBeta access will be granted a few months before general release - allowing those in the beta access backing tier to dive into total GRIP immersion in an essentially complete game. We expect this will require considerable external testing to iron out any multiplayer bugs that may have escaped our attention, and we absolutely want to get that firmly nailed before release. Make no mistake though, we won\u2019t present our beta to you until we know you can play with all the game's features without impediment. This will be full, primal contact.\nSo that we could concentrate more fully on the creative process of making a great game for you, we decided to leverage the power of Unreal Engine 4 in bringing GRIP to life. With its huge, well-established user base, the use of Unreal Engine has significantly reduced the technical risks involved in producing a game like this.\nPowering games like the new Unreal Tournament, Fable Legends, Eve Valkyrie and Street Fighter V, it allows us to bring you the very best in rendering quality available today. GRIP will not just play well, it will also look great.\nThe very progressive physics and handling of the vehicles found in GRIP demand a strong physics system on which to develop them. PhysX, beating at the heart of Unreal Engine, is that system. Independent of which GPU you might have, PhysX delivers a swift and robust solution to our demanding vehicle needs via the CPU. At speeds of 600+ kph, and with monstrous down-force allowing you to drive on roads, walls and ceilings, you have to know that the engine can hold things together for you.\nMultiplayer too is a key feature of GRIP and something we well know we have to get right. And that too, is something that Unreal Engine provides substantial support for. Whereas in most multiplayer games the majority of the development time is spent getting the technology right, in GRIP, the majority of our time will be spent getting the gameplay right.\nGRIP is a newly-born IP produced by a newly-born team. Until recently, just two people working together at furious pace to produce the GRIP prototype. Now, a small studio called Caged Element.  The team is starting to grow, and likewise its combined industry experience.\nWe collectively have worked on dozens of titles starting back in the mid-nineties. Two of our number in particular, worked on the original Rollcage titles published by Psygnosis. Having key roles in bringing those games to life and making them what they were, we understand our market very well and exactly what people are hoping to see in GRIP.\nWe\u2019re a small studio, concentrating solely on creating the best game experience we can for you, the player. We have no interest in luxurious offices or expensive cars - after you\u2019ve driven the cars in GRIP, cars in the real world leave you wanting whatever they might be. Our primary, and only goal, is to deliver our best work in the production of this game.\nThus far, GRIP has been developed collaboratively, and without any financial investment at all. All of our involvement, to immerse ourselves in this idea and see where we could take it. We\u2019ve worked for many months to bring the prototype to life, to prove the concept and then gauge the response to that. It\u2019s been overwhelming and our instincts were right, GRIP has a hungry audience. There is a lot of love out there for Rollcage and for our new vision founded upon it. We\u2019re talking to talented people the world over who are excited to become involved with GRIP to help us develop it further. There is no shortage of people eager to help bring this game to your screens.\nFor funding, Kickstarter, with no interest payments or investor percentages to be returned, is certainly the best way to deliver maximum reward for minimum investment to you, the gaming public. It\u2019s also an excellent way of involving those that want to collaborate with us. We're a collective of passionate and creative people that want to work with you to reach the very apex of what combat racing can be. Kickstarter gives us, and you, that platform. We\u2019re all gamers here, let\u2019s see what we can do.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many complexities associated with GRIP's development that need to be managed. We know this, because we\u2019ve been through the development process many times before.\n\nThe team here has a wealth of experience in producing high-profile titles. We know the common pitfalls of projects like this; the technology risks, the staffing issues, the funding calculation errors and scheduling mistakes that people so often make. We\u2019ve seen it all and we learned very early. There is some risk, of course, but we know how to mitigate it and how to manage the little that is left.\n\nWe also know how to make a great racing game. Having written half a dozen of them before now there is little left to give us any surprises. Many of the algorithms you need to write a game of this sort such as vehicle setup, racing AI, weapon management etc. have become second nature to us.\nWe\u2019ve already developed a substantial prototype to prove that Unreal Engine can handle a game of this kind. It\u2019s scored well in all areas, including the specialized vehicle physics setup that GRIP demands. The only major feature we\u2019ve not yet explored in this prototype is multiplayer, though Unreal Engine provides a lot of support in this area.\n\nThe key to getting multiplayer working well in any game is to give it abundant testing over a long period of time. We intend to do just that by adding it right at the beginning of the main thrust of development, and test with a quorum of around 100 players regularly throughout the game\u2019s development span. Towards the end we will expand the test program to several thousand players in order to work through any remaining issues well before the game\u2019s official release.\n\nOur main focus however, isn\u2019t the technology, with our past experience and using Unreal Engine 4, we pretty much have that licked. No, our main focus is making the game you want, we want, and delivering it to you on time, and on budget. To that end, we\u2019ve produced a very well-considered and detailed schedule founded on an equally detailed game design specification. We have high confidence that our development figures are correct, with ample time for slippage, and that consequently we are asking for an accurate funding level here to cover the costs of development.\n\nSo with the business stuff out of the way, our only remaining challenge is to create an adrenalin-fuelled game that you just can\u2019t put down. The challenge we\u2019re savouring the most, the one we can\u2019t wait to attack. We think that we've made it clear with what we've already shown of GRIP that our time has come - and soon will yours.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Caged Element\nFirst created \u00b7 16 backed\nCaged Element - a small game dev studio making GRIP, a futuristic combat racer inspired by the Rollcage gamesSee more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "GRIP launching Nov 6th for PC/Xbox/PS4/Switch!

Growing up I've always loved science, but finding science kits for girls that weren't just about soap and makeup was always a struggle. Even today we see lots of \"gross\" and messy science kits marketed for boys in toy aisles and not enough of those science kits in the girls' aisles. \nWomen are vastly under-represented in STEM fields, particularly, in engineering, computer science, and physical science. In the workforce, women only comprise 13% of the engineering profession and 25% of the computer and mathematical professions. \nI believe that if girls had more access to cool science and accessories that doesn\u2019t talk down to them, coupled with videos featuring accessible and relatable female scientists, we could make a real impact on those statistics.\nI'm creating StemBox to give young girls access to real science in a way that doesn't make them feel that they're in a class being tested on their abilities. I want girls to create an emotional and inspiring connection with science that fuels them to achieve their goals and create their own futures before they are dissuaded from pursuing science.  \nStemBox is a subscription box and video series that gets girls excited about STEM.  Each box contains sophisticated labware and reagents for the science experiment, a protocol, fun science accessories, and a link to our corresponding videos.  Our educational videos feature in-depth explanation from a real female role model working in that box\u2019s field.\nTarget age range: 7-13\nUpcoming StemBoxes\nThere are so many cool things in STEM that we want to share with girls! Here's a peek at what future boxes will focus on: \nAviation and aerodynamics, computer programming games, astronomy and space sciences, crystallized structures and rock candy, math and spacial reasoning, bacteria and culturing, pH and Litmus Strip scavenger hunts, chromatography and candy, engineering kits, and so many other exciting experiments! \nMaking StemBox Real\nOne of our StemBoxers dissecting an owl pellet!\nHere are real parents talking about StemBox:\n\"My daughter was first reluctant to get out home Saturday morning, but after the workshop she was super excited. In the afternoon, she taught the workshop to several friends at our home!\"\n\"It was hands on and made interesting for kids....my daughter is all over DNA now.\"\n\"Very hands-on, sparked the love of learning more about science in my daughter.\"\n\"My daughter was really glad there was nothing about the experiment that made it \"more for girls\" such as pink gloves etc. She was really happily surprised.\"\n\"Thank you! My daughter came home and taught her younger sister how to extract DNA too. She is looking forward to the next workshop.\"\n\"Loved it! Fills a gap in the school system\"\n\"The girls were so excited after and just couldn't stop talking about the things they learned. They told me all about what they learned and what they did. This conversation transitioned into theorizing about other things (\"What does the air have to do with gravity? Are they related mom?\") I love how once their gears started turning they just didn't stop. I asked if science class at school was as fun and the response was a resounding \"No way!\" ... Later in the day they took inspiration from what they learned in their imaginative play. Here's some awesome sound bites for you: \"I can't wait to make more DNA!\" \"Wouldn't it be cool if we could put these on necklaces and wear them to school to show everyone? I have some perfect string for this\" \"Science is overwhelming, just because of the big words\" \"It's fun to be overwhelmed!\" \"\nI also conducted a short pre-sale of our DNA Extraction box to see what it would be like to ship out boxes, work out any kinks, and to test our business model. Things went really well and we were able to test our boxes with different families around the country. \nYou can see an unboxing of our DNA box by Stephanie Evans of The Stemulus here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nrShnVLBLw\nWhat Kickstarter Money Will Be Used For...\nThe money raised by this Kickstarter will go towards a myriad of things to improve the quality of the boxes, the videos, and the company as a whole. I want to build better boxes with more cool accessories for our girls. This means that I will need money to hire people to help me create computer programs for our programming boxes, to pay our videographers to film and edit our interviews and tutorials, to purchase items in bulk to make the boxes cost effective, and to commission professionals in the field for their help in designing future boxes and writing accurate and educational scripts and protocols. \nStemBox videos are an integral part of the mission we have to encourage girls to explore science without preconceived ideas that may deter them from entering the field. Growing up without any visible female scientists at the level of popularity as Bill Nye the Science Guy, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, or Carl Sagan is something that subliminally reminds our girls that women don't rise to the top of popular science. If they can't see themselves in successful positions of science, they are less likely to pursue those career paths. \nOur videos are comprised of two parts: an informational session about the topic at hand with a professional in the field and a Q&A with the professional that helps us highlight the women working in STEM as relatable personalities that girls can look up to. \nFor our first two boxes, we have begun editing and producing videos highlighting female scientists working in the fields related to our boxes. I have built meaningful and exciting relationships with local companies to gain access to some really awesome people. \nOur first box features an interview with me at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center where I work in a lab researching gene therapies. In the video I get to tell the girls more about DNA, show them what it looks like in a lab, describe what it is is like to work in research, and tell the girls a little bit about myself and my journey to science. \nOur second box features an interview with Ros, a raptor keeper at the Woodland Park Zoo here in Seattle. We got to learn a lot about owls, what it's like to work as a raptor keeper, and how Ros became interested in owls. \nInterviewing Rosalind at the Woodland Park Zoo\nBehind the scenes of our Owl interview at the Woodland Park Zoo with Ros the Raptor Keeper, and Coba the Owl!\nThese videos are instrumental in exposing girls to female role models in science and showing them that being involved in STEM isn't a purely academic trajectory. \n $5- WELCOME TO THE TEAM \n$27- EARLY BIRD DNA or OWL PELLET BOX!

It packs all the amazing game play and beautiful art of a trading card game in one little box at an unbelievably low price.\nEpic Card Game is funded! Thank you so much for your support. We'll be adding various stretch goals as we hit different funding levels, making this already awesome game an even more incredible value!\n  You don't have to add any additional shipping for the playmat, but be sure you include shipping in your order. If you pledge over the base $20 for the gamer set tier, you must manually add shipping. Shipping is $6 in the US, $10 to Canada, $12 to the EU, and $15 to the rest of the world. So, for example, if a US backer were ordering two gamer set tiers and two playmats he should pledge $20+$20+$25+$25+$6 = $96.\nWe designed Epic to provide great draft and sealed deck play right out of the box. If you are a trading card game veteran, you know what this means, and yes, it is every bit as awesome as you think it would be.\nIf you haven't played trading card games before, you are in for a real treat. Sealed and draft are incredibly fun! Unfortunately, with trading card games, they are also incredibly expensive (like $10-$30 every time you play). \nBut with Epic, you get the fun without that scary price tag. A single $15 box of Epic allows up to four people to play draft or sealed again and again with great game play every single time.\nJust that would be an unbelievable amount of game for the money, but there are more ways to play. By simply dividing up the cards by the four colors (yellow, red, green and blue) you will have four preconstructed decks, each balanced for play against the others.\nWith sealed, draft, and preconstucted decks, up to four players can play out of a single copy of the game. There is another way to play, called \"constructed,\" where each player needs their own copy of the game. In constructed, you build a deck at home using your entire Epic card collection to play against a friend who did the same thing.\nWhile Epic gives you the full trading card game experience at a tiny fraction of the cost, Epic is NOT a trading card game.There are no random packs or hard to get cards. When you buy the game, you get everything you need to play. You know exactly what cards you're getting. There will be expansions down the road, but they are optional. You can literally play and enjoy hundreds of games with just the base set.\nThe first war of the gods tore the world apart. Each god continually remaking reality was more than the universe could withstand\u2026 The great nothingness returned, leaving the gods to bicker in the void.\nEventually, a compromise was reached. The gods joined forces to create the universe anew, but this time there were rules that even they must obey. No longer could gods battle directly, tugging against one another on the fabric of reality. Now their wars are fought in the mortal world with mighty champions and devastating events.\nIn Epic, each player starts the game with a score of 30 health. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by reducing their health to 0. Set up is fast. To play a basic game, just shuffle and deal each player a 30 card deck and you are ready to go!\nYou start the game with a hand of five cards, and draw a new card at the start of your turn. Your cards represent powerful champions that will fight for you or game changing events you can use to thwart your opponent.\nEach turn every player in the game gets one \"gold.\" Some cards cost a gold to play, others are free. This means you can play any card in your hand from the very first turn. There is no slow building of resources in this game. Epic starts at full throttle!\nA game of Epic might go something like this:\nOn your first turn, you play a Frost Giant and attack your opponent. Not wanting to take 8 damage, he plays a Surprise Attack and drops a T-Rex on the board, blocking and killing your giant. You Fireball the injured dinosaur finishing it off, then end your turn.  Your opponent draws a card at the start of his turn, then plays a Dark Knight and attacks you for 5, knocking you down to 25 Health. Then he plays a Blue Dragon, drawing a card and blasting you down to 23 health. You need some answers, so before your opponent ends his turn you play an Ancient Chant and draw 2 cards. Hmmm... What should you do next, wipe out the board with an Apocalypse or drop a massive Burrowing Wurm on the table? Welcome to turn two, Epic style!\nThe four colors of Epic cards each represent a different alignment. Yellow is good, red is evil, blue is sage and green is wild. Each alignment has its own strengths and weaknesses.\nLike in Star Realms, you can play cards of any and all colors in your deck. If you can match colors, your cards will frequently get more powerful.\nThe righteous, the honorable, protectors, healers, angels, saints, brave knights and benevolent kings. These are the forces of good.\nYour good cards will raise large armies of humans, protect your champions and increase your health. You will banish enemy champions to the bottom of your opponent's deck and launch devastating airborne assaults lead by glorious angels.\nSavage beasts, burning fire, terrible storms, instinct, aggression and rage. The wild don't have an agenda. They aren't good or evil, they're hungry... and your opponent looks like food. \nPlaying wild gives you giant monsters that can smash and stomp though your opponent's defenses. You'll hurl fire and lightning at your foes. Great storms, volcanoes and earthquakes will smash all that stand in your way.\nThe cruel, the murderous, vampires, assassins, demons, devils and zombies. These nightmares taken form are champions of evil.\nWith evil cards, you'll master death, killing champions in droves then bringing the dead back to serve a new master. Your vampires will shrug off mortal wounds and feed upon the forces of your enemies. Hordes of zombies and powerful demons will be yours to command, if you are willing to pay the price to summon them.\nThe wise, the clever, the logical, tricksters, scholars, illusionists, engineers, alchemists and wizards. For the sage, knowledge is power. Reason and logic will illuminate the path to victory.\nThrough sage cards you will master time, returning enemy champions to your opponent's hand. You will construct mighty engines of war and call upon powerful magic to transform or blast your enemies. You will mislead enemy armies, leaving your opponents defenseless and assuring your victory.

Visit us at www.picobrew.com/ks for more info. \nWe all love great craft beer and we think it should be treated with the respect it deserves.   Forget cans and bottles:  great craft beer should be served fresh from the keg and on tap, and for this you need a kegerator.\nUnfortunately today's kegerators are pretty lame.  They don't serve your beer at precise temperatures, you can't learn about the beer or even figure out what's on tap, and they certainly don't tell you how much beer you have left...\nThat's why we invented KegSmarts\u2122, the world's smartest craft beer kegerator.  KegSmarts\u2122 brings the brewhouse to your house!  Now you  can enjoy craft beer like you do at your favorite craft brewery but in the comfort of your own home!\nAlready have your own kegerator?  We've got you covered!  We make an add-on kit that allows you upgrade your existing kegerator with KegSmarts\u2122.\nHomebrewer?  We're the guys who invented the world's first fully-automatic all grain beer-brewing appliance, the PicoBrew Zymatic\u00ae.  KegSmarts\u2122 was designed to work seamlessly with Zymatic\u00ae and allow you to ferment your beer automatically and serve it perfectly.\nThis WiFi-enabled kegerator takes beer nerdery to the next level. -Playboy\nAvoid an empty keg with a brilliant beer tap that knows what's left and more. -Digital Trends\nPicobrew already brought you a badass beer-maker.  Now they're moving on to kegerators.    -GeekWire\nWe all love fresh craft beer, but if you don't have a kegerator, you're stuck with cans, bottles and growlers.   A kegerator is the quality-of-life-improver you need (just ask your friends)!\nAll kegerators are not created equal, however.  If you purchase our KegSmarts\u2122 kegerator you'll be getting the roomiest, coldest, most technology-decked-out kegerator on the planet...beer technology at its finest!\nIf you already home-brew, and particularly if you use our award-winning PicoBrew Zymatic\u00ae, you are a perfect candidate for KegSmarts\u2122!\nPLAY\n\nIf you already own a kegerator, you can most likely upgrade it with KegSmarts BYO.  Standard 2.5\" and 3\" towers work beautifully...\nHow in the world did we think of the smart kegerator?  Pull up a chair, there's a story here...\nPicoBrew was started in 2010 by two brothers, Bill and Jim Mitchell and their friend Avi Geiger.  The Mitchells were avid home brewers, while Avi was a craft beer aficionado.  Since Bill had been whiling away his time inventing things like smartphones and smartwatches, and Jim had been goofing off, pioneering food inventions with his famous grandfather (of Pop Rocks and Tang fame), it was almost a foregone conclusion that when they got together they would create the world's first automatic all-grain beer brewing appliance.   The three beer-loving partners introduced their invention, the award-winning PicoBrew Zymatic\u00ae, to the world in the Fall of 2013.  It was their first Kickstarter campaign.  They were nervous.  But thanks to craft beer lovers like you, they crushed their funding goal in a mere 24 hours, and went on to become the 2nd most successful Kickstarter Food campaign at the time.  \nAvi was not satisfied, however.  Now he had a limitless supply of great craft beer, but no way to really enjoy the craft brew experience home! \nA long sequence of prototypes followed.  \"The ultimate kegerator project\" snapped into focus in the Spring of 2014 when the team had the epiphany that a keg-tower-mounted solution would enable both new and existing kegerators to \"get keg smarts\".   With diligent effort fueled by lots of beer-testing, the product nears completion now, which is why we need your help....\nWe're ready to go to production.  But production costs money.  And we need to be sure that there are enough craft-beer lovers out there like us who think a smart kegerator is a good idea to pull this trigger..  Are we crazy?  Maybe ...we'll find out...\nIf you make a pledge today you can help bring KegSmarts\u2122 to market, and prove us sane.

Having the original actors (Matt Hannon, Mark Frazer, Robert Z'Dar, Melissa Moore, and Gerald Okamura) back will enable us to bring a lot of what you loved with their characters into this exciting sequel.  As you can see from the publicity pics, Matt and Mark have been frozen in time and are eager to continue where they left off in the previous film!\nOur team has previously been involved in the distribution of such cult classics as John Woo's THE KILLER, Takashi Miike's GOZU, and restored and brought the kung fu epic MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE to a new generation of audiences and oversaw the restoration of the original SAMURAI COP, remastered to beautiful HD from its damaged 35mm film negatives.  We also restored Shervan's KILLING AMERICAN STYLE and will be following up with YOUNG REBELS and the never before seen GYPSY.\nSPECIAL THANKS to Andrew Martin (Amir Shervan FB Fan Page), Carlo Vanstiphout/Tommy Maksymow (Samurai Cop FB Fan Page), 80sPictureHouseUK (Tina, Dave & Thom), Chris Armstrong (Wafu FM), Bristol Bad Film Club, Ryan Sorensen and Red Letter Media.\nTake part of the #KeepItWarmChallenge!

And if you want to learn more about the creation of this project, check out our interview with A Sound Effect!\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\n$7,000 - TREBUCHET!\n$5,300 - flanged mace  FUNDED!\n$5,600 - great helm FUNDED!\nAlright, now that we've gotten those boring firearms out of the way, it's time to get to the good stuff: medieval weapons!\nWhen we were making The Firearm Sound Library, two things were made apparent:\n1. Our backers were AWESOME!\n2. A lot of them wanted some older, medieval-type weapon recordings. \nHere is where we deliver!\nLet's talk about the project goal. We want to make a fairly comprehensive yet very affordable (AKA FREE) library that will have recordings of some common medieval-era weapons. That means bows, crossbows, knives, axes, spears, swords, slings, and all the implied impacts that anyone making a film or developing a game could use.\nAs with The Firearm Sound Library, quality and usability are the main goals. This means recording every sound effect at top settings, using top of the line equipment.\nBut affordability is also paramount, which is why (just like last time) we only have one reward set at $1, and after the library is complete it will become free to download! So donate what you can to the cause and help us create another library for the entire sound community to enjoy!\nNow, you all want to know how many sounds we will be recording and what they will be. Naturally, each specific sound listed will have multiple takes recorded to provide a wider range of diversity within each sound effect. Also, any interesting visual result (did the weapon penetrate the object or not, did an arrow break on impact, etc.) of the sound effects will be included to give you exactly the right knowledge you need. So the link below will take you to the list of sound effects that you will receive. We currently plan to record just under 500 unique sound effects...each with multiple takes. Take a look!\nSpreadsheet of Planned Sound Effects\nLet's briefly give a little more detail on some of the items being recorded:\nAvarian Recurve\nA light bow of classical east asian design, it is most suited to loose lighter arrows of around 500-600 grains at very high speeds. A very snappy sound is produced.\nEnglish Longbow\nOur bow has a draw weight of 90 pounds and will be loosing arrows weighing approximately 1000-1300 grains. We will be using arrows tipped with short bodkins, long bodkins, and broadheads.\nScythian Recurve\nAn unusual design, the scythian recurve has produced a very fluid, smooth sound when used. We will be using very light arrows of around 400 grains with this bow.\nCrossbow\nOur crossbow uses a steel prod and has a draw weight of 250 pounds. It is spanned by hand and fires extremely thick, short bolts that weigh about 800 grains. The sound of a steel prod crossbow being shot can only be described as \"wicked.\"\nSling\nWe will be using a simple sling made of leather and cord with pebbles for ammunition.\nSeax\nOur seax is of classic broken back design and has a blade length of about ten inches.\nDagger\nOur dagger is from Djibouti and has a long, slender blade.\nSingle Axe\nA small-headed axe with a single blade and a haft of about two feet.\nDouble Axe\nA longer handle of about three feet with a massive, dual-blade head.\nSpear\nWe will be using two thrusting spears, each of about eight feet in length. \nType X Sword\nA weapon with a Type X blade and cast bronze fittings.\nSabre\nA long-bladed cavalry sabre with a basket hilt.\nFor our armour we are using a fairly close approximation to what would be worn at the times each form of armour was in use. Also, it is important that the armour simulators used for impact recordings are set up as they may have been worn. That is to say, no soldier would ever wear just a piece of plate armour, he would have layers of other material underneath. The materials we are using are wool, linen, leather, mail, and steel plate.\nLeather\nHeavy leather such as horsehide. We will be boiling our leather in water as was often done. Underneath the leather will be a layer of wool cloth.\nMail\nMail could be worn over normal clothes or also over other forms of protection. We will be using riveted steel-linked mail over wool cloth.\nPlate\nThere are many ways to wear plate armour, but we are aiming for simulation of a medium-quality breastplate configuration, so we will have a sheet of steel approximately 2 mm in thickness over 10 layers of linen over wool cloth.\nShield\nWe will be using round wooden shields made of boards that are about a half inch thick, covered in glue and linen and with a metal boss. \nFlesh\nIt is illegal in our state to hack away at live people for recording purposes, so we'll be using some beef from the supermarket, or perhaps a pork shoulder. Also, we'll have wool covering flesh to simulate a clothed body.\nSound Tech\nSound Devices 744T\n192kHz Sample Rate\n24 Bit \nThe items and sounds should be reasonably self-explanatory, but if you're uncertain just what a sound effect is going to be, don't hesitate to ask. We are looking forward to this project getting funded, as we already know just how incredible our backer support can be. Thank you for checking out the project, and please help us make this happen!\nThings We've Learned from the Previous Library\nWith the Firearm Sound Library we jumped headfirst into a big project and did a lot of listening when it came to feedback from our backers. The importance of how we format sound effects became very apparent as a sound you can't find is a sound you can't use. This sound library will have metadata just like the last library, and we will use a short name for each sound file to describe the sound for people who don't have a program that can read Soundminer metadata or BWAV.\nA Different Way to Reward\nJust like with the Firearm Sound LIbrary, this will become completely free for download. As with the previous library, we are trying to \"liberate\" these sounds for those that would love professional quality recordings but can't afford professional quality prices. On that note, our library will have a CC0 license, so you can use, share, download, upload...all completely free, with no royalties or need to give us credit!\nWe are not currently lining up ideas for stretch goals, but if we reach our goal before the deadline, we'll certainly be able to add weapons. So, if you'd like to comment with a suggestion for a weapon we can't currently record but could as a stretch goal, please do so, and if we exceed our goal, we'll be recording the most-asked after weapons. Thanks so much for checking out The Medieval Weapons Sound Effects Library.\nCheers!\nBen, Brian, & Kevin", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRenting and insuring equipment is always a liability and challenge. Safe practice with weapons is absolutely paramount. Just because they seem primitive makes them no less dangerous. In some ways, these older design weapons are even more deadly if used carelessly than firearms are.

Our team has always loved giant monster movies, and we want to share that love with a fun, light-hearted and smart little game that can appeal to players of all ages.\nThe Kaiju-a-Gogo team consists of seven professional game devs, who between them have over 80 years of cumulative experience in the gaming industry and have contributed to over a dozen shipped titles, most recently Sword of the Stars: The Pit and Ground Pounders.\nChris \u201cDegrassi\u201d Gerspacher is the Lead Artist of Kaiju-a-Gogo and one of the founding partners of Kerberos Productions. He has worked in the gaming industry since 2001, and since the founding of the studio he has served as the Art Director and contributed 2D and 3D art assets for all Kerberos titles, in particular the original Sword of the Stars and Sword of the Stars 2, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit.\nKen Lee has been working in the gaming industry since 1999 and has been a 2D artist for Kerberos Productions since the founding of the studio in 2004. In addition to his work on Kaiju-a-Gogo, he has contributed the majority of 2D art assets for all Kerberos titles since the founding of the studio, including the original Sword of the Stars and all expansions, Fort Zombie, and Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, Sword of the Stars: The Pit and Ground Pounders.\nJohn Yakimow has been working in the gaming industry since 2005 and joined Kerberos Productions as an artist in 2007. In addition to his work on Kaiju-a-Gogo, he has contributed 2D concept art and 3D assets to the Sword of the Stars series since Born of Blood and later expansions, Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, and Fort Zombie, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit.\nJames Goldthorpe is a code wizard who helped give birth to the Sword of the Stars II: End of Flesh expansion and Sword of the Stars: Ground Pounders. In his spare time, James enjoys lifting heavy iron things and placing them back down.\nMartin E. Cirulis is the Lead Designer of Kaiju-a-Gogo and the CEO of Kerberos Productions. His career in the computer gaming industry spans twenty years, beginning as a professional reviewer for Computer Gaming World magazine in 1994. He worked as Narrative Designer on Homeworld and Ground Control and has since served as Lead Designer on several shipped titles, including Homeworld: Cataclysm, Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon, the original Sword of the Stars and all of its expansions, Fort Zombie, and Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, Sword of the Stars: The Pit, and Ground Pounders.\nRowen Epp is the Associate Designer for Kaiju-a-Gogo. He joined the Kerberos team in early 2014 to work on Sword of the Stars: Ground Pounders, which is currently nearing release, and is already hard at work on Kaiju-a-Gogo as well.\nChris Stewart is the Executive Producer of Kaiju-a-Gogo and the COO of Kerberos Productions. He has been working actively in the computer gaming industry since 1997 and served as a Designer on Homeworld: Cataclysm, Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon and Bully before becoming a founding partner of Kerberos Productions. He has been the Producer of all Kerberos games since the founding of the studio in 2004.\nWe like the platform! And although we have successfully used other crowd-funding platforms to develop our first two games, this site does offer some features that other sites do not. The powerful contact and update suite makes it much easier to stay in touch with your Supporters and streamlines contact, follow-up and fulfillment of Backer Rewards, which we think is really important.\n Do we have Stretch Goals for this campaign? Yes we do! In addition to our goal of a multi-platform release, we have plans for additional content and features that we would like to offer our players. We have announced a couple of goals already and we'll talk about all our goals more as the get closer to the full funding goal. Please wish us luck!\nClick Announced Goals For More Info!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges of game development are many, and each project is different. With this project, we have the following concerns.\n\n1. The Number of Abilities Per Monster - Each monster in the game is designed to have 90-100 unique Abilities, and no one player will be able to explore all the possible Abilities for each monster in any given game. This is fantastic for increasing the value of the game by giving it \"legs\" (replayability), but it makes it a challenge for testing.\n\nFortunately, at Kerberos we have a great deal of experience with the challenges of executing and testing a complex Tech Tree in a strategy game. The Supporters of our crowd-funding campaigns and players of our games have always been vocal partners in the development of our games, and we will definitely put Kaiju-a-Gogo in their hands as early as possible to get their input.\n\n2. Multiple Platforms - Another challenge is the difficulty of releasing a game for multiple platforms. Kaiju-a-Gogo is planned for release on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android compatible devices--many teams would be unable to generate a game which was playable on so many platforms.\n\nOur team has been working on this problem and developing our skill base in multiple-platform release for the past two years. Our first game, The Pit, was planned and released for PC only, and the process of adapting it for any other platform has been relatively slow. We chose to build our second game, Ground Pounders, to be multi-platform from the start: that game is in late beta and already playable on PC, Android, Linux and Mac, with iOS completing its final release in the next few weeks.\n\nGiven the experience and confidence we've gained while working with Ground Pounders, we're fairly certain that the multi-platform development of Kaiju-a-Gogo will go smoothly, and that players will be happily conquering the planet on the device of their choice on release day without a problem. \n\nIf we seem confident that we have what it takes to deliver this game--we are. Because we do. We have already produced two successful crowd-funded game projects and overcome significant challenges to make them happen. Our team is made up of committed industry veterans and we have all proven our commitment to our company and our work for many years.\n\nWe have a long-standing and well-earned reputation for pride in our work, accountability, and for supporting our products for as long as humanly possible. We listen to our players and we put the game first, every time.\n\nWhen we have secured enough funding to proceed at full speed, we should be able to go from pre-Alpha to Beta and Final Release of the game by Thanksgiving 2014. Our major focus from the beginning of Beta until release will be to collect feedback, suggestions and performance data from our Backers, to refine the game and make it the best product possible. \n\nNaturally we have high hopes for this campaign, and we've come up with some Stretch Goals in case things go well. Fingers crossed that this will be our first successful campaign on Kickstarter!\n\nJust as a final word, we want to thank all the fans who have spread the word about our crowd-funding campaigns and and spent so many hundreds of hours live-streaming our independent games.\n\nWe hope that you'll enjoy this one as much as you've enjoyed the others.

Every battle is different, every realm is unique, and there is always something new to discover.\nBased on my cult classic ZX Spectrum game \u2018Chaos\u2019, first published in 1985 by Games Workshop, Chaos Reborn is part sequel, part re-imagining of that original game brought up-to-date with high quality presentation. \nThe magic combat system remains true to the original Chaos. It is all about summoning a host of weird and mythical creatures, moving and fighting with them, and using your wizard to attack, defend, buff and de-buff with large array of spells. It is highly tactical and fast paced. But Chaos Reborn expands considerably on this by offering multiplayer modes, a single-player RPG system and co-op play.\nThank you for your support, and I hope to be playing Chaos Reborn with you soon.\nThe Rewards\nOur reward levels give player the opportunity to play some interesting roles in the game from the start. It should be emphasised that there is no pay-to-win situation since every player begins with a level 1 wizard and a meagre selection of spells, and any player can ascend through the ranks from Wizard Lord to God - given some effort and tactical ingenuity. Backers, though, will have some social safety net and will get some aesthetic perks, such as their special Wizard Auras. Check the FAQ and the detailed section on rewards below.\nStretch Goals\n$200k pledge level reached - Localisation of game text - at a minimum French, German, Italian and Spanish, plus a small selection of other languages to be decided based on demand and costs.\n$240k pledge level reached - Android/iOS platform support - a full version of the game available for mobile phones and tablets. The game will be a free download from app stores, and if you are a Kickstarter backer you will be able to unlock the full version without any additional cost (i.e. it will be a true cross-platform game).\nIn the beginning, the gods promised power and immortality through the gift of magic. In a short time the corruption and greed of humankind plunged the magic kingdoms into conflict, unleashing the forces of Chaos. Powerful beasts were summoned into the realm of men, and potent magic warped the landscape. Eventually the world was rent asunder, fractured into island realms split between planes of existence. The Gods of Law regained the upper hand and brought order to the realms by installing Wizard Kings to control the knowledge of magic. But the Gods of Chaos conspired with their devotees, and hid within the realms powerful magical artefacts for Chaos to rise again.\nAt the start of the game you are an apprentice wizard hoping to build your spells and equipment in order to become powerful enough to ascend the ranks through Wizard Lord, Wizard King, Demigod and ultimately God,  where you can influence the fate of the cosmos.\nAt the core of Chaos Reborn is the battle between wizards, fought in an arena with a limited selection of spells. The last wizard standing is declared the victor. Features include: \nQuick playing, turn-based combat. Battles typically last 10-30 minutes. \n80 unique spells, including 24 creatures - from dragons to goblins - fully animated in the 3D Unity Engine. \nClassic spells from the original Chaos - including the Gooey Blob, Raise Dead, and Magic Wood. \nBluff and deception - summon creatures as illusions for 100% success, and use Disbelieve spell on suspected enemy illusions. \nManipulate the balance of the Cosmos between Law and Chaos to your advantage. \nProcedurally generated 3D battle arenas with various types of terrain, and different levels of elevation. \nMultiple game modes, including Classic Chaos mode - fully random battle set-up with random selection of spells. \nThe original Chaos was always renowned as a great multiplayer game that could mix up human and AI wizards for a truly exciting battle. Chaos Reborn builds on this, adding several new features: \nMultiplayer online matches - asynchronous or live \nOffline multiplayer battles on one machine (hotseat mode) \nOnline rankings and league system \nTournaments with prizes \nExtensive co-op options, for multiplayer matches - 2 vs 2, or human co-op vs AI players \nGuild system with guild rankings and guild tournaments \nTrade items and equipment with your friends or guild members \nA major innovation in the Chaos system is the vast single-player RPG experience called the \u2018Realms of Chaos\u2019. You start as a new wizard with just a few spells and you must explore the Realms of Chaos, defeating the Wizard Kings that rule them in order to build your power and magical knowledge. \nWhen you enter a Realm you must seek out and defeat the Wizard Lords, the loyal minions of the Wizard King. As you travel the Wizard King will build his power and reinforce his Wizard Lords, so efficient exploration and effective combat are the keys to success in the Realms. You will discover things to help you and hinder you along the way, and you will build your spell knowledge and equipment as your progress. Once all the Wizard Lords are defeated you can challenge the Wizard King, and if you are victorious you are certain to win valuable treasures and potentially rare or unique artefacts. Here are some of the features of the Realms of Chaos mode: \nNew realms to explore each day - procedural generation system can create a near infinite variety of adventures\nPlayer generated realms - if you are a Wizard King you can design your own realm for other players to explore\nHundreds of different types of equipment to collect in your adventures - including staffs, body gear, headgear and magical artefacts \nBuild your spell knowledge by acquiring Spell Books through combat or trade \nWin gold from battles to spend on sea passages, teleports, mountain passes, realm maps, spell orbs and more. \nLevel up your wizard to gain access to higher level Realms \nLevel up individual items of equipment by entering their \u2018Inner Realms\u2019 - a series of dungeon like levels with unusual guardians \nCo-op mode - invite a friend or guild member to help you fight a battle in the realm you are exploring \nShare Realm Maps and your own experience of Realms with your guild members \n The RPG system in Chaos Reborn is very flexible. Your wizard\u2019s abilities and stats are entirely determined by the equipment given to him, so by using different configurations of equipment and spells you can personalize your wizard and play style, and try to optimise your tactics in battle. The equipment also determines how your wizard will look.\nWizard equipment consists of a staff, headgear and body gear. The staff has a special ability which can be activated after the staff is powered up during battle. For example, a staff might be able to unleash a lightning storm over a wide area, or flip the balance of the cosmos from Law to Chaos, or clone any creature in the arena.\nEach item of equipment may be levelled up individually, but you may only equip an item which has an equal or lower level than your wizard level. Thus your wizard level actually represents your mastery of magical technology. As equipment levels up, it\u2019s powers increase, thus increasing the power of your wizard. You can use equipment in Realm Quests and in multi-player online battles, if the battle rules permit it (\u2018Classic Chaos\u2019 mode, for example, does not allow equipment use). Equipment can be traded with other players for gold or other items, or it can be purchased in special locations inside Realms, or won as spoils of war in battle.\nExtra copies of the game for $15\nYou can add extra copies of the game to your reward for $15 each. Extra copies include early access to playable versions of the game but no other rewards (no art book, game guide, etc.). If you backed at the Apprentice tier or above, for each extra $15 above the price of your tier, you get an additional copy of the game. To do this you have to increase your pledge by multiples of $15 without changing your selected reward. For example, if you backed the game at Wizard Lord level for $50 and you increase your pledge to $80 you will get two extra copies of the game. I will send a survey out at the end of the campaign to check with you exactly what you required with your increased pledge amount. Please note that you can only buy a maximum of 8 extra copies this way.\nReward Tiers\nIf you back the project at Apprentice tier and above you will have access to early playable versions of the game before the official launch, and you can participate in the design process through the Chaos Reborn website.\nWith the Forgemaster tier and above you get to design and name a set of rare equipment items. The game has a procedural generation system for equipment with wide variety of visual designs and game effects, but in this case you will get to design your own equipment and its visual looks using an equipment editor program. Your wizard will start with your equipment, but it will be possible for other players to find more copies of the equipment you designed - with your author tag attached. \nIf you select the Wizard Lord tier or above, you have important status within the wizardly realms, and an extra play mode that allows your wizard to act as an NPC for other players to encounter in their realm exploration. In order to do this you have to go online and configure your wizard by choosing equipment, spells and battle tactics. While you are offline your wizard will be controlled by AI and may be involved in multiple battles. When you go online you may review these battles, which can then help you refine your wizard configuration. Your wizard will earn experience points and gold by using this mode. \nIf you choose the Wizard Lord, Wizard King, Demigod or God rewards, your wizard has status, but still begins as a level one wizard. In order to be effective when deployed as an AI controlled wizard in realms you still need to go adventuring in the Realms or play multiplayer battles so that you can level up your wizard and equip him properly. In other words, you have no initial advantage over other player except access to an exclusive game mode.\nOther players can still ascend the ranks from Wizard Lord to God, with a lot of time, effort and ingenuity. They can also be demoted from these positions to make way for better players. However, if you backed the game at a certain level you can\u2019t be demoted from that level. For example, if you back the game at \u2018Wizard King\u2019 level you will always be at least a Wizard King - you can\u2019t be demoted to Wizard Lord, but you could become a Demigod or God. Also, the special wizard auras are unique to backers - other players don\u2019t get them, even if they ascend the ranks through game play.\nT-Shirts\nThe design features a black T-shirt with the Chaos Reborn logo on the front and a special message on the left sleeve reading '30 YEARS OF CHAOS 1985-2015' and the gooey-blob sprite from the original Chaos, which is my personal avatar. It is an Anvil Jersey T-shirt made from pre-shrunk combed ringspun cotton (meaning it's very soft and comfortable). Shipping is included for US residents.

With your help I will use the Kickstarter funds to put my small but talented team to work full time on Chaos Reborn with the objective of completing the game by May 2015. I have set up a new development company called Snapshot Games Inc., and the development studio will be established here in Sofia, Bulgaria, where I have been living for the last eight years. I will use my extensive experience as a designer and producer build a highly effective and creative development studio. Snapshot Games will be solely dedicated to working on Chaos Reborn until completion.\nThe Team\nApart from myself I have a core team of five experienced developers, each with 7-10 years experience in game development. I also have input from expert freelancers, who have already contributed to concepts, animation and modelling. I intend to keep my core team small and focussed, based primarily on talent and expertise. My personal experience both as a designer and game producer will help keep the project on track for delivery.\nIconic and distinctive creature design is one of our main objectives. The colour schemes reflect alignment - cool colours for Law, hot colours for Chaos and earthy colours for neutral.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChaos Reborn has a lot of online and co-op features which means that we need very robust server-side code and infrastructure. I will devote a lot of attention to this during development. We have teamed up with a local middleware developer, Game Cloud Continental, to provide the bulk of our game server systems, and we will work closely with them to develop any specific, proprietary features we need.\n\nOn the game design side we will be relying a lot on procedurally generated content. The algorithms for creating arenas, realms, NPCs and equipment need to be very good in order to provide players with a rich and diverse experience.

Playdek is excited to be partnering with one of the most legendary game designers, as well as you the fans, to bring out a refreshing, immersive new take on the tactics genre.    \nIn the hands of the veteran tactical RPG master himself, Unsung Story will re-imagine a classic game genre, as Yasumi Matsuno weaves together one of the complex and rich game worlds that he is known for, with inspiring class based tactics game play.\nHistory is written by winners, and tells the tales of heroes. But where there are winners, there are losers, and wars are not won by heroes alone. Behind the veil of history, there are countless stories that lie forgotten. Reliving these hidden tales is the concept behind the Unsung Story.\nUnsung Story: Tale of the Guardians presents an epic sweep of history through the eyes of the ones that make it, but are overlooked by the passing of time. It presents a fundamental twist on the hero\u2019s story, as it immerses gamers through the experiences of those lashed to the great wheel of history!\nThe Unsung Story timeline covers many chapters of the sprawling war-torn history of the fantasy world of Rasfalia. The central plot follows the struggles of heroes who fought in the Seventy-Seven Years War between great kingdoms and empires. \nThe story for each hero will constitute an episode, with each episode being comprised of many stages of game play. Each episode will depict a part of the Seventy Seven Years\u2019 War from the vantage point of various protagonists. Some episodes will span a single year, while others may take place over a decade or more!\nFilled with intrigue, warfare, betrayal, alliances and espionage, Unsung Story is a detailed and immersive game world that players will bring to life through their actions and decisions. It will tie you not only to the names that history remembers after the conflict has ended, but also with the characters behind these immortalized individuals. \nWithout these people, the unsung ones, the course of the history of Rasfalia would have taken a different turn. You will connect to these unsung heroes through your decisions and experiences, as you live these events through their eyes.\nFor more information about Unsung Story from Yasumi Matsuno, check out our Update #11 here:Detailed Design Insight from Yasumi Matsuno\nUnsung Story is an exciting turn-based, tactical war simulation RPG that plays across a great epoch, through individual story episodes. YOU, the player, research and explore the vast history of this conflict that nearly tore Rasfalia apart, by reliving past battles and political events. \nYour viewpoint into this series of intertwined history varies from battle to battle. In one fight, you may command a group of knights protecting a great empire, while in another scenario you may lead a group of revolutionary soldiers, made up of commoners, who are fighting to topple the same empire!\nBattles take place on a 3-D landscape, with an immersive player controlled camera, while episode and scene selection is made through a detailed 3-D world map. Units that you command are profession based, and within each profession are multiple classes. \nEach class within a profession has certain characteristics, and you can change classes within a profession to suit your tactical needs! The world is also rich with magical creatures that are not only foes on the battlefield, but under certain conditions can be commanded by you as well!\nThe character professions, replete with individual classes, provide you with deep game mechanics that you can mold to your individual play style, and adapt to the scenario at hand. You will build your front and backlines by combing these classes into various groups or parties, based on the needs of the battlefield.\nHere is a visual look into the game from a game play perspective. The battle system for Unsung Story is a turn based system that puts importance on speed for each units actions. Therefore, faster units will act on their turns first. The image below represents an example battle stage, as seen by the player, with the player\u2019s party in blue and the opposing force in red. All of the world stages will be richly modeled and detailed, with various terrains and elevations.\nInstead of a square tile system, Unsung Story will use triangular tiles, with units standing not at the center of tiles, but at the intersections. This gives units six possible directions of movement.  \nThis image below depicts different target choices for the player in this triangular based system. In this example, the Active unit has three options:\n1) Use attack \u201cX\u201d on the adjacent Enemy A\n2) Use attack \u201cY\u201d on Enemy B, two tiles away\n3) Use defense \u201cZ\u201d to aid the adjacent Ally C\nThe attack radius shown above is a radius of 2, in other words. A, B, and C are all within the acting unit's range. A and C are well within range, and B is at the edge of the range. The purpose of this system is to explore what more can be presented to the player, by way of multiple action choices, while having a consistent six possible direction choices available to them.\nThis is a concept of what the look and feel will be as you play through the game. It\u2019s not an in-game render but hopefully helps to convey some of the level of detail that we will put into the game.\nIn Unsung Story, classes are spread across three game play types that allow for unique party construction:\nWarrior types that are geared for attacking and defending \nMage types that use magic for attacking, healing and buffing \nMonster types that excel in the use of specialized attacks\nWith this perspective in mind, the system is then made up of five primary class types:\n\nThis is a class connection map that shows the options for leveling characters across class types and professions.\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize attack power. They fight with long swords, massive axes, spears, and maces, for example.\n\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize defense. They are equipped with a shields and other defensive equipment, and will protect their party from enemy attacks.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield offensive and support magic, including the ability to strengthen a party\u2019s attack abilities.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield defensive and healing magic, and can strengthen a party\u2019s defensive position.\n\nThese are characters that command mythical beasts and monsters. The tamed monsters can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.\nAll of these class types have a Profession, which are a cultural/intellectual/craft alignment, and each profession has an affiliation bonus with another profession. \nA unit\u2019s primary class type and sub-class is determined by the type of weapon equipped, and by using various weapon types, a player\u2019s character can gain XP in any class level this way. Units will be able to freely switch between classes that align with certain professions, as each weapon will belong to one of the primary classes and any experience points earned will be applied to levels for that class.\nThese branches show various class types aligned to certain professions.\nFor example, equipping two different Defender weapons, the Knight\u2019s short sword or the Hoplite\u2019s short spear, will both earn experience points toward the Defender primary class level.\nWhat makes the sub-class different is that their special skills in battle will vary between subs. Though they will still have different character stats, they will have unique skills available to their sub-class type to use in battle. This is also key to class development because the skills a unit can learn when leveling up depend on its sub-class at the time.\nEssentially, the system allows you to shape a unit\u2019s development by choosing which sub-class it is, and in turn what skills it learns, thus giving each character its own identity.\nA Tamer Class putting a dragon under his control.\nThese four listed classes are the classes you will be able to choose from as your backer reward for all tiers that specify a Kickstarter Edition class:\nWar Mage: Profession \u2013 Clergy\nThe War Mage is a member of the battle caste of the Clergy. In addition to powerful magical arts, the War Mage can wield Short Swords, Daggers, and Slings, along with Grenade Weapons, and imbue them with enchantments.\nBallast Knight: Profession \u2013 Noble\nThe Ballast Knight is part of the Nobility, and heralds from the upper elite of society. This access to wealth allows them to bear costly yet powerful weapons and armor. Some of the weapons the Ballast Knight wields are the Great Sword, Short Sword, Axe, and for mounted knights, the Lance.\nPolearm Knight: Profession \u2013 Pioneer\nA Polearm Knight is the upper echelon of the rank and file, the commoners who make up the majority of the Rasfalian cultures. A fierce and heroic fighter, Polearm Knights are known to wield Pikes, Halberds, Scythes, and other pole weapons.\nAerolest: Profession \u2013 Estate\nThe Aerolest is a highly skilled, highly educated warrior, immersed in mathematics and the sciences. Known to design and develop their own secretive and extremely deadly ranged weapons, the Aerolest uses various types of Bows, Crossbows, and Scorpios.\nUnsung Story is the inspiration and creation of an incredibly talented set of veteran video game developers and content creators. We\u2019re incredibly proud and excited to be able to bring together this amazingly accomplished set of creative professionals.

Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still order yours on our website www.decibullz.com. \nI have been frustrated for years with uncomfortable earphones that wouldn't stay in my ears. So I set out to find an earphone that stayed put, felt good, and sounded great. After extensive research, I concluded that the only way to fit earphones precisely is to mold them to the exact shape of the user\u2019s ear. Unfortunately the current custom molding process is very expensive and very time consuming. So I invented Decibullz, an easy and affordable custom molded earphone. \nThe Decibullz earphone mold is composed of a nontoxic and biodegradable thermoplastic that makes the molding process remarkably simple: the mold is heated in water, either by microwave or on the kitchen stove, and allowed to cool to slightly above room temperature. The user then presses the mold to his ear, molding it to an exact fit in about four minutes. Once the material has cured, the user has an amazingly comfortable earphone that will never fall out.\nIf the fit isn't perfect the first time, Decibullz can be remolded until you get the fit you want. It is the only custom earphone system in the world that is re-moldable.\nDuring the last two years I have been working to create an easy and affordable custom molded earphone. Last year I was extremely excited to release the first version of Decibullz. Over the last 12 months Decibullz has created a following of amazing customers. They have given their feedback and ideas to help develop and improve the next generation of Decibullz. I have combined that feedback with everything I have learned in the past two years to create an even better custom molded earphone system. \nThe new earphone has been painstakingly redesigned to fully utilize the Decibullz custom molds. This allows for custom tuning of the earphones to achieve optimal audio performance. \nThis new design also makes it much easier for users to create a perfect fitting and great sounding earphone. I have accomplished this by combining our unique molding material with a specially selected silicone tip. The soft tip aligns the earphone in the ear canal and creates a comfortable sound-isolating seal. The tip works in conjunction with the molding material that conforms to the concha (bowl part of the ear) to keep the earphone secure and comfortable. The molding material also creates a second seal for better sound and greater noise isolation. The new earphones have a very low profile so they can be easily used with hats and helmets. \nThe production model will be an improved version of the fully functional prototype. \nThe Decibullz system makes molding your custom earphones extremely easy. Simply heat the thermoplastic molds in a cup of water in the microwave, snap on your earphones, and shape the molds to the unique shape of your ears. \nThe molding material stays pliable at slightly above room temperature for several minutes. This allows it to be placed into the ear and molded safely.  \nAs a designer I jumped at the opportunity to put my skills to use creating a product that I was passionate about. For my early prototypes I tried using silicone, epoxy, wax, and various other materials to create the custom molds. After hundreds of failed attempts I finally developed a material that was safe, comfortable and re-moldable.  \nThe unique properties of the molding material made it extremely difficult to manufacture. In fact, I couldn't find one factory willing to even try it in their expensive machines. As luck would have it one of my neighbors happened to own a manufacturing facility and was willing to help me out. We spent the next several months learning how to manufacture our custom molds. \nI released the first version of Decibullz Earphones at CES 2013. Since then Decibullz has received some great media attention and was even selected as one of the Five Best Exercise Headphones by lifehacker.com. \nShortly after the launch of the first generation of Decibullz I began working on improvements for the next version. After several months of designing and testing I have been able to create an even better custom molded earphone system. The new system is easier to mold, sounds better, and has greater noise-isolation than the previous generation. \nCustom molded earphones are vastly superior to conventional earphone designs. Because of their custom fit they can be worn for long periods of time and won't become uncomfortable. They also do not become dislodged while participating in vigorous activities and will block out noise better than conventional earphones.  \nHeadphones Type: Headset - Binaural\nHeadphones Form Factor: Custom Molded In-ear\nConnectivity Technology: Wired\nSound Output Mode: Stereo\nFrequency Response: 20 - 20000 Hz\nSensitivity: 92 dB\nImpedance: 16 Ohm\nDiaphragm: 0.2 in.\nMagnet Material: Neodymium\nCord Length: 44 in.\nAdditional Features: Noise isolating, Flat anti-tangle cord\nConnector Type: Headset (Stereo 3.5 mm jack)\nRemote: In-line Single Button Remote and Microphone\nIncluded Accessories: 1 set of custom molds, 3 sets of silicone ear tips S, M, L\nI have set a funding goal of $40,000. That will be enough money to bring this new version of Decibullz to market.\nGeneral use of funds will be used to create the specialized tools needed to manufacture the new earphone and electronics as well as the new mold design. \nI have been working with local manufacturers to develop the methods and machinery needed to manufacture our unique molds. We have perfected our methods and are ready to start manufacturing as soon as we have the tools needed for the new design. All of our molds will be manufactured right here in the USA!\nThe custom molds will be available in a variety of colors.

In order for that to happen, we need this library to be affordable. Extremely affordable; as affordable as it can be. That's right...if we meet our goal, this library will become free for all to use, absolutely royalty free!\nThe sound you hear in the main video was an actual recording of the suppressed firearm system you see in the video. It gives you an idea of just how great the real deal is even with not-so-great recording equipment. In 192kHz with a seven microphone setup and a high-quality field recorder these sound effects will be a dream! Interspersed throughout the page are pictures taken during the demo recording session.\nCheck out our interview on asoundeffect.com!\n *CORRECTION: The Tascam DR-680 only records 2 Channels in 192kHz, not 4 Channels.\nGreat Sound is a Great Opportunity\nSound is one of the most looked-over elements in independent film making. Sound can make or break the quality of a film. In particular, gunshot sound effects are often neglected for several reasons. First, when you aren't filming a real firearm, you can't record it. Second, you may live in a state or country where particular firearms are illegal or hard to legally obtain. It's also not convenient to acquire a safe range location, the proper safety equipment and all the gear and know-how necessary to record your own sounds. Lastly, the internet does not have much to offer when it comes to high fidelity recordings, let alone a variety of types and calibers with authentic mechanism sounds, and even the few quality libraries currently available are usually bundled and cost hundreds of dollars.\nMic Setup Take 2\nThere is one other sound which some might consider to be the holy grail of firearm sound effects. The suppressed gunshot. In essentially every single film big and small the sound of a suppressed firearm is completely fabricated. One reason is that most people have never heard a real suppressed firearm so the viewer has nothing to compare the sound in the film against. Another reason is that silencers are illegal for civilians to possess in several states, and in order to legally buy a silencer an individual must undergo an extensive background check, wait for paperwork to pass (sometimes as long as eight months to a year), and pay a $200 transfer tax in addition to the actual item which can cost between $400 and $2,000. Regardless of the reasons, authentic silencer sounds are not widely used, i.e. nonexistent, and we plan to change that. And let us tell you if you haven't watched the main video yet (SPOILER)...the real deal sounds incredible!\nRecording for Posterity\nUse it Like You Know it\nThere is another element to firearm sound effects: proper application. Home many times have you seen a film where the bad guy points his pistol at someone and you hear some sort of cocking sound, even if the weapon has no external hammer or safety (like a Glock)? Considering that not many people have ever used a silencer, or any kind of firearm for that matter, it is important to help people understand what it sounds like to operate, disassemble, and even hold a firearm. For a silencer, there is an entire process to prepping and using it, and everything matters, down to the type of ammunition you shoot through it. As an additional resource for this sound library we will also provide useful information and videos concerning the proper application of these sounds which will walk you through the process of assembling and using firearms in a realistic manner.\nFamiliarization and Safety Brief\nMade for Maximum Customization\nWhen it comes to creating an extensive collection of firearm sound recordings we don't want to stop with just high-enough quality recordings. We want these sounds to be used for anything and everything. Recording all our sound effects in 192kHz enables a whole range of flexibility for anyone wanting to time stretch, perform granular synthesis, or manipulate the sound in any other way. Also, when firing an unsupressed firearm the gunshot tends to be so loud that it is nearly impossible to isolate any of the more subtle sounds. With the two suppressed firearms at our disposal we can record the sound of a bullet traveling through the air and bullet impacts without the massive volume of the actual gunshot smothering these finer sounds.\nShooting Lanes and Downrange Setup Planning\nReward Details:\n$1 \u2013 And you get it all. All the sounds for all the guns. Think of this as more of a \"donate\" button.\nGoing beyond the funding goal means more recordings as listed farther down on the page!\nRecording the Marlin Model 1895. The Zooms had a really hard time with the volume on this one. Recording levels had to be turned way down.\nThe Firearms:\nThe following are the firearms we will be recording for this project. By recording, what exactly do we mean? Basically, if it is physically possible to make one of these guns create a sound by firing it or moving any of the working parts, we'll be recording it. Loading and unloading. Safeties. Triggers. Magazines. Slides. Every single click, scrape, and bang. For firearms such as the 1911, this means nearly fifty unique sound effects, not including gunshots.\nAdding a little oil makes quite a difference both visually and aurally.\nIf we greatly surpass our goal, we will even throw in some recordings of medieval weapons: the spear, the sword, the bow, and the crossbow. Note: the sound of medieval-style bolts and arrows flying through the air is absolutely wonderful. Another option is renting threaded barrels for various firearms already on the list in order to record them with the silencer attached.\nThe photographer abandons his camera and takes up a different kind of shooting.\nNow, back to our segment on using sounds. How does a filmmaker who has perhaps never use a firearm know how to utilize all these sounds (pistols such as the 1911 can produce up to fifty distinct sounds)? That's just another one of the many advantages we will offer you. We will be creating tutorial videos (as mentioned in the project video) that will sort of walk you through the way these guns function, the sounds they make, and more. Think of it as \"Using Guns and the Sounds They Make for Dummies.\"\n Click HERE to see an example of the sounds we will record of the Walther PPQ!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSound design:\n\nThe sound produced by a gunshot is very complex. The weapon's mechanism, the gases expelled from the muzzle and the receiver, the bullet passing through the air, the \"sonic crack,\" and impact all produce unique textures important to producing the right sound from the right perspective. One of the most significant sounds a firearm produces comes from the reverberation from the environment. This sound not only places the gunshot in a real space, but it tends to bleed into the other aspects of a gunshot, making them difficult to manipulate. One of our challenges is to isolate the different events of a gunshot so they can be customized to fit the needs of any project.\n\nObserving the law:\n\nWe have taken great care and will continue to be conscious of and abide by all laws concerning firearms in the state of Michigan. Silencers are 100% legal to own in most states, including ours, and the silencer we are using was acquired legally by one of the members of our team. All shooting and recording will be done on property which we have permission to use.\n\nSafe firearm practice:\n\nFor any project which uses firearms, safety is paramount. We will only record at locations designated for shooting and all project members have been firearms-educated and will practise safe firearm handling. Hearing protection is a must for unsuppressed firearms; being exposed to a single gunshot can cause permanent hearing damage. All those Hollywood movies which have everyone running around shooting short-barreled automatic weapons in the fully-automatic fire mode? The very next scene should be those tough guys sitting on the floor holding their ears and hollering at each other uselessly. In addition, eye protection is recommended when using semi-automatic suppressed firearms as particle, gas, and lubricant blowback is a possibility.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Our Final Update", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWith our presence on Facebook, Twitter, and our new Kickstarter campaign, we are sending you our final update for The Firearm Sound Library.

Your goal is to become the most influential person in the world. Your Influence is measured in the size of your empire, the capabilities of your army, and how much good you do for the populace.\nYou'll begin with control of a single Territory and then expand your Empire, leading bold charges or cautiously marshaling your forces, gaining access to increasingly powerful weapons and ever growing armies. You can wage total war or fund great acts of humanitarianism. Victory can be yours through conquest or through self-defense, through politicking or subterfuge, through war or, with great difficulty, through peace.\nSo, how do you play? I'm glad you asked - hit the video below for a demo.\nYour troops hold territory, your territory produces Warbucks, and you spend Warbucks to recruit more troops and buy more tech.\nRocket Pack\nThe board defines the battlefield, and is divided into many territories. Your troops stack up inside of the territories -- they're represented by stacked chips. The size of the stack indicates its strength, so it is easy to read the whole board at a glance. Troops start with the ability to move and attack. \nCards provide additional tools and abilities - whether it is a self-sacrificing bomb-run, a rocket pack to leap over your enemy's lines, or a vehicle to move farther than otherwise possible -- the cards make your troops more dangerous. Cards that modify your attacks can be played as you attack, letting you immediately make your attacks more potent. Likewise, when you're attacked, some cards give you the ability to respond -- you can spring surprises on your opponents throughout the game.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's Bomb\nA turn plays like this:\nDraw Cards\nCollect WarBucks from your territory\nSpend WarBucks on new tech and to recruit more troops\nDeploy your new Troops\nAttack, using either basic Troops or Troops enhanced by cards\nTurns are interlaced, so everyone draws cards at once, then everyone collects money, then everyone takes turns buying cards, then everyone takes turns attacking. You never have to wait too long between actions.\nGames usually run 60-90 minutes. \nDesigning WarBucks\nWhen designing WarBucks, I wanted a game that encouraged players to interact and negotiate, that had multiple paths to victory, and which was highly re-playable. I started with a focus strictly on mechanics, iterated until they were fun, and then started layering theme and flavor on top. What emerged was a game that you can play, analyze with your friends afterwards, and then play again to get a completely different experience.\nThe World of WarBucks\n WarBucks is set in a world not quite our own. Our worlds diverged shortly after WWII. By developing clean, nearly free energy, they brought about a cultural revolution, and their world knew peace for several decades. They forgot war, forgot killing, forgot nations or allegiances. People invented, created art, lived lives of indolence, luxury, and peace. War became a romanticized memory, a noble pursuit -- something to sell movie tickets, not something to dread. When a group of power-crazed megalomaniacs, each bent on world domination, rose from the shadows and began amassing armies, people flocked to them. War had returned.\nWhat's in the box?\n200 Standard Cards (25 varieties)\n28 Reward Cards (7 varieties) \n24 Humanitarianism Cards (3 varieties)\n200 Troop Chips (4 colors)\n4 Hero Tokens\n40 Marker Chips\n3 & 4 Player Game Board (double-sided)\nRecruiting Office Board \nRule Booklet\nTurn Order Sheet with Slider tokens for tracking key information\nStretch Goals:\n65K 1 Metal WarBucks Coin in every box!\n75K 1 Customizable Game Board in every box in addition to the standard board, plus ten suggested map variants. Customization done via wet-erase marker, so you can play on a different board each time.\n85K ???\n100k ???  \nWhy Kickstarter?\nI'm really excited about WarBucks -- it is a lot of fun to play, and I'm looking forward to the day that other people can pick it up off a shelf or order it online and play it. That said, manufacturing games is expensive, especially games with as many components as WarBucks. Creating a game with a rich world and detailed art takes a lot of time. \nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, Steve, the artist for WarBucks, will stop taking on freelance work and just focus on art for WarBucks until it is complete. Once the art is done, the game will go to manufacturing. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, WarBucks should ship within 6-8 months.\nMechanically, WarBucks is complete, playable, and fun. We've released a Print & Play beta and we're going to continue play-testing while the art is in development. We may tweak card prices (in-game prices -- this isn't a CCG, so all cards come in the box), twiddle other balance knobs, and clarify the rules if needed. As we make updates, we'll post the most current version of Print & Play up on WarBucksGame.com. \nIf you do give the Beta play, we'd love to hear from you -- please, leave feedback on WarBucksGame.com. \nRemember, with Kickstarter, you don't pay anything unless the campaign succeeds, but then you don't get anything unless it succeeds either.  Want to guarantee you at least get something other than the Print & Play? Like WarBucks on Facebook and you'll not only increase the chances that WarBucks gets made, we'll also thank you for promoting WarBucks with high-resolution versions of the art above. Steve doesn't mess around with his art -- even though these were drawn to be used on cards, they are really good looking in high res.\n There's a forum for WarBucks discussion over at Crowd Funding Forum", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWarBucks is the first game we've tried to manufacture, so we're taking an approach that minimizes the number of places that failures can occur to make sure the game and rewards are delivered.\n\nWe are working with a full-service games manufacturer to reduce the complexity and challenges inherent with vendor management. Having a single point of contact means a single point of accountability, which means there's always someone who cares about WarBucks on the manufacturer's end. None of the manufacturing is particularly complex, though there are many parts that go into the game. \n\nWe plan to use Amazon's fulfillment services to ensure that shipping is handled quickly and professionally.\n\nNoah's day job is as a project manager, so he knows the importance of clear communication, tracking deadlines, and resolving issues. That isn't to say issues won't pop up, but they'll be clearly communicated to backers when they do and resolved as swiftly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Single Helix Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 56 backed\nNoah Cohen, the designer behind WarBucks launched Single Helix Studios to bring WarBucks to life.

We can't wait to bring Ascension Online to life thanks to all of your backing and support!\nIf you missed out or were unable to participate in the campaign, head over to our Paypal Campaign page on our website.or to AscensionGame.com for more information.\nEver since we brought our award-winning Ascension Deckbuilding Game to iOS, we\u2019ve heard the same questions asked time and again: When is it coming to Android? When is it coming to PC?\nTrust us\u2014we've heard you loud and clear.  We\u2019re thrilled to have such passionate fans, and we want to be able to bring you the gaming experience you demand and deserve.\nSince we originally released Ascension in 2010 as our new company's first product, the game has grown dramatically. We have released three expansions\u2014Return of the Fallen, Storm of Souls, and Immortal Heroes\u2014along with dozens of supplemental promo cards, and our fans keep asking for more. The Ascension iOS app has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times and players have logged over three million games played online. We think it's time to take Ascension to the next level. \nWe want to build a team dedicated to Ascension Online. We want not only to bring Ascension to Android and PC, but also to make it bigger and better than ever, with all-new features like these:\nAre you the best Ascension player in your play group? Have you ever wanted to see how you stack up against the best of the best? Part of our plan for Ascension Online is building the infrastructure to run online tournaments. We\u2019ll offer both casual pickup events and larger scheduled tournaments, complete with leaderboards, prizes, and more. \nWe know that many of our fans prefer playing against the computer, and we want to give them a more robust play experience, too. We\u2019re going to create a campaign mode featuring a variety of challenges and diverse play modes. Can you defeat Master Dhartha, who starts with a copy of his own Hero card in his deck? Players will be able to level up, unlocking new game abilities and new cards for their own starting decks.\nAs we said before, we want to get Ascension into as many people\u2019s hands as possible. Despite what people responding to all of our posts on Facebook and Twitter might tell you, we don\u2019t hate Android users, and we\u2019re certainly not ignoring them. A huge part of this project is bringing Ascension to the Android and PC platforms so that everyone who wants to can play. This Kickstarter will allow us to make that happen much sooner than would otherwise be possible.\nIn addition to bringing you all the new platforms and features, we want to make Ascension freely available to everyone who wants to play it. With this Kickstarter, we can ensure that the base game will be free on all new platforms we introduce.\nAscension is an award-winning deckbuilding game originally released in 2010. The game features fast-paced strategy and tactics, requiring players to react to an ever-changing board of Heroes, Constructs, and Monsters as they vie for dominance in the rich fantasy world of Vigil. In addition to the original release, Ascension has three expansions\u2014Return of the Fallen, Storm of Souls, and Immortal Heroes\u2014with the fourth expansion, Rise of Vigil, due out in April of this year (and available early to Kickstarter backers!) \nWe are Stone Blade Entertainment, formerly known as Gary Games. Ascension was our first release as a company, but our team is made up of industry veterans who have worked on a wide array of games. We have a huge amount of experience playing games as well as designing them, with five Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour championship titles among the team.  We are currently hard at work producing future Ascension sets and the new digital collectible game SolForge, which was funded in part by fans like you here on Kickstarter. For more information about the company and our games, visit our sites below!\nWe\u2019ve wanted to bring Ascension to Android and PC ever since we released it on iOS, and we know many of you out there have wanted it, too. We can hardly post anything on our Facebook or Twitter feeds without fans bombarding us with the question \u201cWhen is Ascension coming to Android?\u201d As much as we\u2019ve wanted to be able to tell all of them \u201cSoon,\u201d we haven\u2019t had the resources to make it happen. After our successful Kickstarter campaign for SolForge, we thought, \"Could we do this for Ascension, too?\"\nWe were overwhelmed by how many fans came through to support SolForge and how passionate they were about being a part of making it a reality. We see that same passion in our Ascension fans who ask us when we're bringing their favorite game to Android, or when the newest set is going to be available online. \nOur programming team currently has their hands full making SolForge. With this Kickstarter, however, we will be able to bring on additional programmers to develop Ascension Online in parallel. We feel that Ascension Online deserves a dedicated team, one that can commit all of their time to developing for new platforms, creating new features, and ensuring timely set releases.\nBy backing this project, you can finally answer the question that has confounded scholars for ages\u2014\u201cWhen is Ascension coming to Android?\u201d\u2014with \u201cBy the end of 2013.\u201d We think we can get it done well before that, but we take our commitments seriously, and we only want to promise what we\u2019re certain we can deliver.\nAs a backer, you'll not only be a part of making Ascension Online a reality, but you'll also be able to get your hands on a variety of awesome rewards, from unique game avatars and free expansion downloads to the Ultimate Ascension Collector's Edition, dinner and gaming with the Stone Blade Entertainment team at Gen-Con, and more! Check out all of the rewards to the right, and below now!\nBelow are illustrations of all our reward tiers available for this campaign. We also have add-ons available for backers to add to their pledges.

Scroll down to the bottom and find the table that details your pledge tier choice.\nBeing Clear with you about the Add-A-Thing Tiers\nUnfortunately because of the way Kickstarter works, we're relying on the folks at Kickstarter to update some text that we can't change to make things clear to you. The ONLY tiers that provide you an AMD Radeon HD 6870 video card are the following:\n$105 tier\n$205 tier\n$220 tier\n$325 tier\nWhile we understand that the $150 and $175 tiers says \"previous rewards +\", that was the text in place before these new special tiers were added and they are not intended to be included in other tiers. Sadly, we don't have enough cards or budget for previously existing tiers to get video cards. If you want a video card, you need to choose a tier that specifically identifies that it comes with a video card.\nIdeally (and perhaps the Kickstarter folks will do this), the $100 tier should now say \"$75 rewards +...\" , The $150 tier should say \"$100 tier rewards +...\", and the $175 tier should say \"$150 rewards +\".\nWe're very sorry for any confusion. Had we known ahead of time that we'd be adding these tiers at the end we would have worded the original tiers differently, but unfortunately as we responded to what our community is asking for, we didn't have the ability to update the original tiers so it would be more clear.\nAlso, we expect all video cards to ship out in September. December 2012 is when DG: Containment is expected to be released to backers.\nOn the AMD Radeon HD 6770 front, the only tiers that provide those are:\n$70 tier\n$95 tier\n$106 DoubleCard tier\n$195 tier\n$250 tier\nLet us know if you have any questions by messaging us directly.\nYou'll Get DG2\nWe're working to cross the minimum and fund Defense Grid: Containment.  But please also understand that by joining the team as a backer, you'll also get a copy of DG2 when we release it.  We'll need to do extra work on our end to earn or raise the remaining funds in order to complete DG2, but when we do, you'll still be a part of the team.  Crossing $250,000 gets you DG:Containment this December, and DG2 when it is complete.\nRecorded Team Events!\nThe team members at Hidden Path played Defense Grid for 24 hrs on http://twitch.tv/dg2tv from Friday morning through Saturday morning and you can watch the replay if you missed it!\nAlso, if you missed Thursday night's Spreecast, you can watch a recording of it at http://www.spreecast.com/events/defensegrid2 .  Enjoy!\nNew Reward Item Added!\nPledge tiers $110 and over, now include Fletcher's Defense Grid Fortune Telling audio button (see image at the bottom of the page).  With 20 random specially recorded lines from Defense Grid's AI: Fletcher, you can ask a question and be sure you'll get an answer (because the battery is included).  Any question a Magic-8 ball can answer for you, Fletcher now can too.  And it is yours with any pledge tier you choose, $110 or greater.  Watch the Project Update #9 video for more details!\nYour Road to Defense Grid 2\nNow you can help the Hidden Path team build a great Defense Grid sequel: a DG2 that exceeds your expectations and goes beyond the award-winning gameplay and amazing reviews of the original. A great sequel is our passion too, but it's an expensive undertaking, costing $1 million more to build than we can self-finance, so we're inviting you to join the Defense Grid family and help us make DG2 real.\nLet's Kickstart this together - we can't do it without you. To make sure everybody wins as we target our goal, we have a step-by-step plan that delivers new Defense Grid content to you at funding points along the journey, starting at $250,000. Here's the road to how we get there:\nAMD, Razer & DG2 Together\nTo ensure an even better game for you, our friends at AMD Gaming Evolved and at high-end gaming company Razer are each helping out on this project as well. \nWe'll work closely with the engineers at AMD to make sure that our new Defense Grid 2 engine takes full advantage of the latest technology in its video card lines, including the Radeon HD 6000 series and Radeon HD 7000 series.  We're also integrating the cool new Razer SwitchBlade user interface into Defense Grid (both the original game and the new engine).  We love the level of control that Razer provides across its devices, including gaming mice like the Naga Hex with its 6 mechanical side buttons. They open up entirely new dimensions for the game, which is paramount as we include multiplayer gameplay for Defense Grid.\nThe folks at AMD have provided a limited number of Radeon HD 6770 and Radeon HD 6870 cards as pledge rewards, and the Razer team has provided a limited number of Wraith Red and green Naga Hex mice.  Both AMD Gaming Evolved and Razer will be supporting us through this Kickstarter event, during development, through each Defense Grid content release, and beyond.  Both want PC players to have an exceptional experience playing Defense Grid and are partnering with us to help make it happen.\nDefense Grid & Now Defense Grid 2 (DG2)\nWhen we launched Defense Grid four years ago we were blown away with people's positive reactions, including the press: \"Best of the Rest\" - Joystiq, \"A Masterpiece is Born\" - GamePro, \"Most addictive game in ages\" - Game Focus, and \"Defense Grid shouldn't be missed\" - PC Gamer.  We were thrilled when it was considered to be the best strategic tower defense game you could play.\nWe worked so hard on graphic fidelity, polish, and balance to exceed any quality level we'd seen before in a TD game. We were the first to add a storyline and a character when we introduced Fletcher, a helpful and amusing AI character who helped you through the game as he reminisced about past wars and favorite snacks.\nWe knew how hard we had worked and how much we cared about every little detail, but we hadn\u2019t dared hope that players would become such loyal fans and love the game as much as you did. Your outpouring of support, strong sales, and emails about how much you loved the game really moved us to try to make more Defense Grid for you.  The strong sales helped us stay together at a time when so many developers were closing down.\nWe came up with exciting plans on how to take Defense Grid to the next level and started talking with publishers about those plans. We've been disappointed with the number of publishers who love the game and sequel plan, but can't make the modest indie profit level work in their publishing financial structure.  Everyone agrees that DG2 will be successful, but the profits publishers need in order to take a chance are higher than ever.\nAs we get closer to completion on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for Valve, we decided now is the right time to bring DG2 directly to you.\nDefense Grid is a Lot of Fun!\nDefense Grid is a strategy game where you spend resources on building towers that destroy waves of incoming enemies. As you kill more enemies, your resources grow. It\u2019s a combo of strategy and puzzle play, and because the game is balanced just right, there are a million different ways you can beat a level so your solution is truly your solution.\nIf you don't already know about the original and popular Defense Grid, take one minute to watch the original game trailer below.\nYou\u2019ll find that when you play Defense Grid you might get close to beating the level the first time through, but if you try it again, you\u2018ll come up with a new solution, even better than your last one. Your mind starts racing with all the different ways you can beat back the aliens. You watch yourself getting better and better at an amazing pace.\n\nIn Defense Grid aliens come after your power cores in the middle of your base. If you don\u2019t destroy them, they\u2019ll steal your cores and your base will stop working. As you progress through the game you get new tower types that destroy aliens differently, and of course new kinds of aliens start showing up too.\nThe levels start off simple with straightforward paths for the aliens and places for towers to be built alongside the paths, but as you progress further, you actually get to redirect the route of the invading aliens based on where you place your towers and which path you choose for them can make all the difference in the world.\n\nPledge $15 or more and not only will you help us make new Defense Grid content that you'll receive once we've completed it, you\u2019ll also receive a copy of the original Defense Grid game to play or give to a friend right away!\nSo Who are the People Behind Defense Grid?\nHidden Path Entertainment (HPE) has been an independent game developer for over 6 years, with 32 passionate employees and tons of experience making hit games. HPE currently is developing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for Valve, the first major update to Counter-Strike in 8 years. Prior to that, Hidden Path created Defense Grid: The Awakening and released it on PC & Xbox 360.  The team has developed games and projects for Valve, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. You can learn more about the company and its founders, Jeff, Mark, Michael, Dave and Jim and more about Defense Grid at http://www.hiddenpath.com\nYou also may learn more about our partners at AMD Gaming Evolved and their video card technology we'll feature in the DG2 engine at http://sites.amd.com/us/game/Pages/game-home.aspx\nOur teammates at Razer make high performance gaming hardware with cutting-edge technology and design.  You can learn more about their peripherial lineup at http://store.razerzone.com/store/razerusa/en_US/pd/productID.244052300/categoryId.35208800\nLet's Kickstart Defense Grid 2!\nDo you want more Defense Grid?  We're here to make it for you and all we need is for you to pledge the amount that gets you what you want.  Should we achieve all our funding goals, you will get the Defense Grid: Containment expansion and then Defense Grid 2 the second it is available.  You'll be the first to play them!  If we make it part of the way, we'll deliver to you everything up to the tiers we have reached.\nWe also want you to share this opportunity with those you know who also want more Defense Grid.  It turns out there are many out there who play and enjoy DG.  Hundreds of thousands of people actually!  That's really exciting to us.  We're thrilled to have the opportunity to make more Defense Grid for you.\nHow disappointing would it be if people who wanted to fund this didn't know about it and missed the opportunity to join us?  Tell your friends and other players to become part of the Defense Grid 2 team.  Together, we can make things happen that traditional publishers can't do. \nIn fact, you also can have a great deal more influence on how we develop the game and be part of the conversation throughout the process.  We will get ideas in front of you as we're building the game, get your feedback, and keep you engaged during development.  Of course our team will make sure to craft a great quality game and we have some fun plans for how to make the conversation work with you really well too.  With your help, so much is possible!\nLet's make more Defense Grid!\nHere are detailed tables outlining more exactly what is covered with each tier:\nTiers $15 through $108:\nTiers $110 to $325:\nTiers $500 through $10,000:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "24 Hours remain to get Defense Grid: The Board Game", "update_content": "Hello Protectors of the Cores,\nWe just wanted to share a short reminder that the fine folks at Forged By Geeks have only 24 hours remaining in their Kickstarter campaign around Defense Grid: The Board Game and before it ends, there is still time for you to obtain one of the copies of the game for yourself should that interest you."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Defense Grid Becomes a Board Game.

There will be full multiplayer (objective-based TvT, PvP) and core single player/co-operation gameplay (e.g. terrorist hunt against bots) from the start. An intricate full-scale SP/Co-Op campaign and advanced AI will be added (Free to KS minimum reward backers and up) after release.\nUnlike big publishers, Blackfoot Studios is an independent developer who actually cares about their product and their fans. The team consists of former Red Storm and Valve employees with dozens of AAA titles under their belt. These guys left well-paid jobs and turned starving indie to do what they love for the people they love. They mean what they say, answer all questions honestly, listen to feedback, and don't push any PR bullsh1t.\nConcept Art for an Oil Platform Assault Map\nTHE GAME\nGround Branch is a team based Tactical shooter specializing in co-op and online multiplayer (LAN play included) gameplay, cut from the same cloth as the original Ghost Recon. It is being developed by former Red Storm Entertainment and Valve Software employees, in conjunction with United States Special Operations Veterans, determined to offer a unique and immersive experience to disenfranchised gamers that have been marketed to under the promise of \u201cauthenticity\u201d, only to find themselves stuck with so many similar arena shooters.\nIn Ground Branch, players will take on the role of CIA Paramilitary Operators of the Special Activities Division. The Special Activities Division carries out deniable covert operations on foreign soil and often goes into a situation before anyone else, before Army Special Forces, before the SEALs.\nPlayers will learn to respect the lethality and versatility of firearms as death can come quick and health does not regenerate. You are then encouraged to join a team, in order to test your strategies and abilities against other groups or clans. Map design is non-linear, featuring randomized objectives and spawns, so that no two rounds feel identical. \nAs an Operator, your actions and animations \u2013 such as reloading or weapon switching \u2013 will be just as smooth and deliberate as it is in real-life. To succeed in battle, you will be required to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the available weapon platforms, and to be able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Weapons behave as they should and are not artificially balanced. Once players have perfected their loadouts, they can save and name their customized settings for later use. Ground Branch is about player choices and realistic consequences. Your skill and ingenuity will be what allows you to succeed.\nPROJECT UPDATES\nUpdate #15: Who Wil Go? \"Send Me\"\nUpdate #14: New In-Game Video on Level Design\nUpdate #13: LAST WEEK\nUpdate #12: WE ARE ADDING SP/CO-OP FREE TO BACKERS\nUpdate #11: NEW Main Video\nUpdate #10: DRM Free Update\nUpdate #9: Reward Chart Added\nUpdate #8: New In-Game Video on Sound Design\nUpdate #7: New In-Game Video With Commentary\nUpdate #6: Main Page Update and Mac Version!\nUpdate #5: Update to Collector's Edition\nUpdate #4: New Promo Video\nUpdate #3: SWEET SOUNDS\nUpdate #2: A big THANK YOU\nUpdate #1: 2 New Reward Tiers Added\nChoices: This is just one of the many approach paths players can choose from\nWHAT MAKES GROUND BRANCH DIFFERENT\nREVIVING A GENRE: We are not creating an arcade game; nor are we competing with titles that model \"War\", like Armed Assault. The closest two working examples of what we are trying to accomplish are the Unreal Tournament modification, Infiltration (INF), and the early Ghost Recon titles (think of our game as sort of the marriage of those two, if that explains it in a sentence). We are creating a tactical shooter that focuses on the realistic aspects of player combat and movement. Those mechanics mean more to us than pure scale (ArmA).\nIMMEDIATE ACCESS TO ALL CONTENT (NO KILLSTREAKS, UNLOCKS OR LEVELING): You will have access to all of the weapons and gear, right off the bat. No DLC / Content restrictions, ever. The reward for playing our game, is a genuine sense of accomplishment.\nDEVELOPERS THAT ACTUALLY CARE: Every penny will go towards finishing the title; we are not using this money to setup offices. The game is designed with consideration in regards to just about everything we've seen (and dislike) in other games, and we always take the time the listen to the concerns of our community.\nFUNCTIONAL REALISTIC DETAILS:   Weapons and ballistics (including feet per second, bullet drop and simulated wind) are accurately represented. Certain rounds are capable of penetrating various materials, and fragmentation grenades actually produce physical shrapnel, rather than relying upon a generic \"kill radius\" circular deadzone that most titles use. These dynamic elements add a level of strategy to the game, not found in other titles.\nGEAR AND WEAPON CUSTOMIZATION: This is not merely cosmetic -- your choices have a direct effect in game. Some examples include: Varying Levels of Body Armor (provides protection, but has more weight and bulk); Weapon Suppressors (provide reduced shot noise but make weapons more unwieldy in close quarters, and reduce the speed and penetrative capabilities of the projectile). These different effects are all based on real-life properties without any artificial balancing. Players also get to completely customize the look and function of their characters, right down to the number (and type) of pouches and the amount of ammunition they want to carry. The only \"limitation\" is that teams will be assigned a camo pattern by the server admin, on a per-map basis.\nNo Unlocks: All weapons and accessories are available at start\nTACTICAL REALISM (A DEPENDABLE SET OF RULES): We have a group of actual combat operators assisting us with nailing the design. No bunny-hopping tactics, dolphin-diving headshots or dual-wielding arcade gameplay. There is no \"Hip Fire\", and you can cancel a reload cycle at any time to switch to your secondary weapon. Movement is restricted by real-world limitations and things like gear weight and fatigue are taken into consideration.\nMETHODICAL GAMEPLAY: Players must work and train together, learn to identify friendlies from tangos, communicate over VoIP, and adapt to unexpected scenarios (grenade physics are a blessing and a curse), and learn to respect their opponents. Training maps and exercises will be provided to address many of the scenarios players will face in the combat maps.\nNO ARTIFICIAL BALANCING: Weapons and gear are implemented, indiscriminately, and their respected real-world pros and cons will be modeled (see our NORG section). For example: while a M249 LMG provides an \"unfair\" advantage to a M4 in terms of amount of ammunition and pure firepower, it is extremely heavy and unwieldy, making it unfavorable to use in CQB, and inaccurate while standing and moving. We have a saying \"Bring the right tool for the job\": we are focused on the effects of the weapons platforms on the player (Is their view restricted? Is it difficult to carry?).\nNO SERVER-SIDE \"CLASS\" RESTRICTIONS\": Players won't be fighting over the \"Sniper Slot\", and teamkilling / griefing someone over a weapon. Clans are encouraged to create their own squads, with the correct roles for the right situation. We are not imposing limits in respects to gear.\nDesign your Operator's field kit from scratch\nNON-LINEAR GAME DESIGN: No scripted \"monster closets\" or on-rails shooting. Maps have open designs and include plenty of explorable terrain, as well as structures/buildings with multiple entry points and routes. We are even working on game types that will randomly block or allow access to certain routes, so that no two back-to-back rounds are identical. The matches will be as dynamic as your strategies allow.\nREALISTIC HEALTH SYSTEM: No regenerating health here. Our system allows a player to bandage a non-life-threatening wound.  However, you will not be able to regain health at any time in a match -- only stop it from getting worse. Respawns will depend on the game mode and server settings.\nWOUNDING SYSTEM: Not everyone comes out clean. Depending on what kind of projectile hits you, the speed of it, your body armor coverage, or the location of impact in your body (vitals, non-vital areas), your player will be effected. Wounds modify in-game abilities by various degrees. Adverse effects like stumbling if shot while running, staggering and limping when wounded, directly effect your combat effectiveness in game.\nMORE THAN DEATHMATCH: Not everyone cares for basic deathmatch, and needs a bit of strategy to have fun. Good News: Our main gametype is a variation of \"Assault\", where one team defends and protects a series of objectives, while the other attacks and attempts to gain ground. This gametype is included to provide a challenge to players, by forcing them to come up with dynamic strategies against a dynamic opponent.\nSERVER TOOLS: Players will be able to host servers however and wherever they want. Admins will have control over camo patterns, gear availability, allowed weaponry, and basically every other setting we can think of or support. We miss this amount of player customization, and we support it. Period.\nMOD SUPPORT: As far as we're concerned: modding is the lifeblood of PC gaming. Full modding support will be available very soon after launch. We are committed to supporting the mod community to the best of our abilities, for the lifetime of the product, and look forward to the content our community will create. We will not only support it in the sense that the engine is capable of it, but we will go out of our way to provide various asset libraries, and we will showcase quality mods on our website.\nTHE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THE GAME: We are a FULL licensee of EPIC Games Unreal Engine 3 and utilize the the most up-to-date builds. We have also licensed Speedtree from IDV,Inc. and a licensed AI solution is planned.\nTeam of Ground Branch Operatives navigating an urban environment\nWHY BLACKFOOT STUDIOS\nMy name is John Sonedecker and I am the Founder of BlackFoot Studios. Being an original member of Red Storm Entertainment was a true pleasure and honor for me. We had some incredible developers, and we made some great games, for which I am very proud of. Those 'Classic' realistic tactical games are my personal favorites, and I have always loved making them, just as much as I loved playing them. This genre is my motivation; my driving force in this industry. Since leaving Red Storm in 2002, I have dreamt of one day revisiting that classic style of gameplay that is so close to my heart. Today is that day.\nI founded BlackFoot Studios in 2004 to be a contract for hire group and have consistently been able to do so ever since. We have done work with various start-ups and established studios to create some truly unique gaming experiences. I have even been tasked with reviewing initial design pitches for a large publisher for possible 'greenlighting' as well. My gaming credits cover over 15 titles with most being in the Classic Tactical Shooter genre.\nAlong the way, I also spent time working for the US Special Operations Command at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, Ft. Bragg. I was part of starting a cell that utilizes cutting edge gaming technology for Special Operations training and mission rehearsal applications. These experiences help me to bring a truly unique perspective and insight into developing the resurgence of the Classic Tactical Squad-Based Shooter.\nNo Class Limitations: Define your own role within your team\nWHY USE KICKSTARTER\nGround Branch started as an idea in 2007. We spent 2 years searching for publishers and investors with no success. People either didn't believe that this particular genre was still viable for enough sales or wanted it to be the next 'Blockbuster Hollywood Experience'. This would have been a complete compromise of our vision, and was more out of interest in the brand name. In the end, it came down to dollars over design.\nUnfortunately, our financial realities won out over sheer will and heart to move the game along. This has been a very tough road to go down and ultimately led us to the conclusion that it was a vicious cycle of stop/start development that we simply could no longer sustain but no matter what we would not let the project die.\nUsing our own savings and income we've managed to build a solid pre-alpha build as a proof of concept with the foundation for most of the systems that make the game unique in place. Now is the time that we need proper financial resources to complete this project.\n\n\nOne philosophy of BlackFoot Studios is that when looking for people to give you funding support, you yourself must have obligated a significant investment as well. John has put in his personal savings and, with others, countless hours of hard work. We are dedicated to completing this project on greatly reduced salaries; any financial rewards will come from the sales of the game.\nLike you, the backer, our main goal is to simply have a game that we can play for ourselves and that others enjoy. The money will go directly to the development of Ground Branch so that we can provide the PC/Mac gaming communities with a game that fills a sorely missed genre.\nGround Branch Operatives using proper Overwatch tactics\nAPPROACH TO REALISTIC GAME DESIGN\nNatural Order of Realistic Gameplay is basically a series of common sense, realistic, rule sets for gameplay issues, such as mobility and weapon balance. It is a philosophy of game design that guides us by using principals from the real world. It is not a simulation of all things (you're never going to need to eat, or go to the bathroom), but taking the core mechanics the real-world gives you and making those the foundation of the game design. However, there are technical, resource and playability limitations that limit the depth that you can go. No one wants to field strip and clean a weapon in game and that is not what NORG is about.\nIt is about not imposing artificial limitations on players, and therefore, forcing them into an artificial outcome.\nOne quick example: if you find yourself trying to navigate through a doorway, while aiming a long rifle, your weapon will clang against the door frame and make movement awkward and dangerous (potentially getting the player killed because of the mistake). The solution? Bring the right tool for the job: shorter weapons are designed for a reason (CQB). Conversely, you wouldn't want to take a short weapon (like an MP5 or other SMG) into an environment with longer engagement ranges (wooded areas or open areas).\nCQB Breach and Clear in urban environments\nHOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED\nIt is very important to us is that the funds generated here go towards making the actual game and that we present an accurate goal that will allow us to make a quality product.\nAnimation: We have been fortunate enough to be able to generate quite a few animations to this point (including our unique motion capture sessions with an actual Special Forces Operator), but are still in need of many more to complete our feature list. And while what we have is nice, they still lack polish and the necessary touch that professional animators can provide. We refuse to ship a game where anyone familiar with the subject matter is offended by an incorrect animation or procedure. We are committed to authentic weapon handling.\nContent Creation: A Level Designer and 3D Artist position will be added to the team. For everything else, we will be using a few individuals that we have worked with in the past to supplement our content needs. These are professionals here in the U.S. that routinely contract with game studios.\nSound Design: This is one of the hardest things for independent developers focusing on realistic titles to do; not to mention, an indie studio focusing on firearms. Proper sound requires professional talent and our sound designers understand our structure and unique needs. If we exceed our goals on KS, we will record a sound library of unique sound material (individualized gun sounds, down to the shell casing and the material it falls upon) which will be accessible for our modding community, for use in implementing community-made weapons. Other studios throw around the word \"authentic\", much to our chagrin -- we're actually serious about it. As it stands, we've already recorded an obscene amount of highly-detailed source sounds for some of the weapons we have now; down to the accurate safety toggles and bolt releases. We've recorded magazine surface impacts for six different surface types (concrete, gravel, woodland, grass, wood, carpet) with the appropriate magazines and magazine build types (polymer versus steel). Most games have one or two sounds for all of those conditions; and we're still not satisfied with our list. Source sounds matter -- we want to prove it.\nProgramming: We have contracted the 3 person team at Digital Confectioners as our main programming 'go to' partners to add to our small but experienced team. DC is headed by veteran programmer James Tan. James has many years of experience with Unreal Engine 3 on both the C++ engine side as well as extensive knowledge of getting the most out of Unrealscript. He has also been tapped by EPIC Games,Inc. to write official documentation on Unreal Engine 3, for their Unreal Developer Network. These are some of the most knowledgeable and gifted Unreal developers out there. We are confident in their skills and believe the game can be finished in an extremely reasonable amount of time with their help.\nLicense Fees: There are a few license support fees that we will need to take care of, but this is not a large amount. This is not for engine licensing as we have taken care of that our self already.\nSupport Reserve: We firmly believe in supporting our product. We have planned ahead so not to put ourselves in a position where we use all of the development funds, and then have no money to be able to support the game, post-release, while we wait for sales revenue to start coming in. We have no intention on developing annual sequels, and we dislike the current DLC 'schemes'; we come from the philosophy that a product can be sold, enjoyed and supported by the community and the developers for multiple years. We want to develop significant expansions, to extend and supplement the life of the core product.\nBlackFoot Studios is also an active supporter of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and plan to donate 10% of the first week's profits (not Kickstarter funds) from the sale of Ground Branch. We have the utmost respect for those that go into harm's way and this is a small way that we may give back.\nhttp://www.specialops.org/\n\n\nSome people may wonder why there are no physical rewards for the $15 and $25 tiers. Simply because we feel that it would cost too much to actually produce and fulfill the rewards at those dollar amounts. Simple honest answer. It would be very difficult to have manufactured, package and ship something physical at those price points while still retaining money for development of the game.... which is really why we are all here!\nDigital Copy of Game: A CD-Key for Ground Branch, once it is available on Steam.\nArt Book: Expertly crafted and professionally designed, digital art book, showcasing some of the concept and development images from Ground Branch. A few interesting tales and facts will be woven in throughout, for those of you wondering what it takes to create a modern game. Digital version available in PDF format and formatted for printing (in the event that you want a hard copy for when Skynet goes live, and declares war on humanity).\nTactics Field Manual: Our Special Operations Contributor team is building a detailed manual that will show the player basic methods of staying alive and winning in combat that directly relate to the game. This Field Manual will also include detailed information about each weapon, ideas and guidance on possible character/weapon customization, Intelligence on each map in the game and some unique and colorful stories only one of these individuals could provide. Digital version available in PDF format and formatted for printing.\nSoundtrack: The entire original professionally mastered musical score for Ground Branch, composed by Jeffrey Hyatt. Available in both (DRM-Free) 320CBR MP3 and FLAC Lossless Audio.  \nCollector's Edition: Includes both PC/Mac Game Disc (DVD) and Digital Copy (Separate Keys), Soundtrack CD and Digital Copy (saves you the trouble of ripping!), 11x17 frameable print, Printed and Digital copy of Art Book, Printed and Digital copy of Tactics Field Manual along with a Ground Branch unit patch.\nLaunch Party BBQ: We haven't decided where this event will take place, but we will provide the food and the experience. Many of our devout forum-goers have often teased about this, but now, it is a very real possibility. On the eve of our retail launch, we will be celebrating by roasting meat and exchanging stories over dinner. This will be an invite-only event for our die-hard fans and the development team.\nBlackFoot Studios proudly supports the Kick It Forward initiative.\nhttp://kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "BlackFoot Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed\nBlackFoot Studios LLC, based in Columbus Ohio, was founded in 2004 by John Sonedecker, a 16 year industry veteran developer who has been...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "PayPal now available in Ground Branch Store!", "update_content": "You are now able to use your PayPal account in the Ground Branch store.
