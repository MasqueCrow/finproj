internet and the modern era of scientific discovery there was the Great Library of Alexandria.\nCreated to store the world's knowledge, its scribes would copy every book found on every ship that entered Alexandria, and would go on to accumulate untold volumes of history, mathematics, geography, politics and more.\nUnfortunately, it was not to last. It was destroyed during the many conquests of Alexandria, and all that knowledge was lost forever.\nWe may never really know how it happened, but the compelling story of its destruction has inspired us to publish this unconventional game. Join us in retelling the story of the burning of the Great Library!\nThe game as presented here is exactly what we imagined a great eurogame to be. It contains 138 unique illustrations by Vincent Dutrait and Asterman Studio, which aim to evoke a feeling of exploration and adventure.\nAlexandria is complete and includes the highest quality card & cardboard material, as with all our games - 2mm thick cardboard, linen finish, 320gr-weight cardstock, the works.\nHowever, we also have a \"dream\" version of the game, with custom-shaped wooden tokens that enhance the playing experience. For that we will order a limited amount of custom-shaped wooden token sets:\nThese tokens are meant to replace the cardboard tiles and give a more tactile playing experience. Just like our previous \"big\" game, CRISIS, availability of this edition may be limited.\n  Designed by Babis Giannios (KUNE v LAKIA, Shadows over the Empire), Alexandria is a eurogame that takes 45-60 minutes to play, albeit a more unconventional one. With asymmetrical gameplay and a shrinking gameplay area, parts of the library are slowly consumed by fire as Heroes seek the treasures within it.\nEach of the four Heroes in the game has a different reason for being in the library at the time, and each one has different skills and motivations.\nAs they move through the randomly-generated layout of the library, the Heroes interact with what they find in the rooms, as well as with each other.\nThey position themselves to take advantage of the situation as it unfolds, and must manage their time wisely.\nIn so doing they may rescue books, items or persons and be rewarded with fame. Throughout the game they are confronted by their shared destiny, and this will lead to the dramatic end that defines the ultimate fate of the library.\nFor more details on the components and rules of Alexandria, download the rule book here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026).\nPlease download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. This file is the low-resolution version of the rules document.\nIf you find any mistakes, please use this form to submit them: https://goo.gl/forms/jTFX4bDRvO7cuejD2\nAs usual, we offer you the chance to try the game before you back the campaign. The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\n  Keep in mind that prototype components and some placeholder art is shown below. For example, the Hero boards will be cut to a custom shape around the illustration. Please refer to the contents graphic for up to date images.\n          We expect to fulfill all rewards from within the EU, and as a result EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nWe are not able to offer multiple-game pledge levels through the campaign because we need to have a clear picture of how many copies to make - which will be just a few more than we need for the campaign. Since we already subsidize the shipping costs, a bulk pledge would not even save any money.\nHowever, we do expect to have a post-campaign pledge manager via Backerkit, which allows us to manage stock levels.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 41 USD / 52 CAD / 52 AUD / 40 CHF / 4548 JPY / 46740 KRW. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nTracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. Please note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nEven though we will be exhibiting at Spiel, and we hope to have Alexandria there, we are not able to offer pickup in Essen. There are many reasons for that, including the risk that it will not be produced in time, the limited space and time needed to hold and hand out copies to backers whose identity we need to confirm, backers not picking up their game, and more. If you would like to get your game there, it is better to not back the campaign (or back for $1 to follow it), and buy it on site. However, we can not guarantee we will have enough copies for everyone. We expect that the price will be 40-50+ EUR, depending on the edition, and on whether we have any Deluxe copies for sale.\n  What You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that add-ons and/or stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nWe do not offer add-ons (not even our other games) during the campaign, because we want to keep our operations simple and deliver efficiently. We may however be able to offer a post-campaign chance to obtain other games, if stock levels and our operations allow. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we would disappoint *all* backers. We have a reputation for shipping on time or early, and this is how we minimize the risk of missing our deadlines.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur previously launched campaigns in 2017 are still in progress and on schedule. Long Live The Queen and IUNU are in production. Diesel Demolition Derby is now in the campaign phase, but print prep has already started, and is expected to be on schedule. This project is independent of any other. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the graphics and components seen here are subject to change (however improbable). We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is possible that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do, although we plan to ship your games first. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game; the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal service. Once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know before pledging. If your reward does not arrive, it is returned to us, so we need you to patiently wait until that happens. Many times we have re-sent a reward only for the backer to receive both the original and the replacement. Informal currency conversions made on this campaign may not be accurate by the time you read this and may therefore result in seemingly cheaper prices in the future. Please do not play with fire, especially near any invaluable ancient papyri (or was it papyruses?) you may be responsible for. Always check the structural integrity of a room before you enter it. Read books. Eat Nutella. Play more games. By backing this project, you indicate that you have read, understood, and agreed with the above.

New passengers are flooding in. It's up to you to get them to their destinations before they get too angry and complain. If we get too many complaints, we'll be shut down.\nNow Boarding is a cooperative boardgame for 2-5 Players which plays in 30-60 minutes.  Each player has their own airplane they will be using to pickup and deliver passengers. Every round, more passengers show up. Players will need to plan together to make sure everyone gets picked up and taken to their destination on time.\nThings get crazy when the timer starts. Players have 30 seconds to take their turns \u2013 AT THE SAME TIME. Not only that, but new passengers show up right as the timer starts, throwing a wrench in your plans.\nEach player has their own unique route only they can take. You'll need to use these routes frequently to save precious travel time. But doing so requires tricky passenger handoffs and coordination between players.\nAs players deliver passengers, they earn money that is used to upgrade their planes - allowing you to fly faster and carry more passengers.\nA intense, cooperative, pick-up-and-deliver game\nMake complex, logistical decisions - in a matter of seconds\nExperience the mayhem of running your own airline\nMounting tension as more and more passengers arrive\nAll new art from acclaimed illustrator, Ryan Goldsberry\n2-5 player, ages 10+, 30-60 minutes\n        Read the rules here  \nGrab the Print and Play files here\n   Click the images to read reviews\n                                \"Now Boarding is the kind of cooperative game that hits that great balance where every player contributes and everyone has to carry their own weight.

Almost. An intense blend of logistics and real-time action.\" - Jonathan H. Liu, GeekDad Full review here\n\"Now Boarding walks a tightrope between smart strategy and manic energy. You'll work together to form your plan, only to watch as it all goes awry and your group scrambles to make it all work. Table talk is everything, making Now Boarding a great social experience, and the game's a good time too!\" - Gameosity\n\"Now Boarding takes real time cooperative games to a new level. The puzzle every player is attempting to solve together keeps you engaged and thinking the whole game. There is a ton of strategic bang without overly complex rules or a long play time. This is a must have for any gamer that likes cooperative play or real time.\" - Sam Aho, Sam Says\n\"Now Boarding is a solid game with a good hook that gets players involved quickly. The game play is very straightforward, but never the path to victory. Players must work together and talk things out constantly or the game will crumble.

This will be a new 3rd edition of the game. Like Now Boarding, Wok Star is a realtime cooperative game for 1-4 players. Players are members of the Wang family, trying to keep their Chinese restaurant in business. Each player has a unique responsibility - ingredients to prepare, and recipes to serve.  And you only have 20 seconds to serve each customer.\nI'm mixing the best elements from the first two editions, and adding some new, modern mechanics. I want to keep it's identity as a game, but tweak a few things to keep it dynamic. There will be more paths to victory via new investments, each with their own risks and rewards. There are more ways to use your dice and deal with bad rolls. And of course it\u2019ll keep the great art and fun sense of humor.  \nCoordinate \"Grocery Runs\" that allow all players to reroll use their dice again.  \nGo fancy and add new ingredients to your dishes allowing you to make more money.\nEarn \"Hustle\" which allows you to manipulate dice in a pinch. \nIt will come in the same size box as Now Boarding, 6\u201dx9\u201dx1.5\u201d It'll have sandtimers and a timer app. Check out the new tiers that include copies of Wok Star.\n  Tim here  - Now Boarding started 10 years ago as a videogame (nowboarding.us).  My friend Tom Mason and I wanted to be indie game developers. We came up with a quirky time management game that captured the craziness of running an airline.  It's been a crazy journey since then  - working at game studios and recently going full time making boardgames.  So now it's back, converted into a boardgame that still has the interesting routing problems, angry passengers, time pressure - but now you have your friends to help!\nHelp guide the development of this game. We listen to our backers and strive to implement their clever ideas. \nOnce funded, our stretch goals will add more content and better components to improve the game for everyone.\nBackers receive the game at a discount compared to after the campaign. This game is not going to distributors.\nIt may not be in your local store.\nWithout your help, we won't be able to print this game and share it with the world.\nEuropean copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI will be working with my established partners for printing, shipping and fulfillment.

The Japanese celebrate this occasion, as according to their traditions, the goddess of Fuji mountain, Konohana Sakuya Hima revives the fallen flowers at this time. The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality, it is called Sakura.\nThe players in this game aim to play cards without taking any tricks. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules. The players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (coins). The best tactician will earn the least points by managing their coins the best and will win the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs till next spring.\nFor 2-6 players aged 10 and above.\n Easy to learn\nThe game is easy to learn and to teach. The active player has to play a card from hand onto each face-up card on the table.\nThe placed card must be the same colour as the card on the top of the pile, and it must be either greater or lesser in value then the top card, depending on the direction of the Yin- Yang card. Cards with the values of 1 and 13 count as adjacent. On the increasing side, a 1 may follow a 13, on the decreasing side a 13 may follow a 1.\nOR  \nThe placed card is the same value as the top card on the deck but is of a different colour.\nExample:\nTactical depth \nIf you cannot play a card using the main rules, you may hire one or more characters. To win the game you have to manage your coins well and combine the available character skills. \nExample: The player in his last turn cannot play any card by default. He has 5 coins, so he can use the first Samurai for 2 coins. It reverses the Yin-yang card and now he can play a black number 3 onto the right side. Now he pays his remaining 3 coins on Konohana, which allows him to play a card in any color. That way he can play his number seven card on the left side.\nYou have to take the pile(s) where you cannot play new card(s) in your turn. You will get coins from the cards immediatelly, but unfortunately they contain penalty points too, and only the player with the fewest points can be the winner of Sakura.\n             Note: Some components will not be included in the retail version and will be buyable only separately.\n  The game components are language independent, the rulebook will be included in 4 languages: English, French, German and Hungarian. \nThe latest rules are available on our homepage: http://a-games.hu/en/download/ \nDirect link: English rules, Hungarian rules, German rules, French rules\nAdditional: Spanish rules, Italian rules\nNote: The rulebooks are subject to change in the final product.

Any remaining copies from the small print run will sold directly by us via conventions and Amazon sales in 2018. \n                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 39th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Heroes Wanted: Elements of Danger will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Citizen", "descp": "Thanks for the support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Hero", "descp": "One copy of Heroes Wanted: Elements of Danger with all stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["743 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Sidekick", "descp": "One of all Heroes Wanted expansions - Extra Extra, Heroes Wanted: The Stuff of Legend, Breaking News, and Champions & Masterminds 1 & 2, as well as One copy of Elements of Danger with all of the stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["55 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Champion", "descp": "One of all Heroes Wanted games-Heroes Wanted, Extra Extra, Heroes Wanted: The Stuff of Legend, Breaking News, and Champions & Masterminds 1 & 2.

Time is running out. Elite factions are exploring the cosmos for a new home, new technology, new allies, or the resources needed to repair the plight of their damaged home world. With nothing left to lose and on the brink of madness, these warring Earthlings, equipped with deep-space warships with expansive cargo holds, will do whatever it takes to claim the glory for saving humanity...Before The Earth Explodes!   \nBefore The Earth Explodes uses clever tactics and intuition to secure victory in 1 of 4 ways:  \n*Advance to the top of the Tech Track  \n*Colonize 7 new planets  \n*Destroy the opposing faction  \n*Meet a variable victory condition revealed during play\nIn the game, players choose actions simultaneously to determine their course of play. Using a Rock-Paper-Scissors-style of action resolution, a scout will attack an invading ship while an invading ship will damage an away party or a mining vessel while a mining vessel will defend itself against a scout. If a player is able to avoid taking damage they will get to carry out special actions based on the card played. These actions allow players to increase their technology level, encounter an ally ship, clone an opponent's ability, take control of a new planet, or mine for resources.\nBefore the Earth Explodes is 2-player space epic in a small package. Each game takes 20-30 minutes to play. The game was created by the prolific design team and members of Game Artisans of Canada, Daryl Andrews and Adrian Adamescu (Sagrada, Mine All Mines, and the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Showdown).\nGame Setup:\nHere's a basic rundown on how the game is played (see video above for more in depth overview!):\n  Players choose and reveal their action cards simultaneously.\n  At the beginning of this phase, players resolve the icons on the portion of the card with the image.\n  In Phase 1, players may gain ship cards, deal damage, and cancel their opponent's action.\n  As long as players haven't been dealt damage they may resolve their actions (on the bottom portion of the card) in alphabetical order.\n    Next, as long as they haven't been damaged, players may spend resources to colonize a planet. Planets provide one-time use abilities as well as move players towards victory.\n  In the final phase, resources, planet cards, and ship cards are refilled to prepare for the next round.\n  There are several paths to victory that require outthinking your opponent and being attentive and flexible to the changing landscape or the game!\n Check out Jason giving an overview at Origins Game Fair:\n    As with every Green Couch Games title, we try to pack a big experience into a small box so you can easily get our games to the table with casual and hardcore gamer's alike!\nWe think Before The Earth Explodes is GREAT but don't just take our word for it! Check out this previews and other helpful links! (Please note that all pictures use prototype components and don't always reflect the final product.)\n  \"The art is amazing. The feel of the game is super cool. It plays very fast. This has very tactical decisions to be made for an overall strategic goal.\" -Chris Kirkman, The State of Games Podcast.\n  \"Before The Earth Explodes is a really fun, tight 2-player experience.

This one\u2019s a winner.\" -Gameosity.com\nCloak and Meeple shares their preview here and strange things occur:\n                        \"I like that there are a variety of ways to win, even in this compact, quick-playing game. You really do get to pick which of the 4 Xs (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) you want to focus on\u2014but you have to mix it up so that your opponent doesn\u2019t guess what you\u2019re up to.\" -Jonathan Liu, Geek Dad\n\"Before the Earth Explodes successfully fits a head-to-head two player game with conflict, the potential for evolving strategies, and an element of intuition into a tight, enjoyable 20-minute filler experience.\" -Married with Board Games \nCheck out their whole video here:\n                                                            \"It was a mind game trying to figure out what card you can safely play...Every action you take in this game feels enormous...It's great!

Here are the options for getting on board to help make Before The Earth Explodes a reality. Hurry, before we run out of time!\n         At the Captain Level and beyond, your pledge includes a killer custom playmat for organizing your play area! These playmats are cloth with rubber backing and measure 12\" by 18\" and 1/16\" in thickness. These will not be available in stores!\nYou can add-on one of our previous games by adjusting the amount of your pledge! The prices below include shipping. You can add this amount to your pledged amount and we'll collect information about the games you added at the end of the campaign. We'll also ship the add-on games out before Before The Earth Explodes, right after we receive the funds (about two-three weeks after the Kickstarter closes).  \nHere's the prices including shipping (which are cheaper than buying them from our webstore): \n                        Before The Earth Explodes is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US! International Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.  \nAdded Shipping as follows:\nExplorer Pledge Level: US-Included!, Canada-$5, Everywhere Else-$8 \nCaptain and General Pledge Level: US-Included!, Canada-$10, Everywhere Else-$17 \nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is CUSTOMS FRIENDLY. The low price point and small box for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the recent rate increase in the US Postal Service, and we must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game below MSRP while covering the first $5 of shipping costs for all backers. We'll also be adding some extra content at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course).\nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Before The Earth Explodes that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components to make this cool game even cooler! We have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a peek at the first couple stretch goals! We'll announce more and funding thresholds as we get closer to funding!\nThe cloth resource bag is unlocked! Onward and upward!\nCustom wooden tie breaker token is unlocked! To the cosmos!\nAt $9000, we upgraded to a box cover with Spot UV to help the awesome artwork standout even more! \nSpot UV is a process that involves adding a varnish to specific spots of the printed material to draw the eye's attention and give it a super fantastic visual pop and added texture.\nAt $10,000 we'll have the game logo added to the cloth resource bag!\nAt $11,000, we'll increase the size of the player boards from standard sized cards to tarot sized cards!\nIf you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the Work-in-Progress Rules PDF RIGHT HERE!

And so far I have been able to avoid delays and common pitfalls by paying special attention to the following areas and building on previous experience:\n\nArt and Design. The art and design for the game is nearly complete so we'll be ready to print shortly after the close of the campaign. I always like to show you I mean business by paying for the art and design upfront!\n\nPlaytesting and Reviewing. Before The Earth Explodes has been tested by many different playtesters and even a bunch of game designers. I have sent a bunch of prototypes to a variety of reviewers. I want to earn your trust by providing you with a solid product that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by folks from varying backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nPast Experience. This is the tenth Kickstarter project I've run for Green Couch Games and I have helped with several other successful campaigns. Also, having spent many years working in retail and customer service, I understand the importance of treating backers with respect and following through with projects.\n\nOf course, there are always unexpected circumstances that pop up, but I PROMISE to communicate every step of the way and do my best to use creative problem solving meet the challenges head on.\n\nThank you so much for giving Green Couch Games a chance. As a small company, I truly can't do this without you.

If you\u2019re correct, you are rewarded with a great bounty!\nOur stretch goals will unlock other promo cards as well - check out the stretch goal chart below! \nLike all Jellybean Games, Ninjitsu! is simple enough for young gamers to enjoy, but with enough strategy to engage grown-ups as well. The hidden treasures add a unique bluffing element to the game and keep everyone engaged at all times. \nIs that treasure going to guarantee your opponent victory...or is it a carefully laid trap? There\u2019s only one way to find out! \nThe Traps! expansion offers 14 new cards, including a whole new type of trap: cards with long-lasting effects! Stealing treasure has never been so risky, with new traps which prevent you from drawing, swiping, or even playing hidden treasures of your own!\nWith more treasure, more ninjas (the fiendish Master of Tricks, the devious Master Thief, and the dastardly Master of Escape) and more ways to bamboozle your opponents, this Ninjitsu! expansion will totally change the way you play the game. \nAn ancient grimoire has been uncovered, unleashing the secrets of elemental magic! These 15 cards add a unique twist to the game, and can be shuffled into any game of Ninjitsu! OR Scuttle! to add a little magic touch.\nGive yourself the power of Flight, Alchemy, Healing, and more! The magical tome\u2019s abilities will leave your opponents stunned as you duplicate your cards, transmute treasures, and invisibly steal their cards\u2026\nCombining either Traps! or the Supernatural expansion with Ninjitsu! adds the fourth suit to the game, which means the game can be used as a standard deck of playing cards.\nSeize the powers of the elements with these unique player abilities! Master the forces of nature to crush your opponents.\nAt the start of each game, each player is dealt an element - they choose which of the two elemental powers to use and play the rest of the game with that ability.\nWill you use the powers of Fire to protect your treasure, or to steal cards from your opponents? Will your Earthly abilities give you a boost at the start of the game, or grow your treasures? Will the power of Heart be enough to overcome your opponents? There\u2019s only one way to find out!\nWe have unlocked ALL of our stretch goals!

I've backed many of my favorite games through the platform, and thanks to the community we built with our previous projects, Jellybean Games is able to continue its mission: to make family-friendly games for everyone.\nNinjitsu! is our fourth game, and we\u2019re so excited to share it with everyone. But without your support, we can\u2019t make it! As you can see from the review copies, the game is fully designed, the rules rule, and the art is all complete; all we want now is your help to print the game and distribute it around the world.\nNinjitsu! is the fifth project from Jellybean Games. The company was formed to bring you awesome experiences for gamer kids (and their parents) which can also be enjoyed by the wider gaming community.\nOur aim is to make games for kids that grown-ups love.\nAll the money we raise will go towards making Ninjitsu! even better, and furthering development on all our future games.\nIf you like the game, please support the project (every dollar helps!) and tell your friends...especially if they have kids, know kids, love kids, or love great games and gorgeous art!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur first game, Scuttle!, delivered on-time to most backers (and only slightly late to the rest). \nOur second game, Dracula\u2019s Feast, is now shipping.\nOur third game, The Lady and the Tiger, is about to hit the printer.\n\nWe have learned a lot of valuable lessons from our first few campaigns, and we are confident that this game will arrive by the anticipated delivery date at the very latest. The game has been going through playtesting for months now, and the vast majority of the art is complete.\n\nOnce the campaign wraps up, all we need to do is put the finishing touches on everything, and send it to the printer!\n\nThat\u2019s it!\n\nWe are renowned for keeping our backers in the loop through our comprehensive updates. When you back a Jellybean Games campaign, you know you\u2019re in good hands!\n\nAs well as that, we are offering a money-back guarantee. If you decide that Ninjitsu! isn\u2019t for you within a month of receiving it, you can return it for a full refund, no questions asked.\n\nIf you have any questions about any part of the campaign, you can message us through Kickstarter or email contact@jellybean-games.com for a prompt response.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "APPRENTICE", "descp": "Support the project!\nGet access to project updates and the pledge manager!\nINCLUDES:\nProject updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["71 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "NINJA", "descp": "Just the game!\nGet a copy of Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, and all unlocked stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nNinjitsu!\nPromo Pack\nProject updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["223 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "SHINOBI", "descp": "The game + either expansion!\nGet a copy of Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, and EITHER expansion - the Supernatural expansion or Traps!\nINCLUDES:\nNinjitsu!\nPromo Pack\nAn expansion of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "NINJA MASTER - US BACKERS ONLY", "descp": "The game + both expansions!\nGet a copy of Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, BOTH expansions (the Supernatural expansion and Traps!) and The Elements mini-expansion!\nINCLUDES:\nNinjitsu!\nPromo Pack\nThe Supernatural expansion\nTraps!\nThe Elements mini-expansion\nProject updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,184 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "NINJA MASTER - INTERNATIONAL BACKERS", "descp": "The game + both expansions!\nGet a copy of Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, BOTH expansions (the Supernatural expansion and Traps!) and The Elements mini-expansion!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["814 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "PIRATE NINJA", "descp": "Everything Ninjitsu! + everything Scuttle!\nGet a copy of Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, both expansions, The Elements mini-expansion, AND Scuttle! with both expansions!\nINCLUDES:\nNinjitsu!\nPromo Pack\nThe Supernatural expansion\nTraps!\nThe Elements mini-expansion\nScuttle!\nThe Curse of Black Jack\nScurvy!\nThe Scuttle! promo pack\nProject updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,235 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "ONIWABAN", "descp": "3x the game + both expansions!\nGet THREE copies of: Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, BOTH the Supernatural expansion and Traps!, and The Elements mini-expansion!\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Ninjitsu!\n3\u00d7 Promo Pack\n3\u00d7 The Supernatural expansion\n3\u00d7 Traps!\n3\u00d7 The Elements mini-expansion\nProject updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["68 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "WAR", "descp": "3x everything Ninjitsu! + everything Scuttle!\nGet THREE copies of: Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, both expansions, The Elements mini-expansion, AND Scuttle! with both expansions!\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Ninjitsu!\n3\u00d7 Promo Pack\n3\u00d7 The Supernatural expansion\n3\u00d7 Traps!\n3\u00d7 The Elements mini-expansion\n3\u00d7 Scuttle!\n3\u00d7 The Curse of Black Jack\n3\u00d7 Scurvy!\n3\u00d7 The Scuttle! promo pack\nProject updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 499 or more", "title": "BECOME A NINJA", "descp": "Kelly will draw you onto a card!\nGet a copy of Ninjitsu!, the Promo Pack, all unlocked stretch goals, both expansions, The Elements mini-expansion, and Kelly will draw you (or a person/pet of your choice) onto a card to be included in the Promo Pack!

Get ready to gather your gear and head to the beach, where vendors are lining up to collect the crabs you catch. Choose your prizes wisely, and you might just shell out the shellfish they need. Race to snatch up as many crabs as you can, or upgrade your gear to improve your chances of nabbing yourself a star. Compete with your friends to find out who is the true crabbing king.\nShuffle up the crab cards and deal out a hand of cards to each player and then form the crab pool. Players will then take turns trying to raise or catch the right crabs to sell to the market.\nThe first player to accumulate 25 points on their turn triggers the final round. Whoever has the most points by the end of that round, wins the game.\nThis 30mb PDF file contains the draft rules, and all of the cards. Everything you need to play Crabs!

Please post them in the comments section on what you'd like to see in the game. \n                                         We like to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. We know money can be tight for retailers, so the amount you pledge today is only a deposit on the full amount. We'll send you an invoice for the remainder before we ship your rewards. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release the regular retail versions into distribution, giving you a head start on your competition. You can see the Retailer 12-Pack pledge level in the right-side column of this project page.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and it's own budget of production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively. \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...\nMerchants of Araby delivered to most backers 2 months early, was debuted at Origins 2017, and hits retail stores on July 26th.\n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower delivered to most backers 2 months early, will debut at GenCon 2017, and hits retail stores on September 20th.\nGo Nuts for Donuts is being fulfilled on time by GameWright, our worldwide publishing partner.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost is shipping now to most backers, will debut at GenCon 2017, and hits retail stores in October. \nFood Truck Champion is at the printer and we expect to deliver to backers in October. We also expect to debut Food Truck Champion at EssenSpiel 2017 and release it to retail stores in November.\nSailing Toward Osiris is finishing translations into German, French, and Spanish. \nCrabs! is on Kickstarter now. \nHorizons is in the hands of game reviewers and is coming to Kickstarter on August 29th. \nSarah\u2019s Singularity is in final testing and is scheduled for Kickstarter in 4Q2017. \nAlchemea is in beta testing and is scheduled for Kickstarter in 1Q2018. \nCorsairs: A Valeria Adventure is in beta testing. \nSpaceways is in beta testing. \nChocolatiers is in alpha testing. \nPeddlers is in alpha testing.\nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support Crabs!, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up.\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.  \nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer\nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer, Game Developer, and Prototyper\nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer \nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner \nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer\nClaire Donaldson, Illusionist, Illustrator, and Graphic Designer \nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called PlaytestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n                                                                                                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running successful Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers started the gaming frenzy on Kickstarter), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games (Sunrise City and the \"Valeria\" series of games).\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. Whether the news is good or bad, you can expect us to report it honestly and openly.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Crabs! are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 16 or more", "title": "1 x Crabs!", "descp": "One copy of the Crabs! game and all appropriate unlocked stretch goals.

Not only did Kwanchai agree to illustrate the game, he was excited about it and has been amazing to work with.\nKwanchai Moriya is an illustrator and painter. He was born in New York and grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. He completed his education with a degree in History from the University of California and a degree in Illustration from the Art Center College of Design. Kwanchai lives and works in Los Angeles, California with his lovely lady and pet tortoise.\nHe has a passion for making fun illustrations, and has worked primarily in board games, card games, and children's books. Kwanchai is also an avid painter, working mostly in acrylics with science fiction and fantasy themes. His other hobbies include making wood toys, playing board games, and backpacking.\nKwanchai has illustrated quite a few board games, including: Kodama, Prospectus, Loop Inc., Days of Ire, Capital Lux, and the Catacombs family of games.\n    We have been working with LongPack games to manufacture Trash Pandas.

We have been closely involved with several other crowdfunding campaigns (working with publishers as a designer) and learned quite a bit from their success and mistakes.

Once upon a time. Since her passing, this once great land has dissolved into formless void. While all of the Fae kingdom has mourned this tremendous loss, you \u2013 the Guardians of the Four Winds \u2013 have vowed to restore Idyllon to its former glory.\nGroves is a strategy game that combines worker placement with bag building. There are multiple worker types that a guardian can summon to reap the benefits of the land.\nRounds start with players drawing three spirits (workers) from their summoning bag and placing them one at a time.\nAfter drawing their Spirits, players take turns placing those Spirits in available locations. At the start of the game, Spirits can be played on a player's own groves or onto the central Tree of Idyll.\nOnce a player constructs a portal, that player can also place their Spirits onto another player's groves.\nPlaying on Groves will earn a player resources and/or dominion points. Any spirit earns the general ability (lower left).  When a paired spirit is played on a matching grove, the player earns the general ability as well as the bonus ability (bottom right).\nPlaying at the Tree of Idyll allows players to purchase new Groves (crystal costs vary and are paid to the player currently holding the crown token), collect summoning bonuses, and construct portals.\nAfter all players have placed their three spirits, any spirits in the Tree of Idyll are discarded, while the spirits played on groves are placed in the summoning bag of the owner of the realm they are played in (regardless of which player played them there).\nThe game continues until the Grove deck runs out. Players count Dominion from their groves, Dominion earned from Grove abilities, Dominion earned from completed summoning bonus cards, and any Dominion earned from global bonuses that they collected. The player with the most Dominion wins! \nTo win, players must make the most of their realm by adding new Groves to gain Dominion Points and new abilities. They must also optimize their draws by adding new, helpful Spirits while banishing unwanted Spirits to the Tree of Idyll or to their opponents' realms.\nLearn more about the gameplay by watching this Learn to Play by Cassie Elle!\n                                                                                                *Multiplayer and solo variant both included on Tabletopia!\n                                                                                                                                        Read the full Gameosity preview\n                                 Read Mike's take on the use of bag-building in Groves\n                                                                           Watch Rahdo's Runthrough of Groves\nWatch Rahdo's extended Runthrough of Groves\n   STAY UP TO DATE ON GROVES   \nCheck out Groves on Board Game Geek\nFollow Letiman Games on Twitter  \nLike Letiman Games on Facebook  \nFollow Letiman Games on Instagram    \nPOCASTS, INTERVIEWS, AND MORE INFO ABOUT GROVES\n  Tompet Games Kickstarter Interviews - Dan Letzring\nGo Forth and Game - Circle the Circus in the Grove\nBoard Game Workshop - Episode 13: Steven Aramini\nCardboard Architects Kickstarter Special: Steven Aramini & Groves\nPeople Behind the Meeples - Episode 72: Dan Letzring\nPeople Behind the Meeples - Episode 75: Steven Aramini\nFairway Thoughts: Grove\u2019s Bag Building\nKickstarter Groves Livestream 1\nMEDIA COVERAGE\n\nHuffington Post - 8 *NEW* Games You Should Judge by Their Cover\nGameosity - Jess\u2019s Fav Five Kickstarters of the Week 6/9/17\nDice Tower News  Wallet Kicker of the Week - June 14, 2017\nDice Tower Crowd Surfing - June 21, 2017 (Kickstarter, Kickstarter)\nClub Fantasci Kickstarter of the Week - June 11, 2017\nGeekDad Kickstarter Tabletop Roundup - June 14, 2017\nDice Tower Board Game Breakfast - Pssst, Did You Hear?

Check out the sample Print n' Play files below:\n   ...or check out the Tabletop Simulator mod on Steam!\n  Pocket Ops is the first published design of Brandon Beran, with art and graphic design by industry veteran Josh Cappel.\n         Pocket Ops is quick to pick up, because you already know how to play; If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe before, you have the fundamentals: place markers in a grid, trying to get three in a row. But wait! The simple but game-changing twist with Pocket Ops is that before you make a move, the other player gets to secretly predict where you are going to go. After your move, if they were right, your move is canceled. In addition, a variety of Specialist tokens that introduce all sorts of sneaky abilities will change the way you place and predict. Pocket Ops takes a classic framework and breathes surprising life into it.

For Canadians, this also covers import taxes and customs duties.\nUnfortunately, we can't offer the same outside the US and Canada, because it is simply too expensive. However, any EU orders will be \"EU Friendly\", in that they will not incur VAT or customs fees on delivery.\n  We know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have created the 4- and 10-copy levels with lower pricing per copy.\n     We are very happy to bring this project to you via Kickstarter. Keeping true to our philosophy, we have asked for an amount that will get us halfway to what we need to produce the game. It will take about twice as much money as we are asking to bring Pocket Ops to life, and our part is ready. You showed amazing support for the Guild with Unreal Estate, and we know we can count on your for this current project. \n~Fondly,\nMarc Specter, GuildMaster", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups and delays. Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards and transparency we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\n\nAside from artwork changes that may come about as a result of stretch goals, this game is finished and ready to go to Bang Wee, the experienced manufacturer of our two previous titles.\n\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign, and we feel confident that those lessons will help us make this campaign successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Spy in training", "descp": "Support our project + 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\nFREE shipping within the US, $5 Canada, $10 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Stroop Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["55 backers", "Limited (195 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Unreal Estate Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (205 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "Spy Hard", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 4 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 4 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$7 for shipping within the US, $12 Canada, $15 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Guild Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $15 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["43 backers", "Limited (207 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Santa Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 10 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 10 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $20 Canada, $30 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "\"Bond...

You are all amazing! We'll be posting updates as the day progresses and catching up to all of your questions and comments soon. For now, THANK YOU SO MUCH!\nUPDATE: Multilingual support added!\nUPDATE: International partner Spieleschmiede campaign funds added to US total for stretch goal unlocks.\n5-16-17 / 11pm \nTOTAL: $63,450 (US) + $4,853 (DE) = $68,303 worldwide\n Tesla vs. Edison: Duel is a fun, easy-to-learn, 2-player card game that takes less than 30 minutes to play. Duel distills the epic War of Currents to its essence while still preserving all major areas of play from the original smash hit. \nChoose Your Side. It's AC vs DC - and only one can win! \nPlay as Famous Inventors. Select Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, or one of six other amazing inventors to run your electric company and compete for control over the nascent electricity industry of the United States. Each inventor plays differently leading to unique experiences every game. \nRecruit Heroes of Engineering, Business, and Popular Culture. Some of the most well-known historical figures from the actual War of Currents join your company and play key roles in your quest for glory. J.P. Morgan, H.G. Wells, Mark Twain, and others bring deeper thematic immersion and a wide range of special abilities. \nBuild an Empire. Vie for victory by controlling two of the three available regions: New England, New York, and Out West. \nClaim Electricity Projects. From Boston to Chicago, players extend their influence over each region by completing projects in the important cities of the time. \nDiscover New Technologies. Develop the \"latest and greatest\" technologies, seize pre-eminence from your opponent, and forge new relationships with other companies that assist your bid for victory. \nPlay the Stock Market. Joust with your opponent for control of other enterprises. Six minor companies, each with their own preferred technology, are also in the electricity business and located across the three regions. Acquire their stock if you lead in a company\u2019s preferred technology and increase your own regional influence. \nConduct Nefarious Propaganda. Promote AC or DC to lead public perception for added bonuses. Lobby against your opponent\u2019s technology to hamper their regional control. Propaganda is central to any winning strategy! \nAll in Less Time Than Lunch! While Tesla vs. Edison: Duel is a recognizable adaptation of our best-selling core game Tesla vs. Edison, the experience is very different and entirely unique. With lightweight rules, minimal table space, and play time under 30 minutes, Duel is a great game-over-lunch experience for casuals with enough strategic depth for hobby gamers too! \nCome play the War of Currents heads-up and enjoy our latest addition to the world of Tesla vs. Edison!\n                   Tesla vs. Edison: Duel pits two players head-to-head in a fast and fun area control game that packs a ton of electrifying goodness into a small package. Complete rules are available, and we\u2019ve also highlighted some key aspects of play here.\nIt all start with your Inventor.  Pick Tesla, Edison, or one of six other geniuses and prepare for the Duel. Each Inventor also has a different \"instant win\" condition so be sure to keep a close eye on your opponent!\nYour Assistants can claim projects, acquire stocks, influence playable power types in regions, conduct propaganda on the PR track, and advance technologies to help you expand your empire. Duel takes place over three phases. At the start of each phase, draft Assistants to work for your company. Alternate with your opponent and activate one Assistant each per turn by taking the two actions shown on each Assistant\u2019s card until the phase is finished.  Play is smooth and speedy with almost no downtime.\nPlayers battle for control of three regions. Regions award different bonuses and are scored at the end of each phase based on player influence. \nClaim a Project from the market and put it on your side of the board, contributing points to your control of that region. \nWhile you advocate for your preferred power, AC or DC, you also can develop technology of the time to lead in Transformers, Light Bulbs, or Electric Meters. Taking the card for one of these technologies endears you to smaller power companies that can help your bid for victory.\nThe stock market still plays a key role in Duel. Your company gives you influence in its home region. If you lead in a minor company\u2019s preferred technology, you can also acquire their shares to increase your influence in the region where they do business. The more shares you hold, the more influence you wield. You can also sell stock shares for free actions!\nDon\u2019t forget the battle for public perception and PR. Place No AC or No DC tokens on a region to entirely block your opponent\u2019s technology there - at least until they counter!  You can also increase the popularity of your chosen power technology on the PR track. Along with giving you more control over the No AC and No DC tokens, advancing here yields bonus actions and also serves as a tiebreaker for region control, sometimes literally winning you the game!\nAfter three rounds of play, whichever player controls two or more of the game's three regions wins. But don't forget each Inventor's unique instant win condition - if they achieve this goal during the game then they win immediately!\n         Tesla vs Edison: Duel will be manufactured in China. Copies will then be sent to our fulfillment partner depots in various regions around the world for ultimate distribution to backers. This saves you on shipping and extra taxes.\nWe're offering deeply discounted shipping to our backers everywhere. We recognize that even with these discounts, shipping to many parts of the world is just plain expensive, but we're doing what we can to make it easier.\nGiven our strategy of shipping to regional fulfillment depots, various countries will receive their copies at different times. Historically, backers in Asia and the Pacific receive their copies soonest since they are nearest to our manufacturer, then the U.S. and western Europe are relatively close together, and finally backers in the rest of the world receive theirs. We anticipate that all backers will receive their copies by October 2017, but most of you will receive your copies sooner. We'll keep you posted with more details via regular updates as we move forward into production and fulfillment.\nFinally, we also hope to offer Gen Con pickup for backers as we have in the past for other Kickstarter campaigns. The summer con season is very important for us. There's a chance we land the ocean container here in time for the show, but if not, we're planning on air shipping a limited quantity to Indianapolis for backer pickup and sales. We realize that this may occur before some backers, particularly those in more remote locales, have received their games and we're offering Gen Con pickup to give people more fulfillment options as a result. We'll provide more details about this via updates closer to Gen Con. We hope you understand and still choose to support our project!\n    Artana is committed to supporting our retail partners. We offer wholesale pricing to verified stores and other gaming establishments. We treat you like other backers, but you will receive your rewards ahead of other normal distributions channels. If you are a verifiable retailer, please contact us through Kickstarter or send an email to hello@artana.com for more information about how to pledge at this level.\n(Designer) Dirk Knemeyer is the creative director of Artana.

The Artana team includes game industry veterans in all aspects of game design, development, art, and business. We seek to provide fresh themes, innovative mechanics, engaging play, beautiful components, and thought-provoking experiences.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all Kickstarter projects, there are risks outside our control that could slow down delivery of the project - shipping or customs delays, acts of God, unexpected power outages, etc. However, our team at Artana has finalized almost all of the art, components, and design of Tesla vs. Edison: Duel. We've tested it, retested it, given it love, and are ready to send the game to print as soon as the campaign is over. Artana has successfully delivered three Kickstarter campaigns with a fourth on the way. We know how to quickly and accurately fulfill pledges for our backers. We believe that the process of delivering Tesla vs. Edison: Duel! will be smooth and seamless, and should result in your having a light, fun, and strategic 1-2 player version of a much-loved game and expansion in your hands within our shipping timeframe.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Creative Spark!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting our commitment to make memorable games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["57 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "Duelist!", "descp": "1 Tesla vs. Edison: Duel + all stretch goals.

This dynamic game challenges players to keep their wits about them at every draw of the card. Players gain points for their bridge based on construction, height, aesthetics, and completing contract objectives. The player with the highest scoring bridge wins!\nWhat will you build today?\n      Help us to spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, and Kicktraq to unlock a new mat design! \nFirst, take turns drafting bridge cards and building your bridge! Pick any card you want, but be aware your opponent will get to pick next. Look for high-point cards and those with excellent synergies like matching bridge types and symbols. Bridge cards can be built onto to your pillar cards so long as they match the bridge type.\nEach round, draft new bridge cards and add them to your bridge! Try to draft cards which fit your bridge or cards you know your opponent needs! When building, you can add more pillars to give your bridge great diversity and height for scoring bonuses.\nIn the final round, finish your bridge by completing all the segments! Draft your last cards and build what you can to finish your bridges, then attach your last pillars to complete each bridge segment. Only completed segments can score.\nDetermine the winner! Score points printed on each bridge card, multiplying them by their level (x2 for second level, and so on). Award bonus points for each set of adjacent matching symbols. Finally, award points if you met the Contract requirements!\nTime for a new match! The player with the highest scoring bridge keeps the Contract card as a victory token. Set up a new game with the loser deciding which player goes first, then play again. The first player to win two Contract cards wins the game!\nThe Challenge\nBridge parts can only be attached in certain ways and how you navigate these restrictions while striving to fulfill the Contract\u2019s building requirements ultimately determines how well your bridge scores.\nFor the current rules, click here, or watch our How to Play video below.\n                                                                                                                                                         The following is a breakdown of the components of the base game, deluxe game, and the promos.

We hope to have many more to send you!\n    Bridges to Nowhere features multiple ways to play the game! \n This is a two player dueling card game where players compete to be the first to win two contracts. This mode features the greatest strategic depth as players must decide with each draft if they will focus on making the best bridge possible or prevent large scoring plays by their opponent. \nThe solo game uses the same components as the dueling game and requires the player win two contracts within three matches. Instead of scoring against an opponent, the player scores against an escalating point requirement predetermined by their skill level. The solo game captures the strategic challenge of the two player game while remaining a streamlined and fun solitary experience.\n3 to 4 players compete with one another to be the first to win two contracts. It features a unique drafting method to keep options tight which keeps the game fast while maintaining maximum strategic depth. This mode is great for players of any skill level!\nBridges to Nowhere in Action!\n    We offer several add-ons that can be purchased in addition to your pledge.\nBridges to Nowhere Game Mat  (14\" x 24\" x 1/16\") - Add $13 to your pledge (+$3 shipping outside the US/CAN) to receive our beautiful, high quality fabric game mat with rubber backing. It's large enough to support your best bridge designs.

Please double check your components as we've had a few reports of missing components. I'm waiting to see if Gamesquest has spare games left over after fulfillment. Otherwise replacements will be shipping from Canada and it might take a bit longer to arrive. Hopefully Gamesquest has enough spare copies of the game to help us out with replacement parts.\n\n2.  games are en route via AIR shipment after I asked the owner of VFI to please change the shipment from ocean freight to air as it was his mistake for forgetting to ship them for a month. They should be arriving by the end of this week and hopefully you'll start to see shipping notifications soon!\n\n3.  shipments are in multiple different places according to the tracking info. Unfortunately there is not much we can do at this point other than hope that the packages don't get lost. We thank you so so much for your patience.\n\n4.  A few people have reported missing cards. Here's the link to the . Please email steph@firstfishgames.com with your name and address for replacement parts!  \n\n5.  Translations are on our website under the \"Translations\" tab \n\n6.

I just received email from Gamesquest that games shipped out today. You should be receiving notifications today or tomorrow.\nFor AUS I have bad news. I spoke with the owner of the fulfillment center of Asia who was supposed to send AUS Games to an AUS fulfillment center for us. Apparently he got so swamped with the holiday rush that he forgot to send the AUS Games out. He immediately packed them and scheduled them to go out a few days ago but that means the games still need 2-3 weeks to travel overseas. I did ask him to expedite it via air but have not heard back yet. I\u2019m hoping he can eat the cost and ship by air to reduce the wait since it was his mistake. But if he already sent it out via ocean then the wait will be 2-3 weeks. I\u2019ll keep you updated."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "EU good news!

I know it must be frustrating seeing other backers in Asia and North America receiving their games.\n\nSecond, finally some good news. Gamesquest is supposed to receive the games today. Due to delays all over the place (congested port and customs delay) we are behind on shipping out your copies. I expect games should be shipping out early next week after Gamesquest processes the shipment and you should see it delivered within 1-2 weeks depending on your location.\n\nWe truly appreciate your patience through all of this. And please know that we are also very frustrated but at last we can finally move forward.\n\nA reminder for our Pacific NW friends, if you didn't see our facebook post, we will be heading down to Bellevue, WA to attend Orcacon. We don't have a demo table or anything but we'd love to play some games with you! Just message us directly and we can work something out. :)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "EU shipment update and Orcacon!", "update_content": "It sounds like people are starting to receive their games!

Yes you will have 2 market tracks in the box. I've confirmed with the manufacturer that this was a mistake on their part. As long as nothing is missing then we are good! You can frame the extra one or keep it as backup hehe :)\n\nIf you are actually missing any components, please email me at steph@firstfishgames.com and we will send out replacements asap.\n\nPDB Sales is in fact, Starlit Citadels. If you're a Canadian backer, then you will have received or will be receiving a delivery notice from them soon. \n\n\nAs a side note, we will be attending Orcacon on January 13/14th. We will not have a booth or any demo space as we decided to attend way too late to reserve anything. But we'll be around available to play games and whatnot. If you're attending, let us know and we can meet up to play Get Off My Land!, our new prototype, or other games too!\n\nHope you all had a great Christmas and have a happy new year!\n<3"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Games games games!", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe received word from our US freight forwarder that they would be delivering the games to Funagain tomorrow or Monday but that means that it arrived too late to make it in time for the Christmas deliveries.

To throw another wrench in there, the manufacturer has delayed our completion date again, currently telling us November 14th is the new completion date. Which means the chances of games being delivered before Christmas is getting slim. If you're frustrated, imagine us!\n\n\nTo our knowledge, the next vessel to depart from China to UK is November 27th, which means it wouldn't arrive until late December. We have the option to air freight the UK shipment to Gamesquest, which is a huge chunk of money we don't mind spending, but there is still no guarantee that they will receive it in time to send games out for Christmas. I've asked Gamesquest to let me know what they think is the best option at this point.\n\n\nAs for the US/CA, Asia/Aus/RoW, we're still waiting for the dates from the freight companies and will let you know as soon as we do. Once we get closer to manufacturer completion, we should be able to lock in the shipment dates.\n\nWe're trying to iron out all the fine details and do our best to ensure the games arrive by Christmas, but there are a lot of different factors that are out of our hands. We hope you can understand how frustrated we are and that we are doing our best. Your patience means the world to us. We can't wait for our game to hit your tables.

Welcome to Peak Oil: A game about Crisis and Profit.\nYou are the top manager at one of the big oil companies, tasked with leading your enterprise into a future without oil. With peak oil looming ahead, you try to squeeze the last drops from oil fields around the world to gather the resources to invest into various oil replacement technologies. While you may try to emerge from the coming crisis by regular means, your competitors will most probably not, forcing you to dirty your hands as well.\nPeak Oil is an eurotrash-style game of worker placement, set collection and push your luck for 2 to 5 players of ages 10 and up. Games last around 45 to 60 minutes.\n Undead Viking's review\n\"Peak Oil is an interactive game with just the right about of interference. I really dig the game because of the clever action selection mechanism along with the artwork is amazing. For me, backing this game is easy. I love interaction in my games and Peak Oil has it in spades, plus its not hard to teach. This means more table time.\" - Larry Cruz (U.S.A.), of The Boardgame Group\n\"This game is great. I went in wanting to make all the right decisions and by round 3 I was doing everything wrong.\" - Patrick Leder (U.S.A.), of Vast: The Crystal Caverns\n\"There haven\u2019t been very many oil drilling based games through the years. But Peak Oil is a fantastic game of drilling, shipping, & investing in the future. Peak Oil hits on the real reality of things.\" - Christopher Richter (U.S.A.), of Board Gaming For the Win\n\"As a dreamer who wants to one day design his own game, I would love to sit down and pick the brains of this design team to see how they created such a minimized and sleek project.\" - Paul Gypson (U.S.A.), A.K.A. TaylonMoon\n\"The base mechanics are easy to teach and learn, but there's a lot of factors that give it great depth and replayability. Plus, the graphic design and illustrations are fantastic!\" - Juegos y Dados (Spain)\n\"The art work while simple is very easy on the eye and it would be a mistake to think of it as just a satire take on a global industry. Behind the exterior is a deep game offering great player interaction and choice but above all else its great fun to play.\" - Martyn Poole (UK), of Zatu\n\"The game's duration is great, as you can never do all that you want to do. There's also plenty direct interaction with other players, by blocking them and forcing them to push their luck. We can't wait to have the final version on our shelf!\" - Doctor Meeple (Spain)\nHere's the interview to co-author Tobias Gohrbandt by Jeff Beck of Your Table is on Fire podcast.\n  Peak Oil packs a lot of premium quality components, because we're determined to give you, dear backer, the best possible playing experience (We obviously don't expect a top manager at one of the big oil companies to play with inferior components...)\nAlso, we're happy to announce that all game materials are FSC certified.\nPeak Oil is an eurotrash-style board game. What does that fancy word mean? It means that both the mechanics and the theme are an integral part of the game, and they been wrought in together to create a unique playing experience.\nSince you already know about the theme, let's talk mechanics. Peak Oil's gameplay revolves around 3 main mechanics: worker placement, set collection and push your luck.\nWorker placement: On your turn, you assign your agents to different action spots on the board. If your agents are in the majority, or tied for the majority, at any given action spot they squelch the competition there and allow you to take the linked action(s).\nActions include developing and harvesting oil fields, building pipelines, hiring new agents, buying new ship contracts, investing in oil replacement technologies, conducting PR campaigns, engaging in piracy, and manipulating public opinion and oil prices (Yes, you can do a lot of stuff.)\nHere some of the guys and gals willing to lend you a hand\nPush your luck: At the beginning of the game you will put barrels (red, yellow and black) in the bag. Black barrels represent earth\u2019s remaining oil supply, and its number will dwindle down when you drill for oil. Each time you do something \u201ccost-efficient\u201d (I mean, you're an oil corporation, right?), you have to draw 1 or more barrels from the bag. If you draw a red or yellow barrel, it means the media has learned of your misdeeds and you get a PR Crisis (Yes, those are bad for you. You don't want to be on TV.)\n  Set collection: After some time, the oil will run out. This is called \"peak oil\" and marks the end of the game. Players then show the cards they've collected during the game: This is the point where you want to hold the cards that are worth more points. Whoever shaped the future best,wins the game (best as in best for their company, obviously. You're not that concerned with the welfare of the populace!)\nYou can also play the game on Tabletopia, the leading digital boardgaming platform, here (You need an account to play.)\nYou can also check the game's entry on Board Game Geek, the leading boardgaming forum, here (You can find all sorts of interesting stuff in this link, including microbadges!!)\nOK, let's get serious here.\n- It plays great: Whether you play a more cut-throat 2-player game, or a free-for-all backstabbing festival with 5 players, the game works as a well-oiled machine. That's precisely the reason why we haven't included a solo mode: we tested a ton of variants but none encapsulated the playing experience we wanted to offer.\nThe longer the game progresses, the more the bag is checked...\n- It looks great: Author Heiko G\u00fcnther (of Tesla vs. Edison, Glory to Rome, Potion Explosion, among others) is also the responsible for both the graphic design and illustrations. Being in charge for the art of his first published game as an author has inspired him, and we think that transpires on the final look of the game.\n...and this is an old version of the prototype\n- It feels great: The game packs only premium quality components. We believe that going the extra mile in this not only ensures the durability of the game, but also enhances the gaming experience.\n- It's fun: Who doesn't want to experience the power of an oil magnate? Fly on the Concorde, hire Mercena...erm, Consultants, buy start-ups, sway the masses, shape the future! This is a game with a light-hearted, ironic approach to a \"serious\" theme. \n- It is a finished & tested game: Peak Oil was initially concepted in 2005, and has been in professional development since Essen Spiel 2015, when the authors pitched the game to 2tomatoes (You can read the full story here). The game has been thoroughly tested and perfected until we all felt it was ready for release: besides our in-house testing, the game has been available on PnP form (with more than 800 distinct downloads) thorough the development process, and has also been present in major Fairs & Events (Essen Spiel 2016, DAU Barcelona 2016 and Cannes 2017). The invaluable feedback we've got from those varied testing groups and has been taken into account and incorporated into the game. And last but definitely not least, we were blessed to have the generous input of awesome boardgame designer Gil Hova (of Bad Medicine & The Networks, among others) during the development.\nCo-author Tobias explaining to a tester why he always wins at Peak Oil (Essen Spiel 2016)\n- Your pledge actually matters: Unlike other publishers out there, 2tomatoes needs your help to release this game in time for Essen 2017. This is an expensive game to produce, and despite our previous successful games (which you can check out here), we need you backing in this project.\n Please note that there are no early birds in this campaign, and all pledge levels include all unlocked stretch goals. We value all our backers equally, and we do not want to give anyone a pricing advantage (And we're fully aware that you're too busy managing your oil empire to be constantly checking this website for the start of this campaign.)\n Tally of backers who want the game in another language (including retailers):\nSpanish: UNLOCKED!\nFrench: UNLOCKED!\nGerman: 106 backers (with Spiele Offensive)\n\nIf you're a retailer, and want to buy copies of the game, please pledge for the $1 reward. After you pledge, contact us and we will provide you with further information. A survey will be sent to you after the campaign has ended.\nA brief note about Lord of the P.I.G.S.\nWARNING: Contains Pig Meeples\nLord of the P.I.G.S. is 2tomatoes' first game. It is a fast-paced filler card game of hand management and negotiation for 2 to 4 players of ages 14 and up. In it, you and your friends will take the role of Meridia\u2019s (a melting pot of southern European countries) leaders and will vie for economic supremacy!\nWe include it in the pledge level Pig Oil for 2 reasons:\nIt is not so easy to get hold of a copy of it, as it didn't really enter international distribution\nThematically, it has a lot of common with Peak Oil: it deals with a contemporary issue (in this case, the economic & social crisis in southern European countries) with an ironic, tongue in cheek approach.\nWhile every backer means the world to us, regardless of where you are based in, we can\u2019t avoid the reality: shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share for this project to be successful. However, since we want to do our best, we have included a discount for ALL shipping.\nThe rewards will be shipped to anywhere in the world. Depending on the number of backers of each region, we will ship from different logistics centers or from a single one. In the latter case, shipping might be slightly delayed. In any case, all shipping will be done through experienced fulfillment companies, so that you don't need to worry about anything regarding the shipping process, nor customs.\nShipping costs are detailed on the reward text, on the rewards sidebar. For your convenience, we've also assembled them here:\nPeak Oil, Start-Up and Corporation rewards: $0 if pick-up at Essen Spiel 2017 (see below), $7 U.S.A, $2 Spain, $6 Rest of E.U., $10 Canada & Australia, $15 Rest of the World.\nPig Oil reward: $0 if pick-up at Essen Spiel 2017 (see below), $11 U.S.A, $5 Spain, $10 Rest of E.U., $14 Canada, $15 Australia, $20 Rest of the World.\nHowever, if you\u2019re attending Essen Spiel 2017, you can skip this cost by simply coming to our booth and picking up your copies. To do so, simply select the \"United Nations Neutral Zone\" when you choose the shipping destination of your reward (After all, Essen Spiel is the Neutral Zone for the United Nations of Gamers!) \n Peak Oil is the brainchild of awesome game designers Tobias Gohrbandt and Heiko G\u00fcnther.\nThe authors pose stylishly in their HQ\nHere's Tobias' very official bio:\n\"Tobias was constructed in the early 15th century as a semi-sentient cyborg, designed to rid the world of the threat of the dodo. That noble goal accomplished, he commenced to work as a lawyer. He currently resides in Saarbr\u00fccken. Should the dodo one day return, he stands ready.\"\nHere's Heiko's very official bio:\n\"Heiko was found on the doorstep a shaolin temple deep in the darkest Texas. At the age of five, by then versed in every way of fighting imaginable, he was sold to traveling gypsies, and introduced to the ancient art of the shadow. A few years later, after acquiring degrees in philosophy and criminalistics, he started to work as a vigilante in Shanghai, under the guise of managing a gallery for contemporary nihilistic arts. In 2010, he discontinued his promising career as No performer, and since then lives in Saarbr\u00fccken and works as a graphic designer.\"\nThe game will be published by 2tomatoes games.\nEverything was blurry back in the noughties\nThere are 2 tomatoes: \u00c1lvaro Lerma and Jordi Rodr\u00edguez. We met at uni and after having adventures more or less all over the world we founded the company with a simple goal in mind: make games that are different, that stand out.\nWe're a young publishing company, based in Barcelona. We've published and distributed several games including Lord of the P.I.G.S., and the Spanish editions of Guilds of London and The Walking Dead - All Out War. We've also done other crowdfunding campaigns in the past.\nWe're very passionate about what we do and we only publish games that we love. It is a lot of work but we can live with the burden. Expect more from us soon...\nThe whole team wants to give very special thanks to Gil Hova for his outstanding input during the development process, and for the great times passed sharing the booth at Essen 2016. Fist bumps!\n2tomatoes wants to thank the special playtesters Guillem Roig, Sergio Navarro, Alberto Cano, Victor Samitier, Chris Halaska, Arne Kjell Vikhagen and Patrick Surdez; all our fellows at the \"Pati Llimona\" playtest meetings;  all our fellows at the \"Ludo\" (Spain's game designer's association) playtest meetings; all our fellows at the BGG's Peak Oil forums and everybody who has downloaded the PnP and/or has come to visit us and test the game in all the events we've attended.

It is prone to many mistakes and things can sometimes go wrong. However, 2Tomatoes has successfully run and delivered all of our crowdfunding projects (Kickstarter, Verkami), and this one will be no different.\n\nHere are the steps we have taken in order to reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1 - We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the materials for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete; the remaining 5% will be achieved by taking the backer feedback into account. We already have the production quote and an agreement with our manufacturer. We just need the funding to be able to start producing!\n\n2 - We use fulfillment companies for shipping when we have a large number of orders to ship in a short period of time. Peak Oil will use fulfillment for at least international shipping\n\n3 - We are fully committed to transparency and backer communication. We will be updating you on a regular basis and we will be present during the whole process to answer any questions and read every comment\n\nWe want to thank you, dear backer, for your support and trust.

If a large board is needed, it's needed, but otherwise I don't mind reaching a little farther, or asking another player to place a piece for me.

Another divinity shares your passion.\nYou don\u2019t have the choice : you need to show him your power to get more fruits before the end of pineapples harvest.\n        *All leftover copies of KS exclusive content may be sold via our partners, at events or appear in contests run by \u00d4z Editions.

Choose your divinity and place the 8 tikis of your color in front of you.\nTurn\nChoose between two actions :\nCreate a new totem by placing one of your tiki on an empty village\nor\nMove one of your own totems (a totem belongs to the owner of the tiki on top)\nThen, resolve influenced villages\nHow to move a totem\nTake the whole totem and move it a number of villages equal to the number of tikis which form the totem.\nThe move is always vertical or horizontal (diagonal is forbidden), without going back and forth between villages.\nYou MUST leave the lowest tiki in the village that you cross and pile it, if necessary, on the top of the tikis already there.\nResolve an influenced village\nA village is influenced if there is a totem made of 3 tikis on it. If you own the totem (you have the tiki on the top of the totem), apply the effect indicated on the corner of the village tile.\nThen, remove the 3 tikis from the tile and give them back to their respective owners.\nVillages\nThere are four types of villages :\nOne village allows to win 2 fruits\nAnother one allows to win 1 fruit\nThe marshlands doesn't bring any fruit. The 3 tikis are just removed from the tile and given back to their respective owners\nThe cursed villages causes the loss of 1 fruit. If you or your opponent don't have any fruit, a fruit from the reserve is removed from the game.\nEnd of the game\nIf you own 4 fruits, you win the game. If the fruit reserve is empty before this happens, the victory goes to the player who has the the most fruit. In case of a tie, return any fruit which was destroyed to the reserve and keep playing. The first player to win this fruit or make is opponent lose a fruit wins the game.\nShaman variant\nWhen you'll be an expert, you can play with the Shaman variant.\nAt the beginning of the game, place the Shaman near the fruit reserve and put the marshlands on the Shaman side. When you influence a Shaman marshlands, you CAN place or move the Shaman between two villages. In this case, all the moves between those two villages are forbidden.\n      Explanations in french on TricTrac\n             A game in french on Tric Trac\n   Download the rules :\n                              \n             And try the game on BoardGameArena :\n     JeuDeclick\n                                                                                                                                                              \"At first sight, Tiki attracts the eye with the beautiful illustrations of Pauline Amelin.\nOnce the rule is read, we would tend to say that the game is childish, but think again, the appearances are really deceptive.

The game has a great depth of play with simple mechanisms but for which there are innumerable strategies and the variants would be almost infinite according to the random positioning of the tiles.\nTiki is one of those truly addictive games for which we \"chain\" the games.

Here's the link if you want to check it out! \n\nWe had a great time in Victoria, B.C. attending LANtasy 2017! Lots of people got to try out Get Off My Land! and they all really enjoyed it!

We were doing all our initial calculations in USD and we subtracted the Kickstarter discount before converting to CAD. We forgot to take in to consideration how high the MSRP was in CAD. Our brains just don't work in USD.\n\nWe want to be super transparent with our backers and tell you that we really were not trying to gouge you for money. We simply made a mistake and are trying our best to remedy it. We hope you understand that we are a new company and everything we are doing is a new experience. In order to help reduce the unit cost, we chose to reduce the thickness of the cardboard components. We realized how absurdly thick 4mm was. We've reduced the base size to 2mm thick and the stretch goal is now 3mm thick (instead of 4mm).\n\nWe are adding in new pledge levels with a cheaper Kickstarter price. EXISTING BACKERS just need to choose the new pledge level and adjust your pledge amount to the new numbers. You will get the exact same reward but at a cheaper price plus we are throwing in a promo card for our Kickstarter backers!\n\nNEW BACKERS please use the new cheaper pledge levels.\n\nAnd on a lighter note, you awesome people have unlocked our first social media stretch goal! We will now throw more work at Gord and have him pump out additional artwork for all the fence cards!\n\nFrom all of us at First Fish Games, we can't thank you enough. \n\nSorry for the long update.

We have definitely heard your plea and we are working towards having the rulebook translated in to pdf format in certain languages as well as providing card reference sheets. If there is a specific language you want to see, just let us know and we will do our best to provide them.\n\nThanks for all your support and feedback so far! As a reward, I give you a pig.

The game met with huge success, being named a Best Family Board Game for 2016 by Good Housekeeping magazine, a Top-5 STEM Toy by City Kids magazine, an Awesome Math Game by MathsInsider, the Top Solar System For Kids Science Toy from Fractus Learning, and more! Xtronaut has received positive reviews from players and parents. Based on this success, we continue to grow our team and expand our line of fun and educational games.\nHumans have gazed into the night sky since the dawn of time. Dreaming, wondering, and developing stories around patterns of stars. These star patterns are now associated with some of the most intriguing and well-known creatures from mythology and nature.\nWith the introduction of telescopes, we have learned so much more about stars. They have different sizes, colors, locations, and characteristics. This knowledge has made looking at constellations all the more fun. We developed the Constellations game to bring our amazing sky, with its rich history, mythology, and science to your game-playing experience!\nOur Constellations game is based on the seven real types of stars in the Universe. Image credit: Wikipedia\nIn this game, players are stargazers, exploring the night sky and collecting stars to define constellations. They compete to find the right stars to fit the needed pattern -- are B-type stars or F-types required to complete the constellation? Players compete with each other to strategically collect the right stars, reserve patches of the sky for observation, and explore the universe. Once you have your constellation, add it to the map of the night sky being assembled right in front of you. The closer you get to putting together the actual map of the heavens, the more points you score!\nThe game involves drawing Star Cards, which represent the seven types of stars classified by astronomers. Each constellation requires a unique combination of star types to place in the sky. As the game progresses and more constellations fill up the night, players must use their puzzle skills to fit the hexes on the board to score the most points. The player with the most constellation points at the end of the game wins!\nThe game also includes an educational workbook about stellar evolution, star classification information, and the history and mythology of the real constellations.\n Each Constellation Hex has two sides: the Illustration Side and the Information Side.\nThe Illustration side contains original art and is used to place the hex in the sky\n  The information side of the hex guides placement strategy\n  Players collect unique combinations of stars that are based on the brightest stars in each constellation.\n Setup\nConstellations is for 2 - 4 players, ages 8+, and takes 30 - 60 minutes to play.\nSetup is easy. Players tailor the length of the game to time available and age groups -- shorter and simpler versions are available -- or you may choose longer and more advanced gameplay.\nBased on the desired length of the game, players randomly select a subset of the Constellation hexes for that round. Players start the game by placing a Zodiac or Milky Way hex in the middle of the table, illustration side up. This hex is the starting point for future placements.\nPlayers shuffle and deal five Star Cards to each player. Then, they place five cards face up in a row. These are the available stars. The remaining cards are placed face down and become the draw pile.\nGameplay\nThe full rules are here: http://tinyurl.com/ConstellationsRules\nOn a player\u2019s turn, they may take two of the following actions. The player can do the same action twice.\nDraw a Star Card\nReserve a Constellation\nPlay a Constellation\nPlayer's may draw Star Cards from either the face-up set or from the draw pile.\nTo reserve a Constellation, the player takes one of the available Constellation cards and places it in front of them. Only that player may complete that Constellation.\nTo play a Constellation, the player plays the required set of Star Cards for the desired Constellation. The player then places the hex adjacent to another Constellation on the board, illustration side up. The player scores points equal to the Constellation's point value plus bonuses for matching gems and desired adjacent hexes.\nPoints are tracked using star tokens, which remain hidden from other players until the game is over.\nGame End\nThe game ends when a player adds the last hex to the available constellations. Each player takes a final turn, and the game ends. The player with the highest score wins! As a bonus, a beautiful sky map has been created before your eyes!\n Backer Exclusive Items\nBackers that support us at the $22 level and higher will receive the Kickstarter-exclusive Constellations Mission Patch!\nKickstarter-exclusive Mission Patch!\nBackers that select a reward level that includes Xtronaut: The Game of Solar System Exploration will also receive an exclusive mission hex.

I really enjoyed playing it with my kids and, as each game progressed, we learned a little bit ... while having a lot of fun.\"\nDave Banks, Games Editor at GeekDad.com\n\"Constellations is a remarkable game which manages a feat that I feel is pretty rare: bridging the gap between light and accessible mechanisms and an educational experience. It can easily be taught to novice gamers, is strategic enough for veterans, and never loses sight of the fact that above all else its primary purpose is to be clean, fun, and engaging.\"\nChris Rowlands, NPCcast\n\"I had the chance to play Constellations at UnPub last weekend, and I can see this becoming one of my favorite games. The simple rules, the ones we played with for the demos, are easy to understand and ideal for younger players. The advanced rules, which involve minor penalties for over-spending your stars to build a constellation, add strategic depth to the game. In both cases, the game feels immediately intuitive after a few rounds, and this is one that I am sure is going to get countless plays in my house at game nights.\"\nDoug Levandowski, Nerd Nighters, Northeast chapter\nPlaytesting and Feedback\nWe have play tested the game extensively -- and players have enjoyed the excellent gameplay, science, and puzzle solving -- while becoming more connected to our amazing sky.\nConstellation's lead designer, Ian Zang, took Constellations to the Unpub Convention in Baltimore on March 17-19th. Many designers and playtesters there got a chance to play the game, and the experience was highly rated.\nPLAY\n\nHere are some notable reviews from our feedback:\n\"It was both educational and enjoyable. It's a great game to help teach younger players about the stars and constellations, yet it is engaging enough to satisfy older gamers.\" - Matthew Shade\nPlaytesters at the Unpub Convention in Baltimore\n\"I also appreciated the educational aspects of the game without it \"feeling educational\", preachy, or requiring advanced knowledge.\" - Bob Eckert\n\"I think this game is great as a casual and fun game-night game. The level of interactivity is low-medium which is great for groups that talk more than play. You don't have to explain each and every turn you complete as you do so and it makes it a great and fun game. I'm impressed by how much research into the constellations and the night sky went into this game. It is a beautiful game and would buy it as is. My game-night friends would enjoy this greatly.\" - Christina Weigand\nAbout Us\nWe formed Xtronaut to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and citizen scientists through space mission-related games and education programs. Professor Dante Lauretta, the leader of the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission (launched September 2016, to an asteroid named Bennu), and Michael Lyon, a leader in the space tourism sector (organizing the first tourist flights on the Soyuz Rocket to the ISS) founded Xtronaut. Our games are distinguished by their family-friendly engaging play and adherence to real scientific principles.\nDante Lauretta\n  Michael Lyon\nWe have a great creative team at Xtronaut. Ian Zang works to create and develop great games. He has worked on games such as Rayguns and Rocketships, Ashes, AssassinCon, and Seafall, with much more to come! He is the lead designer on Constellations.\nIan Zang\nAshley Kenawell has a passion for educational games and interactive storybooks, which has led her to be involved in indie game development on titles like Biota and Wandering Tales. She is currently using these illustration skills to help bring Constellations to life.\nAshley Kenawell\n  We have worked hard to be ready for this Kickstarter. When our campaign is funded, we will immediately place the order for production of the final product -- all materials are ready to go, and the game has undergone extensive and fruitful playtesting. We have proven out our manufacturing and distribution system with Xtronaut and look forward to getting Constellations in your hands as soon as possible.\nDante, Mike, Ian, and Ashley\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of tangible product to be delivered, there is a real chance for production delays and other factors presenting challenges along the way. Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and shipping mistakes.\n\nFortunately, the designers of this game are used to managing large projects. Just like in building a spacecraft, we developed plans to handle a wide range of contingencies. Our success with Xtronaut has resulted in a streamlined system for design, testing, production, and distribution.

It was the only time all 7 main characters were created so realistically, and Trekkies from all over the world came to see them.\nWilliam Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelly, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei and Walter Koenig, were molded, measured, photographed and sculpted from 1973-1981, by the legendary artist Logan Fleming, until their figures were perfect.\nEND OF AN ERA\nIn 2005, Movieland Wax Museum went out of business and all the figures were auctioned off separately, including the Star Trek figures and set. Many Trek fans, including families of the actors, bid on the figures, but one man bid higher than anyone else, so that he could keep all the figures together. Over $100,000 was spent and they were displayed once in 2006 at Star Trek Las Vegas convention, and never seen again!\nTHE FINAL FRONTIER\nThe owner of the figures knew about our 2017 would tour and asked if our Hollywood Science Fiction Museum would be interested in accepting all the figures and set, displaying them and keeping them together, of course we said yes. This Is a rare, long lost piece of Trek history, and it Is our honor to present them better than they've ever been seen before.\nTHE RESTORATION and TOUR\nWe haven't had a \"crowd fundraiser\" since 2014, and we've been fairly self reliant, but the opportunity to acquire these figures came so quickly, we didn't have time to get the funds through sponsors, so asking fans is our only way. Hair, paint and technical advising and repairs will be made by our board members, including Greg Nicotero's KNB, creator of The Walking Dead and TV and films.\nThis Star Trek Original Series Enterprise Bridge set and Spock wax figure will be introduced at Wondercon in Anaheim March 31 through April 2 2017, then the set and all figures unveiled later this year in our Hollywood Science Fiction Museum tour, beginning in Los Angeles, then around the world for the next 5 years. The tour is produced by SEE Global Entertainment, who also did the Star Trek Tour in the early 2000's. The tour will help raise money for the museum's permanent home in Los Angeles.\nREWARDS\nMany of our rewards aren't completed nor are the designs finalized. All will be the highest quality materials AND completely different from any previous Museum or Bridge Restoration items.\nTHE BUDGET\nSTRETCH GOAL\nAll funds over our goal, go directly into our STAR TREK NEXT GENERATION ENTERPRISE D BRIDGE Restoration, which will be presented late 2017, as part of our Hollywood Sci-Fi Museum Tour. In 2013 we raised $68k out of the $250,000 cost to completely restore the set, and it will FINALLY be seen.\nLEGAL\nThe Hollywood Science Fiction Museum is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational foundation.

In Farlight, you play as an entrepreneur engaged in (mostly) friendly competition against corporations, academics, and enthusiasts, all looking to be the first to discover the wonders that await beyond.\nTo get there, you'll build your own spacecraft from the ground-up, balancing power and efficiency to handle the myriad of missions you'll take on. You might find yourself making scientific breakthroughs, constructing new deep-space facilities, or transporting brave colonists to settle the untamed reaches of our solar system. But whatever the mission, you'll need both speed and savvy in order to best your rivals and forge the future of these faraway stars.\nWelcome to the world of Farlight!\nLike Nick Sibicky's other much-loved game King's Forge, Farlight is easy to learn but also has many interesting decisions and interactions, designed with streamlined play and extensive replay value in mind. Read on for more information, and we'll be posting more throughout the campaign. \nIn this Kickstarter, we're hoping to get enough support to print the game. As a thank you to supporters, we are offering the game at a discount price, along with some extra goodies we hope to unlock in the form of stretch goals.\n  A game of Farlight proceeds through a number or rounds, each with three phases: Bidding, Assembly and Launch. For all the details, check out the draft rulebook above.\n                     We'll be featuring videos and updates going into more details on the game during the campaign.\nHow to Play\n  Tabletopia Version is Live and Free to Play!\nFeel free to click the following image and head over to Tabletopia to try out the game, or simply play around with the virtual components! There are a few little differences between the physical game and the digital one, but you'll more than get the idea.\n      The Technology of Farlight Station\nFarlight Station is also home to teams of independent engineers and designers producing a range of vital components in the quest for space. This technology is of course much sought after by everyone! Let us take you through just a few exciting new technological advances...\nThis Tactical A.I. module processes all flight information and is able to directly modify engine structures and fuel dynamics to improve engine efficiency with each voyage.\n  Gathering scientific data about the often hostile locations in our Solar System is vital for successful missions. This Proton analyzer produces a steady stream of highly useful data on the elemental composition of whatever environment it encounters.\n  This bio-tech based module is highly versatile. It takes a few crew to install, but once attached it not only provides organic matter for terraforming or the habitability of long voyages, it also feeds into three other modules.\n  These Medium Boosters, though not as powerful as the Monster Boosters you may find, are much sought after for their solid performance and versatile connections.\n The Design and Testing of Farlight\nThe designer of Farlight, Nick Sibicky is also the designer of one of our favorite games, King's Forge. Nick is actually one of our favorite designers full stop, not only for his well-oiled and elegant designs, but for his ability to teach and discuss his designs in interesting ways. So we're very happy that Nick will be part of this Kickstarter campaign, and share his thoughts (and tips) on the game through comments, updates and videos. If you see him in the comments be sure to say hi!\n\nNick has been working on Farlight for over two years, and so when it came to us at Game Salute, the game play was already in a very polished condition. We worked with Nick on the theme, to tighten a few screws and added some frills. We also came up with a name. Nick's original working title was \"Project Eos\", and for a brief time we were considering \"Star Forge\" as a reference to Nick's other game with us, but we found another video game with that title and thus Farlight was born, which we are all very happy with.\nFarlight play testing session\n  Farlight play testing session\n    Credits\nGame Design: Nick Sibicky\nDesign/Development: Nick Sibicky\nArt/Creative Direction: Dann May\nGraphic Design: Dann May, Cody Jones\nArtists: Dann May, Zheng Fang\nThematic Copywriting: Chris Schreiber\nProofreading/Editor: Ren\u00e9e Snader\nProject Manager: Cody Jones\nKickstarter Manager: Chris McMullen\nPublisher: Game Salute\nPlaytesters: David MacKenzie, Richard Bliss, Kelson Kugler, Katrina Sibicky, Pat Burnett, Chuck Mueller, Matt Sledgianowski, Tom Hillman, Eric Hansen, Maldus Alver, Dan Logerstedt, and Evan Grim.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe team at Game Salute has delivered hundreds of successful Kickstarter campaigns including our own published titles and those we've helped independent publishers run and fulfill.\n\nWhile printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nWe're so confident that you'll enjoy this updated version of Farlight that we're backing it up with our Game Salute Guarantee.

Here's 4 reasons why you should back this game:\n1. Play alone, with friends or with your kids! The game is cooperative, so you can work as a team. It's also a lot of fun!\n2. Get more great stuff! By helping us make Strawberry Ninja, get an awesome set of Stretch Goals together with your game!\n3. Be among the first! Receive the game straight from the publisher, with no delays!\n4. Make a beautiful thing happen! Strawberry Ninja is a thing of beauty. Just look at the gorgeous art we've prepared just for you!\n                          Written reviews:\nThe art in Strawberry Ninja is an attention grabber for sure and is a large part of what pulled me to the Kickstarter page to begin with! That being said, I also really like that this is a game I can play with both children and adults as I have a pretty solid mix of both in my game group.\nKrista Griffiths, The Geek Girl Project. You can read the whole review here.\nStrawberry Ninja is a cute little cooperative game that is fun for the whole family. It is quick to play, simple to learn, and doesn't take up much shelf or table space.\nStuart Dunn, Stuart's Study. Read the rest of the review here.\nAnd here is what Tom Vasel from Dice Tower thinks about 3 Wishes and What's Up:\n        Strawberry Ninja game boxes will be manufactured in Poland by Granna, under our direct supervision. Manufacturing is scheduled for April 2017. As soon as production is over, we will take over the game boxes and prepare the fulfillment process. \nAll rewards will be sent out of Poland with the postal services. To be able to offer free shipping world wide, we made a deal with the local post so that we can ship a large quantity of packages in a short amount of time. The compromise we had to make is that all packages will be sent without a tracking number. However, we have done that in the past and an insignificant number of packages failed to deliver on time.\nWe expect rewards to be delivered between June and September 2017, without delays. The map below depicts our expected delivery dates:\nGranna has been our partner since 2012 and we have printed together more than 100,000 units, covering 10 titles, with editions in a total of 11 languages. With their help, we created great quality game boxes such as What's Up and 3 Wishes.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStrawberry Studio (USA) was founded in 2016 as a daughter company of NSKN Games (Romania). The two companies are still in a transitional period where various publication and production licenses and rights are held by both companies. Strawberry Ninja is owned and will be published by Strawberry Studio and fulfilled by NSKN Games. Any copies of 3 Wishes and What\u2019s Up made available via this campaign were co-published by Strawberry Studio and NSKN Games, but are owned and will be fulfilled by NSKN Games. Contracts were originally signed between the respective designers and NSKN Games and are, as such, either currently held by NSKN Games or have been, or are in the process to be, transitioned to Strawberry Studio.\n\nWe know how to manufacture games, and we know the ropes when it comes to Kickstarter. This means that have planned everything realistically, and that we will be working with tried and true partners when producing and shipping Strawberry Ninja.\n\nStrawberry Ninja is our third game, with 3 Wishes and What's Up spearheading our line of microgames. If you're already a fan, you can expect nothing less than the high quality you've come to enjoy.\n\nWe have already planned each step of production and shipping, however, in the unlikely event of anything going wrong, we have contingencies in place, as well as some spare time to deal with unexpected events. Still, an absolute worst case scenario may add a total of 15 to 30 days to delivery.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\nWe are producing, packing and shipping large quantities of games, so there is always a chance of human error or damaging some game components. In any such case, please check our customer support on www.strawberry.studio, and we will resolve the matter swiftly, and to your satisfaction.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "The Single Strawberry", "descp": "Get ONE copy of the Strawberry Ninja game with all unlocked Stretch Goals.\nFree shipping worldwide!\nINCLUDES:\nStrawberry Ninja", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["908 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "The Friendly Strawberry", "descp": "Get TWO copies of Strawberry Ninja game with a set of all unlocked Stretch Goals for each.\nFree Shipping worldwide!\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Strawberry Ninja", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "What's Up?

Hire staff, cook food, and please customers to earn awards and gain popularity. At the end of the day, the food truck with the most popularity wins!\n1 Card Serves 3 Functions!\nGame cards can be used for 3 distinct functions: Staff Action, Order Ticket, or Ingredient. Clever hand management and action selections will be key in using your game cards to help you win the game. You'll also need to time actions so that you can gain cards from the Marketplace (center card pool) that benefit you the most!\nGame Flow\nOn your turn, you can either do Market Research (draw 2 cards), Take Charge (draw your Owner/Wild card), or initiate an Action Round by playing a card from your hand as a Staff Action. Use Staff Actions to move cards to and from different zones (the Marketplace, your Hand, Player Board) in an effort to complete Orders Tickets.\nThere are 5 different Staff Actions: \nDriver: Move a card from the Marketplace to your Fridge as an Ingredient.\nCashier: Move a card from the Marketplace to your Plating Area as an Order Ticket.\nManager: Move a card from the Marketplace to your Hired Staff for a bonus Staff Action in future turns.\nPrep Cook: Move a card that is an Ingredient from your Fridge to an Order Ticket in your Plating Area.\nExec. Chef: Play a card as an Ingredient from your hand onto an Order Ticket in your Plating Area.\nWhen you complete an Order Ticket, you'll take a Popularity Token from 1 of 3 stacks. Add that token to your Food Truck board to upgrade (level up) your abilities! \nThe Meat of the Game...  \nThe Action Round is where a lot of tough decisions and game play will take place. If you initiate an Action Round, all other players will get a chance to follow your Staff Action by either playing a card from their hand or relying on one of their Hired Staff.  \nBe careful, because a player can take several of the same action by following you! For example, if you lead with a Driver, your opponent can have a Driver in their Hired Staff and still play a Driver from their hand to take that action twice! Timing is everything if you want to serve up a hot meal and be the cream of the crop. \nWe've Sprinkled in Some Spice...\nBesides fulfilling Order Tickets for Popularity Tokens, there are 2 more ways to gain bonus points:\nFlavor Profiles: Each food truck has a Flavor Profile that will help you get 5 bonus points for a set. Add Order Tickets to your Awards when a Critique token comes up. This set collection mechanic seamlessly layers in added game play and strategy.\nSignature Dishes: Each Order Ticket has a food truck logo on it signifying that it is one of that food truck's Signature Dish. Try to match Order Tickets that have your food truck logo on them to get a bonus point at the end of the game.\nCheck, Please!\nThe game ends when 2 out of the 3 Popularity Token stacks are empty. Players take equal turns, then count up their Popularity on tokens they've gained throughout the game, bonus points for sets of Flavor Profile icons in their Awards, and bonus points for Signature Dishes. The player with the most Popularity becomes the FOOD TRUCK CHAMPION!\n   Game Contents:\n36 Cardboard Tokens\n5 Player Boards\n5 Player Cards\n100 Game Cards\n1 First Player Card\n1 Active Player Token\n1 Beautifully Illustrated Rulebook\nDeluxe Food Truck Champion\nThe Deluxe Food Truck Champion pledge includes everything above, plus the items below. \nKickstarter Limited Exclusive Token\n1 First Player Knife Token\nHelper Mini-Expansion\nWe've Added Another Helper Thanks to Our Backers!\nKickstarter Limited Exclusive Mini-Helper Expansion\n6 Double-sided Helper Cards\n5 Food Truck Logo Cardboard Tokens\nWe have some great Stretch Goals planned to help us add even more content, illustrations, and upgraded materials! Thank you for your support.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              We like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. For pricing, contact David at david@dailymagicgames.com.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and it's own budget of production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter when it's ready to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively. \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...  \nQuests of Valeria is shipping to backers. \nMerchants of Araby is at the printer.\nGo Nuts for Donuts has been taken over by GameWright.\nKitten Klash is at the printer. \n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower is at the printer \nVCK Flames & Frost is at the printer.\nFood Truck Champion is on Kickstarter now.\nSailing Toward Osiris is prepping for Kickstarter May 2nd .\nHorizons is in final playtesting.  \nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support this new project, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up.\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016. \nManaSurge delivered one month late in June 2016 and is currently sold out. \nVillages of Valeria delivered 4 months late due to production and fulfillment delays. \nQuests of Valeria delivered on time in February 2017. \nMerchants of Araby is at the printer and is on-track for early delivery in May 2017.  \nGo Nuts for Donuts has partnered with Gamewright and on-track for delivery in July 2017. \n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower is at the printer and on-track for delivery in August 2017. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost is at the printer and on-track for delivery in August 2017. \nWe are very happy to announce that Schwerkraft-Verlag will be joining us on this print run to bring Food Truck Champion in the German language to Germany.\nSchwerkraft-Verlag is a German board game publisher specialized in the localization of foreign language games. They are well known for their German versions of Terraforming Mars, Raiders of the North Sea, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, and other top sellers. \nThey are also an experienced partner when it comes to fulfilling German language pledges. Schwerkraft-Verlag has already provided excellent fulfillment service to backers of games like Mare Nostrum and Catacombs, and we have full confidence in their abilities and customer service.\nAll backers of a German language version of Food Truck Champion will get their service and delivery via Schwerkraft-Verlag. You can contact them via their website: www.Schwerkraft-Verlag.de\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth. \n  Isaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer\nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer\nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer\nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner\nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer\nClaire Donaldson, Illusionist, Illustrator, and Graphic Designer\nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. \nWe're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, King's Forge, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria, Merchants of Araby, Go Nuts For Donuts, 10 Minute Heist), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Food Truck Champion are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content and Helper cards. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Premium English Print & Play Files", "descp": "Full-art, full-res, full-color Premium English Print & Play PDF files.\nIncludes the Kickstarter Limited Exclusive Helpers Mini-Expansion.\nINCLUDES:\nPremium English Print & Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["28 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "FOOD TRUCK CHAMPION", "descp": "Retail Version - includes all unlocked base game stretch goals.

AI is always first player and first action of the game is always AI truck plays cashier for a recipe and draws top card for recipe. That way when driver comes up you always have to grab and ingredient the AI truck needs for recipe. After AI truck finishes a recipe, the next action is always cashier for truck to keep that piece of game moving. When you play an action look at top three cards of deck. if the AI truck either has a staff of that action or has the action in the 3 cards drawn, the AI performs that action and places those 3 cards on the bottom of the deck. If the action is manager, draw the top card of the deck and use this card as you employee. If AI is not able to perform the action place those 3 cards on bottom of deck. Use 3 stacks of 4 tokens instead of 3 of 6. When placing token for AI, the hand size section is out of play. AI automatically chooses what is at max capacity, if none at capacity chose either employee or fridge and alternate to other option as awarded. That's my single player mode.

This is an English language translation of that same game with some small enhancements to the layout and components as well as a revised two-player variant. The game, its art, and all the components are complete.  The funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign will be going directly to printing costs.\nTo be clear, upon successful funding of the project we will be moving aggressively to collecting the Dog Names and then sending everything to the Printer. Our goal is to have this game in your hands by August, 2017.\nIn Dogs, each player owns an Animal Rescue Center and wants to turn it into the largest and most comfortable shelter for city and country dogs. Each game round is divided into three phases:\nIn Phase 1 players move their trucks through two different areas of the board, Country and City, collecting various stray dogs. Certain dogs will provide immediate financial rewards, while other lost and abandoned dogs of differing breeds will need medical care and food, yielding valuable points at the end of the game. Players will be competing for the same breeds, so tactics and strategy should be carefully considered.\nIn Phase 2 players select special cards and can perform important actions in five different places: City Hall, the Warehouse, the Pet Shop, a Veterinary Clinic, and the Dog Fair. The number of players who can use each location in the round is limited so choosing the right action is crucial to bringing about good results. In addition, there are three types of resources in the game (gas, food, and medicine) and it is essential to manage them successfully in order to avoid penalties.\nIn Phase 3 players feed the dogs in their kennels, pay the salaries of assistants, and organize the board for the next round.\nUpon completion of a certain number of rounds, the kennel with the highest score wins the game!\nThe basic game is the same as the original version which was released in Brazil.  We have made some changes to the art and added new rules for the two-player game as well as some advanced options for when you\u2019re ready for even more of a challenge.\nThe two-player game changes things up a bit, there are fewer dogs and resources making decisions tougher.  Roadwork tiles are added to the bag and appear on the board randomly, costing extra valuable gas to move through.  Several new game end triggers were also added, so keep a close eye on your opponents' actions!\nAdvanced options are flexible, add in just one or select them all. Use the two-player Roadwork tiles in a 3 or 4 player game.  Limit the amount of food and medicine that can be purchased from the Pet Store.  Use one or two of the two-player end game triggers. The choice is yours.  While Dogs is primarily a family game, it also has enough depth to engage the strategy  gamer.\n  We have two reward levels.  For the Standard level, you will receive the game and all the stretch goals (shipping costs vary by country).  For the Name reward level, you get the game and all stretch goals and you also get to personally name one of the dogs!  The Name reward level is split into 12 categories, one for each breed of dog in the game.  There are 7 tokens for each breed, giving a total of 84 opportunities to name a dog.  For this option, the dog's name and city will appear on the back of chosen breed's token, as well as in the rulebook. This is a family game so we do reserve the right to decline a name that is not family friendly.  Space is limited to 12 (Latin characters only, sorry no pictographic) characters for the dog's name as well as for the city. Your dog's name will appear in all copies of this Kickstarter edition. As a thank you for putting your dog in our game, worldwide shipping is on us for these Name reward levels.\nThis project will ship around the world but we have been working with our distributors and can offer EU, AU, Canada and US friendly shipping!\n    We have three stretch goals defined with more to come if we unlock the third.\nAt the $21,000 level, we will be upgrading the cardboard worker tokens to wooden meeples.  Your workers deserve arms and legs don't they?\nAt the $22,000 level, we will be upgrading the cardboard kennel tokens to wooden dog house tokens.  Your furry friends deserve good looking kennels.\nAt $23,000 level we will upgrade the starting player token from cardboard to a wooden dog token.  This will make the starting player truly the top dog!\nWe have some other great stretch goals as well, which we will reveal as the campaign unfolds.\n     Dogs includes:\n1 Mounted Game Board\n4 Animal Rescue Centers\n20 Player Tokens\n4 Player Truck Tiles\n42 Country Dog Tokens\n42 City Dog Tokens\n9 Reward Dog Cards\n42 Bonus Cards\n24 Money Tokens\n36 Gasoline Tokes\n22 Food Tokens\n22 Medicine Tokens\n1 Action Space / Dog Fair Board\n4 Wooden Trucks\n6 Roadwork Tokens (for 2 player or advanced game)\n1 Starting Player Token\n2 Draw Bags\n1 Rulebook\n       Want to see what others think of Dogs?  Here are some video reviews!\nThis is the original Rahdo Runthrough about Dogs:\nRahdo recently did an update based on an early copy of our new version!  Take a look!\n The folks over at The Cardboard Stacker have posted up a play though of Dogs with the new 2 Player Rules.  Many thanks Guys!!!\n   The awesome team over at the Unfiltered Gamer have posted their overview of the game!!!  Thank you guys so much!  Take a look:\n  To find out more about the game check out these links.\n    Special thanks to Nick Peck for the great sound design, Debbie Gatton for lending us her amazing voice, and Indie Game Alliance for their advice.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDogs has been previously published in Brazil and is a complete game.

Players are mad scientist in need of precious Mortals for future experiments. Rather than getting your hands dirty, your army of Campy Creatures awaits to do your bidding. Capture the most valuable Mortals over the course of three nights to win. But be warned\u2014the Mortals won\u2019t go down without a fight.\nWhat is Campy Creatures?\nIt's a ghoulish game of bluffing, deduction, and set collection for 2-5 players. Players begin each round with the same hand of creatures. Their goal is to capture valuable Mortals by outguessing their opponents. Each player has perfect information at the start so knowing what a person might do in a particular situation is key.\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nFive Creature Decks: 45 Poker-size Cards (9 Creatures each)\nThe Mortal Deck: 30 Poker-size Cards\nThe Clash-O-Meter (The Board) and Player Markers\n5 Monstrous Meeples\nThe Rules\nWe've made a component update mid-campaign and are now including small meeples in the game! This will replace the current score-trackers and sit nicely around the board. \n      Mortal Artwork Incoming\nAll Mortal cards will be fully illustrated and Josh is working hard to finish them up during the campaign. Follow along on our Instagram where we share in-progress shots to see them developed out.\nWho\u2019s Campy Creatures for?\nIf you enjoy the thrill and tension of reading people and outwitting them in a particular situation, then Campy Creatures is for you. The heart of the game is outguessing the other players as much of the time you have perfect information as to what\u2019s in their hand.\nThis would be a light-to-medium weight game. Non-gamers and casuals should be able to pick it up and have a blast within no time.  For the masters of meeples out there, we believe this could be a great starter to game night or a nice lunch-break or convention game.\nThe theme is playfully dark, but all content will be family-friendly. The box must say 14 and up, but we found the game has been enjoyed by kids as young as 8. \nA free companion app for iOS and Android will launch with the game to make it super portable\n      Download the Print-n-Play\nWe firmly believe in this game, but feel free to kick the tires first. We're giving the PnP away for free for a limited time (only during the Kickstarter). We'd love to hear you thoughts if you end up playing the game. As people found with our earlier game Control, the final components will be top-notch so we believe there's still reason enough to back the game if you PnP.\n  The download above includes A4 and US letter sizes along the rules in English. You can find other translations here:\nGerman Rules Translation\nSpanish Rules Translation\nDutch Rules Translation\nExample Gameplay\nYou can download the full rules here, or watch an example of the setup for a three player game and how a round plays out.\nVideo notes: The Mortal illustrations will be finalized during the campaign.\n      Where does Campy Creatures fit into my collection?\nCampy Creatures is in a different genre than social deduction games like The Resistance or Coup. We love bidding / simultaneous-action selection games like For Sale, Libertalia, or Eggs & Empires and Campy Creatures would fall closer into their categories. It owes a lot to these games, but we believe it stands on its own as it offers a bit more of a cerebral take on a few things.\nFirst, we wanted the game to be easily portable and affordable. Second, we wanted there to be a fun tension of doublethink present as you second-guess yourself or your opponents\u2014there's a reason all those creature eyes are watching :) Third, we wanted the game to shine at all player counts\u2014we found these style of games didn't accommodate two players, the two-player experience was just alright, or it required extra rules. We wanted to create a great two-player experience while keeping the gameplay unchanged. We looked at great two-player games like Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation and Brave Rats and sought to inject some of the fun found there into Campy. And lastly, we wanted a unique yet meaningful tie-breaker system. It was thanks to the forums on BGG discussing tie-breaker variants for Libertalia that birthed the idea for Campy Creatures' Clash-O-Meter\u2014something that's integral to the game as you'll often make decisions based on your positioning.\n  A Series of Tart Ales \nCampy Creatures not only plays great over beer \u2019n pretzels, but there will actually be a series of beer released alongside the game by Bottle Logic Brewing. This board game / beer series combo might be the first of its kind. The limited edition series will be tart ales with art from the game and each release over 2017 will feature a different creature from the game.\nCampy Creatures Posters\nEach poster is an 8 x 10 inch gicl\u00e9e prints on archival paper. In layman terms, the print is high quality\u2014almost seeming like it's been painted\u2014and the paper is nicely textured and able to hold the print for a very long time. Each creature has been updated with campy flavor text to give the posters a cinematic feel. If you click the image below, you'll go to a higher res version to better view the posters. \n  Josh Emrich (the game's illustrator) also has collector's edition movie-size posters available through his site.\n  Retailers\nWe are currently not working with a distributor, but we love providing games at a 50% discount directly to friendly local game stores. Please reach out to us here with proof of being a retailer and we can get the conversation started. Minimum order starts at 5 games. \nIt's Alive! \u2013 The Art\nWe approached Josh Emrich some months ago about illustrating and designing a creature game. Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined what's before you today. To say we're excited about the art is a vast understatement. We believe he has captured the inspired styles and era of creature features in immense detail. Josh is a mad scientist when it comes to design and illustration\u2014he has truly brought these creatures to life. \n                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our second game we have Kickstarted.

At the beginning of the game, Player's will choose the creatures with which they'd like to play. Players will collectively choose to have all matching hands or play \"chaotically\" where every player builds their own unique hand of creatures. Either way, a player's hand must contain a single card of each number (0-8). With the addition of a new mortal card, the Expansion also invites you to customize your game play experience with a unique mortal deck every time you play the game. Every round, or Night, you'll also play to win location cards that give you added bonuses in future Nights."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Space Park is on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Hello Mortals!\nTurns out we can use space travel to escape the grasp of the creatures here on Earth!

This image links to the working document.\n               THE GAME \nPlayers have a team of food trucks matching each venue. Each round, players secretly select and reveal two venues to sell their grub.\n  Players select actions to play this round, and then play them clockwise one at a time hoping to better their chances at a fat payout.\n  At the end of a round, the customers are split evenly between # of trucks. Any remainder is discarded. Food trucks return to players and actions are discarded from the game.\nTWO PLAYER VARIANT\n WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy. Manufacturing is lined up. Artwork files will be shipping to the printer shortly after the project. All that is left is the funding.  \nWe're still small, and we love Kickstarter because it puts us directly in contact with incredible people willing to help build something they believe in. We're engaged with the community attending events and meetups around the midwest including Gen Con four years in a row.  We feel energized by these connections and building trust within the community. We reward our supporters with discounts on the game and free flowing communication with us the creators. As a backer, you'll be a copilot and chef on this journey to create awesome games.\nPAST PROJECTS\nIn February 2015, we raised $36,078 on Kickstarter with our first game, Brewin' USA. This game takes place at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players auction over brewing ingredients, brew their signature line of craft beers, and compete for city and regional area control! The game has continued to grow including selling out of inventory at GenCon 2016. This project was a wonderful ride and we owe a huge thanks to our backers.  \nBrewin' USA (Kickstarter)\nBrewin' USA website\nBrewin' USA (Amazon)\nMEET THE DESIGNER\nFrom Ryan Lambert - I started gaming when I was little, especially with my Dad. We played the standards like Monopoly, Risk, Pay Day, and Careers. Eventually, we discovered games like Catan and Agricola and the collection has gotten out of hand since then. My favorite game right now is Pandemic Legacy. It\u2019s cliche, but the experience is just too good. A close second would be Imperial Assault or Blood Rage. \nI started designing games a couple years ago because I love to create and explore themes and mechanics. Truck Off started with theme. Food trucks are abundant in the Twin Cities and the idea of owning one has always appealed to me. After so many iterations, I love how clean the design of Truck Off ended up with a good mix of strategy and luck. It\u2019s a great casual game that scales well for groups and I hope you have as much fun with it as I have.\nMEET THE PROJECT CREATOR\nStill a small outfit, Adam and Chris from Adam's Apple Games are eager to continue to grow in the gaming industry.  We're engaged in this community, and will continue to deliver awesome projects and give our commitment and energy back in return. We write our final rules in as a female lead player. Check us out from Gen Con 2016, and we're pumped to announce we'll be back at Gen Con 2017! \nMEET THE ARTIST\nJohn Ed de Vera on Instagram\nJohn specializes in a unique paper craft artwork style.  This means literally cutting paper and then photographing his work.  This is a super unique style that captures depth and shadows making his pieces look unbelievably real.  He is a master at his craft, hands down.\nMore artwork on the way soon!\n SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AVATARS\nPlace these in your profile picture on Kickstarter or as your profile pic on social media to showcase your support!  \n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing.\" This is one of those things, but making new things is also tough!

You'll know if anything unexpected happens and do my best to make it right. I strive to deliver on time against project deadlines and to avoid unexpected shipping delays.

So, you could run the spectrum of a positive game where it's about growing the pie for everyone - all that way to a \"mean\" game that is all about sticking it to your buddies.
