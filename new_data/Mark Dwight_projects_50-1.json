[{"backer": "Mark Dwight", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The latest addition to our range takes all the strength, quality and craftsmanship you\u2019d expect from a WESN blade - and packs it into our most compact, lightweight knife to date. The Samla is inspired by our Scandinavian heritage and steeped in our love for the wilderness.\nNorthern Scandinavia is no place for a normal knife. Without a reliable blade to hand, it can be a remote wilderness, reluctant to yield its resources. But with the right blade \u2014 durable steel; an unrelenting edge \u2014 an abundance of wild game, fish and forage reveal itself. It takes a special blade to unlock the wilderness and make it home.\nOur Samla knife is inspired by our passion for the wilderness.  Before our blade was forged in steel, it was conceived in the blueberry groves of Michigan that I explored as a kid and the mountain tops of the Swedish wildness I later discovered as an adult.\nWe returned to this time to reimagine what a trail knife should be. It\u2019s why our latest WESN knife is extremely light and compact when carried, but versatile enough for food prep or precision cutting around camp. It\u2019s the knife that won\u2019t let you down when you venture to the edge.\n\nThe Samla knife is our latest design evolution of what an everyday carry should be. We started out with the sleek and practical Microblade, then scaled up to bigger tasks with the Allman. With the Henry pocket knife, we honored heritage. Each new design in the range is an extension not just of our pride, but of your capability in the outdoors.\n\nLight as a Feather\nEven casual day-explorers know that weight matters. For a hiker\u2019s knife, we knew we needed to make it compact and light as a feather, without compromising on toughness or durability. The titanium or wood scale handle measures a snug 3.25\u201d in length, and just 0.25\u201d in thickness. But this is a knife that punches well above its size - just 5.7\u201d from foot to tip when fully open, but that\u2019s steel enough to unlock the wilderness.\nWith Your Meals in Mind\nCarry the only knife you need in your cook kit. The sharp, precise steel blade measures 2.45\u201d and slices easily through prep work. It\u2019s tough and versatile enough to cope with everyday repair tasks around camp, from slicing rope to cutting canvas. \nThe Trademark WESN Durability\nOutstanding corrosion resistance means you can draw a bright, keen blade every time with minimal maintenance. We\u2019ve treated each component with care and attention in our design: From the non-locking friction folder for a smooth, steady action to the phosphor bronze washers for long-lasting, corrosion-resistant performance.\nThe Samla Sheath\nWe are excited to introduce the Samla Leather Sleeve. Hand made in Sweden, with natural vegetable tanned leather, the sleeve will age in time, showing character unique to how you use it. Both sleek and practical, the sleeve is the perfect companion for the Samla.\n\n\n\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nIn collaboration with BackersOnly, an exclusive crowdfunding agency for high profile creators. We've helped 500+ projects raise over $45MM.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a dedicated team focused on production. Since our first launch, we\u2019ve fulfilled over 30,000 orders. From our experience we\u2019ve learned there can always be bumps in the road. We promise to handle and solve each challenge in order to hit production deadlines. We have a strategic plan to hit those deadlines, however, due to unforeseen issues, there is always a small risk of delay in delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWith our products focused on being instant classics, nothing about our designs are trendy or cater to hype trains. The knife you carry today will still suit your grandchild perfectly when they use it. We insist on crafting our knives at the intersection of quality and beauty \u2014 ensuring your WESN knife suits any and every occasion.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur packaging is made from post-consumer materials and 100% biodegradable. Although it\u2019s cheaper to go with plastic pull tabs and bubble wrap instead of leather pull tabs and wood shavings, we followed our convictions and went the \u201cgreener\u201d route. With our plastic-free packaging, you can toss it away and feel good about doing mother earth a solid.\nSustainable materials\nThere are many design trends when it comes to knives. The worst we\u2019ve seen in recent times is using low-quality materials, at the cost of a quick buck. Through many hours of R & D, we\u2019re very pleased with our material choice and functional design.

After receiving input from our backers, we created an expansion card with a focus on bullet journalers. \nOur new design features 3 journal specific tools to take your bullet journaling up a notch. Use the BUJO Expansion Card by itself or combine it with the Original Sketchmark for even more creative possibilities!\nAfter packing the Original Sketchmark with over 15 features, we designed the Bullet Journal Expansion Card to complement it, not replace it! We built a card with 3 bullet journal specific features that fit into a small, compact design. Paired with the features of the Original Sketchmark, the possibilities for your journaling are endless!\nThe alphabet stencils were carefully designed to make it easy for you to add titles, dates, and more to your bullet journal! Our unique punctuation stencil allows you to easily create question marks, exclamation points, and periods. The stencils are designed to fit within two vertical rows of a 5mm x 5mm grid journal.\nUse the monthly tracker to keep track of all your habits! Track everything from your workouts, eating habits, sleep schedule, spending, and much more! Our unique design gives you plenty of versatility in creating your own trackers. Use the card as a stencil to create boxes for each day or use the card as a guide to quickly number your days in perfectly spaced 5mm x 5mm boxes. Unlike most stencils, we included 2 title boxes for more options! You can create amazing titles featuring letters and symbols when you use the alignment guides above the title boxes!\nTitle alignment points make it easy to add icons and titles above your calendars. When drawing a title box, simply stop at one of the 3 marking points to include a 1, 2, or 3 letter title.\nFor example, to add \"JUN\" to represent JUNE on your calendar, stop tracing at the alignment point with 3 dots to have the perfect spacing to fit your 3 letter title. \nA single icon fits perfectly when you stop at the alignment point with a single dot above it.\nAdd some character to your bullet journal with our 10 journal icons! We included 7 basic icons that can be used to represent anything you want! We also included 3 journaling specific icons that can take on a few different meanings of their own. Each icon is designed to fit within a 10mm x 10mm box.\nJust like the Original, the Sketchmark Expansion Card doubles as a bookmark! Sketchmark\u2019s bookmark cutout keeps your Sketchmark close to your journal at all times. Use it to mark your page in your journal, textbook, or book! \nSketchmark isn't just for journaling. Use it as your primary bookmark to quickly underline key passages or use the journal icons to take notes and star, check or otherwise mark your book or textbook!\n\nPair the Sketchmark BUJO Expansion Card with the Original Sketchmark! Launched in January, our original card has over 15 tools for journaling, designing and sketching. After raising over 1700% of our initial goal, input from our Original Sketchmark customers helped us bring the BUJO Expansion Card to life! \nWe designed the BUJO Expansion card to complement the Original Sketchmark, not replace it! The features of both cards are designed to work together to give you endless possibilities in creating your journal. Watch our first Kickstarter video below to see all of the Original Sketchmark's features!\n Add-ons will be available following the campaign through Backerkit!\nSketchmark's possibilities are endless! Check out a few samples of what is possible with Sketchmark and the Bullet Journal Expansion Card below! \nGet inspired by other bullet journalers by following popular hashtags on social media! #BUJO,  #bulletjournal, #bulletjournaling", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving launched successful Kickstarters in the past we are confident that we can easily avoid many problems that arise for first-time creators.

It was our dream to develop a notebook that was \"hippo sized\" and could hold many memories/thoughts/ideas in one place.  500 pages of 68GSM Tomoe River Paper strong, with the help of 1401 original backers and many Late Pledges, that project came to life in a big way.\nThe original project as well as this one are dedicated to our son who left this world too soon. He will always be our little Hippo in the sky <3\nThe #hipposquad originally planned to launch the B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto first, but since the original campaign people have been asking for a full sized A5.  We sent out a survey to feel out interest, and now heed the call for a dual launch!  This project is our most ambitious yet, with more collaborations, multiple sizes, and added features.\nFront: B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto, Back: A5 Standard Hippo Noto\nThe Pygmy Hippo and new A5 Standard Hippo Noto, pack all of the features loved from the original Pocket A5 Hippo Noto and also add a few new twists.\nOriginal Features:\nBack Pocket:  For all your swabs, mini notebooks, stencils and more!\nElastic Closure:  To keep your Hippo secure.\nTwo Bookmarks:  Convenience in the form of ribbons.\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper:  All the things you love about 52GSM but with less ghosting, and a more robust feel.\nWhats New:\nPage Numbers!:  One of the most requested features our backers from the last Kickstarter had.\nColored Dots:  Each Pygmy and A5 Standard Hippo Noto have interior dot grid that match the elastic band closure of the book itself.  To add a bit of pop to your writing experience.\nTons of Pages!:  The Pygmy Hippo Noto boasts 400 pages, while the A5 Standard keeps the 500 page count that the original has.\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding:  The original Hippo Noto was thread bound, and this time we are making the binding even stronger by adding a piece of cloth to the profile.\nCover texture:  Some of our cover options will be textured!\nNew cloth reinforced binding.\nWe are so blessed to have the talented Robert Oster do a brand new ink color exclusively for this Kickstarter.  It is lovingly named Pygmy Purple.\nIt is a berry magenta that has excellent shading and sheen, especially on the 68GSM Tomoe River Paper of Hippo Noto.\nUp close and personal with Robert Oster Pygmy Purple\nLets Talk Specs!\nA5 Standard Hippo Noto: \nMeasures 148 x 210 mm\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper (the TR paper tone closest to white and the most popular option from our last campaign)\nPage Count:  500 Hippo Numbered Pages\nBack Pocket\nElastic Band Closure\nDot Grid Interior Printing That Playfully Matches Color of Elastic Band (additional rulings as stretch goals).\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding\nAttractive and Durable Covers\nB6 Pygmy Hippo Noto:\nMeasures 125 x 176 mm\n68GSM Ivory Tomoe River Paper (the TR paper tone closest to white and the most popular option from our last campaign)\nPage Count:  400 Hippo Numbered Pages\nBack Pocket\nElastic Band Closure\nDot Grid Interior Printing That Playfully Matches Color of Elastic Band (additional rulings as stretch goals).\nCloth Reinforced Thread Binding\nAttractive and Durable Covers\nThe Colors! \nThis Kickstarter will start off with two colors, one in A5 Standard and one in Pygmy B6.  We will add more colors as stretch goals, some of which the backers will choose!  We wanted to make this Kickstarter more interactive, as we had such a great response letting the backers choose the stretch goal color for the last campaign.\nA5 Standard:  So Black.  This Hippo will feature a black cover, grey interior end pages, grey interior dot grid printing/page numbers, black bookmarks, and black elastic band closure.  The Hippo Noto logo on the front will feature a dark grey foil, in contrast to the traditional silver we use on all our other models.\nB6 Pygmy:  Purple.  Hippos are purple after all!  This Hippo Noto will feature a royal purple cover with purple interior end pages, two purple bookmarks (light and dark), fanciful purple interior printing dot grid/page numbers, and a light purple elastic band closure.\nPurple B6 Pygmy Hippo Noto Prototype\nInterior dot grid that matches the elastic bands! ***In the So Black Hippo Noto, the dots will be a grey as to not be tooo distracting.\nThe Paper\nAt the core of Hippo Noto is the paper that we use, 68GSM Tomoe River Paper.

The 0.7mm acid free gel ink flows onto your writing surface like no other. It's very reliable, and starts flowing as soon as it hits the paper. No scribbling to get it going.

To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this material will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.\nThere's none more black!\nBlack 3.0 is a super special acrylic paint. We have spent nearly 2 years tweaking its formulation to create a black that absorbs between 98 and 99% of visible light! Quite simply we've created the blackest black acrylic paint.\nBlack 3.0 brush applied to sculpture\nLast November we shared a beta batch of Black 3.0 with 1000 artists around the world for feedback and thoughts. We've now taken that information and reformulated it to be the best black we could possibly make. \nAll the photos and video content on this page are created with the final formulation of Black 3.0 from the UK factory that are producing it for us, we are excited to be playing with it and feel like it's perfect!\nWe need your help so that we can pay the paint factory to produce their minimum order quantity of our recipe so we can share our creation with everyone!\n The science behind the Black!\nWe wanted a super-flat, ultra-matte black that absorbed almost all visible light. To achieve that we went right back to the basics of paint making. The problem with existing black pigments is they are all slightly reflective (carbon is the most common and if you think of coal or charcoal you'll know it has a shine to it), so we created a whole new pigment in the lab and we call it 'Black Magick', it is born matte! This means that the mattifiers we used in Black 2.0, which added a tiny grey tint, are no longer needed making a way blacker looking paint! We've also managed to formulate a new acrylic polymer to hold the pigment, it's special because it has more available bonds than any other acrylic polymer being used in paints. This means it can cling onto way more pigment, leading to a really dense pigment load and a depth of colour not previously possible. We have sourced some brand new nano-mattifiers which we have added, these flatten out the last bits of stray light without compromising colour. \nUnedited comparison with other well known black paints\nWe have benchmarked Black 3.0 against 45 existing black paints, this photo demonstrates a small section of those, being the most commonly available black paints in the UK. We also sent beta versions of Black 3.0 to 1000 artists around the world, they filled in a questionnaire and 93% of them preferred it to our Black 2.0 (previously the worlds flattest mattest black). \nIt's super easy to use.\nOther super blacks are complicated to use and extremely expensive. Most require heat, science labs and specialist training to apply. We wanted to make a super affordable, easy to use paint that was familiar to artists so they could concentrate on expressing themselves. \nWe think that sharing your colours with others is nice! When Stuart heard that Kapoor was the only artist that could use the blackest black he felt sad but also a bit bad that he'd been making awesome colours and only using them in his own work. So he started sharing his colour creations on the internet with other artists. \nThe holy grail of paints is the ultimate zero-point black. We've been on a mission to create exactly that for a long while because we want all artists to be able to express themselves with awesome materials. The limits of your creations should be your imagination not how rich or successful you are. \nWe are a small team of artists and paint makers based in a studio in Dorset on the south coast of England. We are headed up by British artist Stuart Semple who has been making his own colours for nearly 20 years. \nWe've created and shared tens of thousands of the artiest art materials with artists all over the world including LIT (the world's glowiest glow pigment). PINK (the pinkest pink), Gold (the goldest gold), Black 2.0 (the mattest flattest black paint), Dazzle (the glitteriest plant based glitters) and many more creations. \nYou can see what we make and learn all about us on our website:\nculturehustle.com\nNo matter what reward you choose you will get at least one bottle of Black 3.0 but your support means so much to us we wanted to thank you properly.

Our goal remains to get everything done as quickly as possible and beat our listed delivery dates.  Thanks for the support!\nWe know what you are thinking, and we will go ahead and answer it for you. Yes, Kickstarter does need another pen project. Especially this one.\nSay hello to the Spoke Pen.\nThe Spoke Pen is a collaboration between Brian Conti of Spoke Design, and Brad Dowdy of The Pen Addict. And, most importantly, is built to specifically fit the best gel ink refill in the world: The Uni-ball Signo UM-151, also known as the Uni-ball Signo DX.\nThe Signo DX is a smooth-flowing, clean-writing, rich-color gel ink pen. Its quality among its competition in unsurpassed, yet on Kickstarter, the Signo DX has been mostly overlooked.\nSpoke brings an instantly recognizable design: A streamlined geometric-deco style in a world of minimal cylindrical machined pens. We're not knocking minimal design, but everything can't be minimal!  \nthe machined pen that's MACHINED A LOT!\nThe Spoke Pen features aluminum barrel construction, grip materials in aluminum or titanium, a magnetic cap for secure closure, and wide range of anodized aluminum colors. For you tech-spec geeks out there, here are the specifics:\nAs important as the specifications are, it was very important for us to get the feel of this pen right. We started prototyping all of the parts in June 2018, and went through many iterations to get to the final result we have today. The Spoke Pen feels light, but substantial. It is rock-solid and durable, but gets out of the way when writing with it or carrying it. It is high quality, and comfortable. The Spoke Pen is your new favorite pen.\nThe goal of the Spoke Pen campaign is to make the best barrel for the Uni-ball Signo DX on the planet. And, to have fun doing it by offering a wide range of colors in this campaign. Assuming it all goes well, after we successfully fulfill the Kickstarter we plan to periodically release future Spoke Pen 'editions' with more unique color combinations and materials. And yes, we may eventually make it for other refills too, such as the Pilot G2. \n Spoke Pen Classic Series: $60 Aluminum Grip / $65 Titanium Grip\nThe classic colorway has matching anodized barrel and cap, with black anodized accents (clip, ends, and slot see-through).  It is available with a black anodized grooved aluminum grip or a machined grooved titanium grip.  The Titanium grip is slightly heavier than the aluminum... and as a bare machined part it is a bit 'grippier' than the aluminum.\nBarrel color choices: Black, Blue, Red, Lime, Purple, Orange, and Rub/Brushed Aluminum\nSpoke Pen Classic Series colorway (black anodized grip)\nSpoke Pen Classic... aluminum barrel with Titanium grip.\n Spoke Pen Edition Series: \n1) The Joker, $60\nPurple Cap, Lime body, Black Aluminum grip, Black clip, Purple sleeve, lime top cap, purple end cap.\nSpoke Pen Edition Series... the Joker\n2) Orange Crush, $65\nOrange body, Titanium grip, Nickel clip, Aluminum see-through, Aluminum end caps (metal stamped Spoke 'S' on cap end). \nSpoke Pen Edition Series: Orange Crush\nAll pens ship with a Uni-ball Signo UMR-1-05 Black 0.5 mm gel pen refill.\nWe've concepted, prototyped, and iterated using 3D printing and machining. The design is now complete. Brian leads the manufacturing stage and has extensive experience with prior Spoke projects. While he has the ability to make prototypes and product in small quantities, we choose to work with professional machine shops to produce production quantity parts. While Spoke has traditionally utilized only domestic shops, the Spoke Pen will use a combination of US and overseas shops. Brian has lots of experience with overseas shops from his corporate days. The overseas shops have a good ability to deal with anodizing a broad range of colors over a relatively small quantity of parts. The plan is to use a specific shop in Shenzhen that Brian has experience with for the aluminum parts requiring anodize and the US shop Brian traditionally works with for the straight machined parts.\nEach Pen has 10 custom parts. These will be brought in individually and everything will be inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped out by Brian & Brad. There's quite a bit of work that goes into assembling each pen, and we'll show the process as the project moves along.\nA high level overview of the timeline is as follows ...\nBrian Conti is a design engineer and founder of Spoke Design.  Brian runs a small product development company with his brother Dan (Conti-Bros, Inc.). Their brands include Strong Like Bull Magnets, Yaket, and Baux.\nBrad Dowdy has been writing stationery reviews online at The Pen Addict since 2007, co-hosts The Pen Addict Podcast, and makes pen cases and paper goods at Nock Co.\nWill <insert refill here> fit the Spoke Pen?\nYes: Uni-ball Signo 207/307, Uni-ball RT1, Pentel Energel, Zebra Sarasa Clip\nNo: Pilot G2, Pilot Juice, Pilot Hi-Tec-C, Pentel Slicci, Pentel Hybrid Technica, Parker-style.\nWill <insert refill here> EVER fit the Spoke Pen?\nAt some point in the future we will design a Spoke Pen model to fit other refills.\nDoes the pen cap post on the back the pen?\nNo, it doesn't. This is to reduce length in use, lower writing weight, and provide better weight distribution and balance.\nThanks for visiting the project. We look forward to getting Spoke Pen into your hands!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Spoke Pen project brings together two veterans of running successful Kickstarter projects. As noted above, we've spent a good amount of time prototyping to get the design to a production ready point. We have good experience producing machined pencils and other products, and we have good experience with the overall Kickstarter process (funding/manufacturing/fulfillment). The main 'risk' is the delivery timeline. We'll be working with outside supplier partners, and so at times we'll have somewhat limited ability to 'push' to get things done.

I\u2019ve often been asked to compile them into an art book, and I finally have!\nfinished paintings on my workbench(technically a work floor, in this case).\nStrange Friends is a postcard book featuring 20 paintings of odd creatures, furry, scaled, blerpy, and/or horned. It will be offset printed on a lush felted paper, and each postcard will be a art-print quality piece of art. The cover will be a lovely thick cardstock, with foil printing! I make beautiful objects, and I intend to make this one as fancy as I can!\nOf course, I am a very practical person, so they are also nice postcards that should be sent to people you like. \nHere are some of the creatures that will be in the Strange Friends postcard book.\nGood friends. Much friends.\nThis is a very straightforward Kickstarter - you can buy the postcard book, or buy multiple copies of the book. That's because I just want to make this book, and I want to make it a beautiful and special object! There is a one fancier option, where I'll hand-wrap the book for you so you can give it as a very thoughtful gift. For Kickstarter's Make 100 program, I am also making a care package edition, which allows me to indulge in telling weird little narratives through ephemera and other objects.\nHere is a draft of what the cover will look like! I'll be hand painting it, and updating you on its progress in Kickstarter updates. The pink bits will be rendered on the cover in shiny foil! \nDigital First Draft - Strange Friends cover.\nThe Make 100 Care Package edition\nI love making care packages, as my long-time Patreon subscribers can attest to, and this is a lovingly hand curated care-package of the Strange Friends postcard book, limited edition prints, heartfelt letters from fictional girls, and other delightful handmade ephemera and found objects. I don't want to spoil the arc of the tiny-story-in-a-package, but the keywords are: mysterious disappearances, summer camp, and special beasts. \nI\u2019m using this as a platform to experiment with new found object narratives that won\u2019t be available anywhere else!\nCombining pledge levels\nPlease pledge at the highest pledge reward level listed that you would like, and add the additional cost of other reward levels you want to your pledge. \nCosts, and other details.\nPrinting costs for this book, including proofing, fancy foil printing, felted paper, and shipping from Malaysia, will cost approximately $11,500.00.

We worry almost constantly and there's nothing in this world saying that we have to. It doesn't change anything or fix the problem, but we do it anyway. We constantly pull from our bank of emotions and hormones to pay for this debt that doesn't exist. \nHow worrying can affect your body\nChronic worrying can lead to the triggering of fight or flight which causes the body's sympathetic nervous system to release stress hormones. Those hormones cause physical reactions like dizziness, fatigue, headache, inability to concentrate, nausea and shortness of breath to name a few. If excessive worrying and high anxiety go untreated, they can lead to depression. These effects are a response to stress. Whether or not you become ill depends on how you handle stress and there are things you can do to alter the way you respond.*\nHere are a few things that can be helpful\nExercise\nEat a healthy diet\nDon't drink too much caffeine\nLearn to relax\nMeditate\nBe conscious of your worries\n*I'm not a doctor. I just read a lot and have dealt with worry, anxiety and stress like all of us.\nA few years ago, I started manually machining various types of Worry Coins. They vary in metals, woods and sizes. Last year I had the idea that I'd laser engrave this quote into a coin but it was missing something and made these hand made coins even more expensive. I really wanted to be able to offer a more affordable version of a Worry Coin with this quote but, at the time, was not aware of Shire Post Mint's ability to create a concave surface on one side, so I shelved the project. A few months later, I saw what they could do with a coin so reached out to my favorite designer, Mike Major, and got to work. I couldn't be happier with the result. The size, weight, design and cost are the perfect balance and I'm sure you will enjoy.\nCheck out the coin page on my website to see some of the original hand made versions.\nwww.jllawsonco.com\nIs this coin the answer to your worries?\nI don't believe there is one answer to all anxiety or worry but I do believe that an object like a \"worry stone/coin\" can aide in self soothing. Here's a little excerpt about the origin of worry stones.\nFrom the perspective of cognitive behavior therapy, the use of worry stones is one of many folk practices that can function as psychologically healthy self-soothing exercises. Such techniques are imparted at an early stage of treatment, displacing any familiar but destructive coping methods (nail-biting, scratching, lip-biting, etc.) that the patient may have developed. This helps ready the patient to safely confront anxiety or trauma. Worry stones are simple and intuitive enough to be useful in therapeutic contexts where complexity and unfamiliarity are paramount concerns, such as when offering short-term treatment to refugees or children with post-traumatic stress disorder. After a patient has mastered a more sophisticated relaxation script for anxiety management, the worry stone itself can serve as a physical 'relaxation script reminder'; the patient may notice an impulse to use the object, and thereby become aware of their own anxiety.  The rubbing of the stone can create a sense of relaxation making the mind more relaxed and generating a sense of calmness.  There are also people that may use them during meditation practices, this is known to center a persons concentration benefiting the meditation\nThe soothing, repetitive motion of rubbing this concave coin is the perfect conduit to being present.\nLearn to relax, meditate and be conscious of your worries. This coin helps with all of those. Meditation equals relaxing but it doesn't have to mean sitting on a pillow in the lotus position. Meditating is being present and breathing. The soothing, repetitive motion of rubbing the concave coin is the perfect conduit. It's also a good way to remind yourself to let the worry go.\nMost importantly, carry this coin to remind yourself that worrying won't change the problem you're anticipating.\nThe original inspiration for my Worry Coins were traditional worry stones.\nThe difference between worry and concern\nAm I saying that you should never be concerned about a current or potential problem? Of course not, but take steps to handle the problem and let it go. I used to have a ton of trouble sleeping at night because I'd lay there thinking of all the things I needed to do in the near or distant future. In other words, I'm laying there worrying about it when there was absolutely nothing I could do about it at the time...I'm supposed to be sleeping! The worst part is that the majority of those worries never even came true...that debt I didn't owe again.\n1.25\" diameter\n.200\" thick\n1.1 oz\nAvailable in solid Bronze, Copper or .999 Silver\nsmooth concave on one side\nA little bonus for you spinning top collectors!

This Micro Top is a bit of an homage to my dad. He made the original around five years ago as a joke before the spinning top craze took off.

To ship one of these coins the right way, it has to be considered a \"package\" which is now a minimum of $13 for most countries ($9 for Canada). A 1 oz package costs me $13-$15 to ship. I don't pad the cost in any way. The only option that is cheaper than that is to ship a \"document\" and ranges $4-$8. The problem with this is that it's not a document so your package can get held up or sent back and it's just not worth the trouble. I know that other creators and companies sometimes charge less for International shipping but I can't tell you exactly why. Possibly they get better bulk rate, possibly they are shipping the product incorrectly or, more likely, they are padding the cost of the product with shipping costs to make it look like the shipping is cheaper or free. The fact is that shipping is shipping and no company can just absorb shipping costs unless they are making up the difference somewhere else. Thanks for your understanding.\nAbout us\nJ. L. Lawson & Co. was founded in 2011 with the idea to machine some rings and have a side gig. My dad was a manual machinist in the middle of the desert so work wasn't easy to come by. The company began to grow in 2012 so pops had to start training me (Anthony) in the shop. We made some spinning tops that year and machining was kicked into high gear since then. A few years ago, I came up with the idea to have a Decision Maker coin minted and found Shire Post Mint. This is my fifth coin design from the Shire and I couldn't be happier with the results. Finding good vendors for various businesses I've had has always been a nightmare so it's a true pleasure to find someone that I can trust and rely on. I believe Mike Major was sent to me via the universe when I realized that he was not only a customer of mine but I had been following a company that he was part of. He'd done the graphics for Wool and Prince and I kept meaning to reach out to them to ask who did there work. Before I could do that, Mike reached out to me to tell me how much he like the products he purchased from me and I noticed his email address was from Wool and Prince. Madness. To date, the trio of myself, Shire Post (Woody) and Mike Major has been the perfect marriage of talents and I'm sure there are many more pieces to come.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 11th Kickstarter campaign so I've gotten pretty streamlined with the process.

Ziusudra, a man well known for his humility and obedience. Ziusudra did as Sumer God commanded him and built a huge boat, in which he successfully rode out the flood. Then similar stories were then appeared in Epic Atrahasis (1500 BC), Epic of Gilgamesh, Deucalion in Greek folk mythology, Noah in Genesis, and so on.\nThe Deluges Stories\nThe Design: \nDeluge is the first series fountain pen released by our team, Genesis Pen. They tributes to the cultural heroes in the Deluge mythology by using the unique interior barrel design. The transparent barrel refracts the unique internal ink chamber. It assembled with a stack of rectangular blocks representing the Tablet of Eridu Genesis. Each layer of block rotates 11 degrees symbolizes the Deluge story in the Tablet XI of Epic of Gilgamesh. The whole structure consists of 50 layers of blocks and assembles as a helical structure that emulates the DNA 3D structure, the fundamental molecule of life. The ink chamber capacity is approximately 3 ml, which is larger than most ink cartridges, converters, and piston fillers. The Deluge initially comes with three styles named Ziusudra, Atrahasis, and Deucalion, after the historical heroes in the Deluge stories. Furthermore, we will release Noah, when the Stretch Goal is reached.\nClose-up of the metal rings\nThe ink channel\nZiusudra with ink\nZiusudra with ink\nModels:\nDeluge - Ziusudra\nZiusudra\nZiusudra with the cap on\nZiusudra comes with the unique glass-like resin with golden rings. The hand-painted golden helix symbol and the sliver/gold two-tone nib make Ziusudra unique. \n Deluge - Atrahasis\nAtrahasis\nAtrahasis, a fully transparent demonstrator comes with silver color German-made stain steel nib.\nDeluge - Deucalion  \nDeucalion\nDeucalion, with unique triple black design together with a black ruthenium plated steel nib, makes it one-of-a-kind fountain pen in the market. \nThe Making of: \nTo construct such a complicated ink chamber structure inside the narrow pen barrel will not be successful without the use of edge-cutting technology, the Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Resin Printing. This technology uses light to solidify liquid photocrosslinking resins into a rigid solid resin. This technology opens up a new horizon in fountain pen design. \nMaterial: Fountain pen users have a high requirement and expectation towards fountain pen's materials and their durability. We have been searching for resins that give satisfaction texture and at the same time, compatible to SLA 3D printing. After a lot of trial and error, we finally identified the ideal material by using a self-formulated photo-crosslinking resin that is ideal for the fountain pen. After constructed by state-of-the-art 3D printing technology, the material will be solidified and remains strong, transparent, and unique. The material is resistant to water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, and most other organic solvents. Stable up to 200\u02daC heating. The Deluge series uses the hollow eye-dropper type of ink filling system. To facilitate pen washing, we paid a lot of effort in formulating the resin that can make the pen washing and writing be enjoyable. The rings on the pen are costed-bronze, which is shinny and rust resisting. \nHandcrafting: SLA 3D printing together with the self-formulated resin only took us halfway in reaching our goal. After printing, the material is rough and non-transparent that does not look like a pen that people will love. In order to solve this problem, we recruited a specialist to our team who has good pen polishing skills. We spent a lot of time researching the best polishing process for this new type of material. Finally, we came up with a series of processes to turn the printed \"object\" into a unique fountain pen that is transparent and rigid, yet feels smooth and warm like ebonite. \nBefore and after hand-polishing\nPen washing has been a lot of people's concern, therefore we are adding a pen washing video to show the ease of cleaning. With our self-formulated resin, we ensure the ink will not be trapped in the ink chamber. \nPLAY\n\nSpecifications:\nLength: 142.6 mm caped. 112 mm without the cap.

Its uses are almost endless, yet few people use it. Why?\nBecause there is no holder designed to fit the needs of us makers.\nSo we decided to make one.\nThe Maker Knife is a tool made to be carried every day, everywhere you go. It is compact, lightweight, super quick and easy to open. No more looking for a blade. No more interruptions while you\u2019re working on a project. The Maker Knife is always there, ready to swiftly help you work more efficiently.\n- Jimmy Diresta\n          Oh yeah did we mention it\u2019s freaking magic? The locking mechanism is extremely easy to use. There are no buttons to push. No weird finger movements to do. You can just flick it open with your thumb or a finger.\nThe blade holder automatically locks securely into place when it reaches the top and by witchcraft unlocks when you pull it back down. It really does feel like magic!\n\"WTF!?? How does it work?\" - That guy in a red shirt that tried to figure out the mechanism for 2 minutes while pushing it back and forth.\nNo springs, just magic.\n          More magic! Pretty cool right? And this is without the use of springs! It's all you. You see the Maker Knife is adjustable. You can choose from a range of \"almost impossible to open\" to \"wrist flick to open\". Both offer great holding strength while retracted (no worrying about it opening in your pocket), and you can tune it to feel just the way you want it to feel.\nIt's also a fantastic feature for increasing the \"child safety\" factor of the knife as you can make it require a lot of force to open. (Obviously don't let kids anywhere near a knife of any kind though)\nWe made it for you, and us.\nWe love the utility knife blades because you can scrape, pry, cut, chop, stab, sand or whatever without worrying about them getting chipped, dull, bent or broken. They are cheap and easy to find at hardware stores, so you can just swap the blade when it gets worn out and have a new flawless, razor sharp edge in seconds.\n          What we don't like is the lack of a good way to hold them. Most handles are bulky and heavy, mainly made for industrial applications. - That won't work for us makers!\nWhat we need is a convenient, super quick knife that is lightweight and compact. A design that is made to be an EDC (Every Day Carry) item.\nSo we decided to make the Maker Knife.\nHere we are, five months later, with a finished design. You would think designing a holder for a blade would be pretty straightforward right? But we didn't just want to make a stick and shove a blade on there. No, we wanted to make something so good that you would like to carry with you, all the time, every day.\nPrecision manufacuring\nThere were these extraordinarily complex problems that needed to be solved in order to achieve the magic feeling we were seeking. Some parts were impossible to mill using CNC machines, so we used extremely accurate EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining), making cuts that are no thicker than a human hair.\nWith a core of high strength stainless steel\nSuper quick to use in either hand\n          It took many, many tries, prototypes and curse words to perfect this deceptively simple looking locking mechanism. A locking mechanism so intuitive and easy to use that you don't even think about it, you just use it, no matter which hand.\nSome of the very early prototypes\nYou can even unlock the Maker Knife wearing thick gloves.\n\"You really don't have to think about using the Maker Knife. You're already done.\"\nDid we mention it's waterproof?\n\"Unlocking the maker knife is the transition from a thought to an action. That is why we made it flawless.\"\nThe Maker Knife is available in two different finishes; Black or Silver.\nThe silver finish is very similar to a pretty well known computer model\nThe clip can be mounted on either side of the knife\nOnce the campaign is over, we will ask which finish you prefer, so you don't have to make this difficult decision just yet. Pledge now - choose later.\nMaterials\nTo ensure the best performance we made the core from high strength corrosion resistant stainless steel. The case is made from aerospace grade aluminium to keep the Maker Knife as light and agile as possible. This combination also means that the Maker Knife is waterproof.\nSpecs:\nHeight closed: 108mm\nHeight open: 140mm (with blade)\nWidth: 33mm\nThickness: 7.7mm\nWeight: 65g (with blade)\nAbout the thickness of a modern smartphone\nThis makes the Maker Knife very natural to carry\nSo that you can take it with you everywhere you go\nThis resulted in a knife that got its beauty through function\nWe really do believe we made the best utility knife. It's everything we ever wanted a utility knife to be. We think you will feel the same.\nCeramic blades\nCeramic utility knife blades? Yeah, they are really cool! Ceramic is really, really good at keeping an edge. You can cut foam, cardboard, leather, fabric and such and it will probably never go dull. It's fantastic for RC scratch builders, crafts, leather makers and many others.\nBut as always in life there are tradeoffs. Ceramic blades will chip when abused. Cutting very hard things like hard wood and such is not really its intended use. Use cheap metal blades that you can pick up local to you for stuff like that.\n- Only available as part of the knife bundles during the Kickstarter-\nBlades will be available on MakerKnife.com after the Kickstarter has ended. \n The Diresta Maker Knife\nJimmy Diresta decided to launch a Diresta version of the Maker Knife with a custom brass top plate that he'll customize himself with his brand. The Diresta brass plate comes as an addition to the normal top plate in the color of your choice.\nDiresta Maker Knife with Black Base\nThe Diresta Brass plate comes as an addition to the standard plate.\nHelp promoting this campaign by:\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox Partner Program\nPress Relations PressWisdom\n The Team\nTwo like-minded makers.

We need to make several molds and they can be quite expensive. It only makes sense to have them made if there is enough volume of parts being produced. That is why we are here on kickstarter!

Makers unite to make a tool!\n\nThis is our first kickstarter project and it's going to be a excellent learning experience for us.\nHowever it is not our first time doing product development and fulfilment.

We will try our utmost to deliver on time, but if we do run into any problems we will try to be as transparent as we can and communicate this to you here on kickstarter.\n\nThank you very much for supporting us in this endeavour.
