A unique blend of healthy plant-based recipes, nutrition, short stories, practices and habits for realizing your potential and harnessing your power to change your life\u2014and the world. \nMy funding goal is $15,000.

With your help, we can spread a positive message and encourage a world of compassion, love, wellness, self-acceptance and inner fullness. \nHi, I'm Rachelle Hynes\nI've always had bit of an untamable spirit for risk-taking and adventure. This innate desire is partly what thrust me deep into life's arduous classroom fairly early in life. By the time I hit 30, I'd been through an unusual measure of adversity, successes and failures. \nI believe people are craving inspiration from every day human beings\u2014not just superhuman athletes or wealthy media personalities. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m offering. The book is a heart-felt expression of the lessons I've learned, and am still learning; and the components I feel have allowed me to live a zestier, happier and more meaningful life. Each component is covered within each chapter, and the book takes a 360 degree approach to wellness; incorporating mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being. \nWhy It's Needed\nIn today\u2019s society, many of us are struggling with anxiety, health, and finding purpose. Everywhere you turn, you're constantly bombarded with messages on how to \u201clook better\u201d, \"obtain more stuff,\"  and \"be perfect\". This is not healthy.\nMy book aims to help you uncover your inner greatness, and teach you skills to show up in the world authentic, confident and brave; with healthy tools for your journey. \nAmusing and inspirational stories & delicious recipes\u2014Rachelle writes with a sense of humour you\u2019ll thoroughly enjoy!\nTarget Market\nThe customer who will buy this book is looking for guidance on their journey. They don\u2019t want to be overwhelmed with facts, complicated recipes and diets. They want to be nurtured, and they want simplicity.\nSpecifically, people who are thinking about exercise, self-worth and their bodies; exploring meditation, self-awareness and taking care of their minds; who are concerned about nutrition, finding purpose and motivation; and those who want to get back in touch with their body, manage the anxiety of aging and navigate the changes in their bodies with grace.  \nWhy you'll love it\nPeople are grasping for ways to be healthier, happier and more fulfilled. This is an approachable and captivating coffee table book to reach for when you need inspiration and guidance; whether it\u2019s strengthening your mind-body connection, uncovering your purpose and potential, getting through life\u2019s struggles, or cultivating habits for lifelong health, wellness and happiness\u2014this is the your handbook.\n Learn more about Rachelle at:  https://zestylife.ca/  Instagram: @zestylife.ca\nBook Q&A\nWhat\u2019s in it for me? \nYou lead a busy life, and you want new meals that taste amazing, are  easy to prepare, and leave you feeling great after. I put a lot of time  into creating, testing and getting feedback on a variety of plant-based  recipes that are both tasty and satisfying!\nYou\u2019ll also discover a healthy dose of inspirational content, from  short stories to easy to digest tips and tools. This book is something  to keep handy for when you need a quick pick-me-up, a last minute recipe idea, or you simply want to flip through some pretty awesome photography!\nDo I have to be a vegan to buy your book? \nHeck no! These meals taste great and just happen to be vegan. Try them out and see how they make you feel. They can be a nice addition to your weekly meals, or a bridge to consuming less animal based foods in your regimen.\nWhat\u2019s in it for you?\nThrough writing and designing this book I have learned more about myself, and been able to delve deep into a heartfelt passion for  helping others. My aim is to share my experiences, insights, stories and  practices so that you can feel more vibrant, healthy and happy in your life. I hope that people enjoy this book so I can keep creating more zesty content.\nAre your ingredients hard to find?\nNot at all! You\u2019ll be able to create quick and healthy meals, and have FUN doing it! These recipes have unique and complex flavours with some pretty basic ingredients that anyone can put together!\nIf I buy one cookbook this year why should this be the one?\nThis book is so much more than recipes, it\u2019s a vulnerable expression of my own journey and I would like it to light the path in a potent way for as many people as possible, with respect to not only how they think about food and health, but to really propel them to understand that we\u2019re all capable of so much more and have an important ingredient to offer this world.

The storm blows through, shuts down the country, and turns the search for waves into a life-threatening prospect.\nDespite constant darkness and stormy seas, the group continues the hunt for perfect waves and attempts to make history by surfing under the northern lights.\nAfter reaching our initial goal of $150K, we created these stretch goal bonuses as a 'thank you' for your continued support.

We want to come to your cities in person, share the film and photographs with you and answer any questions you might have about the filmmaking process. Our goal is that you will leave inspired to get out and seek these experiences for yourself.   \nStay tuned for the dates and showtimes of our global film tour.

Our goal is to change the way we all approach funding and fund raising. \nJane Leu (CEO of Smarter Good), Vu Le (writer of Nonprofits with Balls), and Jessamyn Shams-Lau (ED of the Peery Foundation), will be writing a book together in 2017. And we want your help!\nSmart funders know that the current status quo is inherently funder-centric and are looking for ways to balance the playing field. Adopting grantee-centric practices means creating funder interactions that maximize the input of time and only strengthen an organization\u2019s ability to achieve their outcomes\u2014interactions that put grantees, and hence impact, first.\nWise nonprofits know that current practices perpetuate a broken system. They also acknowledge their role in perpetuating funder-centric processes. More importantly they recognize their power to change the status quo and shape interactions with funders. They know they have more power than many admit and they are looking for ways to exercise it.\nThis book will delve into both sides -- funder and fundraiser, foundation and nonprofit -- to explore and suggest practical ways all of us can change our ways of operating from 'business as usual' to 'nonprofit as extraordinary'. \nThere is much work to be led and done by unicorns. Now more than ever, we need ways to work together that are fast, equal, and efficient. \nCover Design\nThere are loads of books on nonprofit and philanthropy. We looked at many of them and discovered a common theme - they are shaped, tempered, and endorsed by foundations. We are turning that model on its head. Instead, we want nonprofits to back this book significantly (and have the opportunity to shape it), as well as philanthropy professionals who are eager to spread a more grantee-centric approach to funding. So we\u2019re asking you, the unicorns, to contribute.\nOur Kickstarter campaign launches today, December 1st and will run until December 30th. This campaign will not only raise money for self-publishing (there will be no superfluous padding in our book -- just what you need to make change!), but also to ensure that it is shaped by your perspective and contributions. See the rewards levels for how your ideas and voice can be incorporated.\nChapter Outline\nWe\u2019ll be writing this book throughout 2017, and releasing excerpts to our Kickstarter supporters along the way. We hope that you\u2019ll support us in the coming weeks and share our vision with your network.\nThank you, in anticipation of your support!\nJane / Vu / Jessamyn\n---\nAbout the authors:\nJane Leu\nJane Leu is an internationally recognized social entrepreneur and Ashoka Fellow with more than 20 years of experience in founding and leading numerous social enterprises. Her latest venture is Smarter Good, a global services firm with a dual mission to improve the efficiency and impact of small nonprofit organizations and create purposeful careers for aspiring changemakers in emerging markets. \nJane\u2019s contributions and leadership have been recognized by BYU Social Innovator of the Year, John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award, the Rockefeller Foundation Next Generation Leadership program, Jefferson Award for Community Service, Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship and the Manhattan Institute Social Entrepreneur Award, among others. She is a Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation Venture Partner, representing the foundation\u2019s investment on the Board of Directors of Reset Foundation, a member of the advisory boards of the Peery Family Foundation, Joshua Venture Group and the Migration Policy Institute. \nShe holds a MA from Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and a BA from Tufts University. She lives in San Francisco, CA with her husband, Ted Levinson, a social finance professional, when she is not in Manila with the team of Smarter Good.\nVu Le\nVu Le (\u201cvoo lay\u201d) is a writer, speaker, vegan, Pisces, and the Executive Director of Rainier Valley Corps, a nonprofit in Seattle with the mission of developing and supporting leaders of color to strengthen the capacity of communities-of-color-led nonprofits and foster collaboration between diverse communities to effect systemic change.\nVu\u2019s passion to make the world better, combined with a low score on the Law School Admission Test, drove him into the field of nonprofit work, where he learned that we should take the work seriously, but not ourselves. There\u2019s tons of humor in the nonprofit world, and someone needs to document it. He is going to do that, with the hope that one day, a TV producer will see how cool and interesting our field is and make a show about nonprofit work, featuring attractive actors attending strategic planning meetings and filing 990 tax forms.\nKnown for his no-BS approach, irreverent sense of humor, and love of unicorns, Vu has been featured in dozens, if not hundreds, of his own blog posts at nonprofitwithballs.com.\nJessamyn Shams-Lau\nHigh school drop out turned MBA, Jessamyn currently co-creates and stewards the Peery Foundation's Grantee-Centric approach to philanthropy. Jessamyn is an advocate for inter-disciplinary approaches, thoughtful risk taking, and bold ideas developed through apprenticing with a problem.\nJessamyn joined the Peery Foundation as its first staff member in 2009, helping to shape the foundation\u2019s initial approach and portfolios.

We're self-funded and we have enough money to make sure this game happens. Our core team is locked in and committed to this project for the next 2 years.\nWe're a little over half way through development, and we've decided to come to Kickstarter to raise awareness about Solar Crusaders, and raise funds to accelerate the development schedule by increasing the size of our team.\nWe're testing the waters with this premise, and we want you to help us prove that there is a significant group of people that would love to play a 2D open world space game!\nWebsite: http://www.solarcrusaders.com/\nGreenlight: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409453472\nExplore the galaxy\nAs you guide your fleet through each solar system, you'll explore features such as stars, moons, planets, asteroids, and singularities; optionally colonizing strategic locations as you see fit.\nUnlike similar games in this genre, Solar Crusaders utilizes an advanced agents system to populate the game universe with persistent computer controlled pirates, merchants, traders, smugglers, and more. The game will never feel empty or barren, because the computer will move into empty sectors.\nOnce an agent is destroyed, it permanently ceases to exist, and a new agent will be created unless you move in to take its place.\nGrow your empire\nColonization will allow you to create items in the game, which will range in quality based on your manufacturing facilities and proper composition of resources.\nAnything from small sensor augments, to full ship systems like engines, transporters, and cloak can be created and traded in-game.\nManage your crew members\nYour crew will be composed of five different races including Human, Monk, Plantoid, Robotic, and Creature. Each race will have their own appearance, behavior, and special ability; affording each a particular advantage in combat, diplomacy, or a wide variety of other possible enhancements.\nEach crew member will be subject to perma-death, although this can be mitigated through insurance, and cloning bays.\nTake command of your ships\nYour ships will be highly configurable, with many systems being swappable and/or upgradable. You'll have to carefully manage your critical resources including fuel, atmosphere, and ammunition; while at the same time manage your crew as they perform their specialized duties like piloting, engineering, weapons control, and more.\nAdditional supplies and reinforcements can be salvaged from wrecks, created from resources, or bought from NPCs and other players.\nDomination\nThe advancement system is based upon training individual skills of crew members in fields such as piloting, shields, engineering, weapons, and more. Ultimately, your goal will be to expand your dominion beyond your home system, and into the furthest reaches of the galaxy.\n The game can be played in 3 different ways:\nSingle-player Battle Simulations (similar to Star Citizens Arena Commander)\nLocal Co-op (much like Minecraft where you host the server yourself for up to 64 players over LAN)\nConnect to Official Online Game Universe (much like an MMO, persistent universe with up to 8000+ players)\nSingle-player and local co-op will NEVER have any monthly fee to play. You will NEVER have to sign-up or sign-in to anything to play. Simply download and play as much as you wish.\nThere will NEVER be a fee to play on the Official Game Universe for Kickstarter supporters of $30.00 or more.\nOtherwise, the Official Online Game Universe will be $5.00/month, and possibly less with promotions and deals.\nThere will be a limited micro-payments shop, which will allow players to buy things that do NOT affect the balance of the game. For example, you'll be able to purchase unique decals (skins) for ship and space-stations.\nWe are currently focusing on development of the Solar Crusaders Official Online Game Universe.\nThe Kickstarter funds budget above shows where your money will be spent.\nWe'll be hiring a 3-month contract programmer to help with debugging and and code optimization. We haven't chosen our programmer yet.\nWe'll be hiring on a contract artist to create more concept artwork. Concept artwork will be done by Becca Bair and Ricardo Van Duuren.\nWe'll be hiring Megan McDuffee to do our music.\nGame development isn't easy, and as any enterprising game developer or startup entrepreneur knows, programming is expensive. Running a company has a lot of overhead, and therefore a project such as this can easily run in to the millions.\nSo how we can make this game happen for way less?\n1) Solar Crusaders has an experienced lead engineer / programmer as one of its founding members. Ollie JD has been working in the Silicon Valley for over 10 years, and has brought many large scale projects to fruition. He's not going anywhere, and he is fully committed to this project for at least next 2 years. This project has been a dream of his waiting for the right moment to spring to life.\n2) We're using technology that is much easier to work with. The game engine and servers are built using JavaScript and HTML5, and therefore can share a lot of code. Sharing code is good, because it means less repetitive work, and fewer bugs. A lot of smart companies have invested heavily into JavaScript, including Google, PayPal, Flickr, LinkedIn and more.\n3) Many indies use Unity to save a lot of time, and we're using similar frameworks for both our front-end and backend servers. We're not trying to re-invent the wheel, therefore, anything that has been made and open-sourced, we're going to be using. For more information about our architecture, see the technology section below.\n4) The Solar Crusaders Online Universe will be hosted on Amazon Web Services. When server demand goes up, we spin up more servers and only pay for what we use. We don't have to pay for an IT department, because the servers are managed by Amazon.\n5) All of our team members work remotely, there is no office, we meet and coordinate through Skype. We have practically no corporate overhead.\n6) This game is a passion for all of us! We'll use a little bit of money, and a whole lot of heart to get it done.\nSo where are we now?\nWe've implemented most of the client engine, and we're currently spending most of our development time on the server. We've ran some preliminary stress tests, and here are our results:\nEach Amazon EC2 instance can support 200-400 concurrent connections. With a cluster of 40 EC2 instances, and the artificial load we generated that accounts for realistic read/write operations, we were able to sustain 8000 simultaneous connections, each averaging a ping of 40-150ms.\nThe approximate cost of this setup was $1500.00-2500.00/month, not including the datastore setup, which would cost an additional $1500.00-3000.00/month.\nOverall, it will be inexpensive to run the servers for a user-base of 8000.\nParallel Development\nOur architecture is very unique; we can share almost all of the code between the different types of games (single-player, vs LAN multiplayer, vs MMO.)\nIn fact, the local co-op LAN multiplayer is really just a modified version of the MMO server. Instead of communicating with a database, it'll store everything in memory and serialize to a file upon saving the game. The main difference being that it'll run standalone, instead of in a clustered environment.\nHilary Craven - Founder / Game Designer - Hilary Craven has a passion for computer gaming that was largely influenced by her older brother. Raised in a family of board gamers she has always been looking to create a game. With a background and experience in business she is creating a game studio that will give back to the community. Currently still addicted to StarCraft and Civilizations.\nOllie JD - Founder / Game Architect - Ollie is a 10 year veteran of the SF tech industry, and has gained valuable experience working and consulting for Silicon Valley companies. He worked for PIX System developing video software used in HBO shows like Game of Thrones and House of Cards. He was the lead engineer on the Sports Illustrated Snapshot Chrome App.\nErica Parker - Business Dev - Erica leads our Business Development efforts to target strategic alliances and partnerships. In essense, she helps us make things happen that were previously unimaginable. Erica holds a Masters of Engineering from UC Berkeley. Her advise on legal and business aspects has been invaluable.\nMegan McDuffee - Composer / Musician - Megan holds both a BA in Film Scoring with a minor in Electronic Music from the University of CA, Santa Cruz and a Master's Certificate from the Berklee College of Music in Orchestration for Film and TV. Her music can be heard in numerous films, advertisements, TV shows, and video games including Galaxy Heist. Megan's piece \"Kingdoms\" is featured on Solar Crusaders first teaser video. We are looking forward for Megan creating unique pieces for Solar Crusaders.\nFederico Pereiro - Programmer - Federico is a full-stack JavaScript freelance developer and open source contributor. Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Federico is now taking his work on the road, which brings him to distant and exotic places - provided they have an electric outlet and wifi.\nAron Gerencser - Writer / Lore Master - Aron is a student and aspiring writer based in Budapest. A passionate gamer for as long as he can remember, Aron is a massive fan of anything and everything Sci-Fi. Be it high-tech space operas, post-apocalyptic dramas or abstract thrillers, if It's Science Fiction, Aron likes it.\nRicardo Van Duuren - Digital Artist\nEmily So - Digital Artist\nBecca Bair - Digital Artist\nJoshua Kacher - Advisor\nRuth Pimentel - Public Relations\nCreate a custom reward and then add on the following prices to your pledge:\n+ $30.00\nUnlimited access to the Official Online Game Universe (no membership fee.) This means you get access to play Solar Crusaders for the life of the game.\nUnlimited access to game enhancements as they become available (single-player, and local co-op.)\nadd $8.00 - Beta Access\nadd $25.00 - Alpha 2 Access\nadd $50.00 - Alpha 1 Access\n+ $7.00 - 2 Tickets to launch party\n+ $15.00 - Name a planet\n+ $15.00 - Name a crew member\nWe are building Solar Crusaders using standard web technologies. Both the backend servers and the front-end game client will share code. This means that we'll be able to add features and fix bugs much faster than otherwise possible with other architectures.\nThe game will run in a web browser using no plugins, however, it will also be available as a regular game you can download and run (just like with any other Steam game.)\nIt will be incredibly easy to join the game universe, which means that there will be more players online at any given time.\nWeb-based technologies such as HTML5 and Node.js have come a long way in the past few years, and it is now possible to create high quality games that are virtually identical to their native counterparts.\nObviously, you won't see the next Crysis or Farcry on the web, but simpler games just don't need to be built using C++ anymore. HTML 5 game engines now support GPU accelerated graphics, and can even be distributed through Steam.\nSee BabylonJS and Pixi.js to see some tech demos. Also checkout Cross Code, a completed game using this new technology.\n Audio and visual quality in games has improved immensely over the past 10 years, however, game artificial intelligence has been largely overlooked by developers. Nowadays, the quality of the AI can really make or break the experience gamers have when playing the latest titles.\nWe aim to endue the NPCs in Solar Crusaders with intelligent tactical behavior that goes a step beyond rule-based, or cheating techniques. The agents in Solar Crusaders will be controlled by an adaptive algorithm that corrects mistakes by taking into account previously won and lost battles, on a massive scale.\nEvery battle in Solar Crusaders will be analyzed and recorded by the algorythm. As more and more data is generated, the NPC agents will be able to to better deal with unknown and emergent human-player tactics.\nThe adaptive A.I. will only be available in the Online Universe, the single-player and co-op versions of the game will utilize a standard rule-based approach (but not cheating.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nSolar Crusaders has been self-funded by the founders, and we've been able to secure salaries for core members of the team. We're committed to this project for the next 2 years.\n\nSolar Crusaders will come to life, but the real question is how quickly. We've invested heavily into this project, and we know that we can make it happen.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nWe are using technology that allows us to develop and iterate quickly. Our servers will be using the same technology that is used by companies like Flickr, Uber, and Paypal to support thousands of users inexpensively.\n\nCOMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT\n\nWe know we can make this game, but we will need the guidance of the community to provide feedback during our alpha testing phases. We want to make this game as fun as possible.\n\nSPREADING THE WORD:\n\nOne of the larger challenges that we face is spreading awareness about our game. We could overcome this hurdle by funding an advertising campaign, but we would rather spend those funds to add new features into the game.\n\nYou, our Kickstarter backers can help us overcome this challenge. You have the power to spread awareness about Solar Crusaders by sharing our story with your friends and family on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.)\n\nWe want to make this as easy as possible, so we have created a NEW Thunderclap which will automatically post one message to your social media, please join and help spread the word!\n\nhttp://thndr.it/1H2bNEd\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Hilary Craven\nFirst created \u00b7 27 backed\nAfter being exposed at an early age by her older Brother, Hilary has been an avid gamer all of her life.

LHOOQ Design has carefully designed NODE [6] to take its cues from the new iPhone. The new single-radius bevels around the entire perimeter of the phone is accented by the sphere of each NODE. Crafted from solid aluminum and finished to match the 3 iPhone colors, these corners are the perfect accessory for the design-minded individual.\n The size is designed to keep the phone off of any flat surface no matter the orientation (which solves the protruding camera lens problem while we're at it).

We need to produce one more sample to ensure perfect fit and finish for both phone models. Given how minimal this case is, those tolerances are all-the-more important.

With $500,000 we'll be able to bring the film to 5 Billion people in 50 languages and film Michele's family scattering her ashes in the Ganges. Thank you for your help! \n50 LANGUAGES for 5 BILLION PEOPLE! - According to the World Health Organization, 85% of the more than 270,000 women that die from cervical cancer every year are from low and middle-income countries. It is the 2nd leading cancer in women with over 530,000 new cases every year. Our goal with Lady Ganga is to show the film as widely as we can. In many of the countries who really need this film (Including India), subtitles will not be enough because many people are not able to read the subtitles in their own language. Our goal is to have Lady Ganga dubbed (voice-over from local actors) in the 50 most prevalent languages that need this film! This will be a costly, but very beneficial undertaking for Michele\u2019s cause. Having the film be heard in each of these languages will greatly increase the scope of who will be able to see this film. Our goal is to have the film screen ALL OVER THE WORLD. We want people to see the film in their native languages on television, in theatres, online as well as sponsored viewings by outreach groups and health workers in order educate people about cervical cancer and HPV. \nADDITIONAL FILMING IN INDIA - We want to take a film crew to India where Michele traveled and follow-up with stories of local people along Michele\u2019s path who have been affected by her journey. One of Michele\u2019s last wishes was for her family to scatter her ashes in the Ganga. Filming this would offer an extremely powerful ending to an already powerful story.\n\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign. When we decided to use it as a forum to raise money to finish Lady Ganga, we had no idea what we were going to get. First and foremost, we wanted to make sure that we were able to finish the film and had enough to do just that. Thanks to all of you, we have exceeded our initial goal...and that is AMAZING. You have guaranteed that this film will be made! As our pledges started to grow, so have our ambitions.

She knew this would be her last opportunity to make a difference in the World and what she did in the waning months of her life was truly remarkable\u2026and she gave us full access to film it all, with nothing off-limits.\nWhen Michele, a 45 year old Mother of three was diagnosed with late-stage cervical cancer, she took this as a call-to-action. She decided that she would travel to India to paddle board over 700 miles down the Ganges River, spreading awareness about this disease that was going to kill her and breaking a World Record in the process. \nSome of her friends and family doubted her decision to make the trip. They were concerned for her health and they understandably wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. But Michele felt a higher calling. She had a soft spot for the people of India and she knew that India had the highest mortality rate from cervical cancer in the World. More than 50,000 Indian women die needlessly every year from this preventable cancer. So, she packed her bags and explained to her kids why this was so important for her. They were sad to see her go, but they understood their Mom's final mission.\nA cameraman went along with Michele on her epic voyage down the Ganga and captured beautiful and intimate footage of her journey. Michele did interviews and press with the Indian media along the way and did her best to spread the word. \nThe truth is, cervical cancer is caused by a highly prevalent, sexually transmitted virus called HPV. 80% of ALL people under 50 years of age will be exposed to HPV at some point in their lives. Globally, HPV causes many types of cancers in both Men and Women. This is why Michele dreamed of making an even bigger impact, not just in India but all over the World. That dream of hers has become THIS FILM.\nWhen she returned back home to her family in New Mexico, Michele's time was quickly coming to an end. As her health rapidly deteriorated, Michele wanted people to see the ugly realities of HPV and cervical cancer. Her hope was to inspire people to stay on top of their health, so nobody else would have to suffer from this disease. She also made arrangements for her own post-life ceremony. Michele's wishes were to have an open-pyre ceremony in the beautiful mountains of Colorado.\nSoon after, with her friends and family by her side\u2026Michele passed away. Her family honored her wishes and quickly transported her body to Crestone, Colorado, the only place in the US where open pyre funeral ceremonies are allowed. The next morning, the funeral ceremony was carried out. Her body was burned for all to see and Michele Baldwin's body was returned back to the elements.  \nAs Michele wished, we were there to film it all. It was a profoundly emotional and moving experience for us as well. Watching this strong and athletic woman wither away was tough to watch, but we also saw her come to peace with her dying and accept what was happening to her. It was a bittersweet message that made us appreciate our own lives and showed us just how much one person can accomplish in a short amount of time. This is also the message that we hope to convey with this documentary. \nMaking a film like this one is time-consuming and expensive. We have over 150 hours of deeply moving interviews and footage that we still need to turn into a proper film. We have already gone deep into our own pockets and we have humbly realized that we will not be able to complete this film without YOUR HELP! \nYour contributions will go towards the entire post-production process. This includes writing, editing, animation, licensing, legal fees, translation, subtitles, insurance and the many other expenses go into completing and delivering a film. If our stretch goals are met they will go towards advertising, festival submissions, publicity and even distribution of the film.\nWe see this as an INSPIRATIONAL short-form documentary that will also help to educate and maybe even save lives. The story is heartbreaking and at times graphic, but ultimately, it shows Michele's passion and selfless courage to leave behind a meaningful and lasting legacy.\nTHANK YOU for being a part of this film!! Every contribution is important and will be used wisely. Some of you may not know that if we DO NOT MEET 100% of our funding goal by our closing date, we will not get ANY of the donations made and we will be back to $0. \nIt is also important to try and raise as much money EARLY in the process so that we maintain a presence on the Kickstarter homepage, which will help get us more publicity and greatly help us reach our goal. Even if you are unable to help contribute financially, you can make a great contribution by helping us spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, email, word-of-mouth, smoke signals, or any other way you may communicate with people! \nOnce the film is finished, 100% of profits from sales and licensing of the film will go to the Michele Baldwin Memorial Fund which is managed by ASHA (American Sexual Health Association), a 100 year old non-profit organization who run the NCCC (National Cervical Cancer Coalition) and the Global Initiative Against HPV and Cervical Cancer:\nhttp://giahc.org/\nhttp://www.ashasexualhealth.org/\nhttp://www.nccc-online.org/\nThank you so much!!\nFrederic Lumiere and Mark Hefti\n___\nBudget\nOur goal is to make a remarkable film.

We're now excited to introduce our stretch goals for Llama Nation: The Documentary.\n$20,000\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $20,000 we will offer a downloadable version of the film's score/soundtrack and also a digital photo book of all of our travels while making this film. Both of these rewards will be included on pledge amounts of $25 and up. \nPlease keep pledging and let's well exceed our initial goal. Thank you all! It's been amazing to witness the outpouring of support so far with our campaign.\nLlama Nation: The Documentary\nLlama Nation is a documentary about llamas. It highlights the breeding, showing, packing, and the love people have for llamas. Our goal is to show the side of llamas that most of America has never seen. The general population has a very small understanding of what purposes the animal can serve or even their origin. The only association most people have with a llama is from a petting zoo at their local country fair, the llamas with hats YouTube video, and Napoleon Dynamite.\nThrough the film you will meet people who have a true passion for llamas, and you will come to love the animal just as they do. Each character has a unique story, and unique uses for the Llama. We are sharing their stories to inspire, inform and change people's perception of the Llama.\nThe main goal at the end of the documentary is to have people walk away with a desire and be inspired to love something and to have as much passion about it as the people who love llamas do.\nThe cornerstone of our story is centered around two girls in the southern US who are in direct competition for the title of National Llama Showing Grand Champion at only 16 years old. The two girls placed 2nd and 3rd nationally last year against people 3 times their age. This year, they have been training year-round in hopes to finally take home the coveted title of National Grand Champion. \nWe have been in production since February of 2014. We\u2019ve traveled everywhere in the US from Oregon to North Carolina filming this story. The tale of llamas runs so deep all across the US and we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to go out and capture these. We\u2019re 85% of the way through production and need additional funding of $15,000 to complete filming and to complete the post-production. We really need your help to finish Llama Nation: The Documentary!\nMeet Janessa\n    Llama showing is Janessa\u2019s life and that is a scientific fact. In 2013, she won the National Reserve Grand Champion title, second place, at only 15 years old. This year Janessa has hit the show arena with a vengeance. She wants the Grand Champion title and has been working hard and showing all year to built up to it. The only thing that stands in her way is her biggest competitor, Hunter.\nInteresting fact: Janessa has won 582 ribbons from llama showing.\nMeet Hunter\nHunter hangs her llama wool hat in a small town outside of Athens Georgia. At only 15 years old she is financially self sufficient by the funds she raises with her small llama farm. Through the money she makes on her farm, she's able to pay her way to all of the shows that qualify her for the National Championships. She has devoted her whole year to winning the Grand Champion title and nothing will stand in her way, except Janessa.\nWe follow Hunter as she directly competes with Janessa throughout the entire year trying to win the title of National Grand Champion.\nMeet Jack and Tracy\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to know who the godfather and godmother of llamas and llama showing in the US is, it\u2019s Jack and Tracy. Throughout the 30 years they\u2019ve owned llamas they've built up the largest llama ranch east of the Mississippi that houses nearly 200 show quality llamas.  They have contributed greatly to the domestication and healthcare of llamas in the United States. They also organized the first llama show in the southern US and have contributed countless hours and endless effort to bettering and establishing the llama community to what it is today. \nMeet Maggie\n  Maggie was first introduced to llamas when she took her rabbit into the vet for a check up. The very nice vet tech noticed Maggie's love for animals and invited her out the the local 4-H meeting where they train with llamas.While there she caught the llama loving bug.\nAside from showing, Maggie also visits the local children's hospitals to talk to the patients and so they can see how great llamas can be. In the words of Maggie, \"Llamas just make me feel happy inside. I just want to give them a big hug.\"\nMeet Ron\nRon is the llama carting king. He is also the mayor of a small town in Georgia. Through two decades he has trained countless llamas in the art of pulling a buggy around. He literally wrote the book on cart driving with llamas. He first had his fascination with llamas through watching a news program that was featuring a local farm. Since that day, he's caught the llama bug. \nAs mayor of this small town, Ron has introduced many people to the love of llamas including the town sheriff and the county judge. Since his election in 2013, he's been introducing a lot of improvements to the community to not only benefit the life of the citizens but also to benefit the life of the llamas in the town. \nRon has been out of showing competitively for about a decade. He's finally decided to pick back up the saddle and hit the rink. With the competition more fierce, he can only hope to succeed.  \nMeet Chrissy and Allan\n   Not many people can claim llamas as their full-time gig. However, Chrissy and Allan can. Three times a week they hike 14 miles and 3,000 feet of elevation gain with 8 llamas up the Smokey Mountains. They do this to deliver supplies up the the Leconte Lodge at the top of the peak. There's no way to access the lodge other than by hiking and that's where the llamas excel. \nBecause llamas have such padded feet they can navigate the trails without a trace. The Leconte Lodge has been employing llamas since the 70's to help preserve the forest. \nChrissy and Allan met on the trail and are now married.\nWe\u2019re proud to be offering some very unique rewards with our Kickstarter campaign. You can find a full list of them to the right column. Some of our most unique rewards are: llama beans to fertilize your garden, have a llama named after you, llama cart driving lessons with the llama carting king, and to come and visit Jack and Tracy\u2019s Llama Ranch in Georgia.\nThe Poster\nWe\u2019re offering a Kickstarter exclusive art print movie poster. It will be printed 11x17 and be shipped right to your door. It will be featured in a nice satin print and have a full bleed.

Each will be printed on soft material and will be a shirt you\u2019ll be proud to wear around town. We\u2019ll contact you in regards to sizing and which shirt style you would like. We\u2019ll be offering our classic t-shirt and also our art print shirt. \nThe Beans\nYou might think we're joking here but we're not shitting you. Llama beans are almost as magical as the animal itself. It's surprisingly an excellent fertilizer and cultivated ancient peruvian cultures for centuries. Don't take our word for it but take our good friend Rusty's. \nPLAY\n\nEach bag of natural and organic llama beans will contain one heaping cup and come complete with a recipe on how to fertilize your plants to the most amazing possibilities ever imagined. In case you don't have a plant or garden you're in luck because coal from Santa is so 2013. You can now get with the times and help santa give out llama beans instead of coal this holiday season. It will be shipped just in time for the holidays. \nCheck out this article by National Geographic on how llama beans are cleaning up the Bolivian water supply here.\nTanner Shinnick/ Director/ Co-Executive Producer\nTanner was raised by llamas. No but seriously he was born on a llama farm.  He was actually called \"Llama Boy\" in high school.  Aside from llama documentaries, he is an Emmy Award winning director who has shot and directed national commercial campaigns and feature length documentaries. \nHe can smell llama spit from a mile away. \nAaron Egbert Allsop/ Co-Executive Producer\nAaron Egbert Allsop was raised by a pack of wolves in northern Wisconsin. After living in Honduras for two years he moved to Idaho to get domesticated and go to college. There he met Tanner who was looking for someone to film him who had both a green screen and a pirate costume to supply (true story.) Fortunately Aaron had both and has been working with Tanner and John ever since making movies. To put it short, Aaron spends his time on Llama Nation: The Documentary making sure everything gets done. \nJohn Meier/ Assistant Director/Co-Executive Producer\nJohn loves to go on adventures and journeys. Each adventure has brought new insights to his life and filmmaking career. One of those adventures took him to Colorado where he and Tanner decided to change the world through the medium of film. Llama Nation: The Documentary is only the start of that journey. \nLars Lindstrom / Director of Photography\nLars met his first llama at a country fair when he was 12. It was love at first sight. Lars is an LA based cinematographer with an MFA in cinematography from the Art Center. Aside from Llama Nation: The Documentary, Lars has shot music videos that have premiered on BET and also was the DP for a documentary with PBS. \nTucker Debevec/ Associate Producer/Cinematographer\nTucker Debevec is a country boy at heart with a big city attitude.  Originally from Mississippi, he somehow found his way to Idaho.  After some college at BYU-IDAHO he decided to pursue his dream and knowledge of filmmaking with some awesome friends (Tanner, John, Aaron) .  His love for film is as strong as his love for llamas.  He currently works as a full-time cinematographer for bodybuilding.com and loves every second of it.  When he\u2019s not anxiously waiting for the next season of Game of Thrones then he\u2019s busy trying to eat healthy.  \nDanno Ard/ Associate Producer\nMost kids had a stuffed bear growing up. Danno had a stuffed llama. He is an award winning producer, director and designer with a background in film production, advertising and web design.

We hope a successful festival run and screening will open up these windows of possibilities but we can never be certain.

For the past decade I have been on a mission to document the lack of autonomy that millions of women in developing countries have over their own lives and bodies. Through my photography, I bring these women and their stories to the forefront of global consciousness.\nAt the same time, this book documents the many advances being made in educating and empowering women and girls. Doctors, nurses, teachers, aid workers, and NGO staff \u2013 these are the silent heroes who are working tirelessly to improve the lives of millions of women around the world. This book showcases the noble work they do.\nIn Dhaka, Bangladesh, this woman just received a long-term birth control implant. She is being counseled by her physician.\nFaces of Courage is unique \u2013 no other photo-documentary has portrayed the full scope of this human drama as it unfolds around the world, including the efforts to help women move from tragedy and despair to hope and triumph.\nYou can read many articles about women in peril, and you can find reams of appalling statistics in countless reports and journals. But to me, these portraits of individual girls and women communicate in a much more direct and compelling way. They tell the story of our changing world, with an eloquence that words can never match.\nRajasthan, India \u2013 Two young girls from a rural village. One must stay at home to look after her younger siblings and the goats, while the other is supported by her mother to attend school.\nThe legendary Milton Glaser is the book\u2019s designer, and we already have a commitment from a wonderful publisher. But the book will not become a reality without your support.\nIn\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad the new world of publishing in the digital age, artistic photo-essays have to be subsidized. I also have to compensate the designer and the editor, so I need to raise at least $50,000. I feel that I have a commitment to all of the women whom I\u2019ve photographed over the years, to tell their stories and to add momentum to the movements that are tirelessly working to empower them. With your help, we can share their voices with as wide an audience as possible.\nHere are some sample pages from the first chapter, to give you a better sense of the photographs and the book\u2019s layout.\nFaces of Courage is very timely, as there is a growing movement in the United States and abroad that is hungry for real, substantive content on women\u2019s human rights; readers yearn to explore and understand more fully the facts and issues involved.\nIts hopeful message will make the book an effective communication tool, while shedding light on the heroic work of the small, grassroots organizations featured throughout. As the book\u2019s images and stories show, the struggle of women to gain autonomy over their own lives is a battle of epic proportions. These photo essays heavily emphasize the positive impacts of family planning and girls\u2019 education.\nMother and infant in Kumasi, Kenya\nWhere reproductive healthcare exists, we have the opportunity to make critical differences in protecting the rights and voices of women, which will go a long way toward alleviating poverty and stimulating economic productivity. \nI have documented many programs that have produced results, but even the most effective programs need to be scaled up by many orders of magnitude to serve the huge populations in need. With this goal in mind, Faces of Courage and the accompanying website and PR campaign are geared toward raising consciousness and inspiring activists to support programs serving women in need around the world. \nMidwife and expectant mother in Otavalo, Ecuador\nI have been asked more than once why, as a man, am I focused on the rights of women? The answer is simple: because they are a human-rights issue, not just a female issue. Millions of women face travails on a daily basis that are an outrage and totally unacceptable; for example, some are trafficked and bound in contemporary forms of slavery.\nHow can you help?\nPlease explore the rewards we are offering below and donate as much as possible.

However, in this case, I don't foresee any major risks. Most of the work has been done, including 75% of the writing, and all of the photography. I already have an experienced designer and printer on board, and we have accurate printing and shipping costs from one of the best printers from Japan, plus an excellent distributor. If we raise the funds the book will be published.\n\nAlthough this is my first Kickstarter project, I have done my homework and am fully aware of the challenges presented by fulfilling the rewards, and have set aside the time and accounted for the resources necessary for the packaging and shipping.\n\nThe book will be shipped from the US, and the cost for shipping such a large and heavy book is quite high. If you live outside of the US, please add the extra shipping costs as indicated on each individual reward level where applicable. I appreciate your understanding and thank you in advance, and please do get in touch with me if you have any questions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Faces of Courage: A #MeToo for the Women of the World", "update_content": "Dear Friends,\nBack in 2015, when I published \"Faces of Courage\" -- with your support -- I had one primary goal in mind: To illustrate a cause and to give voice to the millions of women around the world who have no voice -- and no means of protecting themselves against almost daily assaults on their dignity and on their basic human rights. As you know, thanks to the women I portrayed, \"Faces of Courage\" gained important attention. Former President Jimmy Carter endorsed the book and gave it a prominent place in his ongoing campaign for promoting human rights.

And when I try to examine some of the root causes, it always comes down to cultural acceptance.
