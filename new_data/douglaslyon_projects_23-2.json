[{"backer": "douglaslyon", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "BLUEVER Hello X2 is an easy-to-mount and simple-to-use peripheral that is used on any standard desktop monitor or laptop to instantly transform it into an interactive touchscreen with extra functionality. \nWith the help of its built-in camera and infrared light bulbs, BLUEVER Hello X2 detects your moving finger towards the monitor and translates it into touch and drag mouse actions with high accuracy and no latency. It makes your work and fun more efficient and engaging.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 works with any average laptop or desktop with Mac or Windows OS and a monitor screen size starts from 10\u201d up to 27\u201d, and converts them into fancy touchscreens.\nIt makes the interaction with your computer more intuitive and instinctive, therefore your life and work more efficient and easier.\nHello X2 magically sprinkles touchscreen features to your monitor which detect and actuate various finger gestures, including click(short press), double-click, right-click(long press), swipe, touch and hold, touch and drag, draw\\sketch\\write with finger.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 is easy to mount on monitors of all sizes from 10\u201d to 27\u201d. It clips onto the upper right corner of the monitor and you should be able to find a firm fit by turning the screw by hand to adjust.\nIn case you switch to a new computer or monitor of different size or thickness, you can still use your BLUEVER Hello X2 with it. It won\u2019t occupy any extra space on your table, and is so small and lightweight that won\u2019t add a bulk of burden to your monitor.\n *The clip can be adjusted between 1 to 28mm. It also comes with a removable soft grip which allows for a secure and scratchless attachment to your monitor.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 is configured with a camera and infrared light emitter. Any disturbances towards the invisible laser web caused by the movement of your finger in front of the computer screen will be detected by the camera and translated into accurate and immediate mouse actions.\nBLUEVER Hello X2 has a feature called accidental touch protection that prevents sleeve touch or swipe, so no actions of your clothes will be inadvertently made.\n\nThe BLUEVER Hello X2 doesn\u2019t require a bare finger to detect touch. Gloves, paintbrushes and stylus will all work.\nIf you\u2019re anyone who desperately misses a touchscreen on your MacBook Pro 2020 such as a photographer, a graphic designer, a presenter, a gamer, an editor or an artist, you will find Hello X2 extremely practical and useful.\nOnce attached, turn on your computer and plug BLUEVER Hello X2\u2019s USB connector into it to power up. The first time you use BLUEVER Hello X2 with your computer, it is important to calibrate it correctly. The process can be easily done by following the instructions given by the application installed on your computer. It takes just a few steps of about 1 minute and you only have to do it once. Power on/off, sleep/wake or upgrade systems on your computer won\u2019t affect the performance of BLUEVER Hello X2.\nPLAY\n\nThe LED on BLUEVER Hello X2 clearly indicates its working status for your convenience:\nGreen - normal operation; \nRed - to be calibrated/driver to be installed or run; \nYellow - sleep.\n*Any change in the physical position or location of BLUEVER Hello X2 on your monitor or uninstall its software application requires a re-calibration.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\nBLUEVER was established in 2019 and is a team dedicated to design lifestyle tech products that help people to transform into a smarter life.

With a powerful flashlight on one end, and a mini pry bar on the other, this is an essential keyring tool that's always there for you when you need it, and won't get in the way when you don't.  \nCrafted from premium quality titanium, the keychain design allows you to attach your flashlight to almost anything. Keys, zippers, backpacks, and more, you\u2019ll always have it on hand to light your way.\n\nFlashlight & Pry-bar in one\nHUNT3.0 is a brilliant flashlight and EDC companion in one. But where we\u2019ve really upped the game is with the light options you now have available. \nLight Everything: Three LED Color Options\n White \u2013 100 lumens \u2013 The Pathfinder is our super-thin SMD LED module that offers brilliant light with a lower energy consumption. Last longer, see further, and take it anywhere.\n UV \u2013 50 lumens \u2013 The Explorer is a compact EDC UV light that\u2019s perfect for verifying currency and ID, or protecting yourself with germ and fluid detection. Stay safe, and uncover a hidden world.\n Red \u2013 65 lumens \u2013 The Survivor is designed to help you operate stealthily in the dark. Soft red lighting allows the human eye to keep your pupils dilated, retaining and boosting your ability to see in low light conditions. Perfect for stargazing, navigation, and reading at night.\nWaterproof\n\nUV LED\n\nRed LED\nMini Pry Bar Functionality\nHUNT3.0 enables you to perform those everyday tasks that would normally have you rummaging around in the bottom of your toolbox. Whether you want to eliminate the need for carrying a full-size tool, or you just want to maintain a low pocket profile, HUNT3.0 has you covered.\nPractical Everyday Uses To Make Your Day Easier\nLight-duty prying\u2014open those sticky can lids\nOpening taped boxes\nScoring materials\nWorks as a flat-head screwdriver\nOpening bottle caps, wherever you are\nWon\u2019t damage products inside packages.\n\nKeep Your Hands Clean\nNow more than ever we\u2019re conscious of what we touch. HUNT3.0 lets you go about your day while keeping your hands to yourself.\nYou can use it when you\u2019re out and about in the world to press buttons, operate keypads, tap car park ticket machine buttons, hit elevator buttons, and much more\u2014all without making direct contact with your hands.\nHUNT3.0 is your everyday carry hands-free companion.\nBetter way to press public buttons\n\nMade from Titanium And Built To Last\nTitanium is among one of the strongest and most durable metals on the planets\u2014which is why we chose this material for HUNT3.0. Designed for rugged outdoor use, just as much as around the home, you can take it anywhere.\nTitanium coatings are known to chip off and wear down over time. So, we chose a natural, uncoated, raw finish for HUNT3.0, to give each product that timeless look that stays clean and looks great for years to come.\nWhat We\u2019ve Improved With HUNT3.0\nHUNT3.0 is the exciting evolution in our HUNT EDC flashlight series. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new.\nWe added a red light option for better nighttime vision\nWe\u2019ve improved the design and the appearance, making it easier to rotate when turning on or off, and when using the pry bar\nBased on feedback from the backers of our previous-generation products, we\u2019ve improved the size and strength of the pry bar, making it a more durable and robust everyday tool  \n Specifications\nBody Materials\n100% Grade 5 Titanium\nLED Specs\nSMD LED Bulb \nBuilt-in Resistor To Prevent Overheating\nBulb Lifespan 30,000 - 50,000 hours\nAlkaline Battery Life - Up to 60 hours\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur team started back in 2019 after our very first Kickstarter project. So to us, this platform simply feels like home.\nWe don't have (or ever want) any investors, so we bring our new products directly to the Kickstarter community. With your help we\u2019re able to bring our products to life, and make unique products that are built to last.\nWe love being an active part of this community, and wouldn\u2019t be here without our wonderful backers.\nTimeline\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fifth Kickstarter project, so it\u2019s safe to say that we know we\u2019ve got what it takes to bring this project to successful completion.\n\nThe only risk we foresee is the chance of shipping a little bit later than the estimated dates, due to the project being extremely over-funded. It\u2019s not a bad risk to have! So we\u2019ve factored in extra time to account for this, as large-scale productions involve considerably more planning.\n\nWe\u2019ll provide you with regular project updates, so should any production or shipping delays occur, we can let you know about it ASAP.\n\nPlease note that the flashlight shown in images and video on this page is our functional prototype, and we reserve the right to make minor design alterations to all elements as needed. The dimensions may need to be adjusted during mass production to ensure we produce the best flashlight we can, for everyone.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""},

Pero turns your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device. Now, you can control the cursor and input commands with this single device so that you can focus more on getting the job done. \n\nAAD function | Active Applicaiton Detection\nPERO can perform Active Application Detection through the User Custom Program. You can send separate commands according to each application, even with the same gesture.\n\nProvide customized settings according to gesture usage patterns\nOur \u201cUser Support Program\u201d analyzes your natural gesture habits and patterns to learn your command preferences. Instead of fitting your needs to predefined shortcuts, make your own shortcuts that meet your exact needs!\n\n\n\n\n\n Pero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.\n\nPero lets you control the user-interface with just your gestures alone. \nYes, just like Minority Report but better. Since this is real. Turn your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device.\n\n We manage applications by type. \nUCP can manage many applications easily by dividing types according to popular shortcuts and commands. And new applications can be updated faster. These advantages, combined with the AAD function, help effectively control the commands of the application through the Pero. \n\n\nUpcoming Supported applications \n\n * Pero is not fully compatible with drone control at the moment. The video above is a demo test.\n\n\n\n\nPero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.\n\nPalmcat\u2019s Gesture Sensing Algorithm detects movement on the back of your hand while the touch panel strapped around the palm tracks the pressure from each of your fingers. Combining these two factors give you an almost unlimited choice of combinations! For example, even if you swipe your hand horizontally, it\u2019ll carry different meanings depending on which fingers you place on the touch panel.\nComfortable Wrist\nThe positioning of the arm while using Pero prevents the build up of pressure and pain in the wrist. But Ordinary mice force the wrist into a bent shape  which causes discomfort and pain over time\nWhen working with a mouse, you have to always work in the same pose and posture. However, you can work in a variety of poses and poses.\n\n PERO does not need space to control the cursor.\nSo Pero reduces the time you spend moving between the mouse and trackpad. It also helps you use your computer efficiently even in a desk-free working environment.\n\n\n\n\n The movement of the hand is captured by the IMU sensor located on the back and the movement is detected through gestures through Palmcat's GR algorithm. The GR algorithm is a technique that can calculate each gesture in a lightweight chipset environment without the need for a separate analysis process or system by utilizing the advantages of the Palmcat hardware.\nThe thumb button was designed to work like a mouse click. It\u2019s placed right next to your thumb so all options to click, right-click, or drag are within finger reach.\nOur fingers do a lot more than we give them credit for.  \nThink of the diverse purpose that each finger serves. The subtle differences in a tap, press, and pinch. The array of meanings they convey. We took the admiration of our nifty fingers to heart by utilizing their full potential in Pero. Its highly sensitive touch sensor recognizes each individual fingertip and when they\u2019re being pressed down.\n\nSimply connect it just like connect your wireless earbuds, easy and effortless! No external receiver needed. And PERO uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). So you can use 37 hours on a 30-minute charge. \n\n\n\nSetting appropriate commands in advance according to the user's gesture usage pattern, \nImprove the accuracy by grasping the position of the finger touching the palm, \nIt detects the application you are using and delivers the command.\nIt helps you set the commands you want in gestures.\nUCP is our team's best gift to PERO buyers.\n\n\n\nYou could be typing away, drinking coffee, or chatting with your coworkers. Thanks to its 4mm-thin palm strip, Pero remains unobtrusive for you to wear as you carry out the rest of your day\u2019s tasks.\n\nThe hardware was created by molding liquid silicone, a high-precision method used to create cutting-edge medical tools and kitchen appliances. You don\u2019t have to worry about feeling discomfort such as tension, over-heating, and sweat accumulation.The hardware was created by molding liquid silicone, a high-precision method used to create cutting-edge medical tools and kitchen appliances. You don\u2019t have to worry about feeling discomfort such as tension, over-heating, and sweat accumulation.\n\nAre you one of those people frantically looking for the answer to: \u201cwhat about if you\u2019re left-handed?\u201d Don\u2019t worry, we got you covered too! Whether you're right-handed, left-handed, or ambidextrous, Pero works for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an IT engineer, I used to work in small and confined spaces which forced me to use the trackpad or track pointer because I didn\u2019t have enough room for a mouse. However, when I was working with a lot of cursor control, I gradually began to experience more pain in my elbows up to the point where it was difficult to move my arm. This led me to imagine a device that could recognize the movement of my hand.\n And so, after years of research and development, I came up with a device that could recognize gestures and translate it into specific commands. This is how Pero was born in 2017, but the current version of Pero is the most popular version among the people who participated in our user experience research tests (28 touch panel silicon insertion tests, 28 touch panel types, 9 product designs, 8 board modifications, and 8 sets of molds produced). We are doing our best and will continue to work hard in order to create innovative products that will provide incredible value for anyone!\n\nProcess of developing the touch panel\nIn order to make a recognition panel that can accurately recognize gestures even when worn roughly, a capacitive touch sensor was included in the design. However, it was necessary to make a panel to block the natural static electricity that can form in the palm while simultaneously recognizing the static electricity on the fingers. Eventually, we were able to succeed and ended up creating a thin but powerful discernment panel that accomplished everything we wanted it to accomplish.\n\nSoftware\nUser support software is where we focused a lot of our efforts in order to make it easy and simple for anyone to use. In the future, we planning on further developing the software so that more third-party applications are integrated and that additional customized gestures can be recognized. In order to reach this next step, we will try to develop motion recognition optimization by making sure that Pero outputs can be analyzed by 2,800 data bits per second.\n\n\nThis campaign is managed by Altos, a product launch consulting agency that specializes in helping global tech startups launch their product in the United States.

The sensor collects information, such as the plant\u2019s water and lighting conditions, and sends that information back to the Riego system. The sensor also has an LED indicator that displays these statuses at a glance.\nWhether you have a fern, succulent or palm, houseplants help you feel good and add a calming, natural element to your living space. \nUnfortunately, remembering to routinely water your houseplants is a chore that\u2019s often forgotten. And what about when you're not home or away on vacation? Your plants may suffer!\nThat's where Riego comes in!  \nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more. \nThe Riego Indoor Irrigation System was created by two pediatricians \u2014 Manuel Caceres, MD and his wife, Maria Caceres, MD. The duo had a great affinity for plants and gardening, which was hard to maintain with their busy travel schedules. To cope, they installed a commercial outdoor irrigation system in their greenhouse to automatically irrigate the plants. They used a water bib and a timer but their indoor plants couldn\u2019t be automatically irrigated due to a lack of a water source. The pair couldn\u2019t find a device for their living room that would automatically irrigate their plants.\nIn 2014, Dr. Caceres sought out to create the solution. He took a submersible water pump and placed it in a decorative vase filled with water in the middle of the living room. He connected the pump to thin pieces of tubing pulled from his greenhouse irrigation system, made a series of connectors, and paired the unit to an electrical timer. This early prototype was able to irrigate their plants automatically, intermittently and silently. It worked daily, not only when traveling, and only needed to be refilled every 3 to 4 weeks. Thus, Riego was born.\nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Riego a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or pre-order Riego, if you\u2019re a supporter of Riego, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this.

Quality is our main concern and we want our products to last a lifetime with both style and functionality. We are not interested in planned obsolesce after the warranty is finished so you come back and buy another machine - great for the company's bank account but terrible for the environment and the customer. We offer a 2-year warranty and sell any parts that need replacing.- instead of having to replace a whole unit.\nReusability and recyclability\nAny faulty machines are collected and fixed. Units that are too faulty to fix have parts reused (where they can be) and recycled. The packaging used is incredibly protective and has a handle to aid in carrying and transportation. Most of our customers keep the packaging for this exact reason - to transport it to new locations when they need to.\nSustainable materials\nAll timber used for the product is FSC certified. This means any tree cut down is planted with a new one. The positive about cutting trees down is that the new ones that grow absorb more carbon dioxide and provide more oxygen then the older trees that are cut down.\n\nOur Wireless chargers are made from recycled Aluminium which uses 70% less energy to create. It also means we are resuing material instead of extracting more from our precious earth.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe pride ourselves on the factory we have been working with for over 4 years now. Unfortunately, there is a range of factories out there; unethical sweat-shops to incredible and clean operations with staff that are treated incredibly. We also work with our factory due to the supply chains being close. It's important to us that the material isn't traveling miles to then be assembled.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe have a warehouse in the USA, Hong Kong, United Kingdom & Germany so that the final mile is as close to the customer as possible.\nSomething else\nAs our company grows and becomes more profitable - we want to impose on ourselves an annual tax of 1% of sales to Deforestation and planting new trees to mitigate any negative environmental consequences of our business activity.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Double Walled Glass Mug", "descp": "\u00a37\nSave \u00a38 or 53% | Retail Price \u00a315\n1x Double Walled Glass Mug\nKeep your brew hot longer.

Do you dream of having the rigidity and precision of a truly professional machine on your desk? We\u2019ve created the Abdi Automation DMC3 and DMC3 Plus; a desktop CNC Mill that features components and hardware usually only seen on professional machining centers. \nWe have taken what makes professional machining centers so great, and scaled that down for your desk. From the precision cast solid epoxy aggregate base, that has an internal vibration damping factor 5 times greater than cast iron. To the precise Hiwin linear guides on all 3 axis with anti backlash ball screws, and the 24000 rpm spindle with feed rates up to 130in/min. The Abdi Automation DMC3 and DMC3 Plus has everything you could ever want in a desktop CNC milling machine. Making it possible to fulfill the true beauty of your designs.\nWhat Materials Can You Cut?\nThe DMC3 and DMC3 PLUS were designed for users who want to machine materials traditionally not possible on desktop CNC's. You can machine anything from softer materials such as plastic or wood, to hard materials such as brass, aluminum, and even steel!\n\nThis is 6061 aluminum with a beautiful mirror-like surface finish. The clarity of the reflection is nearly perfect! Never before has this been possible on a desktop CNC!!\nThis is brass, an alloy that most machines can handle. But what those machines cant do is produce parts that look like they were made on a professional machining center. The DMC3 and DMC3 PLUS can!\nHere we have A2 tool steel, a material significantly harder than brass and aluminum, but for the DMC3 and DCM3 PLUS, it is a non issue. Beautiful parts every time!\n Machine Specifications? \nHow Does It Work?\nUsing the DMC3 and DMC3 PLUS is easy! It's just like using any other digital fabrication tool. Simply draw your idea in CAD, after that create a tool path of your model in CAM. We like to use Fusion 360, its free for Hobbyist, makers, and students. Also, it has both CAD and CAM in the same program. After that load your raw material and your G-code file into any g-code sender such as Universal G-code Sender or Chilipeppr. Set your work offsets and hit start! The DMC3 or DMC3 PLUS does the rest!\nAlso, the DMC3 and DMC3 PLUS accept industry standard G-code, so for the ones who like to write their own programs, that possible as well.\nWhats included?\nEach machine reward tier will include the following:\nAbdi Automation DMC3 or DMC3 Plus Milling Machine(fully assembled)\nPower Cord\nUSB Cord\n180 day limited warranty\nAdd-Ons\nThis is just the beginning for the DCM3 and DMC3 PLUS, we have lots of add-ons/accessories planed for both machines, so that you can take your work flow to the next level. Some of the add-ons we have planned are :\nA+B rotary table for simultaneous 5 axis machining\nAutomatic Tool Changer\nEnclosure\nCoolant System\n3D Touch Probe\nChip Management System\nTimeline?\nHow We Got Here?\nThis all began 3 and a half years ago as a side project, as I was working on my undergrad degree in mechanical engineering. I wanted a CNC that could mill most metals, and deliver excellent surface finish. Unfortunately, at that time there was no machine that could do that, and even still to this day. So I decided to make my own. First I started with an aluminum frame design, but quickly realized it wouldn't be rigid enough. So I designed another from steel, and then a second one made from thicker steel. But all of these designs had the same issue, there weren't any vibration damping properties. So after a lot of research I finally found a material that was both rigid, and dampened vibrations. Which brings us to where we are at today, the DMC3 and DMC3 PLUS.  Here are a few pictures from that journey:\n\nThis is the first steel fabricated CNC I built. It worked well, but I felt like I could do better.\nHere is the second steel fabricated CNC, big improvement from the first. Much more rigid, but still suffered from vibrations.\nAnd now we have the current design iteration. Bottom left is the mold, before and after the epoxy aggregate was poured to cast the prototype base. Top left is the base after it has cured. Top right are all the CNC machined parts. Bottom right is a partially assembled DMC3.\nIs there anywhere else I can learn more about Abdi Automation?\nThe best place is our Instagram!

Transistor Siren Kit With PCB: \u00a33,000 - UNLOCKED\nWe will include a kit that contains the PCB as well as additional components. You can solder the components in place to build a transistor siren.\n2. New Project: Solar Energy Storage Kit: \u00a35,500 - UNLOCKED\nWe will add another kit that contains a PCB, components, a mini solar panel as well as a supercapacitor and you can use these to build a solar energy storage circuit. This circuit charges a supercapacitor with solar energy and activates a transistor when a certain voltage is reached. This kit can be used as an energy source to power various other projects like a solar-powered wind chime, mini robot/bug, or flashing LEDs to name a few.\nThe stretch goals above add approximately 50 more items to BBox 1, bringing the total to about 550 items.\nThe quickest way to learn electronics is by building and tweaking circuits. Starting out with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi is fine by itself, but if you don't know how components like resistors, capacitors, transistors work then you will most likely keep looking out for tutorials when you want to build something new.\nLevel 1 Kit (BBox 1)\nLearning something new is always easier with the right foundation and that's what this level 1 kit (BBox 1) aims to do. It starts by teaching you about circuit fundamentals and gradually introduces new concepts while reinforcing the earlier ones. This way, you develop a good understanding of how everything works together.\nA glimpse at some of the components\nThe BBox 1 contains 500 items that range from resistors, capacitors, transistors, sensors, relays, buzzers - basically all the electronic components you need to get started. With learning material for 24 projects, there's plenty to build and it doesn't stop there. You can use the additional components present in the kit to build even more circuits!\nThe kit aims at being a guide to help you understand basic electronics so it starts out by teaching you about a simple circuit to light up an LED and it then goes on to teach you about transistors and the rest.\nA simple LED circuit along with some of the components that you will learn about later\nBooklet with circuit schematics and layout views\nThe reference booklet has the circuit schematics and breadboard layouts, while the online videos provide a more in-depth look at the circuit along with useful and relevant information.\nThe booklet contains a breadboard view to simplify the layout\nOne of the challenges with building circuits is figuring out the layout as there are many ways to build the same circuit. We've provided breadboard views for all the 24 projects to make it easier to get started building them. These are verified layouts that can be used to build the circuits.\nCircuit analysis\nThe online videos also teach you how the circuit operates so that you can understand how to create practical circuits. Some of them also provide you with tweaks and suggestions so that you can experiment by changing or adding additional component values.\nSome of the components you will learn about\nThe intruder alarm that uses an invisible infrared beam\nA simple soil moisture indicator circuit\nOur favourite: The transistor siren\nYou will also get access to a dedicated support forum which means that you can share your progress, learn from others and also clarify any queries. This will go live on our website towards the end of the campaign.\nThe BBox 1 contains all the components you need to build circuits with the exception of batteries. \nIt's not easy to classify all the 500 different components but here's a simple breakup of the kit contents:\nBBox 1 contents\nYou will need 2x AA size batteries and 1x 9V (PP3 or 6LR61) battery to power the circuits. Including the batteries would have complicated the shipping process and it would increase the likelihood of delivery delays which is why we decide to leave them out. The 9V battery is only needed for the soil moisture circuit and rest of the circuits use the AA batteries. These batteries are extremely common and you should be able to source them at a local store. \nThis is just the beginning of venturing into electronics. The BBox 1 introduces the concepts of logic gates and you get to build 5 logic gates using transistors. This prepares you to enter the world of digital electronics and integrated circuits which is what level 2 is all about.\nA transistor version of the AND gate\nWe're currently designing the level 2 kit and this is expected to go live soon after the level 1 campaign (this Kickstarter) ends. We build even more exciting circuits in the level 2 kit and it prepares us to enter the world of Arduino microcontrollers - which is level 3.\nThere's even more planned after that, so make sure you've got the basics covered to start building more exciting projects :)\nInternational rewards will be sent by insured, tracked and signed delivery which means you can expect to receive them very quickly.\nWe've fulfilled the rewards for our previous campaign on time and we expect to deliver these on time too. Infact, this is a much simpler campaign compared to the previous one so we are very confident on everything running smoothly, now that we are familiar with the Kickstarter process.\nWe hope that you will start your electronics adventures with us and we hope to see you around.

I'm going to get something like an X-Tronic 5040 XR3 Hot Air Rework Station with Soldering Iron and fix ALL the things! This first box will be a nice refresher on the fundamentals, and it will be nice to learn about the microprocessors. We never got that far.", "time": "about 2 years ago"}, {"username": "WYTng", "content": "In order to give the existing supporter the privilege to pledge Box #2 as a super early bird, they can pay in advance deposit like 10% of the total super early bird price which is not refundable to ensure they take it seriously before they pledge. You has to inform them earlier before the launching date and time so that can pledge the super early bird. This method also allow you to estimate how many fixed order you can get so you can pre prepare how many super early bird quantity needed and followed by the early bird pledge.", "time": "about 2 years ago"}, {"username": "Eric Williams", "content": "I have a question regarding the continuity between the boxes.

We wanted all the research and development to be done for you and encapsulated it in a smart, secure, flexible and reliable package as standard. \nAnd so the Pebl was born.\nPebl can connect with and control electrical equipment, from making sure the kettle is boiled for that first cup of coffee in the morning, to collecting analytics to track production efficiency for your business. The possibilities are endless.\nThe IoT is a place where everyday physical items are quickly becoming part of the virtual world that is the internet. These items can be controlled and monitored from a distance to, for example, improve your life at home, increase productivity in the work place or improve performance and reliability in industrial equipment.\nThe IoT is already a very big and daunting place, especially if you are just starting out. Trying to manufacture and provide an IoT solution can be an expensive and drawn out process, requiring technical and specialist expertise. We believe it should be intuitive and simple, so we've done all the hard work for you. Our product can be used by everyone and anyone. Pebl provides an end-to-end solution for enthusiasts, business owners, education, home automation projects and... well, anything!\nThe Pebl is a standalone IoT device that requires no assembly and no programming. Following a simple two minute setup procedure, your Pebl is ready to be incorporated into your project providing IoT functionality that will bridge the gap between the virtual and physical world, from and to anywhere in the world!\nWe really are providing the complete IoT solution. We offer the hardware, software and the back-end infrastructure, supporting all that you will ever want to do. All you have to do is provide the power of imagination!\nThe potential for ROI (Return on Investment) for these little fellas is HUGE!\nWe believe that by implementing the Pebl into your existing or new development product, you will see fast and large returns. This is due to lack of upfront setup costs, we provide the entire solution.\nPreventative maintenance, remote monitoring and assistance, data processing and management packages are all contracts that you can provide to your customers, at the price of a single device, the size of a sugar cube!\nPebl is designed to remove any requirement for central control hubs, is completely self-reliant and requires almost no technical knowledge to set up. Simply download our app, enter your WiFi credentials and that's it. You are connected to the IoT and ready to begin making your own ripples in the internet.\nEvery Pebl includes a set-up USB lead, purely to provide power to the device. Once the Pebl is configured, you can let your imagination run wild and build the next big thing, streamline your factory, teach your STEM pupils or monitor your heating from work.\nSo why use a Pebl and not an Arduino or Raspberry Pi? \nFirst and foremost, security. The Pebl, unlike other similar devices on the market comes with enterprise grade security as standard.\nAdditionally, the Pebl is pre-programmed. One of the challenges with the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and similar devices, is creating the code you need to achieve your application's goal. More often than not, this rarely proves easy or reliable. The Pebl simply responds to pre-determined commands.\nFurthermore, as the Pebl is a fully encapsulated device, you don't have to worry about electrostatic discharge (ESD) or moisture damage as you would with bare board devices like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The water tight housing provides a barrier for use in almost any scenario, protecting against harsh environments. \n\nSo, what's in the box? Simply, a Pebl, a USB setup lead and a Quick Start guide. That is all you need to explore the world of the IoT.\nWe are determined to ensure our Pebl packaging is slimline, is produced with minimal waste and is 100% recyclable, using just card. \n\n\nThe Pebl is designed to be used as a component within custom hardware. You can think of it as a secure IoT bolt-on for your existing and exciting new projects. Currently you are required to implement the Pebl into your project or solution by modifying existing or creating new circuitry to meet the demand of your application.\nFour GPIO pins and a data bus for communication with I\u00b2C sensors and accessories is made available. This allows makers to produce and market their own IoT peripherals that the Pebl can simply plug into. The Pebl device can be used for multiple applications by simply removing and reinserting into another product.   \nFor enthusiasts and inventors, we provide a breadboard breakout adaptor, to enable you to easily implement a Pebl into your projects for quick and easy development and testing. We offer a 'Starter Pack' reward that we hope will spark your imagination and get your ideas flowing.\nOur 'Starter Pack' includes the following items to get you going...\n\n Pebl One - a standard boxed Pebl device which includes a USB set-up lead and Quick Start guide.\n\n Breadboard - 830 Point Solderless PCB Breadboard for you to simply and quickly prototype your projects.\n\n Pebl Breadboard Adaptor - mount your Pebl to your breadboard to easily incorporate it into your projects.\n\n Jumper wires - 65 cables to wire up your project on your breadboard.\n\n LEDs - Start simple and wire the 4 LEDs direct to the GPIO pins on your Pebl. You can then turn those on or off using your Pebl. No need for resistors as the Pebl has built in current limiting protection. Expand on this by wiring the LED legs onto 2 GPIO pins to control the colour of the LED.\n\n Push Buttons - Use the buttons on the GPIO pins to physically control the Pebl's GPIO. Try wiring a button into pin 1 and an LED into pin 2. Then using the Portal you can set pin 2 to follow pin 1. When pin 1 is high, pin 2 will follow and the LED will turn on. This would also work across multiple Pebl devices from anywhere in the world!\n\n Membrane 1x4 Keypad - Expand on the above buttons and control all 4 GPIO pins. You can then see their states change on the Portal and interact with other Pebl devices.\n\n Capacitive Touch Sensor - A bit more interesting that just a button and works based on your finger capacitance.\n\n 2 Channel Relay Board - Done with the LEDs and looking to take it a step further? Use this relay board to turn on and off larger items such as lamps or even your kettle. Tie this together with the buttons or use the portal to make a cup of tea.\n\n I\u00b2C Temperature Sensor - Make use of the I\u00b2C data bus on the Pebl to get an accurate temperature reading of your surroundings. If it's too hot, use the relay board to turn on a fan. Too cold? Use the other channel to turn on a heater.\n\n I\u00b2C 32Kb FRAM Memory - You've got all these temperature readings, wouldn't it be neat if you could store those to see how it changes throughout the day? Save them on this module to collect later.\n\n Mirco 9G Servo Motor - For use alongside an I\u00b2C servo board (included). Use this to open a vent or small window. You could even rig this up to a flap that when opened releases the cat food. Never have to feed the cat again! \n\n Digital Multimeter - A multimeter is a must have for electronic enthusiasts. Understand what is happening with your project and troubleshoot any mis-connections that you may have. Test your circuit to make sure connections are solid and what you think is happening is actually occurring.\n\n\nThe Fingoti Portal is a secure place to manage, monitor, control and interact with your Pebl devices and best of all it's free to use.\nThe Pebl can be used with or without our Portal. The vast majority of customers will use the Portal for its convenience and ease of use. However, the Pebl can be used in many other different ways, which of course, are free of charge (please refer to the 'Multiple Connection Methods' section below).\nWe've designed the Portal to cater for everyone from enthusiasts to small business owners and even large commercial applications. We have implemented our own infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure platform, resulting in a user experience that is intuitive, concise and rewarding.\nIf you decide to use the Portal, we offer 100 free device messages (called 'Ripples') with FULL functionality, renewed every 24 hours. However, if you choose to extend this cap, then we base our service on a pay-as-you-go, micro-payment basis.\nFor example if you require more Ripples for your application per day, then you can choose to pay just \u00a30.002 (0.2 pence) per each additional Ripple. This essentially means you can double your daily usage limit for just 20 pence per day if needed. \nIf you are using our API as an industrial customer or as a third party developer, the charge is issued in the same manner, however, high usage of the Portal can result in a cheaper monthly contract if desired. \nMost of our pledge rewards include a Portal discount. This discount is applied to any additional Ripples purchased exceeding your daily free allocation. For example, if you have a 50% Portal discount, as with the 'Limited Edition' reward, you would pay just \u00a30.001 (0.1 pence) per additional Ripple. Effectively this means you can double your daily Ripple limit for only 10 pence.\nOur payment terms are completely transparent and you can pay for as much or as little as you want to use, with no subscriptions.\nFrom our Portal, users can claim devices using just the serial number. Once the Pebl is linked to an account, the owner can monitor activity, manage settings and connect with other Pebl devices, including virtual devices.\nOne of the features included with the Portal are virtual devices, which act like physical devices except they are driven by virtual events. These events can be triggered using our API or an internet feed, to effect GPIO pins on other physical devices. This means a physical Pebl GPIO pin can directly follow an internet event, for example, when man lands on Mars!\n\nThe Pebl's onboard 80MHz 32-bit processor is used in conjunction with a WiFi engine as it's primary network connection method. The WiFi connection has a range of up to 50 metres.\nThe 2.4GHz WiFi engine uses the standard 802.11 b/g/n protocol and provides an extremely reliable connection to a router or access point. WiFi connections are WPA, WPA2 and WEP compatible as standard and incorporate a variety of TKIP and AES encryption, as required.\nIn simple terms, the Pebl's WiFi provides secure, powerful and reliable performance, resulting in a lightning fast response to user requests.\n\n\nThe biggest risk for IoT devices is the lack of security. The Pebl provides peace of mind where this is concerned. It's WiFi is fully capable of end-to-end encryption, when using our Fingoti Portal. \nWe use Microsoft's Azure Platform to provide a robust and proven method of transmitting data over the internet, securely. Using a SHA256 encrypted SAS key, communication to the portal from the device is protected while in transit and at rest by our triple firewall protected servers.\n\n\nWith the IoT world requiring clever, reliable and varied sources of power, we didn't want to limit the device to a particular voltage. Instead, we've made the Pebl tolerant to a wide range of voltage inputs. This allows you to power the Pebl with a USB output, solar panel or even a car battery, just to name a few.\nWith a wide input voltage range of anywhere between 5v and 15v. The onboard voltage smoothing ensures that the GPIO outputs aren't electrically noisy and provide a steady 5v output. The voltage regulation does generate a small amount of heat, but this is properly dissipated, with efficient built-in heat sinking.\nSimply, the Pebl can be used with many different power sources, allowing a wide range of applications.\n\n\nThe four user-configurable GPIO pins on the Pebl act as inputs or outputs as required in your application. They each provide an output of 5v with up to 50mA (70mA sink) of current; enough to power logic, LEDs or relays.\nThese GPIO pins are also semi-intelligent. They can detect a short circuit and a change in GPIO state every 1/100th of a second, instantly reporting back the information to the Fingoti Portal.\n\n\nA highly useful feature of the Pebl is that it can be deployed as a master for a high-speed I\u00b2C data bus applications, serving over 100 slave modules.\nI\u00b2C is a globally recognised communications protocol that uses just two wires for data transfer. This allows for a vast range of sensors and devices to be monitored, read and written to, from anywhere in the world.\n\n\nThe Pebl acts like a secure, remote middleman in I\u00b2C communication, simply passing bytes onward to the slave module via the bus at a user specified address.\nThere is an abundance of I\u00b2C modules and devices on the internet at extremely low prices, that are very well documented for easy implementation.\n\n\nThe Pebl includes a 16 million colour RGB LED that can be changed to any colour using a single command, visually communicating with users for many different purposes. \nThe device also incorporates a 'blink' feature that allows you to adjust the flashing speed, duration and colour. This provides additional flexibility and use for the Pebl device.\nPretty cool, eh?\n\n\nWant to use the Pebl outdoors? No problem. When used with our water-resistant connector, the device is immune to dust, dirt, rain, moisture and extreme weather. The rubber gasket and stainless steel screws provide a watertight seal around the connector, allowing you to completely submerge the device!\nThe Pebl is designed to be IP67 rated, which certifies that it's waterproof and we're working on getting this officially assessed as soon as possible after our campaign.\n\n\nWe appreciate that your IoT application for the Pebl may include remote locations, for example, a greenhouse at the end of your garden. Therefore the device may not have a direct connection to WiFi in your home or office because it's too far away...\nFear not, we've thought of that too!\nThe Pebl can use an advanced WiFi meshing protocol, which we have developed from scratch. If your project is not within range of a WiFi access point or router (over 50 metres) then it can search for your nearest fellow Pebl and ask it to share it's WiFi connection, again securely.\nIn short, meshing allows you to have a long range application, by popping a few Pebl devices in between, to bridge the gap, whilst maintaining encryption.\nNormally, meshing can reduce network performance, but as the Pebl's data packets are so small, you shouldn't notice any speed reduction, even after multiple hops!\n\n\nOkay, okay, we know it doesn't have a battery, but believe it or not that was a conscious decision. A battery limits you to have to use devices and peripherals that are low powered which can limit your IoT application - not what we want to see!\nWe believe that for an IoT device to be truly reliable and ensure that its data reporting is as accurate as can be, then it should be continuously powered. We have an environmental responsibility to provide the best performance we can, so, we made the Pebl as power efficient as possible. It draws just 80mA.\n\n\nIsn't it irritating when new software gets released and you have to individually update every device you have?\nNot with the Pebl, it's actively checking for updates. We release software updates after passing an extensive beta testing process, so we're confident they won't interrupt your IoT application and cause any hiccups. You can opt for scheduled automatic updates when they are available or if your application is mission critical, update manually via the Fingoti Portal at a time that suits you.\nIf your Pebl is connected to the internet, you'll never miss an update.\n\n\nWays in which the Pebl can communicate with the outside world are extensive. They had to be, after all, it's trying to be the most universal IoT device on the market!\nThe Pebl accepts requests via a choice of six connection methods...\nFingoti Portal\nFingoti mobile app\nAPI requests\nDirect HTTP requests over a Local Area Network (LAN)\nPort forwarding over the internet (WAN)\nMultiple Peer-to-Peer connections\nUsing the Pebl via the Fingoti Portal is easy and seamless. By default, the Pebl will connect itself to our Portal (if you wish) whenever it sees an internet connection and allows you to access, monitor, change and update it with a free Portal account.\nBut if you're looking for a more industrial or custom solution or you'd consider yourself an advanced user then the Pebl will respond to direct HTTP requests. These can be sent to the device's local IP address over the standard port 80 and the Pebl will serve you either a full local user interface, text or JSON encoded responses. It's your choice!\nFor commercial use, our API can be utilised for direct communication, securely, via our Portal, but implementing your own user interface and back-end. This solution can be useful for third-party developers and custom applications that require high security and minimal fuss setup.\n\n\nYes, we get that a lot, it really is that small!\nRequirements for the size of the Pebl were defined early on to be as 'small as possible' but remaining 'beautifully tactile' - not an easy one.\nIt was important that the Pebl was both minimal and self-contained. This compares to the IoT hardware that is currently available, often being bare-board with exposed electrical components. We've worked extremely hard to make sure that every cubic millimetre of the device has been utilised. All components are internal and hermetically sealed with a chemical and water resistant resin, which acts as a heat sink as well as protection from environmental factors.\n\n\nIf the Pebl ripples your pond, then we'd ask you to please support us in these final steps of bringing it to life! Make a pledge and become one of the first people in the world to start using Pebl to make ripples in the internet.\nAny pledge, no matter how small is very much appreciated, please take a look below...\n\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, as a company, if we're going to do something, we want to do it properly.\nWe have built our company on what we consider to be our biggest value, getting stuff right the first time, and we mean to continue, regardless of cost and late nights...\nPLAY\n\nOur team consist of some very capable and independent people and we've done what we can with the resources that we have. We think we've done pretty well, even if we do say so ourselves! But now we need your help!\nYour pledge money will help fund:\nEnsuring our team can afford to continue working on the project full time.\nThe large upfront costs that are required to complete Portal user interface.\nFinalise the development of the back end infrastructure and API. \nThe high upfront costs of components and materials to manufacture the Pebl devices.\nComplete the beta testing phase of our development.\nAchieve FCC and IP certification. \nChipping in for the tea bags!\nAnd everything in between...\nWe appreciate any amount you can pledge - thank you :)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'd absolutely love to offer free postage for everyone, however, its not easy, as we've made the Pebl so affordable. To avoid spending a big chunk of your pledge on shipping, we've kept the postage cost to an absolute bare minimum. In most cases you'll receive your reward within 3-5 working days of estimated dispatch date, depending on your location.\nWe've clearly defined three global zones, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the Rest of the World to determine postage costs...\n\n\nWe post to anywhere in the world and the cost will automatically be added to your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as the product is concerned, it's 90% complete.

Once testing is complete, it will be all hands on deck to get these devices built and on the way to you all.\n\nIf we are to be held up for any reason, it will most likely be due to an FCC certification complication. Sometimes these things can take longer than expected but we'll work hard to avoid any delay.\n\nWe are fully aware that hiccups may occur but our team is dedicated to overcome them and honour your pledges.

This product was assembled by hand, tediously programmed using a crude breadboard breakout and tested manually, which made for sore fingers and late nights.\nTo solve this we created a semi automated programming and test jig, that programmed and tested each board in a few short steps. But we could still only do this for one board at a time. About this time we acquired a pick and place machine to scale up our output and automate our assembly.\nOriginal Semi-Automated Programming Jig\nWith the larger manufacturing output, we needed to improve on the programming and testing of each board, as this was our largest time sink. A better automated programming and test jig needed to be created to prepare 24 boards at a time. However, we didn't want to purchase 24 programming cables to program these boards all at once, especially when they can cost anywhere from $100 to $1000 each. \nSo we developed a port switching design which switched the programming and test pins on different boards, so it could serially program and test each board with a single button click. Now we could walk away, grab a coffee and everything would be done for us.\nSensorDots Improved Automated Programming Jig\nBut it got us thinking, surely there are others out there that could benefit from being able split out a single programming cable to program many boards at once, at a reasonable price.\nWith a few hardware design tweaks, the Port MuxR was born.\nThe Port MuxR\nThe Port MuxR is a bi-directional, 8/16 channel, switched bus multiplexer which works with either analog or digital signalling. So it doesn't just split out programming cables, it works for any array of 0-5V signalling levels.\nQuite simply, it connects a set of pins, to your choice of additional pins on different switchable ports, which are all connected to a shared bus and tied together with a simple control interface. To help visualise this, here's a block diagram for the Port MuxR:\nThe control circuitry allows you connect a collection of pins with groups of low resistance FET switches to a common bus. The boards also have a common primary port connection on the bus, which is typically used for connecting a master device/programmer (but you can connect up any port to any port as they are all linked via the bus; useful for one-to-many or many-to-one arrangements). Each switchable port has two groups of 4 individual FET switches, giving you up to 16x 4-pin channels, or 8x 8-pin channels.\nThere's also a switchable Vcc line per port as well, which allows you to power devices and sensors from a selectable 5/3.3V supply (or optional external supply).\nFeatures\nThe Port MuxR features include:\nBidirectional data flow, with near-zero propagation delay through each FET switch.\nLow ON-state resistance through switch ICs (Ron = 3 \u2126 typical, @ 3V) and optional series resistors on primary port pins.\nLow input/output capacitance.\n-2V undershoot protection prevents the FET (NMOS) switches from inadvertently turning on (when in off state) during signal undershoot events.\n0 to 5V signaling levels supported.\nSupports both digital and analog applications.\nUSB serial/I2C slave control interface with selectable I2C addressing (the I2C port is master mode capable too).\nLow crosstalk through switches when off.\n8 controllable Vcc pins (with LED indicator).\n3.3/5V Vcc selection header (with optional external power on adapter boards).\n8x8 pin or 16x4 pin multiplexing with additional primary port.\nIncluded open-source .NET based control software (builds under mono as well for Linux use).\nOpen-source Arduino control firmware for easy updating or modification to suit your requirements (running on an ATmega328PB).\nDifferent port switching settings available. E.g. Port make-before-break, break-before-make, port grouping, manual toggle.\nSoftware\nAlongside the hardware, is an easy to use USB serial or I2C control interface. The USB serial interface is great for interfacing with a PC and automation software, or if you just want manual control. The I2C interface is handy if you want to develop an all-in-one hardware solution, that utilises the MuxR. For example, you might like to create simple button interface hardware to control the switching instead.\nWe are also including an open-source, automation software toolkit that works directly with the serial interface. Using this software, you can also chain together or interface with multiple Port MuxRs, to increase the number of output ports you have. It even allows you to run commands after switching each port (e.g. running your programming software).\nAdapter Boards\nAnd that's not all, we have also created some application specific adapter boards, that allow you to connect up a few different programming cables. Different adapters can also be created easily and EDA libraries will be made available to help you out.\nTo start with we have created an AVR 6/10 Pin ICSP as well as an ARM JTAG/J-Link (Segger) adapter:\nProgramming Adapters\nWith these adapters you can turn an expensive collection of multiple programmers, cables and hubs:\nSparkfun's Ganged Programming Setup\nInto a neat-and-tidy, low-cost setup:\nPort MuxR With AVR ISCP Adapter\nBits & Pieces\nHere is the frequency response of the MuxR prototype under various conditions from 10kHz to 20MHz (Attenuation = pin on, Off Isolation = pin off, Adjacent Channel Crosstalk = signal leakage to adjacent pin). Note these figures are an indication only and differences in cables, connectors, adapter boards will affect your end to end frequency response.\nFrequency Response of Port MuxR Prototype (1Vpp @ 2.2pF)\nPlease note, the connectors on the adapter boards will arrive unsoldered as backers might have their own header orientation preferences. However, if the campaign reaches a certain amount, then you might have the option of having them soldered in a specific configuration before shipping (this will depend entirely on the number of backers opting for adapter board styles).\nThe main Port MuxR board is supplied without port connectors for the time being (as seen in the image below; the other headers and connectors are soldered) depending on how the campaign goes (if things go gangbusters, we might even consider a case too!). However if you order an adapter board it will come with appropriate mating connectors for the Port MuxR board. You can solder these in any orientation you see fit (male header to female or vice versa) or swap them out with a longer style of header.\nThe mounting holes in the corners fit up to 3mm screws. Design files with the locations of these will be released throughout the campaign along with pin layouts. The Port MuxR board itself and the adapter boards are 4.90 x 2.00 inches (124.5 x 50.9 mm).\nThere is also a low Vforward diode in series with the 3.3/5V supply lines and VCC output ports (see the block diagram above) to protect from any reverse current from devices connected to the boards or from an external supply. The Vf value depends on the current, but the drop is typically 0.1V@0.01A, 0.2V@0.1A, 0.3V@1A. To overcome this Vf drop, you can use your own supply on the PWR jumper connector instead (this is supported on the adapter boards). The 3.3/5V supply lines support up to 500mA of supply current shared across all ports when powered from the USB port (and up to 1A from external supply). The board itself has a quiescent current of 20mA@5V through the USB port).\nRepeated glamour shot so you don't have to refresh the page. Also click the image for a beautiful higher resolution version.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince the design is ready to manufacture, we just need to hit the go button with component orders (which we should do before the campaign ends if things are looking good). The parts selected have little supply risk, so there shouldn't be any delays on this end. We also have several reels of capacitors already, so the MLCC supply shortage shouldn't affect us too much.\n\nOnce the campaign ends, we will start manufacturing the boards with our own automated assembly and reflow equipment. We can easily manufacture up to 40 boards a day without losing sleep. If the campaign grows well past our assembly capabilities, we have contacts with local manufacturers who can pick up the slack to meet our delivery goals.\n\nWe do not foresee many difficulties with this project apart from natural disasters, however if there are slight manufacturing delays or a large number of backers, we will send boards out as they are made, in the order that backers backed the project.

However, in our opinion this has not come without compromises. \nSome cheap boards, while being small enough, lack of a proper integrated power supply. In other words, the developer has to implement it externally, reducing the benefits of low cost and small size. In other cases, linear regulators are used, making them unsuitable for low power applications or when you need to provide a decent amount of current for the external circuitry. \nOther boards use microcontrollers with limited memory, pin count or peripheral set, which make them unsuitable for more complex applications.\nAnd finally, some boards are not breadboard compatible, and, to date no Cortex M0+ board features 0.3\u201d spacing between rows, wasting precious breadboard space.\nWe wanted a device that solved all these problems without compromises.\nuChip\nThen we came up with our idea! We wanted a dev board:\nUSB based, capable of being programmed without requiring expensive external programmers, just like Arduino and many other dev boards.\nWith a powerful microcontroller with plenty of RAM and FLASH.\nWith a rich set of peripheral.\nCapable of acting both as an USB host and Device.\nWith integrated buck and boost power supplies.\nUSB- or externally-powered.\nCapable of providing an external programmable (3.3V or 5V) high-current power supply, when powered by USB.\nBreadboard compatible, with a narrow DIP footprint (0.3\u201d spacing).\nAnd, of course, low cost. \nWe worked hard, to optimize everything, and our result is uChip!\nHi! I'm uChip!\nMany examples already available!\nWe have developed various examples that will be released as open source. Take a look at some of these! Do you want a light saber ? (this could come in handy sometimes ;) ) Or drive a small RC boat? Or carry with you a portable game that just requires a keyboard and a VGA monitor? Or play a colorful 25-fps platform, with 16-bit graphics and parallax scrolling? \nuChip can do all of this! No kidding!\nPlay with uChip!\nDid we say that you can play with uChip? :)\nAntistatic IC tube + packaging foam + RGB LED strip + uChip = light saber!\nRecycle your empty bottles! Use two motors, one RF receiver and uChip and make an RC boat!\nSimple parking sonar. No more dents on your car :)\nDual role USB relay board: 1) as USB powered device (controlled with a PC), 2) as a USB host (connected to a USB 3G dongle to receive SMS commands)\nElectrostatiCAT: measure electrification when you pet your cat!\nSpecifications\nCPU: 32-bit Cortex M0+ ATSAMD21-series running at 48 MHz (Arduino Zero Compatible)\nFLASH: 256 kB (248 kB due to integrated bootloader).\nRAM: 32 kB, zero wait states.\nPowered via USB or externally (3.3V to 5V).\nIntegrated 500-mA boost and 1-A buck converters and automatic power switching circuitry. \nEach converter can also be individually turned off, e.g. if you want to force power draw exclusively from external pins (self-powered device), or if you want to turn off an external USB device connected with a micro A cable.\nWhen powered through the USB port, the output voltage on the power pins can be selected via software to be either 3.3V or the USB voltage (typically 5V +/- 10%).\n Specification update: pin 15 can be configured (via SMD jumper) as an additional 3.3V auxiliary output @100mA when pin 16 is 5V (either as input or output). By default pin 15 is a regular I/O. If this feature is not used, 5/3.3V (at up to 1A) are still available on pin 16.\n14 I/O pins (2 of them can be used to connect an external SWD programmer/debugger) and 2 power pins (VCC and GND).\nStatus LED (it can be turned on/off via software using a single instruction).\nMulti function push button for reset/program.\n8 12-bit ADC inputs. (specification updated! Before there were only 7 ADC inputs!) \n10-bit DAC output.\n14 external interrupt input pins.\nUp to 5 serials between SPI, I2C and UART.\nI2S port for audio decoders such as  UDA1334A.\n13 PWM pins.\nSize: 28.5 mm x 10.16 mm (1.1 \u201c x 0.40 \u201c), including USB port protrusions (27.23 mm x 10.16 mm excluding USB)\n4-layer board for improved noise performance.\nStandards narrow-DIP footprint: 0.3\u201d (7.62 mm) row spacing, 0.1\u201d (2.54) pin spacing.\nPinout standard logic CMOS compatible: power and GND are on pin 16 and 8, so you can also emulate some 16 pin CMOS ICs (4000 and 74HC series)! \nCan be programmed in C/C++, asm, and also CircuitPython!\nLow cost! (13.6\u20ac per board for 10 pieces or 20\u20ac/board! Cost includes shipping on many countries!).\nLet\u2019s go straight to the comparison with Arduino Uno!\nNote! The comparison now shows the new number of ADC inputs. Now they are 8, instead of 7!\nPinout Diagram\nHere is the current version of the pinout! The blue columns indicate which port pin is currently connected. For more details about the exact pin function, you can refer to the SAMD21 datasheet.\nSize matters!\nuChip is really small.  How small? Judge for yourself!\nuChip has the same pin spacing of a 16-pin DIP package and can be mounted in a 16-pin DIP socket! uChip is much smaller than ATMEGA328P! (see comparison on the right)\nuChip fits a standard 0.3\u201d 16-DIP socket, and it is only slightly longer than a 16-pin DIP IC, just the length required by the USB micro connector! \nOverall, this makes uChip about the same size of a narrow-body 20-pin DIP IC, and much smaller than the ATMEGA328, which powers  Arduino Uno  boards!  \nuChip is breadboard compatible, and its 0.3\u201d row spacing perfectly matches the center gap reserved for narrow-body DIP packages. Unlike other wider dev-boards, uChip leaves more holes for your connections!\nSmall. Yet powerful!\nDespite its size, uChip has the same heart of Arduino Zero, a 48 MHz Cortex M0+. This alone already provides a nice raw-power upgrade with respect to an Arduino Uno. How much? Check the results about the same bubble sort algorithm running on the Arduino and on uChip! uChip is more than 5.7 times faster!\nBubble sort comparison between Arduino Uno (ATMEGA328P) and uChip (ATSAMD21).\nFurthermore, the Event System, DMA and Bus Matrix boost the performance of the Cortex M0+ by offloading some repetitive tasks such as memory<->peripheral, memory<->memory transfers, and peripheral to peripheral communications. These features open the door to incredible applications! Take a look at the examples shown before,  to get a glimpse of  what uChip is capable of!\nOne port, four functions\nThe USB port has four main functions:\n1 - Programming port.\n2 - USB Device port.\n3 - USB Host port.\n4 - Power supply port.\nDid we say four? Well we meant five!\n5 - If you don\u2019t need USB, two additional pins are available on D+/D-! These pins can be configured as a serial port, or GPIO or PWM outputs!\nIntegrated switching power supplies\nUnlike many other small low cost Arduino Dev Boards, uChip integrates powerful high-efficiency boost and buck regulators. \nThe boost regulator is used to power an external USB device connected to uChip (operating in host mode).  It provides a maximum current of 500mA, even when the input voltage is as low as 3.3V!\nThe buck regulator allows to power uChip and the external circuitry, when uChip is connected to a PC/Mac USB port or to a USB power supply. The output voltage between pin 16 (VEXT) and 8 (GND) can be software selected (3.3V or 5V*), and the output current of 1A will grant a good headroom for many applications!\n *Actual voltage will depend on the USB port voltage uChip is connected to! \nIoT Enabled! \nWith plenty of communication peripherals, its low stand-by/run current consumption (270 uA in standby when powered externally) and its small size, uChip is your ideal companion for IoT and battery-powered applications!\nEasy to use!  \nuChip is Arduino compatible and we already integrated its variant in the Arduino IDE. We also developed uChip-specific libraries, which handle power supply management, a better USB host support and VGA output.\nTo program:\nconnect your uChip to the PC/Mac using a micro B USB cable.\nPress twice the pushbutton. \nNow, you just need to upload your code through the Arduino or your favorite IDE (a simple guide on how to integrate uChip with Atmel Studio 7, IAR and Keil will be released after the end of the campaign).\nThat\u2019s it!\nuChip can be also programmed with any serial wire debug (SWD) programmer/debugger. This adds flexibility and allows you to easily and quickly debug your programs!\nReady!\nuChip features the same ATSAMD21 series used on Arduino Zero. We connected the most important pins, so that most of the sketches will run unmodified on uChip!\nIn most cases, there is no need for many external components, such as voltage regulators. Power supply voltage conversion between 3.3V to 5V or 5V to 3.3V is performed internally. \nProgram it in C, C++, asm or python!\nuChip can be programmed using various languages. uChip supports also Adafruit's CircuitPhyton!\nYes, uChip can even emulate some digital logic ICs!\nYou need a 74HC191, or a 74HC138 or other digital CMOS ICs but you don\u2019t have a spare one? Well, you can just emulate it using uChip! The VDD-GND pins are placed on pins 16 and 8 respectively!\nuChip emulating a 74HC191, clocked by a 555 timer.\nOpen Source!\nThe project will be open-source, included all the examples we showed here! The schematics, gerbers, as well as sources will be released online, to allow you and the community to develop shields, applications, projects, and, why not, improve it!\nProject Status\nFirst and second run of prototypes: Done!\nArduino Integration: Done!\nEnhanced USB, VGA, and power management libraries: Done!\nFirst examples: Done!\nBuild other examples, shields: in progress! (we are open to your suggestions!) \nFund the first production run: the campaign is ongoing! Here we need your help! \nWhy Kickstarter?  \nInitially, we wanted a small board to be included in our private projects. But we could not find any with integrated power supplies, with good CPU performance, and in a standard 0.3\u201d 16 dual-in-line package, so that it could be easily used on breadboards and prototyping boards (using cheap 16-pin IC sockets).\nSo we decided we were going to make it for us, and created the first prototypes. We saw that they were actually very cool! \nWe improved them and made prototypes again. And we saw that they were even cooler! So we thought of making uChip available for everyone!\nIn fact, we believe that uChip would bring significant benefits to the community: smaller cost, smaller size, yet easy to use for everyone, without even requiring a soldering iron. \nFully working prototypes are already here, and, while you are reading, we are developing more and more application examples, shields, etc. \nHowever, to make uChip affordable for everyone, we need your help! That\u2019s why we are here on Kickstarter!\nYou can help in several ways:\nThe most obvious. Contribute to the campaign, become a backer!\nShare this kickstarter campaign to your friends.\nLast, but not least, create new applications with uChip, and share with us your expertise, your comments and criticism. We always try to learn from our mistakes! \nExpected Timeline\nThe following will be continuously updated as the  campaign is going on!\nLet\u2019s develop a community!\nWe want to create and grow an extraordinary community, which will provide ideas and feedback both during and after the campaign! \nWhat shields would you like? Do you want special soldermask colors? Any other suggestions?\nRewards, shipping, etc.\nYes, shipping is a hassle that has a huge impact on pricing, especially when dealing with low-cost devices. That\u2019s why we have several perks, with a different number of uChip boards. If you want to just contribute to the campaign, you can do it for as low as 1\u20ac. By doing this, you\u2019ll also receive the campaign updates! (do not worry! You can always opt out from the mailing list!).\nThe regular rewards are:\nWhile you can order just as few as one uChip, we suggest to get more than one. In this way, the price per board will be substantially lower, because there will be just one shipment.  It might be a good idea if you and your friends joined your forces and get more uChip boards with one shipment! There is also a special early arrival reward, for those who cannot wait for their own uChip!\nEarly prototype and Supporter's Pack. \nThis pledge is for those who really want uChip to become a reality! You'll get an early prototype too, with its documentation! This is in very limited quantity, and it contains:\nOne of the first prototypes of uChip\nThe hand-held console, with the display and the other components (excluding uChip)\nThe VGA-Tetrix example, with all the components (excluding uChip)\nThe giant uChip Pack (100 uChip boards).\nThe first three items will be shipped with DHL the first week of May.\nThe giant uChip Pack will be shipped on October, with DHL.\nSince the number of early prototypes is very limited, we can provide the supporter pack only to three backers!\nPlease note that the prototypes do not include all the updates, and their pinout is as follows:\nP1: PA16 (final will have PA06 too) \nP2: PA8 \nP3: PA10 \nP4: PA09 \nP5: PA11 \nP6: PA17  \nP7: PA18 \nP8: GND \nP9: PA19 \nP10: PA22 \nP11: PA23 \nP12: PA31 \nP13: PA30 (final will have PA03 too) \nP14: PA02 and PA03 (final will have only PA02) \nP15: PA04 and PA05 (final will have only PA03 and PA04, and an additional jumper to force 3.3V the additional auxiliary 100mA output) \nP16: VDD I/O\nHeaders: yes/no ?\nFor all the rewards, you can choose your uChip with or without soldered headers, at no additional cost! The backer survey, which will be sent at the end of the campaign, will allow you to specify this!\nuChip with headers can be mounted on a breadboard, soldered directly on a PCB, like a regular IC or mounted on a socket. \nuChip without headers is useful if you want to have other kind of connectors (machined contacts, female connectors, etc.) or if your application is very space constrained and you need a very thin solution: you can directly solder the wires in the holes.\nIf you decide to get the uChip without headers, these will be provided in the same package, so that you can later decide to solder them by yourself!\nHow we will manage funding\nOur goal is to produce enough boards to cut costs and make them affordable, at the prices they are listed in the campaign.\nUnfortunately, there are some expenditures that we cannot avoid:\nKickstarter and payment processing fees (about 5% + 3%). These are applied on the shipping fees too.\nShipping and packaging fees. Yes, even the most basic shipping options have a strong impact on low-cost devices such as uChip. We have multiple uChip perks, which allow to dilute the shipping fees on more than one uChip!\nTaxes.\nTo these expenditures, we must of course add the cost of uChip itself, i.e. components, PCB fabrication, programming, testing and assembly. \nFinally, we considered some headroom in the costs of uChip and shipping, to account for EUR/USD rate variation (manufacturers and shipping services are paid in USD) or component price variation (for instance if we need to choose an alternate part for some items which went currently out of stock).  In addition, to take into account the possibility of defective parts, the order quantity must be increased accordingly. \nWhat happens if the campaign is successfully funded?\nOnce we receive the funding from Kickstarter, we proceed immediately with the order of the first production run. Before this, please consider that, under Kickstarter\u2019s terms, funding will be collected and sent only 14 days after the campaign has ended.

He loves electronics, programming (especially C and asm), DIY and design optimization. He is also one of the members of next-hack.com crew.  Ah, yes, you might think that we applied a grayscale filter to his picture. Wrong, he is actually grayscale and, to save on bits per pixel, he lives in a grayscale planet too.\nAntonio Rizzo is an Electronics enthusiast. He brought significant improvements to uChip.  Antonio loves DIY projects and is an RC hobbyist; he builds both hardware, firmware and software for his projects making use of the huge knowledge available on the net (despite being himself not very \u201csocial\u201d on the internet). He is grayscale too.\n  Credits\nVideo Background Music: Our Inspiring Corporate by Redafs.com, Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License.\nThe graphics of the platform game is from the Sunny Land Tiles free asset by Luis Zuno @ansimuz. \nWe also would like to thanks Franco Gobbo from next-hack, for his support and for creating the logo of uChip!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nuChip already works!

Buy a kit and show your kids they can make magic, or put \"The Exhibit\" on display and stun visitors with interactive wizardry. You can even complete one of our kits and sell it!\nOur animation designs are free to download and 3D-print, or perhaps you will create your own animations?\n4-Mation is the ultimate, interactive, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) display piece.\n** Please read the detailed reward tier descriptions under the Design section. Kits in the \"Walnut Kit\" tier and lower are for backers who will 3D-print the animations themselves. \nEverybody loves 4-Mation.  \nWe took it to a local school, they loved it. We took it to New York MakerFaire, Denver MakerFaire, and UK MakerFaire. They loved it, and gave us a bunch of blue ribbons. We took it to Building Bloqs makerspace (buildingbloqs.com) and the professional makers there loved it too!\nMaking the Electronics\nWe're not making 100's of 4-Mations so there's no point outsourcing production. We're making them on site in Suffolk. Here's a video overview of how we make the electronics.\nGIFS !!\nA couple of Marvellous minifigs! on a LEGO-compatible carousel\nIn the Press\nsome of the websites we've been featured on\nIf you would like to write about 4-Mation too our press kit is here: https://bit.ly/2PwQbsk\nWe're also on Make's youtube channel, who interviewed us at Denver MakerFaire last year. In this video Kevin attempts to explain what a 3D Zoetrope is and how it works. There's also another video near the bottom of the page we made just to explain how 3D Zoetropes work.\nWhat is this \"Animation Multiplexing\" you speak of?\nIn this video we try to explain how we fit 72 frames of animation story into a 20 frame loop. We've been working on this explanation for a long time, we know we could still do better, but hopefully it makes sense to some of you! or perhaps you just enjoy this little paradox :)\nThe Interactive 3D Zoetrope: app control\nYou can control the animation speed, brightness and colour from the 4-Mation app. It's on the Android play store now - it's still in beta, but is fully functional. iOS version is coming in 2019.\nNote the app is purely a wifi remote control for the machine control board. There is no cloud service and no data being gathered here!\nOf course a phone or tablet is not necessary, since there's also a context sensitive smart touch button. Short touches start and stop the machine. A long touch while it's already running will engage \"disco mode\" where the RGB LEDs randomly cycle colour. A second long touch will reset back to white. A long touch while the machine is stopped will engage slow start up mode; the carousel RPM gradually increases until the touch ends. \nFor public display, you might like to put 4-Mation behind glass and mount a tablet in front running the 4-Mation app for visitors to interact with. \nFor those installing 4-Mation as an exhibit, the Exhibit reward tier offers an optional PIR motion sensor (Passive InfraRed - as used by motion sensing security lights) instead of the smart touch button. This will automatically start and stop the animation depending on visitor presence. The sensor comes with a 2m cable allowing for flexible installation.\nAlso the app has an \"exhibit\" mode where any changes to speed, colour, brightness will be set back to standard after a configurable time period. Visitors can interact with the animation as they please, then shortly after, the settings will be reverted for the next set of viewers. \nMultiple machines can be controlled from the app; each 4-Mation has its own name and you can select which machine you're operating from the \"connected-to\" drop-down. \nDesign\n4-Mation has been design iterated for over a year to arrive at this beautiful and simple marriage of form and function. Machined walnut is bolted together with stainless steel and brass.\nAlternatively there's a more affordable laser cut plywood (laser-ply) version with a design accentuating curves.\nIn the gif below we flip 4-Mation on its side and expose the operational guts of the machine - which you can't normally see - and yet as it shows, everything is accessible. The design is simplicity itself, and totally modular. Every part up to and including each custom cable is easily replaced, although the motor is the only moving part that might need maintenance.\nIn this GIF we reprogrammed the LEDs to do a super slow flash for the camera, Red, Green, then Blue, just because it looks cool. \nNote this frame is in oak, not walnut as above. \nWe performed multiple endurance-torture tests running the motor and strobes 24/7 for over 6 weeks. That's more than 1000 hours continuous operation per machine without issue. We only expect customers using machines in a public display setting to be concerned with maintenance; as the one moving part, the motor, will eventually need replacing after some thousands of hours, but it's common and affordable. After the 12 month warranty, you'll be able to get it from us, or source it locally.\nThis is where a PIR motion sensor can be useful for 4-Mations employed as exhibits, which might operate more than 2000 hours in one year. If the machine automatically shuts off when no-one is around, it will significantly extend the life of the motor. \nDimensions\nFlat pack kit All rewards come flat packed, except the Exhibit model which ships an assembled machine, and a finished animation carousel separately. This is because an assembled animation needs special protection for shipping. \nFrame assembly is easy. Here Ana puts one together in under 10 minutes in a single take, on her first attempt, after being shown how it goes together just once. Maybe Ana is a closet Ikea nerd, but it also reflects the simplicity of the design.\nWe will be producing a complete set of detailed assembly instruction videos.\nReward Tiers\nUber DIY: \u00a310 Your choice of carousel cover from our 3 animations. You are a maker extraordinaire (or perhaps you just want a curious wall poster :) and will be designing and building your own strobe machine, but you're not an artist/animator, so you download one of our animations. You'll still need our physical carousel cover sheet though, since we are not making the 2D character position layout designs public. \nNote the markings in the zoom section - these are precise markings for where to glue down the animation characters, in this case the clear support stalks for the fish. \nCarousel covers are 32.5cm in diameter and ship in a poster roll.\nSuper DIY: Early Bird \u00a3115, Standard \u00a3155 Everything you need to make a 4-Mation 3D Zoetrope, except the frame and an animation. Download the CAD files to laser cut your own frame and carousel at your local makerspace. Also download the files to 3D print your own animation and carousel hub.\nInventory: Control and power-regulation board, smart touch button, 4 LED panels with 6 x 9Watt RGB LEDs per panel (3W/channel from true 45mil chips) and the LED hub panel. 7 custom cables to connect everything. A 24V universal power supply with a UK, EU or US plug (other types will need a plug adaptor). Quiet 12V 100 RPM worm gear motor with 2860 count encoder. Silicone mount for motor, metal bracket, and metal hub with carousel mounting screws. Hex key to lock metal hub. Silicone interface to mount carousel hub to metal motor hub, carousel hub screws and nuts, 3 brass thumb nuts in case you need to secure the carousel, and of course your choice of colour-printed carousel cover to match whichever animation you choose to download for printing.\nLaser Ply Kit: Early Bird \u00a3175, Standard \u00a3220 Everything from the Super DIY Kit, integrated into pre-assembled laser cut plywood (laser-ply) cross-pieces with laser-ply struts and strut locks to make the frame, and a laser-ply carousel kit which includes a cast polyurethane carousel hub. All flat packed. \nInventory: Super DIY kit, pre-assembled laser-ply cross-pieces, 8 laser-ply frame struts, 4 laser-ply frame strut lock pieces, 8 laser-ply carousel segments, cast polyurethane carousel hub.\nWalnut Kit: Early Bird \u00a3295, Standard \u00a3345 Similar to the laser-ply kit,  but the plywood frame is replaced with stainless steel, brass and beautiful dark-grained walnut finished in rich hardwax oil, all packaged in a premium, branded box worthy of an unboxing video!\nInventory: Super DIY kit, pre-assembled walnut cross-pieces, 10mm stainless steel LED wiring conduit, 6 x 6mm stainless steel frame struts, 6 galvanised steel tie bars, and 16 brass thumb nuts, 8 laser-ply carousel segments, cast polyurethane carousel hub.\nWalnut Kit with frogs resin kit, or LEGO-compatible carousel: Early Bird \u00a3385, Standard \u00a3445 Walnut kit plus an un-assembled coloured resin frogs animation kit. The frogs are already green, you will just need to paint the eyes, and glue them to the marked positions on the carousel cover (not pictured).\nNote this animation resin kit does not include 3D lilies and lily pads, they will be part of a new animated 2D carousel cover design. Like the sea-floor animation on the fish carousel.\nAlternatively you can choose the LEGO-compatible carousel and let your imagination run wild with LEGO or other compatible bricks. The LEGO-compatible carousel has 16 frames instead of 20, this is to allow room in each frame for mini-figure sized characters to interact.\nThe early bird reward for this tier will not ship before Christmas, our prototype moulds are working perfectly, but now we need to scale them out to production. \nInventory: Walnut Kit, and either 8 interlocking LEGO-compatible carousel segments in cast polyurethane to make a LEGO-compatible carousel, OR 39 coloured green, but unpainted, cast polyurethane frogs to make a frogs animation, together with a carousel cover marking the precise positions for the frogs, and incorporating a new 2D animation for the lily flowers and pads.\nThe Exhibit: Early Bird \u00a31500, Standard \u00a31900 An assembled walnut machine, plus a completed and painted animation of your choice (excluding the marvellous LEGO-compatible one).\nYou may elect to replace the standard smart touch button with a PIR motion sensor if you intend to install your 4-Mation as an exhibit. The sensor will automatically start and stop the animation as it detects visitors around the exhibit. The sensor cable is 2m allowing for flexible installation.\nWe updated the fish animation construction to withstand the slings and arrows of outrageous shipping fortune (see our video below) but we haven't yet done the same for frogs or pyramids. You can still select a different animation for an early bird pledge, and we will do our best, but can only commit to Christmas shipping for the fish animation.\nAlso note that unlike the un-assembled resin kit frogs tier, if you chose the frogs animation in this tier, it will come exactly as shown in the videos and the picture above; fully painted and with 3D lilies and lily pads.\nInventory: Assembled walnut frame machine (everything in Walnut Kit tier), assembled painted animation, ships in separate boxes.\nShipping \nWe're using DHL worldwide express, and all frame kits will ship in double boxes with double walled cardboard. The completed animation tier will ship the animation carousel separately in specially designed packaging. You will want to be certain that something so valuable arrives safely, so we made a packaging drop test video for you with crash test dummy fish.\nDownload STLs and DXFs for the Animations, LEGO-compatible carousel, and laser-ply frame.\nOur animations are freely downloadable for you to print on your own 3D printer, or have someone else print them for you, for example on 3DHubs.com, or even Shapeways. \nWe use a Form2 resin printer, and we expect most resin printers will work fine. It seems unlikely that filament printers could print the Fish or Frogs animations, but it might be possible to print Snakes on a filament printer. The LEGO-compatible carousel should print fine on filament printers, we'll be posting pictures soon.\nWe are holding on to the files for the carousel covers with the markings for gluing the parts down, which will help us protect the animation IP at least until the rewards ship.\nHaving said that, printing and painting animations is not really the business we want to be in (which is why the Exhibit tier is limited) we want to sell 4-Mation kits. So if you want to buy a 4-Mation kit, print your own animation and then sell the assembled machine and animation, we couldn't be happier:)\nThingiverse CAD file links\nFish animation: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3025801 STLs and Formlabs print files.\nPyramids animation: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3053875  STLs and Formlabs print files.\nLEGO-compatible Carousel: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3057509 STL.

After a dozen outrageous quotes for the custom cabling required we invested in wire processing machines from China. \nYou mentioned a \"Big CNC\" at the Building Bloqs maker space. What's that and what's it for? \nhttp://buildingbloqs.com/cncrouter\nIt's a big router (the Biesse Rover J FT 1530)  that we'll use to carve the walnut frames. It has an automatic tool changer and a strong vacuum table - perfect for machining loads of 4-Mation frame sets in a day. It's expensive though, so we need enough orders to set up the production run, this is why our funding target is \u00a38,000.\nBefore you go - curious how a 3D Zoetrope actually works? \nSo how does a 3D Zoetrope work? We hired a global shutter camera to capture 4-Mation running in slow motion with the strobes on. We slow down the action so you can see how 3D zoetropes are just like flip-books. \nLEGO is a trademark of the LEGO Group, which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this web site.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe design is production ready, we're doing the custom cables in-house - and are already expert, the CNC machining and laser cutting happens at Building Bloqs and we have selected a Chinese PCB manufacturer, using boards from them in all our recent prototypes.

We listen to feedback closely.\nLastly, why Proxmark3 Rdv4.0 ? We believe in working on the current Proxmark3 Rdv4.0 with future expansion on hardware and also on the accessories with the option of using contact card too.\nHistory  \nThe Proxmark3 is a powerful general purpose RFID test instrument originally designed by Jonathan Westhues to snoop, listen and emulate everything from Low Frequency (125kHz) to High Frequency (13.56MHz) tags.\nThe Proxmark is the only research and development platform targeting NFC and RFID that is capable of both transmitting and receiving while meeting the timing requirements of most proximity protocols. The Proxmark also provides full control over the radio layer in addition to software support for several higher-level protocols\nFor more details on the Proxmark3 project check out the Proxmark3 Wiki.\nAbout Proxmark3 Rdv4.0 Development Team: \nProxGrind has been in Shenzhen for a long 5 years and has been familiar with the manufacturing stage in China. \nWith his expertise and the rest of the team, we were all able to get the product at ultra-low cost with efficient production; high quality and performance.\nThe concept of our team on this product: To bring proxmark3 back to a development tool. No pricy pricing on the PCB assembly so people can feel free to build on it with a lot of kits to help you with it. All the upgrades and improvements are compatible with all versions of the firmware and in addition, we added an external flash and smart card reader that will not interfere with the operation of the older firmware. \nOur goal is to continue with the Proxmark3 idea of having it as an open source while embedding new technologies and ideas to the well-known Proxmark3 platform. \nWhat\u2019s coming new on the Rdv4.0 \nMajor upgrades:\n1) Highly customizable / detectable antennas \n2) \u201cFull\u201d Eco-System with Contact and Contactless Analyze / Research \n3) Multifunction Multiplexing Interface \nSupport external battery \nSupport external active high power antenna\nSupport Bluetooth UART Interface \nMinor Upgrades  \nCompact  \nHigh Antenna Power  \nSleek Design  \nOnboard 2Mbit / 256Kb Memory for storing data \nDesigned casing\nTechnical Specifications\nCPU - SAM7S512\nStorage - External 2MBits / 256Kb SPI flash\nHardware Interface \u2013\nHf antenna\nLf antenna\nSmart card interface\nMulti-function expansion port\nUSB2.0\nUser Interface \u2013\n4 mode LEDs\n4 power LEDs\nUser button\nWeight \u2013 35grams\nHeight \u2013 87mm(91mm including loop)\nWidth \u2013 54mm\nThickness \u2013 10mm\nLow frequency voltages as high as 65V.

This allows you to map functions in any program to TouchPad's keys, speeding up your workflow. TouchPad can be used with programs ranging from word processing to advanced design software. TouchPad allows key customisation by hand or digitally, and uses a text editor based programmer for quick shortcut setup.\nWhat could you do with TouchPad?\nTouchPad's 36 capacitive keys can each be assigned a series of five key presses using the built-in programming mode. Alternatively, users familiar with Arduino can combine keyboard, mouse, MIDI or serial functions using the Arduino IDE.\nWhat sets TouchPad apart from other macro keyboard solutions is the ability to quickly customise the keys to suit the task at hand.  Combining capacitive touch with haptic feedback produces the feel of a mechanical keyboard but on a flat surface, allowing the use of our unique overlay system.  Transparent overlays can be quickly swapped to match the current command set. TouchPad has five command sets, enabling a total of 180 customisable functions that you can tailor to five different applications.\n Designed for Portability and Compatibility\nTouchPad's light and slim design means it can be taken anywhere (TouchPad is a bare PCB so it is advised to transport it with care).  The lack of need for specific drivers or software, in combination with its compatibility across Windows, Mac and Linux, makes it a flexible tool for any application.\nTouchPad provides 36 keys and 180 functions in a compact layout.\nYour customised setup is stored within TouchPad. This means TouchPad operates the same wherever you go, whatever device you are using.\nWindows, Mac, Linux compatible.\nCustomisable and Versatile\nQuickly switch between applications by swapping the transparent overlays. Overlays are customisable in the following ways:\nDrawing \u2014 Use the included permanent marker to customise one of the five included transparent overlays so that each key reflects its functionality.  If you only want to make use of one command set, draw straight on TouchPad itself.\nPrinting \u2014 Use the digital template provided to design and print an overlay matching your specific application.  This requires some additional items not included in the TouchPad kit: laser/inkjet printable transparencies, a printer, scissors and a standard hole-punch.\nQuickly swap between setups.\nCustom overlays can easily be aligned to TouchPad's keys using the location posts.  The location posts are separated to conform with the ISO-838 size of standard hole-punches.  The location posts can be adjusted to ensure perfect alignment of custom overlays. \nWhether you choose to draw your overlays or design them digitally, the process is quick and straightforward.  Designing digitally consists of four steps: design, print, cut and hole-punch.\nCreate beautiful custom overlays.\nOne overlay designates 36 keys at once without the need to label keys individually and make permanent aesthetic changes to your keyboard. \nOverlay designed for use with CAD software.\nBlank overlays can be cleaned and reused using permanent marker remover.  If you need more blank overlays than are provided, print the blank template onto transparency film, cut and hole-punch.  \nSleek Industrial Design\nTouchPad's unique design belongs on everyone's desk.  Four rubber feet keep TouchPad in place during use.\nTouchPad has a bare PCB design.\nProgrammable Anywhere\nTouchPad does not require any special software or drivers to enable the basic functionality.  The basic functionality allows up to 5 key presses to be assigned to each key including letters, numbers, symbols and modifiers, great for keyboard shortcuts.  Several delay and repeat functions are also available (1mS, 10mS, 100mS, 1s, 5s, 10s and 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 10x, 20x).  You can also program TouchPads key LEDs (except the bottom row which is predefined) to a pattern matching your command set, this will be displayed when you switch command set.\nUsing the portable On The Go programming mode involves opening any basic text editor, touching and swiping on TouchPad, and interacting with the user interface typed out by TouchPad. The On The Go programming mode has many advantages:\nAdministrator rights are not an issue for office users.\nNo need for specific drivers or software.\nCompatibility is ensured, as long as USB keyboards are supported.\nProgram basic functionality On The Go\n The 6x6 grid typed out corresponds to TouchPad's 36 keys, by pressing the corresponding key on TouchPad functionality can be assigned to keys.  Below is a detailed programming tutorial:\nPlease note: \nThe speed TouchPad can type out its programming interface may depend on your device/operating system.  TouchPad has a feature built in to slow down the text output if your device can't keep up.  Most devices work at the speed shown above but this is not guaranteed.\nThis programming mode is entered by touching and swiping down on TouchPad.  This mode can only be entered before any key presses occur to prevent accidental swipes typing all this information.  To enter this mode after key presses have occurred you must remove and re-apply power to TouchPad.\nArduino-Compatible\nTouchPad is integrated with the Arduino development environment, meaning you can easily edit the Open-Source firmware and upload it to TouchPad.  This allows you to assign snippets of code to each key, giving you the ability to assign longer key sequences or other functionality to keys.\nOpen-Source firmware.\nUsing the Arduino IDE add keyboard, mouse, MIDI, serial or any other Arduino (32u4) compatible function to any key. \nProgram any functionality with Arduino.\nArduino is easy to use software, with the setup process documented in the user manual and all necessary files provided.\nPlease note:\nThe standard firmware leaves around 10KB free for these modifications, if you do not require the On The Go programmer this can be increased.\nOther than basic documentation, Arduino programming support is not provided. Although, Arduino is very well supported online.\nTechnology\nSpecification\nPlease note:  \nTouchPad is primarily designed as a UK keyboard.  The full range of key functionality above is available when TouchPad is defined as a UK keyboard in your operating system (the symbols above will vary based on your operating system).  If TouchPad is defined as a US keyboard in your operating system then one key will be repeated meaning you have 2 less symbols, 1 less key.  TouchPad will work with other language setups however the exact output is not defined here.  \nThe modifier key GUI is operating system dependent.  It is the windows key for Windows and command key for mac.\nRewards\nTouchPad Coasters:\n 1x TouchPad PCB from a prototype run or the final prouction run.

Challenges that we must still overcome to deliver your TouchPad to you are mainly logistical. This means in a worst case scenario, you might have to wait a little longer for your TouchPad to arrive than expected. These challenges involve finalising the source code, sourcing parts, coordinating assembly and programming the boards, packaging the final product and finally, shipping. \n\nSource Code: All of the TouchPad's basic functionality is already implemented and fully functional. All that is left to do now is finalise the user interface and find any bugs that may have gone unnoticed. \n\nSourcing Parts: With the volumes we are expecting to be producing, this should not be difficult. TouchPad uses entirely off-the-shelf components meaning lead times are minimal. If the campaign significantly exceeds its target, this could cause the delivery date to be later.\n\nAssembly and Programming: We are talking to manufacturers who are confident that they can produce TouchPad in the quantities we are expecting. Once again, if pledges significantly exceed the goal, it is possible delays may occur. Potential reasons for delay could be incorrect assembly leading to boards having to be reworked, or bugs being found in the firmware requiring boards to be reprogrammed. All resolvable problems, although at the cost of time. \n\nPackaging: We already have a good idea of how the products will ship so no problems here.\n\nShipping: Fortunately TouchPads are light and small making this part a little easier. We also have a good idea of the services we will be using so we don't expect issues to arise here.\n\nLike all hardware projects things can go wrong, but we are committed to getting the finished TouchPads to you as close to the expected date as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "TouchPad Donation", "descp": "Make a donation towards the TouchPad project, your name will be listed on the TouchPad website and embedded in the source code.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "1x TouchPad Coaster", "descp": "Receive an unpopulated TouchPad circuit board, either from the production run or a prototype run.

Phone charging has become one of the most essential task in everyday life, so put a little effort & investment on it, would results huge happiness.\nVoltBot is designed to improve charging experience.\nPLAY\n\nWhen your adapter is closer to you, your data cable can reach further. This will ensure that your devices can stay within a comfortable operation zone.\nWhat is a good charging experience? You can move the phone and operate it freely while charging.\nTraditional charger have to be plugged into power socket, and power socket carrys AC electricity, which is dangerous to humen. It results that people have to reach out for a charger, but a charger never reach out for people.\nThe DC power which VoltBot use, is completely safe, which means abolutely NO shock harzard. Our creator will perform eating it in the video at the bottom of this page. No longer need to keep distance from chargers.\nOvernight charging on bed? It might be a good news for those who likes to play phone before falling asleep.  \n1. LCD \nVoltBot provides a visual charging experience:\nDisplay dynamic charging voltage & current. \nDisplay real-time charging speed(power circle). \nDisplay quick charging state. \nDisplay history data, curve.\nIt is exciting to watch electricity streaming into your devices. Look into the details of charging.\n2. APP \nVoltBot has an APP. VoltBot will broadcast a WiFi hotspot named 'VoltBot', the phone can join the hotspot and talk to VoltBot with APP.\nWith APP, curves of charging current can be observed, with which the actual battery capacity can be calculated. \nVoltBot consists of 4 charging engines, providing 4 independent charging channels. Each channel can be matched to the best quick charge protocol. With quick charge, VoltBot can accelerate charging speed up to 70~75%.\nVoltBot supports quick charging protocols, including QC3.0/QC2.0, FCP, AFC, SFCP, Apple 2.4A, BC1.2, PumpExpress and samsung 2A.\nEstimate speed ups: (examples, not all listed)\niPhone6+/6s+/7/8/X can speed up 70% than small white charger. \niPhone6s can speed up 30% than original charger. \nAndroid devices have too many types, please refer to manufacture's manuals.\nFull support of Android devices. \nFull support of Apple devices.\nFull support of other phones, such as BlackBerry, Moto, HTC, Nokia and Windows Phone.\nFull support of other USB devices, such as PAD, PDA, mp3, earphone, bracelet, and etc.\nHow many adapters have you collected? 10? 20? Hmm...  \nYou'll no longer need to count, because VoltBot can replace them all. VoltBot can give you any voltage through 2.5V~12V, and this ability even ensures VoltBot a good tool to conduct physics experiment.\nVoltBot can be phone charger or pad charger.\n VoltBot can also be adapter of wireless router.\nVoltBot can connect to cigar-lighter plug-in, directly utilizing power generated by car.\nThe benefits of having charger near bed is obvious. Because messages and calls arrive now and then, if we do overnight charging near bed, it would be easier for us to reach out for phone.\nThere are some advantageous factors of VoltBot to be placed near bed. \nVoltBot equipped environmental light sensor to auto adjust its backlight power. So its screen will go dim when you fall asleep. And a side key is implemented, you can also switch the screen on/off mannually by pressing it (same as phone). Auto-Backlight is default on. However, some people may have special tastes, wishing screen to be shining in the night. Just use the APP or web-browser, configuration interface is there.\nLeft: Auto-Backlight Off                                   Right: Auto-Backlight On\nWe also implement Auto-Cut-Off function to further protect your battery.

More and more people want there own Glow Tube Clock. But The Glow Tube has been out of production for a long time, since the demise of the soviet union. So it's hard to get a new Glow Tube now. \nToday, EleksMaker has brought an entirely new design of the RGB retro full color simulation glow tube electronic clock.\nEleksTube uses an innovative way to simulate the reality of the glow tube, which can connect your computer to change its color with your mind. And add RGB full-color discoloration function.Fully support Windows/Mac system.\nEleksTube provides a variety of choices for you, We have 4 bit black and white acrylic / 6 units bit clock ElekTube kit, and 4 bit / 6 bit bamboo material ElekTube clock suite.\nAnd creative push out single bit version EleksTube which compatible with most of the full bit EleksTube functions. Single bit version EleksTube also have acrylic version and bamboo version. \nThey all have technology black metal anodic alumina alloy base and the integrated main controller and 1600W color Tube lamp board developed by EleksMaker. Add new passion and creativity to your artistic creation.\nWhen the such idea that retro clock project produced. we feel very excited. \nOur EleksMaker Studio is a focus on the desktop CNC devices and embedded development team.We have push out several popular desktop laser engraving / drawing machine, and embedded motherboard. So we have a lot of experience of research and development in technology equipment, and we immediately decided to use our own style to make this interesting idea into products that everyone can buy.\nAlthough only having a single digit display, Tube One easily shows the time by displaying numbers one after the other. For example, 15:48pm would display as \u20181\u2026 5\u2026 4\u2026 8\u2019. This provides a very simple and natural way to read the time.\nYou can choose your favorite color in every mode. EleksTube support rainbow gradation and a variety of display modes.\nPLAY\n\nThen our hardware engineer has completed the integration of PCB main controller board, a RGB Light PCB demo version and delivered to our factory to make a early version. We tested dozens of tube pipes design production plan, and ultimately make the display design of the best effect.After hundreds of times continuous improvement and tests. Finally we push out the best version of EleksTube.\nOur software engineers began to design the EleksTube hardware driver and PC application from zero. EleksTube communication protocol, control protocol and model switch algorithm. Software engineers completed the application for Windows and then transplantation platform to Mac OS.Make the EleksTube from one of our ideas, become so gorgeous and real equipment.\nIn the future, EleksTube has Infinite species possibility. We will open source our communication protocol API, everyone can experience the joy of DIY EleksTube. Everyone can customize your EleksTube, we will constantly update the official software and firmware for EleksTube, and add new functions in further. We will release our latest research results at the EleksMaker official forum. \n Thank you for your support", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working closely and building up a strong relationship with our suppliers since the past few years. as other projects may encounter supply break problems, we have confidence to ensure stock and lead-times are within our production requirements; and ensure all the components have been testing and met the highest standard.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thanks For Your Support", "descp": "If you like EleksTube and would like to give us a little boost to help us on our way, every dollar is appreciated!

We have created a special micro application just for the voltmeter in the USB mode. It has some nice features such as: stay on top, hold results and configurable low pass filter to make displayed results more stable if needed.\nPower Source: Any of the positive voltages can be delivered independently to the breadboard power rails. They are also available on the pin header on the top of the board.\n OMNIBORD is a AVR microcontroller ISP programmer and a CORTEX (ARM) SWD programmer and debugger. No additional hardware needed.\nSerial to USB converter: (Virtual COM port). Separate COM port for the serial communication, not shared with other devices.\nOMNIBOARD has 5 GPIO / PWM ports controlled by the software in the USB & standalone modes.\n* RLC Meter - for full functionality requires the RLC Extension Board which accommodates the ZIFF socket and some passive elements. RLC Extension Board will be available after the Kickstarter campaign in our shop and as an Open Hardware project.\nThe I2C/SPI Host device is a powerful I2C & SPI bus host adapter through USB.

It comes with a custom installer. Everything is designed to make you focus on the text.\nWe believe in removing distractions, giving you a calm, focused writing space: We stripped away everything that might stand between you and how you feel so that you can write from the heart. This is how great writing gets started. We created focus mode. An experience where everything fades away. Everything but the sentence you are writing, the thought that you are expressing right now. Focus mode helps you dive into the flow.\nSentence Focus Mode\nThere's a powerful engine underneath the hood, but it never gets in your way: First, you write from the heart. Then you write with the head. There\u2019s a time to edit, and a time to shape. \nParagraph Focus Mode\niA Writer is a tool for the brave: When we are about to do something that is important, we are most likely to procrastinate. So we don\u2019t need to face others and ultimately ourselves. We procrastinate to protect ourselves. We might get rejected. We might get no response. We might find out that we are not as great as we hope to be. This is why it so hard to start with that novel, publish that blog post, make that call, or write that proposal. The only way to fight that fear is focussing. Focussing no matter what. Focussing against all odds. Focus, get started, get it done. This needs courage. There is no app or tool that will give you courage. But there are environments that encourage distractions out. And there are environments that encourage you to focus. iA Writer is not about features, bells, and whistles, it is all about getting focused and getting started.\nNight Mode\nEvery feature in iA Writer is designed to let you better focus on the text\nFolding: Expand and compress the text below a headline so you can quickly switch between a structural and a detailed view \nFolding: Click headline to show and hide chapter text\nMarkdown: Lets you quickly format your writing without having to use your mouse and break your flow.\nFocus Mode: Focus Mode dims everything but the current sentence, helping you stay in the flow. \nType Writer Mode: Have your cursor vertically centered on the screen so you always see the sentence you are working on right ahead of you. \nNight Mode: iA Writer includes an inverted \u201clight on dark\u201d mode, perfect for writing at night. \nFull-Screen Mode: Give your writing the attention it deserves\nWriting Goals: Set a goal in number of words/characters \nWriting Goals\nDuo Spaced Font: Use iA Writer Duospace, a font optimized for writing.\niA Writer Duospace Font\nMarkdown Preview: Use the preview function to see how your text renders in a separate preview \nPDF Export: Export your text as a simple PDF\nCSS Templates: If you use iA Writer for your business, you can now create custom templates for previewing, printing, and PDF export. The Windows templating logic is compatible with our existing templates.\nContent Blocks: Embed pictures files, table files, and other plain text files\u2026\n\u201ciA Writer creates a clean, simple and distraction-free writing environment for when you really need to focus on your words. It\u2019s delightful to use\"\n\"iA Writer is an example of how powerful simplicity and accessibility can be for creating commercially successful interfaces, applications or services.

On the basis of the same capacity and the same charging current, the cell with graphene composite material has much smaller internal resistance and better conductivity. Therefore, the temperature rise is lower during super fast charging, so it is safer, and cell swelling and burning will never happen.\n\n  PLAY\n\nGraphene Battery Charging Performance Test in 8C Rate ( 2500mAh cell Charging in 20A Current) \nPLAY\n\nSurface Temperature of  Graphene Battery Charging Performance Test in 8C Rate\nPLAY\n\nFinal Temperature of Graphene Battery Charging Performance Test in 8C Rate After Fully Charged. (Noted: 8C Charging Rate which means fully charged in about 7 mins)\nRoadmap Of the Graphene Composite Battery Power Pack\nThose Graphene Composite Battery cells and the related technology are provided by CellsX ( Also Called NESC in China),  they have spent more than 13 years in the Graphene Battery Cell Technology. We met each other four years ago and we were asked to made the first Graphene Power Bank with their Gen1 Battery ( 60C Charging Rate, 2400mAh) for them, and later we updated it by their Gen2 Battery (30C Charging Rate, 3500mAh) during the next two years.  However, there has two problems in the Gen 1 and Gen 2:\n1. 60C or 30C is far more enough when it is applied  in Power Pack ( 5C would be enough) . \n3. Much Smaller Capacity than actual Market requirement. \nTherefore, CellsX had spent more than 3 years to make it smaller in Charging Rate from 60C to 10C  and Higher Capacity from 2400mah to 6000mah in Same size ( Shown as below) ,  and finally, the lastest battery cell was in mass production in Jan 2017 and We used to design the Gen 3rd Power Pack. \nThe idea of Apollo Power Bank is confirmed as USB C PD technology is more and more popular, in Gen 1 or Gen 2 Power Pack, it still needed separate adapter to charge it. So we decided to make it compatible with all the USB C PD adapter.  Therefore, we designed the Apollo with USB C PD 3.0 and Called it Gen 4th. \n The Apollo is all based on the Pre-Mass Production and Feedback of our Gen 3rd (Working in it now). most problems have been solved during Gen 3rd, Apollo will be optimized based on the Gen 3rd, it is likely to have the new features including:\n1. CellsX Claimed the Version 4 Battery Cell will improve the capacity in  about 10%-15% in 3~6 months later , if it will be, Apollo will update to about 7000mah when shipment .\n2. Improving the Charging effective and lowering heating \n3. Optimized the assembly & Testing process \n4. Try the possibility to  Update the input from 60W to  87W.\nOne more thing to be noted it that, in Gen 3,  as the bolt voltage of  traditional battery cell is 3V while the Graphene Battery is capable to 2.5V, therefore, the Graphene battery is able to be charged in large current at the beginning, however, one of the chipset, is called 8805, is defined by traditional cell, it will only allowing to charge it in very small current at the beginning, therefore, in 0%-1% it will take about 3-4 min to power up while in 99%-100% will take 4mins. \nTherefore, in Gen 3, the totally charging current is about 27mins (20 min to charge about 98%). We'll try to make it possible to make the charging time in both 0-1% and 99%-100% shorter.\nELECJET TEAM have run anywatt and assisted to run C-Force, if you are Backers from those two projects, you might know that, unlike other projects, we will launch the project before it is 100% not risk in Mass Product and we will provide after-sales services to all the backers. To achieve it, we will release about Gen 3rd into the market where it is manufacturing (China)  for testing the reliability.\nRewards\nOur last campaign :  AnyWatt | A Revolutionary Multifunctional Adapter\n\nApollo Accessories Selectio\nThank you for all your supports. We\u2019re a group engineers who working with USB C for more than 5 years. Therefore, we\u2019re able to develop the innovative product like Anywatt and Apollo. Many backers sent us messages or left comments to us inquiring about the detail accessories information, as the USB C expert , we have been developing many USB C accessories, therefore, we decided to launch it advance in this Kickstarter Project and offering 20%-50% off only for our Dear Backers \uff08shipping fee is included when shipping with Apollo together\uff09, please check it as below:\n\nThere are three PD Adapters, all working with widely range of input from 100-240V , Please refer to the picture below.  \nFor 45W PD Adapter, there are only US Type and EU Type, not interchangeable plug.\nHowever, we have two types of 60W PD adapters, please check the comparison as below. Personally, if you travel often, We would recommend the PD60W001 as it is much portable than the PD60W002 and less weight, it works with Apollo perfectly.\n    If you wish to have one of those accessories, please add $xx extra to your current pledge, we will send out the Survey to everyone 3-7 working days after it ends.\n       Project Timeline\nOther Graphene Composite Battery Applications\nThe biggest features of the Graphene Composite Battery is Super Fast Charging and long cycling time.

The rules are simple. You must make contact at least once and knock your opponent over while remaining upright. We played many games, but this one had us hooked.\nEDUCATION\nThe software is written in C/C++ which, according to IEEE SPECTRUM, is the computer language most in demand by recruiting companies. The software is free for you to download, modify or completely rewrite. If the campaign is successful, we will be setting up a forum for you to share your code with the community. We recommend the Arduino development platform. Check out the S4A project too! \nHARDWARE\nT-BOTS use a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes to precisely measure the tilt. This information is used to calculate the necessary motor response for the robot to maintain its balance. There are numerous ways of achieving this; both simple and complex.\nThe T-BOT has an ultrasound distance-measuring module for eyes, providing the user with scope to write algorithms for the robots to interact with their environment or each other.\nThe bluetooth module allows you to control the robot using your smart phone or PC. See Joystick Bluetooth Commander.\nTechnical Specifications\nAcrylic Chassis \nOpen Source Arduino based Microcontroller \nMPU 6050 MEMS Module Tri-Axis Gyroscope, Tri-Axis Accelerometer \nHC-SR04 Ultrasound Module \nTB6612FNG Motor Driver Board \nHC-05 Bluetooth Module \nCREATE\nT-BOTS have been designed to inspire creativity. From designing your own T-BOT skins, inventing your own games, learning to program using the Arduino development platform or Scratch (S4A), understanding the physics of balance and dynamic stabilization, all the way up to advanced control theory. Or you can just assemble the robot, download the software and play! T-BOTS are an excellent example of a STEAM product that is genuinely fun!\n      Fluffy\n                        A T-BOT was used to help film the campaign video! The model for the dolly adaptor can be made freely available for 3D printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe design is complete, we have working prototypes, the quotes and lead times are in! We are ready to go on completion of a successful campaign. \nWhy \u00a3100k. The short answer is, economy of scale. The long answer...\nI\u2019m a scientist and I have three children. I wanted to inspire them with a project that would teach them about science, mathematics, electronics, programming, product design and even explore concepts like artificial intelligence. So I designed a robot called Robie (see below). \nWhen their friends saw Robie, they wanted to know if they could buy one. Until that point, I hadn\u2019t even considered selling robots. Robie was much too complicated to launch as a first product with no infrastructure in place. So I set out to design an endearing robot that would be affordable for as many people as possible, and so the T-BOTS were born! When setting the target I considered two things. First, I did some market research to gauge people\u2019s response to the T-BOTS. People were both intrigued and charmed by these little chaps, so I new we had a saleable product. Second, I explored options to make them affordable while maintaining the highest quality. This is where the economy of scale comes in. For example, the chassis will be laser cut and the wheels will be injection moulded. When seeking quotes I discovered the obvious - the cost drops significantly if you order in bulk. The cost per unit for a thousand was significantly less expensive than 500 and 2000 was significantly less expensive than 1000. But of course, this must be balanced against the likelihood of finding a higher number of backers. I looked at other products that had been launched on Kickstarter and thought that selling 2000 T-BOTS seemed achievable.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nInevitably, manufacturing a new product carries with it risks of delays in production due to the supply chain.

The last player standing - wins!\nSoldering Iron and Solder \nPhillips ScrewDriver \nPliers\n240mm x 240mm Matte Black Circuit Board\nTinted Screen Filter\n32 x 32 Pixel RGB LED Matrix Display (160mm x 160mm)\n8 Potentiometers (Four of which are spares) \n4 Potentiometer Knobs \nUSB Connector \nLED Matrix Ribbon Cable + Connector \nLED Matrix Power Cable + Connector \nTwo Push Buttons \nPIC 18F46K22 Microcontroller (Pre-programmed with Retroball)\nFilter Capacitor \nUSB Cable \n40 Pin 0.1\" (2.54mm) Male Headers (For those who wish to experiment with their Arduino Uno)\nFor those who want to run their own experiments, Retroball comes with a built in slot for you to plug in your own Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller. Just download the Adafruit Library and get coding! (Note: only two of the four potentiometers are available for your Arduino due to limited pins on the Arduino). Some example will be provided to get you started.\nAn Arduino is not required to make Retroball work however.\nAll source files will be made available once the campaign is completed including:\nPCB Design Files \nPIC Microcontroller Source Code \nBill of Materials \nSchematic Diagram\nArduino Sample Sketches\nA hidden menu gives you access to these extra features:\nScreen Pixel Test \nPotentiometer Controller Test \nScreensaver 1 \nScreensaver 2 \nLED Sketch (Like etch-a-sketch) \nThe Great Race \nDice\nFor those who have had anything to do with these RGB matrix displays, (perhaps you've bought one from Adafruit or Sparkfun) - you may have seen that they have an inherent problem with producing some very dim green pixel ghosting.\nI take pride in delivering a quality product and can assure you that I have worked on the Retroball code to virtually cancel out any green pixel ghosting. This means you cannot see green pixel ghosting when playing in a lit room and is barely noticeable when playing in a dark room. Either way, the game plays perfectly fine.\nPCB dimensions 24cm x 24cm (9.5\" x 9.5\")\nLED Matrix Dimensions 160mm x 160mm\nCompleted kit weight approximately 650grams (1.43lb)\nPackaged weight approximately 1.1kg (2.43lb)\nRetroball is powered by an 8-bit PIC 18F46K22 Microcontroller running at 64Mhz with 64KB of program memory and 3.8K of SRAM. \nThe LED matrix contains 1024 RGB LED's which provides a 32 x 32 pixel playing area. \nBackers are also able to use their own Arduino Uno (or compatible) microcontroller by soldering in the 0.1\" male headers (which are provided with every kit). You can then download the Adafruit library to code your own experiments. I will provide details and some sample code to get you guys started.\nDepending on your country - shipping will be through DHL, TNT, EMS or Singapore Post. All items will be sent out from my manufacturer in China which is a much more cost effective method rather than having all parts sent to me in Australia to then send out.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run numerous successful Kickstarter campaigns over the past few years and have been able to fulfil the backer rewards with quite a minimum of fuss. Retroball is very similar to my previous campaigns and since I will be using essentially the same suppliers and manufacturers, I am very confident that this campaign will run smoothly.\n\nHowever challenges do arise such as delays with components and / or PCB manufacture etc... However since I have been working on projects like this since 2007 and have dealt extensively with component and pcb manufacturing companies, along with running numerous successful Kickstarter campaigns, I am confident that if any challenges do arise, I will certainly be able to overcome them to again make this a successful campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 79 or more", "title": "One Retroball Kit", "descp": "Approx $62USD / \u20ac54EUR / \u00a348GBP\nOne Retroball kit.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["173 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 149 or more", "title": "Two Retroball Kits", "descp": "Approx $118USD / \u20ac102EUR / \u00a391GBP\nTwo Retroball kits.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 365 or more", "title": "Five Retroball Kits", "descp": "Approx $289USD / \u20ac251EUR / \u00a3222GBP\nFive Retroball kits.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 710 or more", "title": "Ten Retroball Kits", "descp": "Approx $562USD / \u20ac487EUR / \u00a3432GBP\nTen Retroball kits.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 60 or more", "title": "Early Bird Retroball Kit", "descp": "Approx $48USD / \u20ac41EUR / \u00a337GBP\nOne Retroball kit for the speedy backers!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "15 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "How are your Retroball kits going?", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nI thought i'd post an update to see how your Retroball kits are going - mainly to see if anyone is having any issues with them.\nThrough the Kickstarter campaign and selling some left over units on Tindie i've had a small handful of people who have had issues with their kits however we have been able to fix this up by troubleshooting via email.

Case is made of solid machined aluminium (polished or painted).  The tubes produces no noise or heat, uses very little energy and is the most beautiful way of displaying time. \nOur team was working on this project for almost 2 years before the final prototype was ready and fully tested. It uses a gyro sensor to display time and save power. So it will light up only when you need to display time. After tests we chosen the most powerful and compact phone battery, IN-16 Nixie tubes were the most stable working tubes. We understand that this technologies are complicated and this tubes are really hard to find. We decided to provide a lifetime warranty for watch and all it's components. And you can enjoy the Nixie tubes really warm and unusual shine and it's design will help you stand out of the crowd.\nNIWA Nixie tube watches has two very distinctive features that are bound to impress who love innovative and eye-catching watches. First, the NIWA watch\u2019s unusual and eye-catching look sets it apart from the thousands of other watches available in the market currently. Designed using high quality and reliable materials the NIWA watch takes the steampunk watch look to a whole new level. Secondly, the nixie tubes or old cathode display brings back the much-loved retro technology from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\nAVAILABLE IN 2 COLOURS \nKey Specs\n Measures 55mm diameter round watch\n Available in grey and black colours anodized cases machined from aircraft aluminium\n 24mm watch straps\n Docking station for charging (USB powered)\n 2 x IN-16 Nixie tubes\n 2 x IV-15 tubes\n Lifetime warranty for Nixie tubes\n\n\nYou will receive:\n1 NIWA Nixie watch\nDock station with stand\nExtra 2 IN 16  tubes\nMagnet for reed switches to set up time\nPower USB cable\nWood box wrapped in special Kickstarter paper\n Avaliable straps\nYou can choose one of the following straps together with your NIWA Nixie watch. Silicone, metal and leather.\nNIWA Nixie watch shows time only when you want to. Usually you need to charge your watch each 4-6 days depending on how often you use it. Charging takes 3 hours.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nNIWA Nixie watch has 2 reed switches and are not visible. You need a magnet to set up time and format. \nPLAY\n\n REWARDS\n Right now you can choose a NIWA Nixie watch with Sapphire glass which is $35 more then with original glass.

Use everyday objects, amplify them and use them to make sound, like our heroes John Cage and David Tudor used to do! \nThe Field Kit is optimized to process signals from microphones, contact microphones, electromagnetic pickups and able to run DC motors and solenoids. On top of that it can receive radio signals and convert signals from switches and sensors into control voltage! \nPLAY\n\nWe have finished development of the Field Kit, are ready for production and we need your support to make it happen!\nThe final Field Kit prototype, ready for production!\nIt's all about the things you connect to the The Field Kit! To get you started we decided to offer an Expansion Pack with a bunch of different sources that you can use and connect to create your own signature sounds.\nLet's get more detailed...\nThe Field Kit boasts 7 separate functional blocks all focussed on receiving  or generating all types of signals. They are designed to operate together as a coherent electroacoustic workstation or alternatively together with other pieces of music electronics with the ability to use control voltage signals.\nThe Field Kit is capable of doing a lot of different things! Let us run your through its functions, first there is the Four Channel Mixer:\nThe Four Channel Mixer is the beating heart of the Field Kit, providing a fully functional mixer with individual Gain, Mix Level and Tone control over each channel and individual Master- and Aux sub-mixes. \nThe level of the Master and Aux Channels can be set with the Master Volume and Aux Volume controls and the channels being sent to the Aux sub-mix can be set with dedicated Aux Select-buttons. The Aux sub-mix is pre-fader.\nFor the noise heads amongst you: the mixer can be used very well for feedback mixing and no-input mixing as well; there is plenty of Gain to play with and the Tone control is a passive Low/Hi Pass filter drastically changing the sound. \nAM/FM/SW Radio with CV Search function\nThe CV Radio is a CV-controllable radio receiver capable of receiving radio frequencies on AM/FM and SW bands. Additionally it provides the ability to catch electromagnetic waves for further processing inside the Field Kit. The frequency of the radio can be set with a dedicated multifunctional Search-control which acts both as a manual CV-source and as an input attenuator for a CV-signal. \nThe Field Kit comes with three connectors to attach needed antenna's for both FM and SW bands and a loop antenna connector for AM signals.\nEnvelope Follower with CV and Gate Out\nThe Envelope Follower in the Field Kit applies two functions to the waveform you send to the input: full-wave rectification (mirroring of negative portions of the waveform) and low-pass filtering (averaging). It can also be used for frequency doubling of a signal, which is a great tool to have in the electroacoustic domain.\nIn addition to the Envelope Out, the Envelope Follower inside the Field Kit also gives out a gate signal whenever the level of the input signal is high enough. The input signal level can be set with a dedicated Attenuation-control. \nLow Frequency Oscillator (LFO)\nThe Low Frequency Oscillator generates periodically varying voltages to be used as control signals. The output waveform can be set with a three-position Waveform-control and gives out either a Square-, Triangle- or a mix of Square and Triangle waveforms.\nThe frequency of the LFO can be set together with a dedicated Frequency-control and a three-position Range-control. With the higher range-settings, the frequency of the LFO reaches into the audio-range so the LFO can also be used as a simple drone sound source, send this is into a delay effect and you can make trippy sounds for hours!\nDC Interface\nA very cool function of the Field Kit is the DC Interface. You can use its output voltages to run little motors, fans, solenoids, buzzers and control them with control voltage signals. You can pick up the vibrations and electromagnetic waves with the contact microphones and electromagnetic pickup. \nThe DC Interface can be used together with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)- or Pulse-controlled devices. An example of a PWM-controlled device is a DC-motor of which the rotation speed can be set by varying the pulse width. A Pulse-controlled device can be a solenoid-motor whose impulse strength/distance can be set with the length of the control pulse. Other devices that can be used together with the DC Interface could be computer fans, LEDs, relay switches,  etc. \nHere are a few things you can use with the DC Interface:\nThe operation mode of the DC Interface can be set with a two-position Mode-switch and there is a multifunctional Intensity-control and a CV/Trigger-input whose functions are dependent on the mode of use and whether a jack is present at the CV/Trigger-input. \nThe Field Kit Expansion Pack comes with both a prepared DC-motor and a prepared solenoid-motor ready to be used together with the DC Interface or alternatively the user can prepare devices on his/her own.\nSignal Interface\nThe Signal Interface is a nifty toolset to transform the raw signals of a wide variety of sensors and switches into signals that can be used with the Field Kit or other gear. This means you can trigger or control sound by light, heat, humidity, distance, speed, acceleration, proximity, pressure, force, level, all depending on what type of switch or sensor you are using! Ideal for sound installations!\nThe Signal Interface consists of two parts, the Switch and the Sensor Interface. \nThe Switch Interface transforms signals from different switches like buttons, ball- or tilt-switches etc. into four different types of gate signals. It can output gates, inverted gates, ramp or sawtooth triggers of adjustable length (1ms to 1s). It has two outputs that can be used at the same time, so you could drive a motor and scan the CV Radio with the same switch! The output-voltage spans a range from 0V to about 8V.\nThe Sensor Interface is made to manipulate the output voltage of analog sensors, like light-, heat- or distance-sensors and convert their signals into control voltage. It can amplify or attenuate the incoming signal and add a DC-offset, so you can for instance set the motor to a constant speed and make it run faster by outputting a higher voltage from the sensor. \nThe maximum output-voltage is about 8V. It provides enough current to power an Arduino!\nHear the Field Kit in action!\nAll audio has been recorded straight from the Field Kit, using a DC Motor, Solenoid Motor, a DC powered fan, Roland TR-8 and Berlin's local radio station Antenne Brandenburg as audio sources.\nField Kit Expansion Pack\nIts all about the things you connect to the The Field Kit! To get you started we decided to offer an Expansion Pack with a bunch of different sources that you can use and connect to create your own signature sounds.\nThe Expansion Pack contains:\n2 x Contact Microphones\nUse these contact microphones to pick up vibration or sound, they are an amazing versatile input source. \n1 x Electro-Magnetic Pickup\nThis guy is good at picking up changes in magnetic fields, you can use it to amplify a string like a guitar pickup or amplify a spinning motor. \n1 x Solenoid push-pull motor\nUse the solenoid to hit things, together with the DC Interface the solenoid can make anything rhythmical and percussive. \n1 x DC motor\nThe Motor can be used to rotate things or as a noisy oscillator together with the Electro-Magnetic Pickup. \n1 x small speaker\nUse the speaker to listen to the main mix or as a sound source and to feedback sounds. \n3 x patch cables Always handy to have around to patch up different parts of your Field Kit. \n\n...and a bunch of little objects to play with (little springs, clamps etc.)\nIn the book and manual 50 Ways To Use The Field Kit that will be shipped with every Field Kit we will show you how you can make different sensors and input sources for your Field Kit, to experiment away!\nYou can get the Expansion Pack as a separate reward or get it in a bundle with the Field Kit. \nMRSP Pricing Expansion Pack: 59,00 EUR (incl. 19% VAT)\nDIY or Die!\nField Kit DIY Version.\nWant to build a Field Kit yourself!? You can!\nYou can get the Field Kit as a ready-made device or you can get the DIY Version, which you have to put together yourself. When you want to build the Field Kit yourself, we will supply you with a board that has all the SMT components already soldered on, which means the hardest bit is done already, but you have to do the rest: solder on all the hardware parts and final assembly of the front panel and you are good to go!\nThe DIY Version will be shipped with the User Manual and build instructions, we will also record a very clear video as a step by step tutorial on how to build your own unit (and show some cool hacking tricks while we're at it).\nTo get the DIY Version, choose DIY Version in the Rewards Section.\n50 Ways To Use The Field Kit\n50 Ways To Use The Field Kit - Manual and Reference Guide for the Field Kit.\nWith every Field Kit we ship a little booklet called \"50 Ways To Use The Field Kit,\" which, besides being the official user manual, is exactly what you might think it is: a small book with examples of 50 different setups with the Field Kit to spark your imagination to experiment with the Field Kit on how for instance make a spring reverb, do radio feed backing, sense heat, water and light and make it trigger a sequence of sound and so much more! \nIt also includes a few ideas and schematics to make your own add ons for the Field Kit. A good way to get started!\nEurorack Ready!\nYou can easily interface the Field Kit with a Eurorack modular system. At the backside of the PCB you will find a power connector you can use to power the unit from your system. The total panel width will be 36HP.\nEurorack panel prototype. You can unscrew the Field Kit out of its box, take off the front panel and mount the Eurorack panel easily.\nInspirations\nThe Field Kit is inspired by the electroacoustic research, compositions and performances by our heroes, experimenting away trying to find a new idiom and set of tools for sound generation.\nLeading the way was John Cage, who with his pieces Imaginary Landscape (1939-1952) and Cartridge Music (1960) used many audio sources like tin cans, conch shell, ratchet, bass drum, buzzers, water gong, metal wastebasket, lion's roar and amplified coil of wire. In his classic piece Water Walk, he is using - you might have guessed it - mainly water:\nAnother innovator was the German composer Karl-Heinz Stockhausen, who composed many pieces with electroacoustic sounds in which \u201cnormally inaudible vibrations . . . are made audible by an active process of sound detection (comparable to the auscultation of a body by a physician); the microphone is used actively as a musical instrument, in contrast to its former passive function of reproducing sounds as faithfully as possible\u201d (Stockhausen 1971a, 57).\nOne artist who mixes traditional instrumentation and objects we really like is Hauschka. When he performs he is using a 'prepared piano' to change and alter the sound of the strings, creating a new sonic world in which he can transform his instrument so that it loosely replicates the sounds of all sorts of others, whether bass guitar, gamelan or the hi-hat cymbal of a drum kit.\nWe experiment ourselves as well, here is our own Wouter Jaspers, performing at an event in the Netherlands back in 2010, using a battery of effects, milk foamers (for their motors) and dictaphones to create an immersive soundscape:\nAbout Us\nWe are KOMA Elektronik, a crew of engineers, artists, scientists and bon vivants living and working in Neuk\u00f6lln, an area in Berlin, Germany. We started building musical devices in 2011 and have since released a bunch of different machines to make music with. \nWe love electronic music and all like to experiment with sound. Some of us are sound artists, others build sound installations and we see the Field Kit as a device that can bridge many genres of music and stimulate musical experimentation.\nOur latest machines are the Komplex Sequencer and Poltergeist Quadraphonic Audio Mixer, but we also produce a line of modular effects pedals, a motion controller called Kommander and a bunch of accessories for modular music making.  \nWe run a little synth shop and open electronics workspace in our neighborhood called Common Ground, where we host workshops on electronic music, DIY culture, music electronics and organize concerts. We have workbenches where you can come by and fix your own equipment, where you can build a kit or design an enclosure. Its a place where you can talk nerdy about electronics and where you can learn. From each other.\nThe KOMA Team in front of the Wall of Kits at Common Ground, from left to right: Lizzie, Robert, Christian, Benjamin, Otto and Wouter. Not pictured here: Tom, Hayden and Juan.\n\nRelease schedule\nWe hope with your help to complete our Kickstarter campaign within 4 weeks after the initial launch. As soon as we receive the necessary backers we will begin preparing the production of the units. \nThe total production process will take up to approximately 7-8 weeks. After the production phase we will begin with shipping the units. This will be at the start of March 2017.\nThanks and Acknowledgements \n- Super thanks to our colleague Otto for designing the Field Kit!\n- Thanks for Ruben for the great photography!\n- Thanks to all the artists who beta-tested the Field Kit for us!\n- Thanks to you for supporting our Kickstarter campaign!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOver the past 5 years KOMA as a company has gathered a lot of knowledge and experience setting up, controlling and finishing a manufacturing process. The Field Kit has been thoroughly tested and works 100% to specifications. \n\nWe are ready to begin with the manufacturing process as soon as we reach the necessary backers. There are always things that can go wrong, especially when you are running a large production. For instance the PCB manufacturing could be delayed or our wood manufacturer can have a technical problem in their CNC machine. This is why we calculated a reasonable timeframe and have already prototyped the Field Kit with these manufacturers, so they know the job already before they start their production process.\n\nWe already have acquired the necessary CE and FCC markings for the Field Kit, so we are allowed to export them all over the world. We assemble all of our products at our workspace in Berlin, all units will be thoroughly tested in our workspace before shipping out.\n\nWe will give regular updates here on Kickstarter and we will make sure we let our backers know when things change in the process. \n\nAll KOMA products are proudly designed and built in Berlin, Germany.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Eternal Love from the KOMA team", "descp": "You are awesome!

Current prototyping hardware is cost prohibitive given how integral it is to designing IoT products. In order to unleash the full potential IoT has to offer, it is essential to offer hardware at a lower cost to give access to a wider audience of developers. This is where PUREmodules comes in! We have simplified our hardware to the basic components and by doing so minimized cost and complexity.  \nWhat are PUREmodules?  \nPUREmodules are the building blocks for IoT connected smart sensors. PUREmodules help you bring your vision to life. With PUREmodules, there is never any need to solder, breadboard, or wire anything. PUREmodules are quick to assemble and enable you to easily try out your ideas. Once you have the PUREmodules you need, simply snap them together, use our sample code, or DIY and write your own, and you are good to go! PUREmodules will simplify IoT development on a massive scale and set this technology loose on the world in a way that up until now has been impossible.   \nWhy should you support our Kickstarter?  \nWhat is currently on the market, are systems that are hard to assemble, messy, and difficult to work with. What we are offering you with PUREmodules is a system that is clean, compact, elegant, simple, and quick. Sounds great right? Here\u2019s where we need your help. Building hardware inexpensively requires volume. We intend to keep our costs as low as possible while maintaining the goal of making our hardware in USA. PUREmodules have been prototyped and tested and we ready to go to production. A successful kickstarter will help us break the cost barrier to be able to price our modules inline with the mass production costs of other electronics.  \nMore about PUREmodules  \nCOREmodule  \nThe Core Module is the brain of the system. For your support of this kickstarter one of the rewards is that you will receive the nRF52 Core Module. We selected the nRF52832 SOC for a number of reasons. First, is because of it\u2019s compatibility with Arduino and a number of other open source frameworks. We know many of you love Arduino for its simplicity and power, and so do we. We will be providing support for Contiki OS and Arduino for this kickstarter release. What\u2019s also great about the nRF52832 SOC is it supports the following major IoT operating systems:\nMynewt  \nZephyr  \nContiki OS  \nRIOT-OS  \nmbed OS  \nAdditional Software frameworks supported  \nArduino IDE  \nWirepas  \nBluetooth 5 ready, with meshing capability \nHomeKit  \nHardware Features  \nnRF52832 SOC  \nOnboard Antenna  \nInternal Temperature Sensor  \nLIS2DE12TR Accelerometer  \n1225 Coin Cell holder  \n2.4Ghz Antenna  \nOne While LED  \nTwo User buttons  \nThree output expansion ports, two I2C and one SPI  \nTwo input expansion ports, one I2C and one SPI \nShipping with BLE bootloader. \nUpdate firmware over the Air. \nOptional JTAG programming connection via Tag-Connect \nOne of the I2C expansion ports has JTAG and NFC expansion options \nTotal of 20 GPIO is available \nApplications\nThere are endless applications with the nRF52 Core module, but a few common applications include:\nBLE Beacon for Asset tracking\nBLE packet sniffer\niBeacon and Eddystone beacons\nMotion controller BLE mouse\nFitness step counter with BLE interface\nSUPER SENSOR Module \nIn addition to the COREmodule we are also kickstarting a multi function sensor module to enable a maximum number of uses in conjunction with the Core module. We call this our SUPER SENSOR module. The SUPER SENSOR Module contains 7 sensors capable of measuring the following data: \nBAROMETRIC PRESSURE \nHUMIDITY \nTEMPERATURE \nACCELEROMETER \nMAGNETOMETER \nDISTANCE \nUVA UVB \nRGB \nIR \nHEART RATE PULSE OXIMETRY \nWe are targeting three key areas with our multi-sensor module: (1) home automation and monitoring, (2) health tracking, and (3) industrial measurement.\nHome Automation and Monitoring \nWithin home automation a number of applications are possible. Some possibilities include: weather station, water leak detection, motion sensing, appliance monitoring, intrusion detection and pet monitoring. We are even more excited to see what you come up with. The possibilities are endless.\nHealth Tracking Applications \nOptions include: pulse rate oximetry, motion, fitness, sunscreen application alerts, sleep quantity measurements, and stress detection. Again we think this is only the beginning and can't wait to see applications that are created. \nIndustrial Measurement applications \nServer monitoring, equipment utilization, asset tracking, and farming. Overall we think that the starting set of sensors we are going to have will enable hundreds of different applications. We will continue to develop new sensor modules and refine the ones we have. \nOther Modules \nTo give you a better understanding of the size and scope of this undertaking we want you to know that we have designed over 40 other compatible modules. We have selected two of the best to begin with for this Kickstarter campaign. After we have successfully gone into production with the COREmodule and SUPER SENSOR module we will take more of our modules into production. Here is a list of some that are already designed: \nGeneral Purpose IO modules via I2C Expanders \nI2C ADC and DAC modules \nEnergy Harvesting Modules \nLow power chemical Sensors \nPIN diode Radiation Detector Module \nI2C thermal camera modules \nDual I2C DC motor Module \nGPS and IMU Module \nLong Range LoRa RF modules (10+ miles) \nLi-Ion and other Power modules \nEthernet Module \nLow Power LCD module \nUser IO button and LED modules \nMultiple Core modules; CC2650, EFM32, ESP32 and more. \nAdapter modules to other sensor systems such as Grove and LittleBits \nAdapters to popular platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. \nWhy did we make PUREmodules \nOur team, after creating hundreds of designs began to see a pattern emerge. Most hardware is built with same core components with slight variations between them. By breaking up the design into logical blocks we saw a pattern of a Core processor, sensors and IO. We found by making reusable modules we could make prototype designs very rapidly. We want to share our building blocks with you and the rest of the world.\nSchedule  \nWe plan to order pre production hardware beginning December and have the first batch of 100 units by late January ready to ship out to all Early birds. After this round all issues should be worked out for a larger run of 1000+ units. Late January we will start the boards for production. This should be ready to ship by early March where all the backers will start to receive their hardware. We will release schematics of the designs when the hardware ships.\nTimeline\n  Stretch goals\nWe have some great ideas for stretch goals for this project, they will be announced as we progress in this campaign, so please share this projects with others you think will be interested. \n\nLinks\nhttp://www.puremodules.com/\nhttp://hackaday.com/2016/12/25/pure-modules-aim-to-make-prototyping-easier/\nhttp://hackerboards.com/iot-prototyping-kit-offers-bluetooth-sensors/\nhttps://hackaday.io/project/12808-pure-modules\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/PUREmodules-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Module/\nhttp://www.electronics-lab.com/puremodules-iot-building-blocks/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/5fmjr3/puremodules_building_blocks_for_making_low_power/\nhttp://wwwhatsnew.com/2017/01/15/puremodules-ayudara-a-llevar-ideas-para-el-internet-de-las-cosas-a-la-practica/", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Donate to help spread the word", "descp": "Thanks for your support and spreading the word.

development are as tedious as placing electronics components by hand. Contractors can assemble small batches, but who has 2-4 weeks and $1000 to spend on each design cycle? \nThe Chipsetter ONE is the first pick-and-place machine built to satisfy the needs of today\u2019s electronics developers. Fast setup, accurate placement, and affordability make the Chipsetter ONE the tool to help developers overcome the final barrier to rapid circuit assembly. It\u2019s time to take control of your assembly, and get to market faster.\n Our Story\nWe began this project after assembling many, many circuit boards over the past 10 years. Shrinking SMT device sizes, combined with new access to affordable prototype PCB fabrication services meant we were developing more circuit boards than ever, and constantly experiencing the pain of manual assembly. Our survey of available solutions revealed existing desktop equipment was either too expensive, or unreliable. We needed something better, and we knew all of the electronics developers just like us needed it too. So we decided to do something about it.\nInspired by desktop 3D printing, we set out to create a useful and affordable tool. We knew that to be useful it would need to actually save you time and effort. To do that, our solution would have to be very reliable, and we would have to solve the setup time problem.\nWhile other solutions have moved away from single tape feeders in favour of arrays of tape slots, many users have complained at how difficult this has made it to set up and change over jobs. We decided to pursue an economical feeder solution, which required our team to design an economical removable electronic feeder system from the ground up. It is our intention to enable owners of the Chipsetter ONE to own a sufficient number of feeders to put an end to time wasted swapping tape between feeders during a change-over. Chipsetter Tape Feeders can be easily loaded and unloaded from the Chipsetter ONE, making mechanical and electrical connections in one swift motion.\nCircuit Boards Assembled on the Chipsetter ONE\n Supporters\n\"Right now, if you\u2019re looking at pick and place machines, I\u2019d highly suggest checking out the Chipsetter [ONE]. It works, and with forty feeders it\u2019s cheaper and more capable than the lowest priced \u2018pro\u2019 machines.\" \u2014 Hackaday\nHow To Build Circuit Boards Using the Chipsetter ONE\n1. Insert feeders\n2. Apply solder paste to your circuit board\n3. Secure PCB in the Chipsetter ONE's clamps\n4. Import manufacturing data, and the machine will take care of the rest.\nThe Chipsetter ONE will then pick up your components...\n...the camera vision system will correct for any misalignment...\n ...and your components will be placed on your circuit board.\n5. Reflow the circuit board in your reflow oven...\n ...and it's ready to go!\nHow It Compares\nCost Effective - When developing a rapidly evolving design, the Chipsetter ONE in-house solution is both time and cost effective. Factoring in setup and per unit build costs, it\u2019s not uncommon to spend upwards of $1,000 and 2-4 weeks through a PCB contract assembly service. The cost of the Chipsetter ONE can be recovered in approximately 5 development cycles, which may be encountered in the development of a single product.\nHow fast is it? - While high production volume machines are specified in \u2018components per hour\u2019 (CPH), small batch assembly jobs are dominated by setup time, change-over speed, software ease of use, and the need for operator intervention. The following scenario highlights the importance of fast setup time for small jobs:\nTime Comparison to Build Boards\n15 Boards in total\n40 Components per board (600 components in total)\n15 Unique components (15 Feeders required)\n So wait, the CPH is lower, but it\u2019s actually faster? In many short-run scenarios, yes. Despite a 40% lower CPH, in this scenario the Chipsetter ONE completes the job in 50% of the time.\nFast Setup (Low-Cost Feeders) - To solve the setup time problem we had to go back and re-think feeders. We know that loading and unloading tape from tape-and-reel feeders takes a long time. Our solution was an economical feeder design that uses mass-produced parts, and a microprocessor to store information. The resulting solution allows you to own one feeder per reel in your inventory, making swapping reels in and out of feeders a thing of the past.\nFast Setup (Software)  - Our low-cost feeders are a snap to attach anywhere on the machine, but how does the machine know where they are? Cameras! Our built-in camera system automatically detects feeder locations, sparing the operator from hours of tedious manual setup.\nNo need for manual programming - There\u2019s no manual placement programming here! Our software handles everything you need to build your boards. Once feeders are loaded, simply import your manufacturing data (Centroid and BOM files in .csv format) from your favorite EDA tool, and the Chipsetter ONE will take care of the rest.\nClosed Loop Vision System - Bottom Camera\nAccurate Placement \nThe Chipsetter ONE features two built-in cameras to ensure accurate placement of components as small as 0402s. A top-down camera inspects and corrects any misalignment in the circuit board, while the bottom-up camera inspects and corrects any misalignment of held components. \nAssembled by hand:\nCircuit Board Assembled by Hand (25 Mins)\n Assembled on the Chipsetter ONE:\nCircuit Board Assembled by Chipsetter ONE (6 mins)\n  Here is a demo of the Chipsetter ONE building give away boards for New York Maker Faire 2016.\nTech Specs\nPlacement speed: Up to 1250 component placements per hour.\nMinimal Setup time: Control software uses built-in cameras to automate system setup. \nPlacement accuracy: 30 microns repeatability. \nVision System: Board fiducial and Component alignment. \nPart sizes: Handles components down to 0402. \nBoard sizes: Up to 13.5\u201d x 10\u201d of usable placement area. \nPickup Heads: Two pickup heads for increased placement speed.\nNozzle rack: 8-position auto tool changer. \nTape and Reel Feeders: Removable electronic feeders enable pickup of tape and reel packaged components in 8mm, 12mm and 16mm reel widths. \nFeeder capacity: Up to 40 8mm Tape and Reel Feeders. \nTrays: Accepts JEDEC and custom trays. \nCut Tape Trays: Accepts components in sections of cut tape. \nTube Feeder: Accepts components in tube packages. \nMachine size: 34\u201d wide x 28\u201d deep x 21 \u00bd\u201d high. \nAssembly Data: Control software reads BOM and centroid data from CSV format files, and communicates with the machine via standard USB interface.\nFeeders\nSeveral custom designed feeders allow the Chipsetter ONE to handle all conventional component packages including; reel tape, small sections of cut tape, components in tubes, and loose components in custom trays.\nTwo Custom Cut Tape Feeders and a Tray Feeder\n  8mm Tape Feeder (Left) Vibrating Tube Feeder (Right)\n  Picking up Components from Tape Feeder\n  Picking up Large Components from Tray Feeder\n  Rewards\n*Chipsetter ONE Prices are in Listed USD\n How to Purchase Additional Feeders\nAdditional feeders will be made available to purchase for Chipsetter ONE backers through our backer management system. 8mm, 12mm and 16mm Tape Feeders will be sold in packs of 5 for $399USD, 20% off $499USD MSRP, Save $100USD.

To ensure our engineering success, we have assembled a team of highly capable engineers who are very passionate about this project, and we have produced a working version of the product using the the same production methods that will be used to fulfill the campaign rewards. \n\nSupply Chain & Manufacturing \n\nThe team at Chipsetter has been busy developing relationships with suppliers, and testing component suitability. We are continuously evaluating alternative suppliers to minimize supply chain risk. Our manufacturing plans are flexible to meet Kickstarter demand. While we hope Kickstarter demand will allow us to experience economies of scale in terms of manufacturing, we also have a plan for the alternative scenario.\n\nAssembly and Quality control\n\nTo ensure the quality and performance of this automated equipment, Chipsetter will perform the final assembly and testing of each machine, which will include building a circuit board on each machine before it is shipped. We know this stage of the process often reveals problems that become very disruptive if not addressed immediately, therefore we have committed to performing this work ourselves allowing us to resolve issues promptly.\n\nSoftware\n\nChipsetter is committed to delivering a satisfying software experience. Our current software used by our development team contains all required functional elements to operate, however it requires a redesign of the user interface before it will be ready to ship. With the resources provided by a successful campaign, we are confident in our ability to perform this task.\n\nTeam\n\nIt required a fantastic group of skilled and motivated team members to design and build the Chipsetter ONE, and we know we will need to grow our team to fulfill our campaign rewards.

Now, hopefully with your backing, it's time to move from development & prototype phase to the first production run of these new, much more powerful products.\nThe scope of this Kickstarter project involves completing a first production run and publishing good Arduino-compatible support software, with these 2 new Teensy boards as the physical rewards shipped to backers.\nHowever, this new hardware is meant to be a stepping stone to open an ambitious new chapter of software design & platform enhancements.  As I've done with Teensy for many years, I intend to develop increasingly powerful but easy-to-use software libraries and even improvements to the Arduino platform to enable everyone to more easily create awesome, incredible DIY projects.\nA Brief History of Teensy\nTeensy has always been about bringing more powerful microcontroller features to the DIY Electronics world, not just hardware, but advanced libraries that allow more powerful features to be used easily from Arduino.\nTeensy 1.0 (late-2008) offered 12 Mbps native USB at a time when all Arduino compatible boards used slow serial.  It was the first board Arduino compatible board to feature very fast USB communication.\nTeensy 2.0 (2009) added support for USB Keyboard, Mouse & MIDI.  At this time nearly all Arduino libraries were hard-coded for Diecimila/Duemilanove.  In 2010-2011, I added thin abstraction layers to Servo, Firmata, OneWire, IrRemote & many more, as well as fixed many issues and optimized code, which later paved the way for compatibility for later Arduino products (Mega, Leonardo, etc).  Starting from this early period, I contributed many optimizations & improvements back to Arduino, to benefit everyone, not just Teensy users.\nTeensy became more widely used from 2011.  So did the early addressable LED strips.  Inspired by a conversation with Phil Burgess, I created code to stream USB packets to LEDs.  This pushed Teensy 2.0 to its technical limits, but several people used it to build some awesome LED projects.\nTeensy 3.0 (2012) was the first 32 bit Teensy, launched here on Kickstarter.  While Maple deserves the credit for being the first 32 bit Arduino compatible board, Teensy 3.0 began a major effort to port every widely used Arduino library and begin developing new libraries to truly use the far more capable hardware.\nBy early 2013, much less expensive addressable LEDs appeared.  Many people were interested in using them for video walls, inspired by those earlier projects.  At first this seemed impossible due to their tight timing requirements.  But using the flexible DMA controller and timers in Teensy 3.0, I created the OctoWS2811 LED library which has been used by many thousands of people to create truly outstanding large LED products.\nSmall color TFT screens also became inexpensive around this time.  At 320x240 resolution, these update quite slowly using 8 bit microcontrollers.  Running the same code on Teensy 3.0 results in a 3 to 4 times speedup.  But by developing a special optimized library to take advantage of the more sophisticated hardware FIFO and control signal hardware, much better performance was achieved.\nTeensy 3.1 & 3.2 (2014) Teensy was updated to a faster chip with 4 times larger RAM.  The increased memory size opened up the possibility of very flexible audio.  I spent nearly 2 years developing the Teensy Audio Library, which is actually a toolkit of dozens of audio processing components.  To help people use it, I created this design tool, borrowing GUI code from the Node-Red project.\nWith some help from Alysia Dynamik, in late-2015 we created a workshop and tutorial demonstrating many of the audio library features.  This video walkthough can give you a good idea of how I've tried to put this 32 bit hardware to use, crafting a library that not only makes audio processing possible, but easy to do from Arduino sketches.\nSince this video was made, several more audio features have been added, including quad channel input & output and USB audio streaming, where Teensy appears to your PC as a USB sound card and audio data streams bidirectionally between your PC and the audio library.\nEach new generation of more capable Teensy hardware has brought the opportunity to develop these advanced libraries.  Now, hopefully with your backing, it's time to again step up to more powerful hardware.\nTechnical Features & Specifications\nFeatures specific to Teensy 3.6:\n180 MHz ARM Cortex-M4 with Floating Point Unit\n1M Flash, 256K RAM, 4K EEPROM\nMicrocontroller Chip MK66FX1M0VMD18 (PDF link)\nUSB High Speed (480 Mbit/sec) Port\n2 CAN Bus Ports\n32 General Purpose DMA Channels\n22 PWM Outputs\n4 I2C Ports\n11 Touch Sensing Inputs\nFeatures specific to Teensy 3.5:\n120 MHz ARM Cortex-M4 with Floating Point Unit\n512K Flash, 192K RAM, 4K EEPROM\nMicrocontroller Chip MK64FX512VMD12 (PDF link)\n1 CAN Bus Port\n16 General Purpose DMA Channels\n5 Volt Tolerance On All Digital I/O Pins\nFeatures common to both:\n62 I/O Pins (42 breadboard friendly)\n25 Analog Inputs to 2 ADCs with 13 bits resolution\n2 Analog Outputs (DACs) with 12 bit resolution\n20 PWM Outputs (Teensy 3.6 has 22 PWM)\nUSB Full Speed (12 Mbit/sec) Port\nEthernet mac, capable of full 100 Mbit/sec speed\nNative (4 bit SDIO) micro SD card port\nI2S Audio Port, 4 Channel Digital Audio Input & Output\n14 Hardware Timers\nCryptographic Acceleration Unit\nRandom Number Generator\nCRC Computation Unit\n6 Serial Ports (2 with FIFO & Fast Baud Rates)\n3 SPI Ports (1 with FIFO)\n3 I2C Ports (Teensy 3.6 has a 4th I2C port)\nReal Time Clock\nThe pin assignments have been designed to preserve compatibility with the 28 breadboard-friendly pins of prior Teensy 3.x models.  All 28 of these pins support the same features as the older models.\nMore I/O pins are available at small surface mount pads on the back side.  The 6th serial port, 4th I2C port and 3rd SPI port are on these pins.  They're not as easy to access as the main 42 through-hole pins on the outside edge, but for projects where you really need access to a huge number of I/O signals or those extra communication ports, these boards do give you a way to access them (but keep the board to a reasonably small \"Teensy\" size).\nTeensy 3.6 has a second USB port which is capable of 480 Mbit/sec speed.  It's intended to used in USB host mode, so you can connect USB devices like a keyboard or memory stick.  This USB port is accessed using 5 pins, which are compatible with the commonly available internal PC cables for USB.\nThe Arduino IDE is the primary method used to program Teensy.  Like prior models, my goal for Teensy is the best possibility compatibility with all Arduino functions and widely used libraries.\nDevelopment Timeline\nI started planning for a high-end Teensy about 3 years ago.  This paper model was among the very first steps.  This paper model was made before Teensy 3.2 existed (early 2014), when we were still using the Mini54 chip to implement the bootloader. It has sat on the corner of my desk all this time, as a reminder to make a more capable Teensy model.\nAs you can see, the concept of a 48 pin breadboard friendly form factor with the micro SD socket existed from the very early days.  Originally 10 more through-hole pins were planned between the pushbutton and chip, with 8 of them providing the last Serial, I2C & SPI ports.  You can see these 10 pins on all the later prototype boards, but they were ultimately changed to to bottom-side SMT pads to allow room for the USB host port.\nThis circuit board is the first prototype which actually worked, made in early 2015.  A few others were made earlier but didn't work and were never debugged.  As you can see from the white wire, this version also had some mistakes.\nNXP/Freescale published datasheets for the MK66 chip in mid-2015 and the chips became available in late-2015, long after this prototype was made with the earlier MK22 chip.\nTo say this early prototype \"worked\" may be a bit of an exaggeration.  I had quite a bit of trouble with my code and the newer flash memory controller.  NXP/Freescale calls this controller \"FTFE\".  The ones in other Teensy models are \"FTFL\" and \"FTFA\".  Their documentation looks very similar, but subtle differences set my efforts back by many months.  FTFE only supports 64 bit word size.  It also seems to have very strange undocumented behavior in some conditions, which aren't treated as errors at all by the smaller FTFL & FTFA controllers.\nTwo more prototype boards (no photos) were made, based on the update from the MK22 chip to MK64 & MK66.  The pin assignments changed somewhat, mostly to allow an Ethernet PHY shield to use the on-chip Ethernet peripheral.  The extra power pins were brought near the center of the board, to see these connections short for a future Ethernet shield, which would require the RMII interface which clocks at 50 MHz.\nIn May 2016, the last prototype was adapted to make this beta test board.  It has the final pinout with sockets added at the intended form-factor.\nIn June, we began a beta test period, first sending 10 of these boards to long-established community contributors in mid-June, and another 16 later in July.  As you can read in that incredibly long forum thread, a pretty tremendous amount of beta testing has occurred over the last couple months!\nBefore finalizing the pinout, I wanted to be absolutely certain we could have a working Ethernet shield.  The RMII signals seemed simple enough, but lingering questions remained about the RMII clock.  So in July I designed this Ethernet shield using the LAN8720A chip.\nI was able to write and confirm a simple ping sketch.  Some of the beta testers, especially forum user Manitou, stepped up to do much more testing, including benchmarks that show the hardware really is capable of back-to-back packet processing at 100 Mbit/sec speed!\nA pretty incredible amount of testing has been done over these last two months, including impressive benchmarks on the native SD port and some initial results with the 480 Mbit/sec USB port.  Most of the Arduino libraries have been ported or updated.\nIn July I turned my attention to the PCB layout.  The design uses 6 layers.  Cramming all this into the Teensy form-factor, routing so many signals from the 144 ball BGA using \"escape routing\" mostly on just 2 sides without any other PCB area for signals to cross back to the other side of the PCB was quite a challenge.  This was by far the most difficult PCB layout I've ever done.  After a few solid weeks of work, it was finally all routed, even preserving 2 of the layers for only ground and power planes.\nAs you can guess by the purple color of my prototypes, I love OSH Park, and I tend to make many iterations as I work on a project.  But they don't offer a 6 layer service, nor small slots which I wanted to use for a strong USB connector.  It seems nearly all 6 layer prototype services are quite expensive.  We ended up having our normal PCB vendor make the 6 layer prototype in the form of the actual panels we'll use for production.\nAll Teensy 3.x boards are assembled in the USA, at a local contract manufacturer that's only a 15 minute drive away.  Robin and I met with them, and they were eager to do a test run, especially since this our first PCB with this BGA chip and the USB connector using slots.\nThe boards from this pre-production run work great, I was quite relieved to learn after making this small run of boards using a brand new PCB layout (have I mentioned how much I wish for OSH Park's awesome service for 6-layer boards).  The final production boards will be identical, with the minor exception of those extra holes in the panel frame were relocated, to better fit special fixture equipment they use with applying the solder paste.\nEven though most of the technical work to design this board is completed, much work remains to be done for a final release.  How we will test these is the next major task as we fully test every board before shipping them out.  Much work also remains on documentation everyone needed for a properly supported development board.  I'll be writing updates.  These high-end components and 6 layer boards also involve quite a financial investment (PJRC is a tiny company, just a few people) which is where the magic of Kickstarter comes in.  We'll gauge the size of this first production run of boards based on the response here, so I hope you'll consider backing this project to help us complete the last step of a full production release.\nFuture Software Development Goals\nTeensy has always been about so much more than just its hardware, about bringing more advanced but easy-to-use software libraries to the Maker & DIY hardware communities.  In this last section, I'd like to share some of my ambitions for where this far more powerful hardware can take us.\nKickstarter requires all projects to have clear goals, to be able to define a point where the creator can say \"it's finished\".  For Teensy 3.5 & 3.6, that goal is shipping all the rewards, and a non-beta software release that provides compatibility with all the standard Arduino functions, libraries that come built-in to Arduino, and the 76 of the 77 other commonly used Arduino libraries that ship with Teensyduino 1.29 (one is specific to only 8 bit AVR).  These should not be considered part of completing this project.\nUSB Types for MTP Disk, USB ethernet\nAudio library, many ambitious ideas: network in/out streaming, real-time pitch shifting (phase vocoder), tempo/beat analysis, granular synthesis & effects, etc\nLED music visualization (prime use of the floating point unit)\nSD library to use DMA and pre-fetching, thread/interrupt safe caching\nEthernet library, drop-in replacement for Arduino's Ethernet lib\nArduino Event Processing API\nUSB Host Library Exansion & optimization\nDebug features integrated into the Arduino IDE\nWhile some work has been started on a few of these, most of these are \"wish list\" ideas.  Much of the best work I've done for Teensy over the years, such as the OctoWS2811 library for video-speed control of large LED projects as been inspired by comments.  So please do comment.  It really can lead to great things!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing of any hardware can involve risk of delays. Vendors may deliver materials late, assembly issues can lead to setbacks, and issues with testing, package and shipping can come up.\n\nPJRC (my small company) has 16 years of experience manufacturing and selling microcontroller development boards, and I personally have 24 years of professional electrical engineering experience. Many people who backed the Teensy 3.0 Kickstarter in 2012 have commented it was one of the few campaigns they've ever seen ship on time. We recently completed a tiny preproduction run of beta test boards, which builds a high degree of confidence we will be able to manufacture these boards without significant delays.\n\nI am confident we'll avoid such issues, based on how well the pre-production run went. It's a major personal goal of mine to see every single reward shipped on time! But unforeseen issues can always come up. If they do, we certainly do have the resources and experience to quickly deal with setbacks.\n\nThe short-term software goals, excellent compatibility with Arduino and widely used Arduino libraries are looking very promising. Beta testing over the last 2 months has already resolved many issues, with nearly all libraries confirmed working. Of course, software is notoriously difficult to ever become absolutely bug free.\n\nLong-term future software development goals, while not technically within the scope of this project's rewards, are of course important. They're also very ambitious ideas which may take a very long time, or may change in scope, or may not come to fruition. I do have a good history of developing these sorts of software projects, but no particular grand software idea is ever 100% certain until it's actually implemented.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 23 or more", "title": "Teensy 3.5 Single", "descp": "Get started with 1 of the Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["318 backers", "Limited (22 left of 340)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Teensy 3.6 Single", "descp": "Get started with 1 of the Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["779 backers", "Limited (47 left of 826)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Teensy 3.5 Pair", "descp": "Two Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["97 backers", "Limited (8 left of 105)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Starter Combo", "descp": "One of each - Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) board + Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,053 backers", "Limited (17 left of 1070)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Teensy 3.6 Pair", "descp": "2 Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["325 backers", "Limited (25 left of 350)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 72 or more", "title": "Teenys 3.5 Three Pack Combo", "descp": "Three pack of two Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) board + one Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["34 backers", "Limited (6 left of 40)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 77 or more", "title": "Three Pack Combo", "descp": "Three pack of two Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards + one Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["164 backers", "Limited (16 left of 180)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 82 or more", "title": "Teensy 3.6 Three Pack", "descp": "Three pack of Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["74 backers", "Limited (26 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 129 or more", "title": "Five Pack Combo", "descp": "Five pack of four Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards + one Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["50 backers", "Limited (5 left of 55)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 160 or more", "title": "Teensy 3.6 Six Pack", "descp": "Six pack of Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["27 backers", "Limited (4 left of 31)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Four Pack Combo", "descp": "Four pack of two Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards + two Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) boards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "150 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 216 or more", "title": "Special Developer Pack", "descp": "Five Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards + Two Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) boards + One Ethernet Shield", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 295 or more", "title": "Special EARLY 3.5 Developer Pack", "descp": "Six Teensy 3.6 (180 MHz, FPU, 3.3V only) boards + Three Teensy 3.5 (120 MHz, FPU, 5 Volt Tolerant) boards + and Ethernet Shield + One Pre-Production Teensy 3.5\nThe Pre-Production Teensy 3.5 will ship as soon as your payment is verified (shortly after the project closes - estimated ship date is Sept 12).

Have you ever seen water run-off when sprinklers are running? Your traditional timer may get the basic job done, but this can lead to inefficient and wasteful watering practices. You are wasting money!    \nYardian is the solution  \nYardian is designed to replace your traditional timer. It uses local weather data to calculate the amount of water your lawn and plants need, same technology that has been used in agriculture but now promoted by the US Environmental Protection Agency to save water. It also has access to the municipal water restrictions database, so that you don\u2019t have to worry about overuse and possible fines. Precipitation forecasts and rain sensor activities in your neighborhood are used to skip watering whenever possible.  \nNo more unnecessary watering and fines!  \nThat\u2019s not all. We wanted to bring as much useful functionality as we could to Yardian. This is why we\u2019ve added a camera. It's always on and streaming live video to your phone.

Connect with friends by pairing your bands. Send Light Signals to communicate in a flash. Be part of the show at concerts and events by pulsing to the beat, syncing with the DJ, or connecting to the crowd around you.\nIt\u2019s the first wearable that lets you change your design using snap-on Tiles as easily as changing your clothes. Switch up your band\u2019s Tiles, colors and Effects to match your look, your mood or the moment.\n          Gemio has light, motion, sound and proximity sensors so it responds to who you're with, where you are and what you're doing. Gemio uses a panel of LED lights and a palette of millions of colors to create unique Light Effects for any situation. It can reflect your mood, match what you're wearing or pulse to the music.\nPLAY\n\nYour Gemio includes advanced Light Effects that mimic elements in nature and respond to your movement. The Water Effect (below) flows blues, greens and whites across your band. Fire emulates the flickering oranges, reds, and yellows of a flame. and \"sparks\" when you tap your band.  \nPLAY\n\n  Connect with friends by simply pressing a button on your Gemio. You can create a real life network on-the-go, anytime, even without your phone. It's a whole new way to connect with people you meet at events, festivals and concerts.\nPLAY\n\nGemio lets you send Light Signals to your friends using the MyGemio App on iPhones and Android devices. Light Signals are patterns that play on your bracelet and communicate simple messages, like: \"meet me\", \"let's get out of here\", \"I'm on my way\", or \"thinking of you\". The signals are easy to understand because they mimic the message you're sending (\"meet me\" has lights that meet in the middle). You assign colors to your friends so you instantly know who the message is from and what it means. \nPLAY\n\nGemio comes loaded with commonly used messages, but you and your friends can create your own Light Signals.\n  Gemio is the first wearable tech that allows you to completely change the look of your band in a snap (literally). You change designs by simply switching out your Tiles. All the Tiles are optically designed to work with Gemio's LED panel - creating beautiful effects and signals.\nPLAY\n\nAt launch, we will be releasing six Tile designs to choose from (even more if we reach our stretch goal).  Every reward level on Kickstarter that includes a Gemio Band comes with the Gemio Tile set and 2 Tile sets of your choice. You don't need to pick the designs now, we'll ask you to pick from the collection before we ship.\nYour Gemio Band will ship with our signature Gemio Tile set: \nIn addition, there will be 6 Tile set designs available to choose from when you pre-order Gemio Bands.\nBecause you and your friends helped us reach our first 2 Stretch Goals, we are able to add 6 more print Tile set designs and 3 \"shapes\" Tile sets for you to choose from at the end of the campaign:\n  We'll continue to release new designs so your Gemio is always fresh and fun. We're also working with celebrities and designers to create limited edition designs.\n  Gemio charges wirelessly and has dual batteries that will keep the party going all night. \nThe magnetic docking lets your Gemio hover magically when it's charging --  it can even be the coolest night light you've ever seen.\n  Your Gemio takes any music, concert or festival experience to the next level. Use your swappable Tile sets to coordinate your Gemio to your concert or festival look. Be part of the light show by having your Gemio pulse to the music, or sync to the DJ or crowd around you. Stay in the moment without staying glued to your phone. Use Light Signals to know when friends arrive, wanna meet up or are ready to go. And your Gemio is built to hold up to concert conditions - it\u2019s rugged, doesn\u2019t get hot (even after extended use) and stays charged for 5 to 6 hours. \nGemio's patent-pending wearable technology creates amazing responsive light effects, connects you with friends, groups and interests, and enables a new way to interact and communicate.\n*exploded view is a rendering\n    The My Gemio App lets you control the behavior of your Gemio from picking colors and light effects to sending light signals. It also keeps track of the friends you see IRL - so it's easy to stay in touch or meet up.\n  And that's the just the beginning, we are working on many new features of the app to add in the near future.\nThe MyGemio App will be available for iPhone and Android at the time we launch. If you are interested in being part of the beta testing group please contact us at friends@gogemio.com.\n      PLAY\n\n                    For manufacturing Gemio Bands, we have partnered with a top tier factory that makes wearables for several major brands.\n            Gemio believes in the power of people connecting. Gemio is proud to partner with the non-profit foundation, Love is Louder, co-founded by actress Brittany Snow. Love is Louder strives to raise the volume around the message that love and support are louder than any internal or external voice that brings us down. Gemio is a proud supporter of Love is Louder and they will be the first Community that Gemio Band owners can subscribe to on the MyGemio App. Subscribers will simultaneously receive periodic light signals from Love is Louder to remind the community that we are all connected. To join the Love is Louder movement, visit www.loveislouder.com. \n We've created a unique Tile set for Love is Louder. It will also be available upon launch.\n  PLAY\n\n You can also amplify Love is Louder's partnership with Gemio by pledging $25 for this limited edition t-shirt.\n (This is not a charitable donation.)\n       Share the news of Gemio on Facebook\nTweet about Gemio\nUse this link to share the news of our campaign anywhere: http://bit.ly/GemioKickstarter\n\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been working on prototypes for over a year, iterating the hardware and software design and engineering. We\u2019re most excited about our recent partnership with a major manufacturer with a track record of producing some of the best known and high-quality wearables. Whenever you manufacture a product there are a lot of moving parts which all need to integrate smoothly to keep to a schedule. Many things can throw that off: part scarcity, part delays, quantity changes, quality control glitches. If these come up, we\u2019ll let you know with regular updates and hope you\u2019ll understand and bear with us as we solve any problems.\n\nWe still have a final iteration to complete before mass production and this could cause changes to the design if that\u2019s required to make the bracelet more durable or fit better. We don\u2019t anticipate anything significant, but we\u2019ll tweak it if it\u2019s going to make it better, and we wanted you to know that up-front.\n\nThe App will continue to evolve and we\u2019ll be adding new features regularly, but that also comes with a risk of bugs. Of course the release process will include beta testing, but given the time frames and small initial user groups it\u2019s always possible some bugs will slip through. We\u2019ll communicate any known bugs and fix them as quickly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "SUPPORTER", "descp": "Thanks for supporting our campaign.

Quite simple: No vibration when facing/travelling the correct direction and then ramp up linearly until the user is at 180 degrees from the correct direction. This means that if you veer off course, you'll feel vibration, and if you continue turning the wrong way the vibration will increase letting you know that that is the wrong direction and you should go the other way. The only tricky part here is figuring out the margins of error. For example, how big should the window be that is considered the 'correct' direction? Also, sampling the direction from the phone's compass would probably need to be averaged over some time interval because the phone bouncing around in someone's pocket while their walking is likely to provide a somewhat noisy signal.

The combination of raw materials and hand construction creates a unique piece of beauty only nature could conceive. We live in a day where you can control almost your whole life from a smart device in your hand, which is nothing short of amazing, however that sense of natural beauty could never be replaced or recreated by any machine.\nAnh\u00e4nger Classic Ready To Go\n Colours\nOur plan is to launch Anh\u00e4nger with three original colours; Burgundy, Tan and Black. Due to the nature of the leather we like to work with, each colour run will be limited and therefore exclusive. We will always offer a version of black, tan and burgundy. We will offer runs of special colours for a limited number of pieces, these colours will be influenced by seasons and request popularity .\nColour Option Pro\n Custom Stamping\nA big part of Anh\u00e4ngers\u2019 creation was to offer something unique, special and individual. The whole point of a luggage tag is to identify one's traveling belongings. The best way to do that is by customising your luggage to stand out from the crowd. We will offer a range of personalisation options depending on the different Anh\u00e4nger models, everything from large monogrammed letters or short messages on the Pro or Classic, to embossed contact detials on the Lite.\nAnh\u00e4nger Stamping Sample\n Stretch Goals \n(Colours in table are not an actual representation of leather colours)\nStretch Goals\n Anh\u00e4nger Models\nAnh\u00e4nger Pro\nRefined, extravagant, the top of the line Anh\u00e4nger, showing the world you mean business. The Anh\u00e4nger Pro is Large enough to be clearly visible with its Traditional yet modern look. With its extra Privacy Flap over the front it ads durability and uniformity to the tag.

The Anh\u00e4nger Classic is Large enough to be clearly visible with its Traditional yet modern look. Open front to easily view your information when recquired. Perfect size to add your business card if preferred. Comes in 3 colours for the moment; Black, Burgundy, Tan\nAnh\u00e4nger Pro/Classic\nAnh\u00e4nger Lite\nSimple, Elegant, Perfect for your smaller luggage or every day bag. The Anh\u00e4nger Lite Delivers the same High quality Leather that the Pro and Classic models have, as well as the same hand etched, personalised details. The strap on the Anh\u00e4nger Lite is a smaller strap still with incredible strength capabilities. Comes in 3 colours for the moment; Black, Burgundy, Tan.\nAnh\u00e4nger Lite\n Interchangeable straps\nThe Anh\u00e4nger Pro and the Anh\u00e4nger classic, both have interchangeable straps to suit everyone's needs. There are three lengths available, \nSmall:      18cm\nOriginal:   21cm\nLarge:      26cm\neach chosen as they represent the lengths most commonly used.\nStrap Lengths\nThere are also three colours avaliable, though with many more to come very soon! Black, Beige, Burgundy\nCurrent Colour Options\nYou can swap out your straps for longer or shorter versions, or personalise your anh\u00e4nger, and get another colour!\nIndividual Style\nProduction of the anhanger\nAll Anh\u00e4nger are crafted by hand in our workshop in Sydney Australia, where we have been working tierlessley for the preparation and release of this Kickstarter.\nWhat we Need from you is your help to be able to purchase the leather and other materials for the anh\u00e4nger, as well as train more staff to be able to organise the continuous production of the ahn\u00e4nger range.\nCutting Straps\n The Design Process\nThe design of the Anh\u00e4nger came around about 9 months ago, where it was a meer drawing on a boarding pass on a long taxi ride to the hotel, and since then it has been worked on and tweaked continuously. The main design of the anh\u00e4nger has been the same throughout the whole process, to create something that stands out and makes its mark, though there have been many minor changes along the way. but right now, we feel that we have perfected the design and that it is ready to tag the world.\nHand Drawn Anh\u00e4nger Classic\n Who we are\nNicolas came up with the idea for the kickstarter after his trip, and so he drew up the designs on a boarding pass on the way to the hotel, and once he arrived back home later that week, he started making a luggage tag out of paper, the first prototype. After this he continued playing with the design and finally made one out of leather, which became a birthday gift for Marcus who also saw the lack of options in the market, therfore before long they were both working on the project, where they decided to make a kickstarter to help them get everything started.\nNicolas (left) Marcus (right)\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first kickstarter project, so there will of course be many unexpected challenges along the way, such as the possibility of not being able to keep up with production rates as it is a custom and hand made product, as well as possible shipping delays.

They can be used individually or combined to weigh just about anything.\nUse Weighitz as a single scale or as a set. Alone, they are ideal for home kitchen use. When combined, a set of Weighitz can weigh heavier or more oddly shaped objects.\nA set of Weighitz can replace all your home weighing scales. Weighitz have no platform, so you\u2019re no longer constrained by size or shape. Calibrate any container to weigh whatever you like. Need to weigh your Labrador? Turn their dog bed into a smart scale. \nWeighitz are designed to be easy to use. Just squeeze on, place them under whatever you need to weigh, open the app and begin weighing.\nWeighitz output to the Weighitz smartphone app. The app makes weighing smart and simple.\n  When using more than one Weighitz, the app will combine the readings from all the scales into a single reading.\nWe have been amazed at the number of suggestions for Weighitz applications. We encourage backers to tell us how Weighitz might solve one of their weighing problems. Here are the top apps we have created so far: All of the below are part of the main Weighitz app.\nApp Examples\n  Sensitive enough to weigh herbs and spices. They also have a wide range, so you can weigh heavy things like flour and rice. Planning a party for twenty guests? Combine Weighitz to weigh just about anything. Weighitz can do a lot of other cool things, like convert metric to imperial units. Even convert non-standard units like cups to grams.\nKitchen Scale\n  The Weigh-Anything app allows the user free range over Weighitz. Users can see the combined reading. The readings from each Weighitz or even the raw uncalibrated units. The Weigh anything app is ideal for those with unique weighing needs, below are a few of our favorite uses.\nPet, baby & infant Scale - Turn the bed into a scale\nWeigh pets and babies with ease\nSample Scale (compare sample weights in real time)\nCompare Samples\n Weigh Packages (0-270lb)\nWeigh Packages\n  The app connects to a large database that contains the nutritional content of a wide range of foods. This data displays when weighing and records the nutrients in each meal.\nPortion Control\n Portion control is vital for those on strict diets, like athletes and diabetics. \nThe portion control app will integrate with a larger health application - including - calorie and diet recommendations.\nThis will also be integrated into the automatic baking and smoothie making apps - with healthy recipe alternative and suggestions (update 1).\nCombine Weighitz, to create a portable smart body scale.\nWeigh yourself or family members\nThe body weight app will allow tracking of your weight, BMI and will eventually be part of the healthy living app - this app will combine with the kitchen and automatic baking app to suggest healthy ways to achieve weight loss, gains or more specific goals - like muscle building. \nOur luggage app turns your whole suitcase into a smart weighing scale.\nWeigh Luggage\nSee the weight adjust in real-time as you pack your luggage. Receive a warning when approaching baggage limits.\nWe are building apps based on the needs of our backers. In addition to the above-mentioned apps, we are producing two cool new apps our backers will love:  \nAutomatic Baking:\nBaking based on weight is a simple yet precise method of baking. We are creating an app that will contain a variety of recipes based on the automatic baking concept. \nSmoothie Maker/Cocktail Maker:  \nLike automatic baking. Follow simple weight-based recipes for delicious and healthy cocktails and smoothies.\nWhat's your favourite?\nWe love to hear from our backers. We are going to take a poll after the campaign to determine our backers favorite apps. Then make them a reality.\nWhen an object is placed on the surface, the top layer deforms. Weighing sensors under the cover detect slight deformations in the material.The force experienced by each Weighitz is measured and sent to the smartphone.\nDepending on the app module you choose, the individual weights, combined weight or just raw readings can be viewed.\nSingle Scale ____________________ Set of Weighitz\nWe designed Weighitz to be attractive in any kitchen whilst being sturdy enough to be thrown in a gym bag.\nWe have optimized the dimensions to be sleek enough to fit into your pocket. A wide enough surface to hold the average kitchen plate/bowl & high enough to hold up a fabric suitcase\n0.90\"/2.3cm high - Required to keep larger pots/bowls and fabric suitcases from touching the ground when weighing.  \n3.19\"/8.1 cm Wide - Designed to be wide enough for a single unit to hold an average sized plate, bowl, large glass.\nDesigned for use in the kitchen and on the go. Weighitz are water resistant to IP4 level. This means you can wash them with a wet sponge but not submerge them in water.\nThe miniature design and magnetic base make for easy storage. Place them on the fridge for easy access.\nLow power consumption and high capacity batteries combine so you rarely have to recharge. When required, plug in the micro USB cable and attach to your computer or wall socket. An indicator will light up when charged.\nMicro-indents in the top and bottom surfaces make Weighitz non-slip. This makes it easy to place larger dishes on Weighitz with confidence.\nBLE allows communication between the Weighitz and your smart device. BLE uses little energy which gives Weighitz a long battery life. BLE has a large range (approx 100m) which allows for remote weighing.\n     Each Weighitz scale can weigh a wide range of weights with high accuracy and resolution. Each Weighitz can weigh up to 90lb with a resolution of 0.0002lb. \nRange and Resolution\n    PLAY\n\nPlace a weight on a Weighitz and it sends that measurement to our application on your smart device. Our app will display the readings in both metric and imperial units. \nPLAY\n\nWeighitz connects to your smart device through Bluetooth low energy (BLE). This allows us to connect multiple devices at once.\nPLAY\n\n  Each Weighitz will come in a choice of colors. Red, Blue, Green and Black. \nChoose a single color or a variety of colors for sets. You will then receive.\n A set of Weighitz will come with a single micro USB cable and plug.

That didn't work out, but since then we've pushed forward all the way to LA, bringing the product to the TBS show America's Greatest Makers. We were selected as one of the top 24 makers in the USA and got the support and advice of U.C. Berkeley, Haas School of Business, and some of Intel's best engineers. With their help, we've developed this to the point that we're finally happy and ready for a full product launch.\"\nOriginal Product Video:\nPLAY\n\nWe spent a long time refining and testing Weighitz.\nPrototyping\n And finally came up with an amazing product. \nNow we need your backing to help us bring this product to life and mass manufacture - so don't forget to take advantage of our excellent early bird prices and back us now.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"There are risks and challenges in all hardware projects, but we are mitigating them by working with some excellent manufacturing consultants.\n\nFor instance, our devices use Bluetooth and will need certification in all the regions we sell in.

The only way to get a display that is perfect for you is to build your own - a challenging project requiring both hardware and programming skills. That's why we created Wave.\nWe designed BreadBro Wave to help you easily create beautiful, musically reactive LED art projects while you learn about computer programming and electronics hardware. After completing a project with Wave, not only will you have a beautiful piece of LED art, you'll also have an Open Source development board for any project you can imagine. \nWhile you build your project, you'll be learning the fundamentals of computer programming with Arduino, a programming language similar to C++. Even if you've never written a line of code before, Wave can help you create any musical light show that you can imagine.\n  Wave makes it possible for beginners to create compelling LED projects, even with no prior experience, by building on the tools of the Open Source Hardware Community. Wave is built on an Arduino Uno R3 Footprint, and is compatible with Arduino shields and software.\nArduino makes it easy for you to upload small computer programs to a small computer chip. This chip can then control any electronic component - motors, buzzers, transmitters, LEDs, and much more.\nThis means that Wave can be programmed with the popular Arduino development environment, and that all the community resources of Arduino are fully compatible with Wave. If you need to, you can use Wave just like you would any other Arduino Uno R3.\nIf you've never written a computer program before, don't worry - we'll be providing a comprehensive set of both text- and video-based instructions and lessons. \nTo use wave, simply plug it into your computer via a USB cable. Next, connect it to an audio source and a RGB LED strip. Start playing audio and watch the show!\nNext, launch the Arduino software, and follow along as we help you build your own custom LED control software. Not only will you be learning computer programming - you'll be creating your own personal light show.\nAs you learn more and more about programming, you may want to use Wave as a standard Arduino. No problem - just disconnect your LED strip and audio cable, then use Wave as you would any other Arduino. When you're done, simply re-upload your LED firmware and carry on.\n  BreadBro Wave makes a great addition to any Maker's toolkit. \nWave is an Arduino Uno R3 - Compatible development board with an Atmel ATMega328P-AU microcontroller. USB-to-serial conversion is provided by an FTDI FT231XS-R IC. VIN from either header pin or barrel jack is regulated by an LM1117 5V LDO. Combined, these components provide a high-quality Uno R3 compatible development board.\nAn onboard 3.5mm TRRS headphone jack provides an easy way to provide any type of audio input. In the production version, we'll be providing both an \"In\" and \"Out\" headphone jack, to eliminate the need for a audio y-splitter. Left and right audio channels from the headphone jack are solder-selectable.\nAn MSGEQ7 Spectrum Analyzer IC by Mixed Signals provides hardware analysis of the input audio signal. The MSGEQ7 can be controlled using only around a dozen lines of code in your Arduino sketch. It provides seven analog values corresponding to the amplitude of specific frequency ranges.\nFinally, an Onboard JST Connector provides an easy way to interface with WS2812B RGB LED strips, matrices, or modules. a provided inline 470-ohm resistor and 47uF electrolytic capacitor provide the recommended protection circuit for all WS2812B applications.\nWave takes a common project - sound-responsive LED artwork - and puts the necessary hardware on a board that can always be used as a standard Arduino clone. Save some space and reclaim your breadboard while keeping your artwork in place!\n      BreadBro Wave is at an advanced stage of development. Our prototypes have been validated and we've ordered proofs of our final PCB design. We're launching this Kickstarter to help validate the market and to help figure out how many Waves we should build.\nAll BreadBro Technology products are hand-assembled in our facility in Austin, Texas. The only major component that we don't manufacture ourselves are depopulated circuit boards. This assembly method allows us to have complete control over testing, quality control, and supply chain. \nThe funds from this Kickstarter Campaign will be used towards PCBs and components for assembly. Once the PCBs arrive, we will begin shipment in weekly batches of approximately 25 Waves per batch. As always, we'll keep you updated on our campaign, website, and social media platforms. Fulfillment should begin by the end of October.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any hardware startup, Wave faces some risks. One risk that we may face is delays in the manufacturing process.\n\nWe have mitigated this risk by taking complete control of our sourcing and assembly process. Other than bare PCBs, we assemble each and every Wave in a garage in Austin, Texas. We handle all of our sourcing directly with major domestic suppliers to ensure a steady supply chain. \n\nAnother risk that Wave may face is in scaling. We are constantly identifying and quantifying any risk factors that may present themselves as we scale, particularly in labor and logistics. Even if our volume exceeds what we're capable of building right now, Wave's pricing model accounts for labor, facilities, and variable costs. \n\nThanks for your interest in BreadBro Wave.

Raspberry Shake is a single channel electronically extended 4.5 Hz geophone with an 24 bit digitizer sampled at 50 sps (samples per second) with the data presented in miniSEED format. What a mouth full!\nIn other words, Raspberry Shake is sensor-digitizer that records earthquakes from about magnitude 2 and higher within a radius of 50 miles, and a magnitude 4 and higher in a radius of 300 miles. It will also record earthquakes of larger magnitudes farther away but it will miss some of the subtleties. Raspberry Shake can detect and record short period (0.5 - 15 Hz) earthquakes; the farther away an earthquake, the less of that range of frequencies can be recorded.\nRaspberry Shake is the little brother of the famous and popular OSOP Sixaola short-period six-channel seismograph.\nThe data will be displayed with the versatile SWARM software written for the USGS Alaska Volcano Observatory. This is open and free software.\n  Raspberry Shake, your personal seismograph\n        Raspberry Shake has two main components:\n1) The main sensor is a geophone, a microphone for the vibrations of the earth. Geophones have been used for decades in the geophysical and oil exploration business. A geophone is a small can about the size of a salt shaker. There is a coil that moves in relation to a magnet and creates a small current.\n2) The Amplifier, digitizer and ARM processor.\nThe small current mentioned above is then amplified with some ultra-quiet state of the art op amps. Once amplified, the signal is digitized, then that data are shipped to the ARM processor and bundled into one-second packets that are shipped to your Raspberry Pi.\nThe Raspberry Pi time-stamps the data and stores it in a seismic industry standard format and sends it in answer to client requests. Those requests are displayed on your smartphone or computer monitor. The complete system is called a seismograph.\nThe Raspberry Shake is for any person who would like to \u201csee\u201d the vibrations that are all around us but are generally not felt. ANY felt vibration whether it is a truck or a tremor will be detected by your Raspberry Shake. It's fun to make, fun to program, fun to watch the tremors and fun to review all of the recorded vibrations of the day on one screen.\nIf you don't have a Raspberry Pi yet, take a look to our \"Magnitude 9.0 reward.\"\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the size and the price. Raspberry Shake is better than many of short-period seismometers in current use by the local networks of the USGS and many developing countries. Several software vendors have, for the first time, provided personal no-cost licenses for this project.\nRaspberry Shake will make observatory quality data that can be shared in the worldwide standard SEED format. All modern automated seismology programs used by observatories can use the data from the Raspberry Shake. It's the Volkswagen of seismometers - yes there are Lamborgini seismographs but both the Lamborghini and the Volkswagen will get you from point A to point B.\nThese are some of the features included:\nDisplay data in real time locally or remotely, which means you can place your Raspberry Shake in a quiet location and see the data via internet. \nStore data in SEED format (Standard for Exchange of Earthquake Data). \nAllow sharing of real time data. Seedlink Protocol. Send alarms by email or Telegram. Off-the-shelf parts.\nSupport by email and Whatsapp. \nCreats daily wave summary as a helicorder or spectrogram.\nDisplay-quality case. \nIndustrial quality geophone sensor. \nIndustrial quality 4 layer board and surface mount components.\nThe Raspberry Shake board has four major circuit blocks:\nThe power conditioning section.\nThe analog front end with the signal conditioners and the amplifiers.\nThe digitizer section where the analog signals are converted to ones and zeros.\nThe main processor where the digital signals are bundled and sent via RS232 to the Raspberry Pi.\nDevice specifications\nThe Raspberry Shake shield is compatible with almost all Raspberry Pi models. With any Raspberry Pi B, B+, 2 B and 3 you should be able to see waves coming from Raspberry Shake. \nThe shield uses only three signal connections in addition to the Power and Ground pins.\nRaspberry Shake graphic device specifications\nThis is how you connect your Raspberry Shake to Raspberry Pi. Just plug it into the top of the Raspberry Pi's 40 pin header (or the 26 pin header for other models).\nRaspberry Shake is a module easy to plug into your Raspberry Pi\n On the 40 pin header the Raspberry Shake use five pins:\nPower / RPi Pin 2 \nGround / RPi Pin 6 \nTX / RPi Pin 8 \nRX / RPi Pin 10 \nReset / RPi Pin 15 / GPIO 22\nAll other pins are unused. As you can see, if you are a tinkerer, a maker, a hobbyist or an EE you can connect the Raspberry Shake to any single board computer that has TX/RX.\n  The Raspberry Shake team has huge experience creating seismometers (we do it for a living) and it's our passion. We have all kinds of instruments and are constantly seeking ways to make more and better ones.\nThe Raspberry Shake is a little brother of a seismograph for local and regional earthquakes that our team makes for universities and national seismic observatories. We sell one model for several thousand dollars. We have taken the same geophone sensor, made the electronics a bit simpler and mounted it all on a Raspberry Pi. Then adapted the software to work on the Raspberry Pi. Once that was done, we could use Open Source Software used by the USGS. The data is stored in a format fully compatible with the USGS and seismic observatories all over the world. If you choose, you can share your data with the rest of the world.\nAlong with the book Personal Seismology you can learn the basics of recognizing small local and regional earthquakes. In many cases these quakes are undetectable because the government observatories don\u2019t have enough stations and the detectable energy from small quakes does not travel far.\nYou can set up a web page that shows the data in the form of a helicorder and share that data. The USGS program Heli_ewII makes the capture of the data for daily helicorders and web page creation easy.\nSeveral small earthquakes\nIn the image below you can see several small earthquakes, once you know what to look for. With other tools covered in the book Personal Seismology you can expand and analyze those small quakes.\nSWARM graphic interface in helicorder mode\nThe figure above shows the graphic user interface that has been produced by the USGS\u2019s famous and popular program called SWARM (which you will download for free). What you see is 24 hours of continuous data in a format that used to be called a helicorder and some seismologists now call a webicorder. The red indicators show where certain user-selectable limits were exceeded and are small earthquakes. The expanded section shows a \u201ctext book\u201d local earthquake about 30 kilometers away and around a magnitude 3. The book Personal Seismology will explain how to use SWARM and how to estimate the distance and magnitude. \nRaspberry Shake will allow you to monitor ground motion from your computer terminal or smartphone. You will be able to record the motion of 24 hours for your review in a single screen and examine close-up any little portion of the recording.\nComparison between Raspberry Shake (upper) and Nanometric Trillium Compact (lower)\nThe image above shows how your Raspberry Shake roughly compares to a $50,000 professional seismograph. The upper expanded image is from a Raspberry Shake and the lower expanded image is from a Nanometric Trillium Compact broadband sensor connected to a Kenda Earthdata true 24 bit digitizer. Both charts show the same regional earthquake.\nBeing able to do this is simply remarkable. Just a few years ago it was possible with massive investments that only governments and universities could afford. Raspberry Shake brings this ability to everyone.\nMovers and Shakers: Thanks for your contribution! Get updates, and be on the Movers and Shakers section of our website.\nThis is the complete guide to personal seismology with your Raspberry Shake. We explain in simple non-technical terms and many examples what you see and how to interpret it. It covers all aspects of enjoying your Raspberry Shake. You will also be on our Movers and Shakers section.\nThis is our main benefit. This board plugs right on to Raspberry Pi and start sends data through the RS232 serial port.\n If you already have your Raspberry Pi, this reward is for you. You get the Raspberry Shake board and the seismic sensor, the geophone. These are brand new and tested to make sure that you get the most out of your seismograph.\nThis gives you everything except for the Raspberry Pi itself. Add the RPi and things will boot right up.\n  How you assemble your Raspberry Shake kit\nThis is the full meal deal, ready to run right out of the box. You get a fully functional seismograph that is better than what some third world observatories have. It includes all of the hardware and all of the software. You can be up and running in no time. You will also get direct personal support via the community forum, email and Whatsapp.\nThe team at OSOP is 14 members strong! Only four of us are directly working on Raspberry Shake, but we could not do it without the rest of the team, especially the programmers. Raspberry Shake utilizes several thousand hours of code that OSOP has produced and many many more hours of other people's open source code. 95% of the work is in the software and it is the software that makes Raspberry Shake special. Raspberry Shake speaks in the language of SEED: Standard for Exchange of Earthquake Data. This language makes it a real seismograph and not a curiosity that makes wiggly lines. We especially thank the team that wrote GFZ Seiscomp 2.6 and the team that wrote USGS SWARM. Special thanks to OSOP team members Dave, Thomas and Branden. \n  $15,000 We will write the software so you can securely share your data through a central server with other Raspberry Shake users and national seismic observatories. Even more importantly, the data from your Shake will be available to the USGS and other national seismic networks.\n$25,000 We will make a website to display all the shared Raspberry Shake stations around the world on an interactive web-based real-time world map.\n$50,000 We will provide real time automatic global earthquake locations on your computer using your Raspberry Shake, other Raspberry Shakes and open seismic stations. This will be a better network than many nations had just a scant 10 years ago. $50,000 will make this happen!\nMost of the work is done. Raspberry Shake is working. Most of the components are off the shelf: geophone, RPi. We make the acrylic box in our shops. This Kickstarter campaign will allow us to make the production version of the Raspberry Shake board. We will also unify all the little bits of software and get them to be nice to each other.\nWe will have product in the mail late October or early November, in time for gift-giving. Here is our timeline:\nThank you so much for checking us out! We hope to have you on board very soon. Please drop us a line or leave a comment in the campaign if you have any questions, we would be happy to help you.\n   Check out our Press Kit: https://github.com/osopsa/raspberryshake-press-releases", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don\u2019t see much risk but of course it exists. Most of the viewing and analysis software is already in day to day scientific use by the USGS. When we raise our pledge amount we will have enough funds for the first run of boards, and after that it is mostly carpentry. Most of the risk is in terms of delays in time to delivery; everything will be on track if we make no changes to the hardware and do not add any new software. As makers we always want to tinker and improve things and I know that we are looking at some different op amp. We promise to weigh every decision in relation to the promised delivery time. We will post updates often.\n\nWe promise that when we make our goal, all of our supporters will get their Raspberry Shake, and we will also give you any and all the support you need to get it up and running.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "I love it", "descp": "Movers and Shakers: Thanks for your contribution!

We received a lot of feedback from our awesome user community and in 2014 we launched our second successful Kickstarter for the RoVa3D - the updated version of our 5 extruder system. We delivered every 3D printer pledged for from both of those campaigns!! And we've since sold many hundreds more of the RoVa3D and had 2 more years of market feedback from our growing customer base. Well, you've spoken and we've listened again. We are here today to introduce you to our 6th generation 3D printer: The RoVa4D\nYour TV is full color, your cell phone is full color, your office paper printer is full color, shouldn't your 3D printer be full color too?\nWe think so! That is why we have added this new dimension to our newest 3D printer.\n  ********UPDATE since launching the campaign: We have decided with the input from our current backers that we will increase the print height to 18 inches!  The build volume is now 12 x 12 x 18 instead of 12 x 12 x 12! ********\n    What is Full Color Blending?\nThe RoVa4D works by extruding separate cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and white filaments into a single patent pending hot end where they are blended together and deposited from a single nozzle. This works similarly to your inkjet printer at home except that we also need white filament, since we aren't printing on paper.  This lets you print unlimited colors in a single print. The materials can be printed with a gradient or as hard separations. The printer switches colors by purging the difference in a little bin (just like your inkjet) or to reduce the waist the transition can happen inside the infill area of the print provided that it's large enough. The RoVa4D has 3 separate hot ends.  One is capable of printing in any color, hue, tone, tint or shade. The second one is dedicated to flexible materials like Ninjaflex, and the third one is dedicated to dissolvable support material.  If you want you can switch between all three during a single print. \nHow Does it Work?\nWhat about Blending Materials?\nNot only can it blend CMYK+W to create any color in the rainbow, but our new printer can ALSO blend PLA based materials, like hard and soft to create an infinitely variable hardness of material.  Five different materials go into one hot end and they are mixed together to produce new material. Combining these together you can create hybrids of each one. It works the same as the color, but instead of creating a new color, they blend together and create a material with new properties.\nDuring our Kickstarter you have the choice to include with your reward either a CMYK+W filament pack (5 in total), or the multi-material pack which will include: Carbon Fiber, Wood, Transparent, Metal Filled (sinterable metal), and Soft Material (5 in total). Or you can choose to get both so you can switch between color mixing and material mixing (please see the information regarding rewards further down the page).  You can also substitute other PLA based materials yourself, but the base polymers have to be compatible and that may require some testing. These are just the ones that we are supplying, that we have tested.\nSaves you Money in Printing Materials:\nWhat we think is the absolute best feature of the printer is the ability to choose any color you want. You can color match to a picture and have the correct colors instantaneously without needing to shop around on the web trying to find the right ones.It eliminates the problem of buying a specific color of filament to print one small part and then having to store it on the shelf because you don't have an immediate use for it, or perhaps it ended up not being the color you wanted after all.  What a waste of money!  Because now you are onto ordering the next color you need or want to try. Or perhaps it is the complete opposite and you find yourself in the middle of a print and you run out of the color you special ordered in and have to go re-order only to find that when it arrives it is a different shade because it was made in a different batch, but sold as the same product. Again, what a waste of money and time spent waiting.\nThat's the value proposition. With this printer you will get consistency in color, and you can just pick the color you need from an infinite pallet. It's easier and faster. Pick the colors calibrated to the Pantone scale or use the rgb or cmyk codes from a color picker. Finally the things you print can look like the things you wanted to print. It's one less step of processing. You don't have to paint your models after the fact they simply come off the bed completed.\nOne color is no longer boring when every print can be a different custom color on the fly.  We've taken 3D printing and added a new dimension to it. Color. What if you printed a fish in a green ocean because you ran out of blue. The effect would be devastating. (Trust us, we've been there).\nFor schools it adds one more step of involvement in that the students can color the models and contribute more to the process.\nImagine how much more organized and efficient your filament stock room can be if you only need to stock 5 colors and from those 5 you can produce ANY color, hue, tint, shade, or tone in the rainbow!\nSimplified Work Flow:\nOne of the biggest complaints we got about our 5 nozzle printer was that there aren't enough 5 color models out there. (Well that's not really about the printer but we solved that problem anyway.) In the past in order to produce a multi-colored part you would need to have a model that would have multiple segments. The printer wouldn\u2019t know which color was loaded into a particular extruder, so you had to make sure it was loaded with the correct color into the correct extruder. Once that was done you then assigned that extruder to a particular part, so that when it was printing that part of the model the printer would use that extruder and therefore that color would come through. You almost have to be a graphic design artist in order to be able to do that.\nWith our Simplified Work Flow, what we have done is make it so that you can take any single body model (like the millions that are available on Thingiverse and on the web), and color them in one of 2 ways:\n1.) You can simply wrap any picture onto the model - you can take a photo or something you have designed in Photoshop like a logo, and wrap it onto any shape like a vase, block, etc.\n2.) You can paint the model with a size variable brush using a color picking wheel, and selecting the color in the computer, virtually painting it so that when you print it \u2013 it will print in those exact colors. You don\u2019t need to switch out the filaments to get those colors. You simply leave the CMYKW loaded in the machine, ready to print. The printer knows which color is in each of the extruders and it knows which extruder is for cyan, which is for magenta, etc. It combines in the ratio that is required for that color into the mixing chamber where it is mixed/blended together to produce the new color, and that is what comes out of the nozzle and is what is printed.  We've made it really easy to make ANY 3D model into a multi-color model. It's so easy that anyone can do it. It's as simple as:\n1) Pick your model 2) Paint the model 3) Print the model\nJust 3 simple steps and every model is a full color model! You will find that the process is not only fun but also easy enough for a child to use. Now everyone can easily use this new printer to create full color 3D prints even if they aren't a graphic designer.\nExample of Painting a Gecko:\n More models painted and ready to print:\nSome sample prints:\n** For even more print samples make sure to go through our updates!\n  Working on Color Matching:\nWe Love a Challenge:\nPrototype Video Footage:\n** For even more print videos make sure to check out all of the updates!\n   \nCommercial Quality at Maker Prices:\nIf you have seen our printers before you know our printers are made to last, and that every component of our printers has been custom engineered. \nThe Frame: The printer frame is STRONG! It is not just an all metal frame. It is \u00bc inch aerospace grade aluminum, anodized to perfection and reinforced by a \u00bd inch aluminum internal frame with rear metal cross braces (Like how you would reinforce the back end of a racing car.) We do all of this so that you can run it really fast with a head that is fed with 7 separate extruders without it wobbling around \u2013 it is still rock solid.\nWe are incorporating what we learned over 6 generations of 3d printer designs to improve the basic geometry of the printer to get the maximum build volume into the minimum foot print.\nEnclosure: One of the other things that customers asked for was a smaller enclosure, so we went to a core x/y system , so that it\u2019s not only a smaller enclosure but now the print bed only moves up and down on the z and the print head moves in the x/y axis. Core x/y is more accurate and more repeatable than any other linear motion system.\nThe enclosure is part of the printer and further stiffens the entire chassis. The printer is also impact tested according to the safety standards for use in a home, school, or office. The enclosure is also lockable and will fail in a locked position. If it is hot inside it will not be allowed to open until the printer is stationary and cooled down. (See Update #5)\nGears & Pulleys:  We don\u2019t 3d print the components that are on our printers, we have them injection molded or machined from aluminum. That makes them significantly stronger. All of our gears are stainless steel, our pulleys are metal, the belts we use are designed for linear motion.\n  Hot ends: Our hot ends are also made of aluminum so they heat up very quickly. They have powerful heaters in them, and our nozzles are zinc coated copper, so they are durable as well as great heat conductors. The best that any metal can be. And they seal more easily and don\u2019t leak, because they use a proprietary gasket technology to seal them.\nDedicated Nozzles: There is a dedicated nozzle for support material and one for flexible material.  The reason these are separate is because the base polymers of different materials don\u2019t play nicely with the PLA of the full color nozzles. In order to print completely different materials they have to be separate hot ends.  We have engineered them to have the best optimal performance for those particular materials. Our Ninjaflex extruder and hot end were engineered specifically to print in flexible materials. They print easily and fast. If you were to mix them into our full color hot end, they would need to be printed at such vastly different temperatures that it would be impossible. Because we have separate hot ends and because of our liquid cooling system we are able to keep each of the hot ends at precisely the temperature that they are set to. The dissolvable support material hot end can be at 160 Celsius, and the full color hot end can be at 210. The liquid cooling system is so efficient it will allow them to maintain that precise separation between their temperatures. Having three hot ends that are dedicated to different materials will allow you to print materials that are completely incompatible with each other, all in the same print.\nLiquid Cooling: All hot ends have a hot and a cold section and our competition uses air cooling which leads to jamming problems. The enclosure is sealed so it gets hot inside, this helps to prevent warping of the printed parts but if you use a fan to cool the hot end inside the enclosure you are just blowing hot air.  We employ a liquid cooling system that circulates cold water through the hot end, and pumps the heat out of the enclosure where it is cooled in an external radiator (kind of like your car).  This is far more efficient than a fan, and eliminates issues like jamming that our competition suffers from.\nBuild Volume: You can print any object that is up to 12 inches x12 inches x18 inches. The actual build volume is closer to 12.5 inches on the X and Y. Why? Because you can\u2019t use 12 inches on the X/Y/Z if it is actually only 12 inches, as you cannot print right on the edge. So we are giving you a buffer so that you can actually print 12 x 12 x 18!\n Geckotek Plates: They are interchangeable plates for different materials so you don\u2019t have to prepare the beds yourself, and after the print is finished if you are going to do multiple back to back prints you can leave the bed hot, take the plate off to cool down, and put another plate on and just keep printing. Print materials stick so well there is no warping or delamination that can occur on the bed \u2013 it\u2019s amazing and we love this product - which is why we are including it in every order.\nRoVa3D Full Color Blender Features:\nSome of the amazing features of the RoVa4D include: automatic bed leveling, auto nozzle height control, electronic offset control, heated bed, tool-less setup, liquid cooling for jam free prints, all-metal 450C hot ends, automatic print layer cooling fan, wireless full color touch screen, wi-fi printing and video updates, and a full metal frame, stainless steel gears, and a 12X12X12 inch build volume.

This campaign is to get the ball rolling.\nI wanted a robot arm. But even the kits are expensive, for what they deliver. So one weekend I grabbed a few high strength microservos and went to work designing the parts to have printed.\nAt the end of the weekend I had a couple of different versions of the robot. I took it to work and everyone loved to play with it and I soon had a couple of people ask me to print them one.\nFirst 2-DOF Prototype\n  The first prototype\nLater, I was doing some demonstrations for STEM teachers. They also loved the idea, and they asked me to make them some for their classes. \nSo I decided to turn my little maker project into an actual product at Slant Robotics.\nThis campaign is to raise funds for building software and tutorials on using the arm and to purchase several 3-D printers and other supplies in order to produce the arms in greater quantities. \n3-D printed\nThe LittleArm is a completely open source project. I made it 3-D printed so that anyone can download the parts and start using it. It also ensures that the arm can be rapidly changed and developed for different applications, without being constrained by molds.\nArduino\nThe arm is controlled entirely by an Arduino Uno. The Uno provides a decent amount of support and is very versatile. These qualities allow almost anyone to start programming the arm and add other features like sensors.\nArduino is also supported on platforms such as Blockly,  so beginners can write programs graphically.\nInterchangeable End-Effectors\nThe arm is designed to have a modular gripper. While there is a servo to actuate a gripper I have also designed several rigid end-effectors for different tasks.\n  Wrist, Claw, and Hook\nSoftware\nIf you want to use the GUI or create some other complex program, you need more than the Arduino. All other software, is entirely based in Python. Python is a simple language to learn and has a large amount of support.\nMost of the foundational programs have been created. Kinematics are done. We have a basic GUI. And best of all we have a \"record\" function so you can train the robot to perform a task and then watch it go.\nThat is the start, but honestly the number of programs that can be created for an arm like this is big.\nWe could set-up a webcam and add vision. We could have some basic sensors so that it follows a laser pointer. We could make it play with a ball. (Oh wait, we did that)\nBut in order to create all of those programs we need a little money and a bit of help. We would love it if anyone who is interested in the project shares their code with us on our website.\nEarly Version of GUI\nWebsite\nWe have already created a basic website to support the arm. It started as a project blog, so it is a bit rough. But we are working on getting it upgraded.\nIn the future the website will contain all resources needed to build, work with, and teach with the LittleArm.\nUses\nSTEM\nSo many of the programming kits out there are just too complicated and quickly become boring. How many times does it take to make a robot follow a line before the kids decide the idea is stupid? Plus many of those \"build\" kits just have a bunch of pieces waiting to be lost.\nThis arm is a great kit that doesn't have many pieces to lose, can take a kid through every part of engineering, from design to programming, and always has something else to add.\nImagine a class project where kids have to create an assembly line with their robot arms. Or they create a small group of synchronized dancing robots. Maybe they train the robot to feed the science class lizard. While this arm is simple it can do a ton of stuff.\nHobby\nThere are a lot of hobby arms out there. But they are all expensive, and they are really not very helpful because they depend on a 'community' to make it interesting. \nThis arm is so basic that anyone with a any kind of experience can easily create programs from scratch. And while we like and want a community, it is not a necessity to use this arm.\nResearch\nYes, that is what was just said. This arm can be used for a number of different research purposes. In fact I am working on a small project in deep learning right now with the arm. It is a whole lot easier to test software on this arm than on a large industrial robot. And since deep learning requires data, it is a lot cheaper to get 100 of these arms to provide data than a single industrial arm.\nBut that is all nerd stuff. No one really cares about that.\nActual Home Use\nHave you ever forgotten to feed the fish. This arm could be programmed to do it. Maybe someone at the table needs a mint. This arm could broach the subject.  Maybe it could scratch your cat's belly. Maybe it could put the sugar in your coffee. Maybe you need a Rube Goldberg method of turning on a light.\nWe don't expect anyone to make these an official part of their home. This section is just an excuse to present some other ideas.\nWhat is Included in a Kit\n4 MG90S metal-geared microservos\n1 Arduino Uno (unless ordering Brainless)\nAll required fasteners and connectors\n1 6V power supply\n1 mini breadboard\nAll 3D printed components (colors vary)\n1 actuated gripper assembly\n1 pen-holding gripper\nConnector wires for breadboard\nAll the Parts in the Kit (Minus the Tools)\n Other Rewards\nBuild the Uprising T-Shirt\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in robotics for nearly ten years. This project is basic.\n\nI have already sourced all the materials and resources and am ready to upload the files to the printer to start making preorders. Additionally since it is being supported by Slant Robotics there are a lot of resources and talent to draw from within the business.\n\nThe largest challenge will be creating enough tutorials and software to make this robot easy and fun to learn on. That will be an ongoing process but the architecture has been laid out and a lot of those resources have already been created. Right now an eighth grade kid could learn to use what we have available. We're trying to get it down to a 3rd grade kid, or lower.\n\nWe have detailed how to use Blockly for the robot and are creating web interfaces to eliminate the need for configuring python on the computer. And there is a small online video class in the works to walk anyone through the entire robot.\n\nThe largest challenge on the hardware side is printing the arms in quantity. Printing can be unreliable. But we have designed several new methodologies for ensuring quality prints most of the time. This ensures that we can use printing at a greater scale.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Thanks", "descp": "A shout-out on Twitter from Slant Robotics thanking you for your support", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2016"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "\"Build The Uprising\" T-Shirt", "descp": "For those that don't want a robot but want to be a part of creating low cost robots.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (10 left of 10)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 42 or more", "title": "LittleArm Brainless: Take 2", "descp": "Didn't get here in time for the early-bird?

It comes in two finishes, polished or a matte, bead blast, each giving the P1 its own distinct appearance.\nOverall dimensions are a compact 4.65\u201d (118mm) in length, with a diameter of 0.55\u201d (14mm) and weight of 1.7 oz (48g). This makes the P1 a perfect fit for every day carry. \nThe pen retracts using an intuitive, bolt action mechanism. Moving the bolt over presents the pen tip and a small red dot indicates the P1 is live and ready to write.\nThe P1 ships with a waterproof fine, black Lamy M22 rollerball insert. The refill is readily available and comes in different tip sizes as well as blue. The conical end of the pen has a long thread to ensure it securely holds the components in place. Thin grooves have been machined into the body to provide comfort and grip.\nThe water resistant flashlight module is fastened to the body with a combined magnet and twist lock feature, allowing it to be used both as a single piece or on its own.\nThe circuit is based around a CREE XP-G2 emitter, chosen for its small yet powerful specifications. There are two modes available by a twist interface. Turning the grippy, knurled bezel, step-cycles through a low, 9 lumen mode and up to a high 130 lumen mode.\nA single 10180 battery powers the light.

This includes Raspberry Pi, Crumble, Arduino, ESP8266, micro:bit and Codebug.\nCrumbleBot with McRoboFace\n  Pictures of Prototypes in the Wild\nTim Morley\nTim and his 10 year old son are making a great robot project using a Raspberry Pi, Picon Zero and McRoboFace.\n\n  Robin Newman has designed a circuit to extract the volume from an audio signal so that his McRoboFace can sing along to Bach! Also, the clip below shows 2 McRoboFaces talking to each other, using SonicPi. How cool is that?\nYou can now select a pledge reward that includes the components shown in the video for the Singalong project:\n400 point Breadboard\nCapacitors and resistors\nBreadboard friendly trimming potentiometer\n3.5mm stereo jack lead\nMale-Female Jumper leads\nPushbutton with cap\nNote that the Picon Zero is NOT included in the kit. Other ADC boards for the Pi are also available\n.\nYou can use McRoboFace to make programming the BBC micro:bit  even more fun:\nPLAY\n\nWhy not code your micro:bit and McRoboFace to react to being shaken or tapped? Maybe it should turn blue if it gets cold, or red when hot?\n.\nWhat's in a Name?\nWhen the prototype was shown, there were a number of comments that the fun name \"McRoboFace\" was simply \"too silly\" :-(\nSo every backer has one vote to choose the final name for the product. This name will be printed on the back of the PCB and on the packaging. You can choose from\nMcRoboFace\nRoboFace\nEach backer, whatever the pledge level, gets one vote. If you want to help select the name, then please pledge! When you have pledged, send a direct email with your vote.\n.\nTechnical Details\nMcRoboFace has 17 fully addressable LEDs. These will be WS2812B or SK6812 (fully compatible products).\nMcRoboFace is made on a White PCB with ENIG (gold) plating for reliability\nDimensions: 50 x 40mm\n3 mounting holes for M2.5 screws\nMouth comprises 14 LEDs, each 3.5mm square\nNose is a single LED, 3.5mm square\nTwo LEDs for eyes, both 5mm square\n4 Pads to connect: 5V, Ground, Data In and Data Out (for daisy-chaining to another McRoboFace or other \"neopixel\" strip)\nEach McRoboFace will be supplied fully assembled and we will include a 4-way right-angle male header which you can solder on if required. This makes it easy to plug directly into a breadboard.\n.\nWhy Run a Kickstarter Campaign?\nAlthough this is a simple project, we need to have a fully automated process in place to manufacture them to ensure that all pixels are working correctly from the start. To do this, we need to place a minimum order of 1000 units. If you want this product to be available, please support it and pass the message on.\n.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is actually a simple project and the prototypes are fully working. The manufacturer has already quoted for various quantities and we can go ahead as soon as funding is confirmed. We will be able to ship within about 4 weeks of placing the order with the manufacturers.\n\n4tronix is a successful business and already has the systems in place for shipping worldwide, so we don't expect any issues there.\n\nThe manufacturer will test every pixel on every unit made. The test includes separate Red, Green and Blue as well as a combined White test. There should be no problems with faulty pixels, but we will also do a random test at 4tronix as a double-check before we ship.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "Earlybird Single McRoboFace", "descp": "A single McRoboFace from the first batch.

And because it has the same processor and pinout, all libraries written for the Zero will work on the Neutrino without any modification!\nFinally, being open-source, you're free to modify it as you wish and integrate it into your own designs - without ever needing to pay any royalties or licensing fees!\nWhat's new with version 2.0?\nThe new version of the Neutrino adds RX/TX pins that were often requested, and is designed to be a bit cheaper to manufacture so that I can continue to offer them at this price point. The USB OTG circuit, which required a costly power multiplexing chip, buffer, and transistor, has been replaced with an inexpensive very low forward voltage diode to isolate the battery from the USB supply. The micro AB connector has also been replaced with a less expensive, but just as sturdy, micro B house part. In addition, the 3.3V LDO regulator, reset button, and status LED have also been changed to house parts. But don't be alarmed; these aren't downgrades. The regulator is a nice modern Texas Instruments part, and the new reset button is slightly larger and has a nicer feel to it!\nThe Neutrino 2.0!\n  Technical Specs\nMicrocontroller: Atmel ATSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0+\nClock speed: 48 MHz\nOperating voltage: 3.3V\nI/O pin limits: 3.3V, 7 mA\nDigital I/O pins: 14, with 12 PWM\nAnalog input pins: 6, 12-bit ADC channels\nAnalog output pins: 1, 10-bit DAC\nFlash memory: 256 KB\nSRAM: 32 KB\nVoltage regulator: 3.7-5.5V input / 3.3V, 300mA output\nDimensions: 1.4 x 0.7\" (36mm x 18mm)\nNeutrino 2.0 PCB Layout\n  Programming\nProgramming is easy! Like most Arduinos, you simply plug the board into your PC using a micro USB cable, select the board you want to program, and hit the upload button in the IDE when you're ready. The Neutrino ships with the Zero bootloader installed, and most of the time it will auto-reset when the USB serial port is opened by the IDE, but in the event that this fails, you can always hit the reset button on the board to force it to enter bootloader mode after your program finishes compiling.\nThe Neutrino can be programmed with the Arduino IDE via USB, or with the Atmel ICE!\n  Programming is easy with the Arduino IDE!\nOther Features\nStatus LED\nLike most Arduinos, a green LED is connected to pin 13. This can be used as a status indicator, and on the Neutrino it functions as a power indicator as well; coming on automatically when power is applied to the board.\n10-bit DAC\nSay goodbye to the Tone() command forever! Turn your Neutrino into a virtuoso by connecting an amplifier to pin A0 an using the Audio library to play .WAV files with the built-in DAC!\nLiPo charger compatible\nNeed to use your Neutrino on the go?

Soon we'll be surrounded by small intelligent sensor nodes that analyze the environment and offer people more content on their smartphones.\nMany traditional proximity beacon products are already available, but what the market is truly lacking is a capable open-sourced device.\nWe decided to change this.\nA year ago we started a design process with one goal: to create a superior open-source sensor beacon platform to fulfill the needs of developers, makers, hobbyists, students, IoT companies and even normal people.\nWe managed to create one of the most advanced Bluetooth sensor products in the world.\n        What is it?\n  RuuviTag is a stand-alone Bluetooth 5 ready sensor beacon platform. It can be used as a standard Eddystone / iBeacon proximity beacon but it has the potential to be so much more.\nBy having a way to measure: \nAmbient temperature\nRelative humidity\nBarometric pressure\nAltitude\nAcceleration\nIt\u2019s possible to cover several use-cases. And no need to worry about charging the device: the battery has the potential to last up to 10 years depending on the SW used.\nRuuviTag is compatible with both Android (4.3.2 or higher) and iOS (8.0 or higher) mobile devices.\n   How to Use It?\nRuuviTag is an IoT beacon that can be used for almost anything. Sounds cool, huh?\n- I want one! But how can I use it? Give me an example.\nFair enough.\nWe've made it simple. No programming or electronics know-how is required to start with the device.\nWe've prepared ready-made applications for you to use. And this is just a start. RuuviTag will be a compatible platform with many great open-source projects such as BubblePy, Arduino IDE, Apache Mynewt etc. We also encourage all the backers to join our community.\n  Demo 1: A Weather Station\nApplication on this video is very simple but still extremely useful for everyone. Because the Tag is equipped with state-of-the-art environmental sensors, we decided to make it work as a personal weather station.\nIn this example the firmware application reads the sensor values, encodes the data using Base91 encoder and broadcasts the address in an Eddystone-URL frame. Nearby mobile phone sees the address and by clicking it, a simple JavaScript on our website decodes the data and shows it in a readable format.\nImagine all the possibilities this simple application enables!\nYou can put RuuviTags wherever you like to and check the sensor readings from your phone without:\npairing\nconnecting or \ninstalling a mobile application.\nAndroid phones (and iOS with Chrome installed) can natively show the nearby beacons.\nBy running this weather station firmware, the battery of the beacon can potentially last several years.\nGo ahead and check it out.\n  Demo 2: Configuring the Physical Web\nGoogle's Eddystone is a really powerful open-source beacon format.\nThis is a simple way to create the Physical Web applications of your own.\nJust set the beacon to broadcast a URL address pointing to a website of your choice. From the video, Joe put one in his vintage car making it convenient and handy for the lady looking to rent a car from her mobile phone.\nThe Eddystone-URL is one of the available frame types Eddystone protocol has. In this demo you can see how the device can be easily configured to broadcast a new URL.\nIt's also possible to take advantage of other geeky features (UID, TLM and EID) Eddystone has.\nConfiguration of the parameters is really easy using the GATT service enabled mobile application shown in the video.  \nSo many ways how to use the Physical Web. Maybe you would like to hide a treasure? We call it spontaneous geocaching.\n         The whole idea and technology behind the RuuviTag is bigger than that. Here's why:\n   1) The Physical Web\nYou may have heard of it. The Physical Web is one of Google's projects. ...and a very cool one.\nThe idea behind the Physical Web is that every object can have their own website. These objects are basically beacons that use Google's Eddystone protocol to broadcast URL addresses everyone can find.\nThe technology is new and we are one of the first ones taking advantage of it.\n  2) Web Bluetooth\nThis makes things even more interesting. The Web Bluetooth standard allows browsers to communicate with the beacons (two-way communication). This allows our Tag to be something more than just a simple beacon.\nAnd the best part is that it works without needing to install a mobile application.\nTo fully understand the possibilities this technology enables, this video gives a better (and easier) explanation:\n 3) Android Nearby\nOn this very moment, Google is rolling out a software update for the Android users with a new feature called Nearby. It makes user experience with nearby beacons seamless and is fully compatible with RuuviTags.\nNearby Notifications is a new feature allowing developers to tie an app or website to a BLE beacon and create contextual notifications, even with no app installed.\n   What we have created is a powerful open-source beacon platform to help you to take advantage of these new technologies.\n  ...and it's affordable!\n  Basic model (only nRF52832's internal temperature sensor)\n   Advanced model (with all the sensors). BME280 = temperature / humidity / air pressure. LIS2DH12 = 3-axis +-16G accelerometer. FYI: This model has totally three (3) temperature sensors onboard (nRF52 + BME280 + LIS2DH12).\n    Let's Support Education!\nDon't you think it would be great if students could experiment and learn IoT using cool devices like RuuviTag? We do.\nYou've got a chance to help by selecting one of the rewards where we promise to ship one RuuviTag+ to a random school. We are helping too by giving out devices for students to use.\nAn example: A super simple weather station that everyone can access.\nImagine one Tag with a several year battery life broadcasting sensor data outside a school. Students can check their phones for real-time weather information and learn of the possibilities technology enables -- both fun and educational.\nAnd this is just one of the numerous ways the Tag can be used. Older and more advanced young minds could learn by creating similar applications themselves or even create totally new, innovative hardware products.\nOpen-source simply rocks!\n  Easy to Update\nRuuviTag is shipped with a preloaded bootloader software. This means it's very straightforward to flash new firmware application Over-the-Air:\nWe'll be offering various ready-made software for you to use, so:\nNo programming knowledge of any kind is required to get started with the device.\nIn addition of the firmware application software, it's also possible to update the bootloader and the Bluetooth protocol stack over-the-air.\nThis means that once the best Bluetooth chip manufacturer in the world, Nordic Semiconductor, releases its new protocol stack (ie. the Bluetooth 5 support), it can be updated without needing a computer -- super handy and ready for the future of technology.\nUpdating the firmware over-the-air is supported on both Android and iOS devices.\n   Arduino Compatible\nWhen the design progress of the RuuviTag began, we had no idea what kind of platforms would come up in the future. Recently, Arduino has decided to start supporting the same Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 chip we are using. This is a great thing for Ruuvi users!\nRuuviTag is a software compatible platform, which means that makers, hobbyists and students will be able to use the familiar Arduino IDE and its libraries to create their own sensor beacon applications.\n   Hardcore Developers\nAlthough it's possible to use the platform by running the ready-made example firmwares on it or create one with help of Arduino, RuuviTag is also a perfect tool for serious development projects.\nIf using standard Bluetooth stack and bootloader isn't what you're looking for and would like to use the serial wire debug (SWD) bus to hack with your Tag, don't worry.\nAll the necessary pins and buses (including I2C/SPI/ADC/UART) are available for hardcore evaluation.\nWe have created a custom Arduino-compatible shield to be used with Nordic Semiconductor's low-cost nRF52-DK evaluation board. Our factory uses similar shields to test the RuuviTags in production.\nThe perfect tool for badass firmware developers. No need to hassle with wires and batteries.\n      Technical Specifications\nNordic Semiconductor nRF52832 SoC\nBosch BME280 environmental sensor (RuuviTag+)\nLIS2DH12 3-axis accelerometer (RuuviTag+)\nIntegrated NFC antenna\nCR2450 / CR2477 battery (up to 10 years, depending on the SW used)\n-40\u00b0C to +85\u00b0C (requires a high temperature battery, CR2450HR)\nMore than 500m (1650 feet) open-air range (depending on the environment and transmission power used)\nNormal Lithium coin cell batteries are usually performing ok between -10\u00b0C and +70\u00b0C (-4F\u00b0 to 158\u00b0F). Please also note that walls etc. will decrease the range.\nBecause the nRF52 is a future proof system-on-chip software radio, also other protocols apart from Nordic Semiconductor's own Bluetooth stack can be used. There are several option available and RuuviTag is a supported platform for example with Apache Mynewt which is a really cool open-source project:\nApache Mynewt is a community-driven open source OS for embedded and includes the world\u2019s first open source Bluetooth Low Energy stack for constrained devices (MCU)!\n  Nordic offers a protocol stack for ANT and RuuviTag is also a Wirepas Connectivity compatible platform:\nThe Connectivity protocol enables creation of large mesh networks of up to thousands of RuuviTags. They can be connected to the Internet through a single gateway. A great choice for business customers.\nThe upcoming Bluetooth 5 will also finally bring the Bluetooth mesh communication to reality.\nRuuviTag is a Bluetooth 5 ready platform.\n   Superior Antenna\nMany beacons does have bad antennas and it means shorter battery life.\n>500m range doesn't really make sense for most beacon applications, but having a good antenna means that lower transmission power is required thus leading to longer battery life.\nIn the video (you saw earlier), the chip was transmitting at +4dBm (2.5mW). The next day we made a similar test using -4dBm power (0.4mW). We were overwhelmed by the result: 500 meters (1650 feet). Sweet! Even the chip manufacturer was impressed.\nRuuviTag transmitting at -4dBm which is 10 000 times less power compared to the max TX power of the cell phone.\n  The max range we've tested is ~1.4 km (~4500 feet)!\n Innovative Battery Holder Mechanism\nUsing a coin cell battery was a tricky task.\nWe wanted to create a new way to make a connection to the battery. After much trial and error we came up with a perfect battery holder mechanism.\nThe circuit board material bends enough to firmly keep the battery in place.\nA patent will be pending but we don't like those.\n    How did This Project get Started?\nThere was a demand for an open-source beacon and we decided to make one.\nIn the beginning this was just a fun project, but we got so many contact requests from companies and developers that we decided to make the project viral and start working with this crowdfunding campaign.\n  Design ready for production\nWe think electronics should look interesting. Especially the devices designed for makers. One of the original goals was to create an innovative beacon that looks like a ring.\n   About Ruuvi\nRuuvi began 7 years ago when Lauri was a student at the University of Oulu, Finland.\nHe launched a website for Finnish electronics hobbyists. Ruuvipenkki (a screw vise in Finnish) became a popular site among embedded electronics hobbyists. This Finland based company, Ruuvi Innovations Ltd (Oy), was founded in 2015 to continue the passion of embedded systems.\nRuuviTag is Ruuvi's second project and the first one to be crowdfunded.\nLauri showing RuuviTags at the Maker Party event in Chiang Mai, Thailand\n  Ruuvi team ready for The Next Web conference, Amsterdam\n  Ruuvi stand at TNW conference\n  Presenting RuuviTag in a business meeting\nYou can find more stories from our blog.\n   Manufacturing\nLauri has lived last two years in SE Asia where he met Sharnon Tulabadi, the founder of the U.S. based company Gravitech LLC. Ruuvi decided to run the campaign in cooperation with the Gravitech.\nGravitech has a well known side-branch in Thailand. They have opened a new PCB assembly facility in Bangkok this year. RuuviTag devices will be produced using brand new SMD assembly machinery.\nSharnon with their brand new pick and place machine\nThe factory is capable of assembling and testing up to 10,000 Ruuvi devices a day and Gravitech is also going to handle the shipment of the devices.\nPick-and-place machine configuration before RuuviTag prototype run.\n  Ready, steady, go!\n  Inspection and some manual component placing before reflowing in the oven.\n    Open-Source FTW!\nAll the hardware and the software projects of Ruuvi's are open-source.\n  Ruuvi Community is contributing to the development of the projects. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion and be a part of the community by requesting an invite to our Slack team.\nAs the community grows, more example use-cases and demo applications will come up.\nYou can find more info from our website\n  Follow us on Twitter\n           Timetable and Usage of the Funds\nMultiple prototyping rounds have already been successfully completed and the best component manufacturers and suppliers have been located.\nThe design is 99% finished has been proven to work. After tuning the antenna it will be even better. In other words, it\u2019s ready to be manufactured.\nWe've got everything under control.\nAfter the campaign is finished, the funds will be used to purchase the necessary components and circuit boards. A mandatory Bluetooth declaration fee will be also paid using the funds.\nIn the meanwhile, documentation and example software will be polished.\n   What's next?\nWe've got so many cool ideas about how to make the most out of RuuviTag.\nWe're excited of what the Physical Web, the Web Bluetooth and the Android Nearby can offer in the future.\nMost of the all: we\u2019re excited to hear what kind of use-cases you can come up with the Tags.\nThere is one more thing we want to share with you even though it's not 100% finished.\nIn the future RuuviTag will be immortal.\nWe are prototyping an add-on board called RuuviHarvester. It's a battery replacement board for RuuviTag (and third-party beacons).\nRuuviHarvester makes your beacon immortal!\nAnother exciting project around the corner! ;)\nWhat others say about us on Twitter?\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already competed several prototype manufacturing rounds without problems, but manufacturing physical devices is always a challenging task.

Mechaduino is a self-contained motion control platform which allows you to develop your own custom servo mechanisms. It can be also be used as a drop-in servo motor for 3D printers and CNC machines. No more missed steps!\nEngineers use servo motors to achieve the precision motion required in applications such as robotics, automation, and CNC manufacturing.  Like RC servos, industrial servos actively correct for external disturbances.  Unlike RC servos, industrial servos can provide very accurate motion, and often support advanced motion control modes.  Unfortunately the cost of industrial servos is prohibitive to the individual maker (thousands of dollars per motor).\nWe've been developing an affordable open-source industrial servo motor, opening the door to sophisticated mechatronics applications.  Our design leverages the low cost of mass produced stepper motors.  We are able to achieve very high resolution via 14b encoder feedback (after calibration routine!).\n  Mechaduino began as a personal project that grew out of our recurring need for affordable, yet capable servo motors. \nWe began documenting the project on hackaday.io to share our designs with the world and to get feedback from other makers and engineers.

Maybe, you get away without paying GST on goods through the post most of the time, but like it or not, you should be paying the GST on goods you buy.

In addition, optional plastic case not only protects the circuits but also adds professional look to it. Why bother messy wiring or ugly project boxes while you can get this elegantly dressed up WiThumb.\nIn addition, WiThumb could be powered by standard USB type-A ports found in many power adapters, computers, TV, routers, cars, solar chargers and etc. It makes WiThumb an ideal device to deploy your applications anywhere.\nLanguages and Applications\nWiThumb is not only compatible with Arduino, it also runs micropython (a lean and efficient implementation of the Python3 programming language) and LUA.\nIn addition, being Arduino compatible, many sensor and WiFi libraries are readily available. For example, it is very easy to build a WiFi thermometer, to post the data to IoT cloud (e.g. on data.sparkfun.com) and to plot graphs using Analog.io).\nAlso, it takes no time to build a local IoT cloud with Raspberry Pi and WiThumb because of the MQTT protocol.\n(Disclaimer. Mentioning of these companies doesn't imply their direct involvements nor endorsement. This is for reference only) \nBenefits\nCompact (1.9 inch x 0.85 inch PCB)\nUSB Powered.

To name a few:\nInternet connected thermometer\nIMU (Inertial measurement unit) for drones and robots\nAs a smart device in home automation\nWiFi Access Point\nHome/Office Security (using IMU)\nIndustrial temperature sensing (e.g. in data center, storage)\nIoT gateway\nWiFi sniffer\nMonitor TV usage (e.g. WiThumb is powered when TV is on)\nMonitor driver's driving habits\nWith additional circuits through I2C, GPIOs and ADC, WiThumb could be the controller of many projects (WiFi controlled switches, LED control, WiFi compass, WiFi enabled soil moisture sensor, etc.)\nStore sensor data to the cloud\n  Example:Monitor TV usage. WiThumb gets powered when TV is on.\n  Example: WiThumb as in-vehicle IMU\nProgramming\nWiThumb is compatible with Arduino and could be programmed through USB from Arduino (TM) IDE.

It's a simple, 3-step system to generate and evaluate ideas, keep them organized, and then design and plan them.\nThe Hatch notebook will help you find an idea that you\u2019re passionate about and then take action on it.\nHatching ideas requires a blend of creativity and practicality, inspiration and perseverance. Hatch is a place for both\u2014it has enough structure to guide you, but also the flexibility to allow for all different types of people to use it for their creative endeavors.\nOrganize all your ideas in one place  \nIf you're like us, your ideas end up in all different places\u2014blank notebooks, dry erase board, napkins\u2014you know how it goes. Without an organized system, it's hard to know which ideas are good, or how excited you are about a particular idea. \nWith the Hatch notebook, you\u2019ll be able to see all your ideas at a glance and decide which ones you\u2019re excited about.\nWe\u2019ve found that having one place for all our ideas helps generate more ideas, and make connections between them.\nHatch will also help you stay motivated and committed throughout the process of bringing an idea to life.\nBringing an idea to life can be an emotional roller coaster. The Hatch notebook will keep you committed and inspired throughout the process!\nHow does it work?\nThere are 3 steps in the Hatch process.\nSTEP 1: Conceive\nFirst, you list your ideas by category to create an unorthodox table of contents as you enter page numbers. As you fill in the excitement & difficulty levels of each idea, you\u2019ll be able to see which ones might be worth pursuing at a glance.\nConceive - TOC page\nThere are also blank dot grid pages that you can use to brainstorm and mindmap to generate new ideas. And, we\u2019ve included some tips & suggestions for how to get the ideas flowing in the back of the notebook (just in case you get stuck!)\nConceive - Brainstorm page\nSTEP 2: Incubate\nNext, evaluate and define your ideas by answering some questions. This will help you figure out which ones you\u2019re most passionate about (and most viable) and want to Hatch. \nIncubate spread\nSTEP 3: Hatch\nHere, you'll fill out your project specs and an action plan that will keep you moving forward. Then you can use the blank pages to sketch, take notes, code, write, or anything else that's part of your process. Dream big, be creative, and have fun!\nHatch specs and action plan\n    How many pages in each section?\nConceive section \n4 pages to list and categorize your ideas \n16 blank dot grid pages to brainstorm ideas\nIncubate section\n14 spreads with questions to help you evaluate your ideas to decide which ones to pursue\nHatch section\n5 project sub-sections to design, develop and plan your ideas; 18 pages each, with 1 page for specifications and action plan and the others blank for your sketches and notes\nGuidelines, tips & resources\n10 pages of guidelines, tips & resources at the back, to guide you if you need it, while being unobtrusive if you don't\nPlus, there are quotes at the beginning of each section to inspire and motivate you when you start to have doubts, to encourage you to trust yourself and keep going, and to remind you that you're not alone.\n\nWe're still finishing the content for the Guidelines, tips & resources section, and are open to suggestions for what you'd like to see!\nFeatures  \nWe've spent a lot of time on the design details and selection of materials to make a notebook that looks great, is fun to use, and you'll love to carry with you everywhere.\n      Color Options\nAvailable in Slate Grey or Midnight Blue\nBecause we reached our $30k Stretch Goal, we've added a midnight blue cover color option! Backers will get to choose from the 2 colors via the survey at the end of the campaign. You'll be able to split your pledge between the two color options if you'd like.\n    This is one of our prototypes. The final book will have a sewn binding so that it always lays flat!\n  Why a paper notebook?\nJust the act of writing down an idea on paper makes it more real and gives it value in a way that digital format does not. There's so much digital media these days that it it feels fleeting, less permanent. When we make a note on our phones we often completely forget it's there. \nWe find that when you write all your ideas down in one place where you can see them all together, you start to have more ideas and draw connections between them. The key to having great ideas is having a lot of ideas, so all ideas\u2014even the bad ones\u2014serve a purpose. This is harder to do in digital format because it's not as easy to flip through and see things. Also for us, it's more fun to sketch and draw on paper. And you can look back at your notebook for years to see what your thinking was at that time.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur goal of $15,000 will fund an initial run of notebooks, and the money will be used solely to produce and deliver Hatch Notebooks. We\u2019re excited to launch another product on Kickstarter. There\u2019s a sense of community around bringing a project to life that\u2019s unique to this platform.\nWe hope you like Hatch, and we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! The layout isn't set in stone, and we may make changes based on your feedback.\nPrevious campaigns:\nFoodie Dice\nMixology Dice\nFor more about us, see Our Bio\nShare to get the PDF for FREE  \nWe believe that ideas can come from anywhere, that no idea is too big or too small, and that ideas can change the world. We\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019ve created and even more excited about helping people develop their ideas and find something that\u2019s meaningful to them. We want to create a community around launching ideas, and we want everyone to be a part of it, whether they\u2019re able to donate to the project or not.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to share the digital version for free.\nAll you have to do is:\n1: Share our project on any social media platform with the #hatchnotebook hashtag\n2: Send us a note at hatchdigital@twotumbleweeds.co with a screenshot or a link of where you shared it, and we\u2019ll send you a PDF at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nUse one or both of the links below to get a pre-populated tweet or Facebook post shared directly from your account. \nShare on Instagram  /  Share on Facebook  /  Share on Twitter\nOur Inspiration & Process\nWe came up with this idea about a year ago, and started using a basic version to organize our own ideas. We quickly found that having one place for all our ideas helped us generate more ideas and make connections that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Also, we found that just the act of writing down an idea made it more real and helped us stay committed.\nOver the past year, we've created and used several prototypes, sought feedback from different types of makers, and continually refined and revised the concept. We\u2019ve learned so much about book binding and printing. It's come quite a long way from the initial spark, and we've enjoyed the process.\nHow did we get from Foodie Dice to Hatch? On the surface, these two products might seem unrelated, but at their core they both inspire creativity and a sense of adventure, and that's our ultimate goal.  \nConnect with us and share what you create!\nInstagram  //  Facebook\nThank you so much for your support!

They\u2019re in the United States, have been in business for over 100 years, and they do beautiful work.\n\nWe also learned a lot with our previous campaigns, Foodie Dice and Mixology Dice (which we delivered on time), and we have the infrastructure already in place to easily ship rewards.\n\nIf our campaign is funded, we\u2018ll dedicate ourselves to delivering a quality product, and we\u2019ll be transparent if challenges do arise.

IFTTT is also possible.\nEcoFan, a smart bathroom and washroom fan that\u2019s powered by a small computer chip and a PC-grade fan. To put it simply, this fan is far and away better than anything else that is being used in bathroom and washroom projects on a regular basis. EcoFan will immediately set your bathroom or washroom apart and make all of your hygiene activities a pleasure rather than an eardrum-aching chore.\nEcoFan is based on a computer fan that has shipped billions of pieces, meaning that the price is already competitively low and that the quality has already been established. The fan runs for 10,000 hours, and it has been tested and reviewed over a period of many years. Enabling fine control, the powerful microprocessor comes built in, and we are providing the Arduino source code to anyone who would like to add their own features as well. A 433mHz RF remote module also comes built-in, and you can change the fan speed exactly to your liking, not just with the one or two settings that come with only the most advanced models currently on the market.\nFan controller comes with firmware written in Arduino, default mode is a timer that will shutoff the fan after 30 minutes. \nYou can use remote to configure the timer, change how long the fan will run after you turn on the power. \nAlso, you can turn on/off using remote, use remote to let fan run continuous.\nSource code will be provided, if you know coding, you can change it to whatever you want.\nPrototype:\nFan with controller prototype\n Controller prototype with enclosure\n Controller prototype\nEarly prototype:\nArduino Source Code:\nWill published to github after this project.\nThe Story:\nI got the idea when my washroom fan was broken and need to be replaced. I opened the cover, took off the fan, took a picture and about to go to HomeDepot to get a similar model.  \nWhat I discovered shocked me: the fan I was looking for was rated 50 cubic feet per minute, similar to my computer fan, but it was using ten times the power that my computer fan was. On top of that, my computer fan is brush-less, minimizing the amount of noise it emits.\nSo I did some research and put the 12V power supply and PC-Fan together to see if it works.\nMy old fan:\n 12V AC-DC power supply and PC-Fan\nIt worked really well! Exceeding my expectation!\nAfter several months. I am thinking, why not add a timer to it? Because I am always forgetting to turn off my bathroom fan after I take my morning shower.

Go ahead, make it full screen and enjoy all those extra pixels.  (Kickstarter downsamples the main project video to SD quality to save a little bandwidth.)\nWait, before we tell you about the project, why don't you tell us a little about yourself.  Start with number 1, 2 or 10 below.\n1: I am an Electronics Guru \nOh, you're an Electronics Guru and want to know all the gritty details?  Then you should GOTO 30!\n2: I want to know how the MegaCube + eBOSS with ID Chip = Awesome\nIt's true.  The MegaCube connected to an eBOSS with ID Chip is awesome.  To get right to the details on that, GOTO 45!\n10: I am new to electronic wizardry. What the heck is this?\nThe MegaCube is a programmable, reusable, simple little computer. It allows anyone, particularly software and hardware engineers, to try out ideas, creating prototypes of their own electronic gizmos, with much less grunt work. The MegaCube can gather feedback from external sensors (detect light, motion, temperature, etc.) and control actions (turn on motors, illuminate lights, synchronize and communicate with other devices, etc.)\nThere is related trend on the rise called the Maker Movement. This is a culture of invention, where people (not just engineers!) use tools like the MegaCube, 3D printers, CNC machines, robots, etc. to design their own things. The MegaCube is intended to act as the brains of the \"things\" in the Internet of Things (IoT). Although it's in its infancy now, you'll hear more and more about the IoT in the next few years.\n20: This is great and all, but what can I DO with it?\nYou could use a MegaCube to:\nControl a robot to pick Cheetos up and hold them up for you to snack on hands free to keep the orange stuff off your fingers\nAct as the brains of a remote control vehicle\nControl equipment in a radio tower\nBe the core controller of a build-it-yourself 3D printer\nActivate motors to automatically adjust your window blinds based on current time, sunlight, outside temperature, and the temperature you want your house to be.\nMake a bunch of LED lights outside your house do crazy awesome stuff during the holidays (like, say, blink to the beat of music)\nThe list of things you could make using a MegaCube are practically endless!\nHere are some of the fun things we've already done with it:\nControl a remote control car (it drove down the aisle at Mike's wedding, acting as a ring bearer, yes, really!)\nControl servos to move a robot arm\nMonitor a fish tank's water temperature and display it\nDisplay cool stuff on an LCD screen\nMonitor a clothes dryer and send a text when it's done\nMake a \"Fruit Announcer\" that tells you what fruit you just touched\n30: I'm an Electronics Guru - tell me more!\nMike, creator of the MegaCube, wanted to build a clone of an Arduino Mega, which is a flexible, easy to use hardware and software open source electronics development platform. He wanted to build one that...\nIs able to store multiple programs simultaneously (streamlining use across projects with a unique eBOSS for each project) - GOSUB 45!\nIs smaller (check out its size vs. a quarter above)\nIs \"Socket-able\"\nAllowed access to all 100 pins of the processor\nDidn't require expensive proprietary connectors\nUsed standard 0.1\" pitch spacing to make it Protoboard friendly\nAnd, on top of all that, he wanted it to be more reasonably priced!\n40: You say it's Socket-able, right?\nThe Embedded Break Out Shield System (eBOSS) - allows embedding the MegaCube in your own project. It has solder tabs for all 100 pins and still allows the MegaCube to be neatly unplugged and reused in other projects. Due to the 0.1\" pitch spacing of the pins, you can use our eBOSS or you can also solder your own female header pins on to protoboards to socket it directly into your own project.\n45: Can I move the MegaCube between projects without reprogramming it?\nYes, you can!  The eBOSS has been redesigned to include a Unique ID chip which has a hard coded 64-bit registration number and 48-bit node address.  There are also programmable bits so you can add your own personal ID/data.  So why is this important?  Having a unique ID allows you to have multiple programs (sketches) stored on the MegaCube at once and, when moving it between eBOSSes, the MegaCube runs the appropriate program based on ID.\nYou can move your MegaCube between the eBOSS mounted in your Larson scanner LED project for your Knight Rider Car Club and the eBOSS soldered to your Battlestar Galactica Cylon helmet without having to stop at your computer to reprogram the MegaCube.  When you add another project, just add another program to the MegaCube and plug it into another inexpensive eBOSS.  Our API makes it easy and only using 1-wire communication means that it doesn't use up an SPI port or UART.\nIt's not our problem if KITT gets mad when you move your MegaCube over to the Cylon.\n50: Neat! I want one. Is it for me?\nThe MegaCube is an affordable and enhanced electronics prototyping platform intended for the intermediate to pro user who is looking for more than what the Arduino Mega offers in a package that is smaller than an UNO and is easily embedded in a project at a lower cost than the Arduino Mega or its clone offerings. For anyone interested in getting into the Maker Movement and Arduino world, the MegaCube along with the BOSS and an FTDI cable (to connect directly to your computer's USB port) or ICSP programmer is all that you would need to get started.\n60: Nice. How can I keep it safe during testing?\nThe MegaCube Holder is made of ABS and protects the MegaCube from touching conductive surfaces during your development process. Mike decided it might be an important addition when he fried one by absentmindedly setting it on his aluminum laptop. Now if he can just get rid of the burn marks on his laptop...\n70: I want a MegaCube and a shield!\nExcellent! Check out our Combos for a MegaCube or, if you want it all, go for our Ultimate Combo, which has the MegaCube, eBOSS and Holder.\n80: I'm in! I want it before everyone else.\nWe have a limited supply of Early Adopter MegaCubes and Starter Combos, so be quick about it! Not only is the price slashed, you get the honor of calling yourself an Early Adopter, and who doesn't want such a noble title? Seriously, we'll post on Facebook or something about how tech-forward you are.\n90: This is so cool, I wish my name was on it!\nYou are in luck. Become one of our Sponsors and your name will appear on the eBOSS or the MegaCube itself. Seriously, you back us as a Sponsor and your name will be on every single MegaCube (or every single eBOSS) that we produce for this Kickstarter Campaign. You will be immortalized! Just imagine if one of these somehow makes it to space. Then your name will be in space! (We make no guarantees about your name making it to space.)\nSeriously, though, we can only fit so many names in the limited open area on the hardware, so claim your space today before it's all gone! You can blame Mike if we run out of this reward because he was just too darned efficient with his designs.\n100: Is everything going to look like it does in the photos?\nAlthough the early prototypes are green, the final MegaCube will use blue text and graphics on white circuit boards just like the eBOSS pictures. Trust us. It will look totally sexy, especially when you're holding it in your hand.\n110: I want more details on this sweet tech!\nGlad to hear it! Check out all the juicy bits on our website at http://megadom.net.\n120: No, seriously, show me its innards!\nOur MegaCube Pinout Diagram should shed some light on it for you:\nOh, you like to use Fritzing?  We've got you covered with the MegaCube Fritzing Part:\n130: Rewards\nHere's a nice visual version, but for all the details and to actually choose a reward, check out the rewards listed in the right column (you'll have to scroll up a ways!) \nThe Rewards!\n140: Who are you guys, again?\nThe short version is that Mike, the creator of the MegaCube, started up his own company, DomCo Electronics Inc., an electrical engineering consultancy, and initially developed the MegaCube under that company, which is why you see that name and company web address on some of his MegaCube prototypes. He got together with The Jo(h)ns and we formed MEGADOM Electronics Inc. as a small company specifically to bring Mike's prototypes to market so that all engineers can get their hands on them. Of course, we're a new company and we need your backing (see below) to get us rocking, so thank you in advance! Check out our Full Bio to learn more about each of us.\n150: Why do you need our help?\nWe're here on Kickstarter because we need your help to take the MegaCube from prototype to production. We've gotten pretty far on our own, but now we need your financial backing to go the rest of the way. We'll use the Kickstarter funds to buy parts in bulk quantities, set up our assembly process, and ship the MegaCubes and eBOSSes to you as quickly as possible.\nYour support will go a long way to help us get our company off the ground (and into the hands of our customers!) We think the most exciting thing about creating this product is seeing all of the awesome things that you guys find to do with it!\n160: How did you figure out the funding goal?\nMike has a ton of experience in building electronic devices for his career, so he used all the knowledge to determine the start up costs involved in putting together all the bits and pieces necessary to build the MegaCube in mass quantities. Our ultimate costs will depend on how many of each unit we have to produce, and we determined the minimums we need to get reasonable pricing from manufacturers. Check out our Risks and Challenges below for more information.\n170: I want a combo that you don't offer.\nNo problem! Send us a message and we'll see what we can do. We'll either create another reward that meets your criteria (within the limits of KickStarter's rules, of course) or ask you to pick a similar reward and include the appropriate additional amount.\n180: This seems mighty familiar...\nYes, we launched a nearly identical KickStarter campaign in 2014, with a much higher funding goal, because we wanted to minimize our costs (manufacturers provide big price breaks at higher quantities).  We relaunched this KickStarter with a much more modest goal, with a much smaller income margin because we believe that the MegaCube needs to get into your hands.  Just getting the MegaCube out there will help slingshot us into the next phase of our production plan - we're just starting out smaller this time!\n200. What the heck are all those numbers before the headings?\nWhat, you mean, like the 200 in front of this one?  That's a throwback to old programming languages like BASIC, just for fun.  And yeah, we skipped 190 because you didn't have to use every number in BASIC code, either.  See, Microsoft isn't the only one who can skip numbers.\n210.

Creating the inexpensive eBOSS as a perfect companion to the MegaCube to allow developers to use their MegaCube in multiple projects without needing to solder and unsolder it repeatedly\n\nConstruction Quality\n\nElectronic products like this require precision manufacturing techniques, including using high quality solder stencils to produce superb connections between components and circuit boards. We've partnered with respected Contract Manufacturing (CM) firms and we have full oversight of the entire process to make sure the job is done right!\n\nExperience\n\nOne risk for many electronics projects like ours is that the project members just don\u2019t have the experience they need to get the products properly designed and manufactured.\n\nMike has been designing electronics for decades. He has worked with countless manufacturers to get his designs turned into real devices, so getting the MegaCube manufactured will be, as they say, a piece of cake!\n\nDelivery of Hardware Rewards\n\nAs with every piece of hardware, the delivery depends on one or multiple production partners.

It is based on an ARM microcontroller that manage a three axis accelerometer and a three axis magnetometer. The bluetooth connectivity allow your tablet/smartphone to become a brain for your home security alarm. \nA simple philosophy behind Yooquik project: make a simple and secure device for the home/office security. The end user can install it by himself and manage via a cloud connected smartphone or tablet, whereas the maker can customize it using his Arduino knowledge and his Javascript skill. Open Source is the magic key to this project!\nHi, I\u2019m Marcello Gesmundo, the Yooquik creator. I\u2019m an electronic engineer and I designed the Yooquik hardware and software to make sure that each user can use it in the most intuitive way. Some years ago I was on vacation and I had a problem with my old home alarm system: that was the moment when I decided to create a new security system that would allow me to be sure about what was happening at my home. Why yet another new one? Because the existing ones could not be customized or integrated with other devices or other personal projects. It had to be based on a simple gateway alarm where the software only could determine its functionality. It had to be Open Source! Why not using the iPad you used before buying the new one? Why not using Apple HomeKit today? Because it\u2019s not open, you can\u2019t customize it and you can\u2019t connect to anything else you need!\nOn February 2014 with my friends from Acme Systems I presented at Nuremberg Embedded World fair the first Yooquik developer board for the automation purpose. But I wanted more: an entire security system without a mainboard! At the end of 2014 I designed the new bluetooth Yooquik device assembled at early 2015 and today I start this campaign to begin a large production for the end users and the makers! I need your help to create a large community of makers and developers to expand this vision.\nYooquik project is dedicated to my wife Antonella and my children Davide and Valentina. It's not so easy to share life with a husband or a father that works about 17 hours at day: I'm grateful for their patience.\nMany thanks to all backers for considering my project: I really appreciate any support they can provide. My sincere gratitude to Carlo (Progetti & Sistemi) who followed the project evolution from the beginning, becoming an enthusiastic supporter together its partners Franco and Gianvito.\nThank you so much to my friends Sergio, Roberto and Ennio (Acme Systems) for their support in the prototypes making and, last but not least, a special thanks to my best and loyal friend Pier Luigi, my mentor and new partner in this awesome adventure.\nHere is Yooquik\nYou need just few steps to turn your tablet/smartphone into a true security system.\nGo on App Store or Google Play and download the free App Yooquik\nPlay it and create your personal account on Yooquik Cloud\nInsert the battery into your Yooquik devices\nPlace your devices on windows and doors\nDONE! Your security system is now ready!\nAll windows, doors and blinds opening detection. Forget the traditional magnetic opening reed sensors and pulse counters for blinds: Yooquik has a true three axis magnetometer that reads the magnetic field. All kinds of frame can be managed. It's impossible to deceive it using an external magnet because the magnetic field would change and Yooquik would send an alarm notification.\nVibration detector. None traditional tilt sensor (inertial sensor): a true three axis accelerometer measure the vibration of the frame and analyze it to avoid wrong alarms recognition.\nTemperature sensor. Keep under control the temperature next to the doors and windows and track a map of the trending of the temperature.\nMicrocontroller Not the usual passive sensor: an ARM microcontroller analyze the magnetometer, accelerometer and temperature sensors data with a very low power consumption. A single battery can grant from 18 to 24 month of functionality.\nBluetooth connectivity. Avoid a dedicated 866MHz radio gateway: with the Bluetooth Smart radio all devices are connected to your tablet/smartphone without other devices.\nPlug and play installation. No specialized installers needed: remove the plastic film behind the sensor and place it where you need. Done!\nEasy configuration. No need to configure your router in order to access from the outside: use your Yooquik Cloud account to manage your security system wherever you are.\nPush notifications. Receive notifications on your smartphone about all events. Choose which events you need to monitor and who will receive the relevant notifications.\nOpen Source and Arduino compatible. Connect your device to your Mac or PC using the connector inside it; use the well known Arduino software to create your own personal device. Do you want to transform your device in an iBeacon hot spot? You can! Upload your software into your Yooquik device and go live!\nPersonalization. You can personalize your security system device as well as you usually do with your smartphone cover. You can also create your own top cover: download our base model and customize it as you want with your 3D printer.\nExpandable. The Yooquik connector is pin-to-pin compatible with the Acme Systems boards: connect your sensor to your Acme board and make your awesome device!\nFree App for iOS and Android. Manage your security system with the free iOS or Android App. Create multiple users with different permission levels.\nIP Cameras. Connect to your cameras directly from within the App and look for help to configure your cameras using the community. Your video stream is managed by our Yooquik Cloud and encoded to be available from all HTML5 capable device. Earn points by posting the configurations of your cameras and get discounts on our Yooquik store.\nTelegram. Use our bot or create yours to manage your security system within the Telegram App. Chat with your security system!\nInstallation example\nInstall a sensor on every door and window of your home/office and put your tablet or smartphone in a safe location as central as possible. You can also use one or more sensor to protect your bungalow when you are on vacation.\nPrototypes\nWhat's the first step to create a new product after the idea? A lot of evaluation boards! And what's the second one? More prototypes!

I am in the middle: for a few years I got ahead the idea of yooquick trying various technical solutions without the support of a comunity. Now, after having written base code to verify that the idea was practicable and that the hardware worked as predicted, I decided to start this campaign, so I chose one of the possible way. I could have waited to complete the firmware, the app and the software on the server side, as well as the documentation. As regard all the Node JS modules I published on GitHub the choice was always the same (github.com/mgesmundo). But the compare with other people always helps so the reasoning was easy: as the hardware is ready and perfectly working, why not to make it available now and complete in a second time what the end user needs with the help of other people with whom share and improve the ideas? That's all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn a project that involves both hardware and software the main problem is the hardware. Working closely with the manufacturer Acme Systems hardware prototypes have resulted immediately working and can be certified. I will perfect the CAD files to launch the injection molds of the plastic enclosure. The second challenge is the software. Yooquik software includes the firmware on the device (Arduino), the App for iOS and Android (Cordova) and the server side software (NodeJS). This is the main area where I hope in a contribute by the developers community. As developer contributor I published some NodeJS modules on NPM repository used for the Yooquik software and for the Acme Systems boards. I'm a true perfectionist, that's why I publish only when all tests are done, the software coverage is satisfying and the documentation is completed. A lot of time to do that but I love this!\nIf many other developers join this project, it will grow quickly.\nI will keep in touch with you for each step I take to keep you upraised of Yooquik project progress status according the above timeline.\n\nYooquik\u00ae is a registered trademark of Yoovant\u00ae by Marcello Gesmundo.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Yoovant by Marcello Gesmundo\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nYoovant is an Italy based company focused on software and hardware design of the consumer electronic devices.

The code samples found at the above project page were used in the below video manual.  \nUpdate (May 30th/2016):\nHi everyone! The video manual is now available, and Arduino code samples will be published tomorrow.  Stay tuned!  This video features some Arduino controlled projects, so please have a gander if you have time!\nHi Everyone!\nThank you for taking an interest in my 17th Kickstarter campaign!  My name is Patrick Mitchell, and I want to introduce you to \"The Beast Display\"!  The Beast Display Kickstarter campaign is very much a DIY/Maker based Kickstarter campaign, as all but one reward tier requires some form of assembly.\nThe Beast Display set has four modes of operation:\nUp Count:  By using either the buttons connected to the main processor board, or your Arduino Uno, you can program in a final score anywhere between 0001 to 9999.  Every time the relative button is pressed, or signal line is pulsed to (Arduino control), the display increments!  Once the score has been hit, the Beast Display signals a victory scroll!  A GPIO on the processor board toggles states when this happens, so that you can control a relay, or an external circuit once the score is hit. You an also reset at any time using either the buttons, or with Arduino.  \nDown Count:  By using either the buttons connected to the main processor board, or your Arduino Uno, you can program in a starting value anywhere between 0001 to 9999. Every time the relative button is pressed, or signal line is pulsed to (Arduino control), the display decrements! Once the display has been decremented down to \"0000\", the Beast Display signals a victory scroll!  A GPIO on the processor board toggles states when this happens, so that you can control a relay, or an external circuit once the score reaches 0000.  You an also reset at any time using either the buttons, or with Arduino.\nCountdown Timer Mode:  This is your standard countdown timer function.  Easily program in a starting time (anywhere from 0001 to 99:59, and the countdown begins!  As with all modes, you can reset at any time using either the buttons, or with your Arduino Uno.  Once the timer reaches \"0000\", all segments display the victory scroll, and a GPIO on the processor board toggles states when this happens, so that you can control a relay, or an external circuit.\nScore Keeping Mode: The left two digits of the display are reserved for one team, while the left two digits are reserved for the second team! Press the right button (red) to increment the score on the two right digits, and the left button (green) to increment the score on the left two digits.  You can reset at any time by pressing and holding both buttons at the same time.  If either score reaches 99, then the score will flash, and the unit will take for the user to reset the unit.\nApplications:\n1) You can include the Beast Display with your Arduino projects.  \n2) It can be used as a score keeper at sporting events.  \n3) It can be interfaced with a target practice system.\n4) It can be used in entertainment centre projects, escape room scenarios, or as a game timer in indoor paintball or airsoft arenas.  \n5) With four modes of operation, and with the Arduino compatibility option, the possibilities are endless!  We provide the electronics, and you make it your own!  Not sure if your application is possible?  Send us your questions, and we'll get back to you promptly!\nArduino Compatible?  Yup!\nThere is a connector on the main processor board that allows for you to interface with your Arduino.  \nThe GAME OVER pin:  There is a GPIO pin set as an output that toggles states when time runs out in countdown timer mode, when a count up/down limit has been hit, and when a score hits 99 in score keeping mode.  With this, you can control a relay, or simply to tell your Arduino that a goal has been hit, or that a game is over.  \nThe Master Reset - This pin acts as a master reset that can be controlled by Arduino.  Use any Arduino GPIO to manually reset the Beast display by applying a 5v pulse for 500ms or more, and then clear the line to reset the Beast display with Arduino. \nButton Controls - There are two GPIO pins that are on the same control lines as the two LED buttons.  You can use your Arduino to act as the buttons would.  Simply pulse 5v to either of these two lines for 100ms or more, and then clear it to simulate a button press.  \nA comprehensive video manual will be provided later on in the campaign, and code samples will be available to pledges!\nFor DIY'er & Makers:\nThis campaign is very much DIY oriented.  Some rewards come with nothing assembled, while others comes with assembled and tested processor boards.  Every reward tier that includes the large displays, (minus the most expensive tier) requires that the user wire up the large displays to the main board, and solder the LED buttons to the connector cable.  This below video outlines the process of assembling and testing the electronics from scratch:\nThe Comprehensive Assembly Video:\nThe Casing & The Casing Assembly Manual:\nOnly the upper reward tiers include pre-cut wood, or fully built Beast Displays installed in stained wood casings.  My lively wife is the designer of the casing, and she will be providing a casing assembly manual in PDF form for those of you who pledge towards a reward tier with pre-cut wood.  This PDF will be available nearing the end of this campaign.  For those of you who pledge towards a reward that does not include pre-cut wood, or a fully assembled Beast Display, we encourage you to build your own displays, and share pictures of your own work to be published on the upcoming Beast Display Project Page at www.engineeringshock.com.\nReward Shipments:\nIt is expected that all rewards will be shipped by the first to second week in July.  For those of you pledging towards reward tiers that do not include pre-cut wood, or a fully assembled Beast Display, you can expect your reward to be shipped by the third week of June at the latest.  Rewards that include pre-cut wood, or fully assembled beast displays should be shipped by The second week of July at the latest.\nDo you want to pledge towards something very specific?  Drop me a line and tell me about it.  I'll see about making you your very own reward tier!   \nIntroducing The Electronics:\nThe main processor board takes care of it all!  Thsi board interfaces with the two LED buttons via cables, the 4x displays, and a voltage booster module for display light level adjustment.  It holds all of the programming, and acts to drive the displays as well.\nThe voltage booster module is a necessity here.  It allows for the user to adjust the light level of the displays. This booster pshould be calibrated to 16v - 18v for optimal display brightness.\nThe LARGE Displays that are included in some reward tiers are just under 5 1/2\" high, and just over 4\" wide.  They are common anode displays, and when four of them are placed side by side, they look AMAZING!\nMagnet wire (also called enamelled wire) is what we use for wiring the displays together, and to the main processor board.  This wire looks like uninsulated copper wire, but it isn't.  This wire is covered in an enamel that acts as an insulation.  It can be burned off, or scratched off, or both.  This wire is talked about in detail in the assembly video.  It is easy to use.  you can use wire-wrap wire if you'd like, but magnet wire is just as easy to use, and any reward tier that includes the large displays will also come with a whack of this stuff! \nThe 120-240VAC IN (50-60Hz) // 9v 1A OUT AC-DC Wall Adapter is American and European wall outlet power supply friendly. However, if you are in Europe, you'll need an adapter to plug this into your wall. This AC-DC adapter provides nominal power to your fully assembled Beast display! \nThe LED buttons (Red & Green) are used for incrementing, decrementing, resetting, programming in values, selecting modes, etc.  They comes with connector cables that are to be soldered together using the instructions in the assembly video.\nThe Arduino connector cable gives you the option to interface with your Arduino (Or any TTL compatible platform). Every reward tier (minus he momento reward tier) will include one of these.\nWhat is left to do?\nThe hardware is production ready, and the software is nearly complete.  I simply need to optimize the software so that it is perfect!  I will also be adding to the software, and making a video or two showing my progress during this campaign.  I also need to make a compressive video manual, Arduino code samples, and a wood casing assembly PDF manual (care of my lovely wife).  All of this will be completed and shared by the end of this campaign.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKickstarter and the Kickstarter community have helped me to bring fifteen of my ideas to life thus far.  If not for you, I'd be building my projects on prototyping boards, and putting them on the bookshelf in my lab.  Hundreds and hundreds of people have pledged towards my projects, and I'm extremely grateful.  I've been working with the Kickstarter community for over two years now, and I hope to be creating projects and working with you all for many years to come!  Thank you all for taking an interest in my projects!\nProduction Schedule:\nDuring the first week of this campaign, I'll be working on tweaking the software, and working compiling the information needed to make my parts orders. I will share my progress at least twice a week via project updates.\nI'll be placing orders for PCBs, components, displays, and accessories two weeks after this project is launched.  After two weeks, I should be able to properly forecast what will be required to fulfil reward shipments. \nDuring the third week of this campaign, I will be finalizing the software, and I'll begin working on the video manual.  At this time, my wife will begin work on the assembly PDF for the wooden case.  As soon as both of these videos are completed, I will publish the links in a project update.\nBy the fourth week of this campaign, all components, accessories, and assemblies should be in transit to my home.  I expect to have all of the relative hardware in house by the end of this campaign.\nThe first two weeks following the end of this campaign will be dedicated to quality control, reward packaging and shipping.  Rewards that include electronics only (No pre-cut wood/fully assembled Beast displays) are expected to ship by the end of the second week following the end of this campaign.  This falls on the first/second week of July, depending on the exact date that this campaign is launched. Reward shipments that include pre-cut wood are expected to ship shortly after (around mid to late July). The same goes for fully assembled Beast display units in stained wooden boxes.\nFinal Notes:\nIf you haven't pledged towards one of my campaigns in the past, then I wish to convey to you that I take my campaigns very seriously.  Communication is very important, and it isn't uncommon to see more than 15x project updates.  I have always managed to ship rewards on time, or early.  Delays can happen, but they have not happened to me yet.  I believe in running my campaigns with the utmost integrity.  If you h ave any questions or concerns, drop me a line.  I'm more than happy to speak with you one-on-one.  \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks involved with this campaign. I've successfully completed reward shipments on time for all fifteen of my successful campaigns. I have solid relationships with my component suppliers, and with my PCB manufacturer.

Please read our final update or visit Modkit.io to learn more.\nModkit.io is an Event Oriented Multithreaded Programming Language\nModkit.io is a new kind of programming language for the Internet of Everything for Everyone. It has a rich, yet surprisingly intuitive, multithreaded and event oriented syntax that will be familiar to millions of young students and educators who have been exposed to Scratch. And it works with Wiring, the microcontroller framework used in the Arduino IDE as well as development tools from TI, Particle, and Intel.  \nMultithreading is traditionally thought of and introduced as an advanced programming concept, but it just means you can have multiple things going on at the same time. Event-oriented simply means things can alert other things when something interesting happens. Unlike most programming languages, both of these concepts are built-in to Modkit.io, not introduced as a complicated afterthought.\nSupported Editors and Hardware\nModkit.io works with the most popular programming environments\nModkit.io works with the most popular microcontroller development environments including the Arduino IDE, Particle Build, TI Energia, and Wiring.  If your hardware is supported by one of these environments chances are you can use Modkit.io to program it and make use of all of your existing libraries! The boards in the image below have already been tested.\nModkit.io supports the most popular development boards\nBut we could never test the 100's of possible boards ourselves. Be one of our first 1000 $1 backers by June 1, and help us test Modkit.io for your favorite development hardware.\nHelp us test Modkit.io with even more boards by pledging just $1\nPre-campaign\nImportant: We will add additional rewards once we reach our goal of 1000 pre-campaign supporters. But if we fail to reach our pre-campaign goal by June 1, our campaign will be cancelled due to insignificant demand.\nUnlike most Kickstarter campaigns that start giving out rewards months (sometimes years) after funding success and add additional \"stretch-goals\" once they reach their initial fundraising goal, like most everything else at Modkit, we thought we'd do things a bit differently. So instead of a stretch-goal we set a pre-goal that's actually not about money at all. Our goal is to get our new programming language Modkit.io out to 1000 backers before we even start our campaign!\nOur official campaign starts on June 1, but to connect with our earliest adopters and potential partners, get important feedback, and gather stories about how you will use Modkit.io, we're offering 1000 backers a single download of our Modkit.io library for Wiring-based microcontrollers for the absolute minimum Kickstarter pledge of $1. If we don't reach our pre-goal by June 1, we plan to cancel our campaign and if we don't reach our final goal by June 30, none of our backers will be charged. So if we're not successful you will actually get your pre-reward for free!\nWhat do we mean by Internet?\nThe Internet starts with local networks\nWhen people think about the Internet they often think about being able to communicate with anyone and everyone, anywhere in the world. But the Internet is simply a network of networks and it all starts with local networks. The same Internet protocols that allow you to communicate with a website or service across the world, allow you to send a document to a printer or to stream content to a television across the room. These same protocols can even be used to communicate between different programs on a single computer or device. This makes the Internet both technologically and socially democratic.\nWhat do we mean by Everything?\nThe Internet of Everything starts with Things\nJust like the Internet starts locally, we believe that the Internet of Everything should begin with a single thing and scale up from there. When developing programming languages to talk to things across the world, it is interesting to think that the same languages people use to talk to each other are the very languages we use to formulate thoughts, make personal plans, and ultimately to talk to oneself. \nWe've seen many tools and languages proposed for the Internet of Things that do not provide a way for things to talk to themselves and to other things across the room in the same way that they talk to other things or computers across the world. Modkit.io was designed to democratize and bring the true essence of the Internet to Everything.  Our preview Modkit.io library for Wiring is focused on the most local network of things, the individual components connected to a single circuit board, and helping them communicate with each other more fluently than ever before.\nWho do we mean by Everyone?\nInspired by Scratch for beginners - Multithreaded and Event-driven for everyone\nMost text-based programming languages and other serious tools for technology creation are designed for engineers or computer scientists. With over 40 combined years of research and development in STEM education programs, Fab Labs and graphical programming languages such as Scratch and Modkit for VEX, we took a completely different approach and designed Modkit.io for Everyone. Just as text editors like Microsoft Word and Open Office are used everywhere from elementary school to grad school and by everyone from amateur lyricists to professional lawyers, we do not believe well designed tools have to appeal to only one audience or use case. We have seen graduate students at MIT struggle learning programming languages and young students from low-income neighborhoods excel at the same. This unique and broad exposure has led us to see far more commonalities than differences across novice and experienced programmers and it inspired and enabled us to design a programming language truly accessible to Everyone.\nRelated Languages\nModkit.io comes from a large family tree\nModkit.io is influenced by a large family tree and has benefitted from extensive interaction between its designer Ed Baafi and the designers of some of the most popular languages used by hobbyists and in education. For Ed it started over a decade ago, when Amon crossed the same bridge you see in our video carrying a flash drive containing Scratch, a new graphical programming language from his advisor Mitch Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Ed had experience teaching with Logo, one of Scratch's text-based predecessors, alongside one of its original designers Dr. Cynthia Solomon. Amon said that like Logo, Scratch was designed to make coding more accessible for kids and that just like hip-hop DJs would remix beats, vocals, and samples from existing material, Scratch was designed to let kids remix sounds, images and the programs that control them into whole new digital creations.\nHistory\nWe founded Modkit to bring the same accessibility as Scratch to microcontroller programming, originally targeting Arduino compatible development boards powered by the C++ based Wiring framework which itself has its own rich history. But Wiring/Arduino was single threaded, forcing programmers to coordinate everything in a single event loop and Modkit's early tools suffered this same limitation. If Scratch allows kids to remix like an experienced DJ with a set of turntables and a multitrack recorder, trying to remix with a single thread of control is like trying to mix with a single turntable and only one track. It's not impossible but you need a live band and you need to tightly coordinate everything. If you want to make any changes you usually have to redo the whole song. It wasn't until Modkit partnered with VEX Robotics to create Modkit for VEX, that we finally had the opportunity to bring a new language into the world. Originally called Wiring++ to honor Wiring's creator Hernando Barrag\u00e1n, Modkit.io has been in heavy development ever since and sits behind Modkit for VEX's powerful graphical programming blocks.\nFuture\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns that are complete when they produce a film, gadget, or electronic hardware and ship rewards to their backers, for Modkit.io our Kickstarter campaign is just the beginning. Once a physical item is shipped there is not much left to do but we understand that the nature of software is that it is never complete. This is why we are offering $1 rewards even before we start our campaign, but it is the same reason we need a critical mass of supporters and partners if we are to build a community around the Modkit.io language and meet that community's needs well into the future. We will update you about our plans for the future once we have reached our pre-goal, but if we fail to reach 1000 backers for $1 by June 1, we are afraid there may be no future for Modkit.io at all.\n\n\nRewards\n1000 Early Adopters get a single download of our Modkit.io Wiring library for Particle, TI Energia, and Arduino\nWhile Modkit.io is a programming language for Everything and Everyone, our pre-rewards are designed just for Early Adopters and Early Evangelists. Both rewards feature a preview release of the Modkit.io library that brings the Modkit.io language to popular Wiring-based editors such as the Arduino IDE, Particle Build and TI Energia. Early Adopters get a single download of the Modkit.io library for just $1 even before our Kickstarter campaign has actually begun. We believe that once you try our simple event driven multithreaded programming, and after we open up additional rewards, you'll want to increase your pledge so that you can continue to follow our development and make room for another early adopter to try it out.\n100 Early Evangelists get a Modkit flash drive to help spread the Modkit.io language and show support\nEarly Evangelists receive a limited edition Modkit flash drive that will only ship if our campaign is successful. Use it to share the Modkit.io updates you'll receive for one year from our funding completion. We know that many of our potential supporters are educators or members of local Makerspaces and Fab Labs so this is a great way to pass Modkit.io along to others. While it is too early to decide how we will license Modkit.io, the preview will be released under a special license that allows you to share it with your colleagues, friends, classmates and students. Help us spread the word and we'll be sure to add some more reward tiers as these begin to fill up.\nModkit Team\nThe core Modkit team met while designing and running the first of over one thousand worldwide Fab Labs as well as a one-of-a-kind youth maker program called Learn2Teach, Teach2Learn. In alphabetical order we are:\n\nEd Baafi is the lead instigator and founder of Modkit and the designer of the Modkit.io language. In 2011 he dropped out of the MIT Media Lab to focus on Modkit and hasn't looked back. From time to time he gets a chance to write including a chapter on hardware and software standards in Building Open Source Hardware. \n\nDr. Susan Klimczak is a self-proclaimed education geek who loves integrating art and technology in youth programs across Boston. She received a doctorate in education from Harvard University focusing on informal educational environments.  She is also a fellow in the FabLearn Fellows Program at Stanford University. \n\nDr. Amon Millner is Assistant Professor of Computing and Innovation at Olin College of Engineering.  While studying for his PhD with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, he helped design Scratch and related technologies. He is immortalized as a character in Scratch so you can program him to do your bidding.  \n\nCollin Reisdorf is the designer who focuses on the user interfaces and experience for Modkit's graphical programming tools.  He taught himself programming while studying design at MassArt and has designed experiences for some of the world's most recognizable brands before Ed convinced him to join Modkit.\n\n\nCredits\nModkit.io was designed and developed by Ed Baafi with support from VEX Robotics and inspired and adapted from Scratch from the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\"Modkit.io - the Most Important Technology\" stars Ismael and Sang, directed by Michael King and co-produced by Ed Baafi and Michael King.

We also already have the flash drives in hand which is currently our only physical reward. The biggest risk is for our company and for the future development of Modkit.io which cannot continue without significant support.\n\nLarge companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google have historically been the only players who have built successful businesses around programming languages and we are aware that there are not many established paths for us to follow. But we are not deterred. We believe that the current state of hobbyist programming languages and tools is so far behind and so badly fragmented that educators, students, makers, hardware manufacturers, media outlets and other interested parties will get behind our efforts to change this and create a viable business around the Modkit.io language and tools. But if you've read this far, we're sure you're already ready to support us. If so, thank you!

(Less than 2 minutes and much more entertaining than my video.)\nHow the RPiKit came into being.\nWhile developing the prototyping system for the Arduino, I had many conversations with individuals looking to learn how the Raspberry Pi could be utilized and help learn electronics using Python and Java as a programming language.  Most of my conversations ended up with the differences micro-controllers and micro-computers.  After a couple years of thought and development, we have merged the two ideas.  Yes, now you will know what to do with those bizarre \"pins\" on the corner of the Raspberry Pi.  Believe it or not, The Raspberry Pi is much more than a Bit Coin miner or a MineCraft server.\nRPiKit with Included Accessories\nWe have partnered with a parts kit supplier and turned this into a circuit board based \"plug and play\" kit without soldering, to help make learning easier and more accessible to users.  All the components will also be available separately if you want to solder together a project and build it outside the RPi prototyping kit.\nOur standard RPiKit will include a 7\" Andriod table that will be connected as a wireless display.  You can also use your existing device (Tablet, iPad or WiFi computer) as a display if you wish or utilize the HDMI connection for a wired display for programming and testing.  One of our Pledge levels offers the PRiKit without the wireless display.\nAt this stage of development, we mainly have tutorials on how to attach and actually use components in programs.  We will be hosting additional examples and projects on our \"Show and Tell\" forum where you can share projects and get ideas from the community.  We will show you how to attach and code for every components and module in the RPI Kit.

Biking to work, riding on a motorcycle, working, and even snow sports are all activities that may require you to wear a jacket. But once you start moving\u2026 that same jacket keeps the elements (moisture/sweat) in. For example, one Dry-Active team member often cycles to work. Nothing serious, just a leisurely 25 minute ride. When it rains, a jacket must be worn to keep him dry. However, within minutes he is sweating on the inside with no way for this extra moisture to be drawn away from his clothes.  In fact, high humidity makes you sweat even more.\nWhat about when you\u2019re wearing a jacket on the mountain but decide to hike up with your snowboard to ride some fresh POW. You begin to sweat, your clothes get wet, and when you\u2019re sitting on the chairlift, you feel colder because of the added dampness.\nWhether it is during work or play, keeping you dry on the inside of your jacket, leads to more comfort, drier clothes, less odour and a better regulated body temperature that keeps you healthy!\nTHE WORLD'S FIRST WEARABLE DEHUMIDIFIER \nDry-Active is a wearable micro-dehumidifier that decreases core humidity by up to 40%. It creates a dry localized environment around your upper torso and thus enhances your comfort level while you engage in activities. Dry-Active sits comfortably over your shoulders and instantly enhances the performance of any water resistant or water proof jacket you choose to wear.  \nThe Dry-Active App\nMonitor and Control your Environment\n    The Dry-Active system comes with an App that will allow you to control the humidity settings that are monitored within your jacket. With any Smart Phone or Bluetooth device, you can operate the device or monitor temperature and humidity readings. You can even set it on Auto Pilot to turn on when moisture levels rise, and then off again when the desired comfort levels are reached.\nWhy do our bodies feel more uncomfortable in higher humidity?\nThe rate at which sweat evaporates depends on how much water is already in the air. Body temperatures increase in humid regions as the body's natural cooling process (thermoregulation) is impaired.\n\"If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat... But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually gains heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation...Anything that prevents evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise... Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation...\" - wikipedia.org\nDry-Active is held in place with an adjustable 3 strap system\nAccelerates the removal of moisture caused by heat and sweat\nA recent study has shown special clothing meant to wick moisture away from the skin is in reality, ineffective for the following reasons:\nMoisture can accumulate in quantities that won't move through the fabric fast enough. \nWhen environmental humidity is as high as the humidity around your body, there is no capacity for the fabric to absorb additional vapour.\nFabrics can become saturated with water from excess rain and humidity.  When moisture also accumulates from the inside of this jacket (body heat & sweat), this newly formed moisture cannot pass through these saturated spots and becomes trapped.\nDRY-ACTIVE'S System actively circulates air around your upper body and at the same time - takes away the moisture inside your jacket.\nDRY-ACTIVE keeps your body temperature more consistent in cold weather too!\nAs we have learned, high humidity interferes with the body's cooling abilities.  In colder weather, wet fabrics sitting against the skin will transfer the cold from the surrounding environment.  This will lead to a drop in your body temperature.  Just think of how much colder a cool breeze feels on wet skin as opposed to when you are dry.  By keeping your clothing drier, our system will prevent this additional cooling effect for a more consistent experience.\nThe Dry-Active Solution\nDry-Active draws the moisture from underneath your jacket and runs it through our filter. Because the moisture is collected, your clothes stay dry and any cold transfer is prevented. The end result is a drier, more comfortable experience in any activity you choose to participate in.\n\nOur Press:\nThank you for sharing our story!\nThe Data\nOur studies have shown Dry-Active keeps your body in a recommended comfort zone. This is achieved by regulating your comfort levels away from uncomfortably moist, while also preventing you from feeling uncomfortably dry.  In our studies, improvements of up to 40% are experienced.\n  Any level above \"60\" (humidity) places the body in discomfort. Top line is without Dry-Active. Bottom line within comfort zone is with our system\nTechnical Details\n\nFeatures\nFront Diagram\nDiagram (Back)\nErgo Soft Support Sample Material\nWear\n  PLAY\n\nClick our video to see how Dry-Active sits under your jacket.\n2 adjustable shoulder straps and 1 adustable waist belt secures Dry-Active in place\nMaintenance\n\nMaintenance is easy.\nEach Dry-Active Device comes with a refillable filter that uses common low-cost materials found in your local hardware store.

It may lead to heat-related illness, disability and even worse!  Dry-Active compliments with other heat stress prevention techniques to help our outdoor working warriors and ensures a more comfortable experience throughout your activity.\nBicycle commuters \nYou can generate a good amount of sweat by pedalling for 10 miles.  On days where you don't want to look like you just came out of a sauna, Dry-Active is your best friend.\nSkier and snowboarders\nHaving fun on the slopes generates different degrees of exertion at different times.  Need to hike for 5 minutes to get to that perfect spot?  Try sitting on a 15 minute long chairlift in the cold right after.  Moisture in your jacket makes you feel colder, faster!\nUnless you are on a treadmill or a stationary bike, no single jacket can fully accommodate the varying exertion levels of any given activity.  When you are working harder than what your jacket can handle, you need that extra help.  With Dry-Active, you can automatically regulate the humidity levels in your jacket, so you feel more comfortable and dry.\nOther Activities\nFishing, Hiking, Travel, even riding a scooter during a monsoon :-) ... basically anytime a jacket is required but the activity is causing you to sweat inside.

We wanted to produce the most versatile and functional, lightweight, non-tangle leash to replace retractable, bungee, and fixed leashes with one simple product.\nWhat else?\u2026. years of walking our dogs and being frustrated by the available leash options. Other than some minor improvements, there really haven\u2019t been any leash innovations in years. Our challenge was to find the right combination of design and materials to provide a versatile, simple, non-mechanical leash, which lets you and your dog enjoy a hands-free walk together. \nThere are many leashes on the market today, but our Leash Tamer\u2122 outperforms them all. When we design multi-function products, we feel very strongly that each of the functions must perform BETTER than the single-function products being replaced. We know you don't want a product that provides three mediocre functions. \nThe Leash Tamer is the best leash you will ever own. It is perfect for any situation! Whether you are in the city, suburbs or country, the Leash Tamer works perfectly. With a simple clip, you can set it to be a 3 foot, 6 foot, or 10 foot long leash. And because it retracts so effortlessly, it will never get tangled under your dog's feet. \nEven the handle has been re-designed to help it stay on your wrist even when you are not paying attention or grabbing the leash. It has a very gentle stretch so it softly snugs up around your wrist without being tight. \nWe also offer our custom Carry Bag that can be easily clipped on to the Leash Tamer to hold your smart phone, some money, or some extra doggie bags! The Carry Bag comes in two colors: Black and Metal. \nThe Leash Tamer\u2122 has been designed and tested with all types of dog sizes and weights. We have spent years researching and developing designs and materials in order to meet the demanding objectives. We've incorporated that research into a simple to use product that provides all of the functionality of current leashes.\nThere are two sizes:\nSmall dogs: Under 25 lbs\nLarge dog: Over 25 lbs\nSingle Leash Tamer\u2122 Rewards\n Multiple Leash Tamers\u2122\nContact us if you are interested in larger quantities/bulk orders and we can add appropriate awards.\nCOLOR CHOICES:\nWe will be producing 3 colors of leashes in each of the two sizes (larger and small dogs). We want to give our collective supporters the ultimate choice of which colors are produced. Below are the color choices to pick from. At the end of the project supporters your input and vote will be gathered (along with shipping information) and we will produce the top 3 color picks for each leash size.\nSmall Dog Leash Color Choices:\nLarge Dog/Pet Leash Color Choices:\n\nAt Nootools, we \u201cmake everyday life simpler\" and we make things work with simple, intuitive, functional designs. \nNootools is a Connecticut-based company founded by a one-time physics major, Mark Noonan, who, along with the company Engineer Stephen Fog, have over 50 years combined experience designing, developing, engineering and branding new products. Before launching Nootools, we designed and developed products for some of the world\u2019s leading companies - with many US and international awards and recognitions (including Time Magazine's Best Inventions for our Snow Wolf). Together we have over 30 patents and have started and built several brands from early inception. \nWe can give you these commitments: all our products will work well, be made well, and whenever possible, made in the USA. We have deep experience with every aspect of the manufacturing process and supply chain. We have a track record of success and are absolutely committed to integrity, excellence and innovation. \nExamples of our products we invented and brought to market:\nThe Snow Wolf: a radically different approach to snow removal \nOur Leaf Loader: a nearly universal solution to all leaf and yard cleanup. \nRaxstars:  low-cost universal ski, snowboard and kayak adapters for ANY vehicle roof sport rack. \nWe focus incessantly on improving and simplifying our designs and construction, to produce the most reliable, simplest operation for our products. We are committed to making products that work to improve and simplify your life, but we are just as focused on creating well-built, durable products without flaws! Our track record in delivering flawless products to our customers is nearly perfect because we stand behind all our products 100%. \nWe also would like to thank Nellie, our shelter dog who , being part terrier and not a large dog is really the inspiration for the Leash Tamer\u2122 with her perpetual exploration and deviating from any path to investigate the many scents and animals on our daily walks\u201c\u2026to Nellie the shelter dog.. .\nOne of our strongest skill sets overall is bringing well-made products to market smoothly. The core part of that is planning, anticipating potential production and customer issues and developing simple reliable solutions and production plans (foremost a design that is functionally optimized/simplified yet that accommodates a smooth and reliable production cycle). We have already been refining a very precise and novel production sequencing with one of our tested US-based manufacturing partners \u2013 creating the many prototypes and samples by testing and proving out the best of a range of approaches. \nThe project is planned to be completed and shipped by end of April.We\u2019ll have you enjoying your early spring walks.. that is our commitment! \nThe tooling unfortunately comprises 10 weeks, as the production cycle for building that type of injection-molded tool is currently a bit back-logged (including testing and production setup) to complete after the project is funded. \nAs touched on, we are very hands on (and very experienced in managing sourcing and production sequencing) when we choose products to produce and manufacture, as we will be for the Leash Tamer \u2013 to ensure it is not just made with high quality materials, but well built to last. \nSetting up the production flow, fixtures and overall process is central to delivering and quality product - and , while we are very efficient and capable in this regard, this is a critical step for any new product production (to develop the step-by-step production and fabrication step) and to create simple fixtures (specific to our product and components) for the factory team to work from. \nProduction run (4 weeks), as it would start slow with higher percentage of quality control sampling before speeding up daily production then adding/training additional production teams.  \nPlease Join Us to 'Kickstart' the Leash Tamer\u2122 \u2026.\nWe are very pleased to be launching Kickstarter and really appreciate both your interest and support in our goal to bring products to you that save time and simplify your life. Please show your support by making a pledge to receive your Leash Tamer\u2122 or as a gift to a fellow pet lover. We hope you will spread the word and help us raise enough to put Leash Tamer into production. Our thanks to you and your four-footed friends.. We would also greatly appreciate if everyone would share the Kickstarter project link with a friend.\nYour generous pledge will go directly towards helping us fund the costs of the production engineering, sizable tooling for the injection-mold, raw materials, final packaging design, shipping and the first production run. Any funds received beyond that will be well used for the further development of our brand and two additional planned Leash Tamer\u2122 brand products.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn order to amortize and cover the tooling and setup costs, we need to reach a minimum production of roughly 1600 units. The manufacturing and tooling is fairly straightforward and low volume tooling and production has already been successfully tested. The current design has been worked through by our team and will have only minor tweaks in the final tooling/design. \n\nWe have filed our patent and it is now pending. There are minor risks related to staying on schedule rather than risks to successfully delivering finished products. While the fabrics and hardware component suppliers have already been sourced, there is always some possibility that once we deliver the final engineering designs for the injection molding, the company doing our tool building may have slightly longer backlogs and lead times which could somewhat delay our production. Similarly, while we have built in what we think is prudent scheduling with our final fabricator/assembler, unplanned new production projects could possibly delay final production and delivery . Nonetheless, anticipating ,planning for, and managing the many hundreds of minor production issues is a major focus for us and one that we are committed to delivering a timely and high quality product to our supporters and customers. \n\nShould the project be well over-subscribed, that might add at most a couple weeks, merely from just the greater production volume requiring a bit more production time.\n\nOur team has one of the best product designers with a very strong background in design for manufacturing. Even if we encounter high demand, we will be able to scale production and logistics accordingly.

This glorious victory when the temperature displays on your LCD, or your LEDs flash in perfect succession. I've spent many long hours on projects seeking this moment, only to have it shattered by the realization that my creation is shackled to the USB port of my computer or the cord on an AC adapter. Sure, you could wire up a battery pack of sorts with a costly 9V battery or a pack of AAs; only adding to the amount of delicate circuitry. We knew there had to be a better way...\nAfter some trial and error, we have found the better way.\nNightShade Electronics is proud to introduce to you...\n What is it? The energyShield is a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery in the form of an Arduino shield (Uno/Leonardo Compatible). It has three main internal functions including a circuit to boost the battery's nominal voltage of 3.7V to 5V; a lithium-polymer battery charging circuit; and an on-board fuel gauge IC which allows for the measurement of battery voltage, current, and accumulated charge by means of a Two-Wire Interface (TWI/I2C).\nWhat's Included\nAll energyShields will include:\nenergyShield (with everything soldered except the headers and battery)\nBattery (with bare leads)\nHeader Pins\nPower Adapter (U.S. Plug Type, 9V DC)\nFeatures\nContained in Arduino Shield Form-Factor (Uno and Leo/R3)\nRechargable\nUninterruptable\n5V Output (and 3.3V when attached to an Arduino)\n500 mA Output (Final version will be HIGHER!)\nIntegrated Charging Circuit\nFuel-gauge IC - Monitor Voltage, Current, and Charge via a Two-Wire Interface (TWI/I2C)\nFully Functional Arduino Library\nOn/Off Switch\nCharges from Standard Arduino Power Adapter (7.2-20V)\nPowers Arduino While Charging\n@ $15,000 - 3.3V Output and Breakout Header for non-shield use\n@ $20,000 - Charges via USB micro cable\n@ $25,000 - Chages via solar (PV) cell without power interruption\nSome Applications\nTemporary Projects\nRemote Data Logging\nR/C Vehicles\nClassrooms\nAny Time You Want Hassle-Free Power\nHow is it Unique?\nIt's not a secret that there are other batteries out there for the Arduino. However, there is no other rechargeable Arduino battery that includes built-in charging circuitry, offers high current sourcing ability, and contains a fuel gauge within the footprint of the Arduino . Here at NightShade Electronics we created our first working prototype a couple weeks before Christmas and, even today, we are still fascinated by the ease at which you can power a project with the energyShield. There's no expensive, disposable batteries. No delicate power circuitry. Just a securely attached shield with an On switch and DC power jack for recharging. It's easy and it is FUN! \nThe Journey\nAfter we formed the initial concept of the energyShield we went right to work designing our first prototype. Our first design was... less than impressive. Sometimes it functioned as it was supposed to and, at other times, it lost some of it's magic smoke. While addressing a simple problem we had created a complicated solution. At that point we threw out the design and started again with a blank canvas. We began again with a more simple, yet more elegant design. The operation is now more intuitive, and the energyShield is more robust. In our second iteration we had achieved everything we had set out to do. We have created a shield that provides a project with power at the flip of a switch. \nBut, we're not stopping here. We already have a list of changes to make to further improve the energyShield. As you read this we are working on our third iteration of the energyShield. We are fixing a couple of bugs and adding to the list of features.\nWhere you come in...\nWe have brought the energyShield to Kickstarter, because we need your support to fund the first production run of the energyShield. We have a manufacturing plan in place and we are in contact with various suppliers who are ready to source the parts to us. The only missing piece is your pledge. Your pledge will provide the capital necessary to place a production order large enough for it to be economical. On behalf of the entire NightShade team, Thank you!\nAtmel article featuring the energyShield!\nAbout project\nThe robot in the video, project, was designed as a power source demonstrator. As such, it does not have any power source of its own. The Arduino seen on the top of the robot has wires soldered to the bottom of it to control and power the screen and motors.\nThis campaign is not about project though, so back to the energyShield!\nTechnical Stuff   \nPresently the energyShield has a capacity of 1200 mAh, a nominal current sourcing of 500 mA and, at full charge, a maximum current sourcing of 825 mA. We are looking into improving the current rating of the board to allow the energyShield to power even more demanding projects. The reason for the varying current limitation on the energyShield has to do with the output voltage (5V) being stepped up from the battery voltage (3.7V nominal). Because the battery voltage is lower than the output voltage, the current from the battery is larger than the current drawn from the energyShield at 5V. Assuming that the power from the battery is equal to the power used at 5V, the battery current (100% efficient) can be illustrated as such: I(bat) = I(out) * 5V / V(bat). What this says is that as the battery dies (voltage decreases), the current drawn from the batter will increase. Therefore the load must be limited, so that the current drawn from the battery does not exceed the battery limitation, even at the lowest battery voltages.\nBelow is a graph which represents data recorded from the energyShield via the TWI interface. \n This data was recorded as a fully charged energyShield was fully discharged under a 245 mA load. This constant load is represented by the lowest curve on the graph (Output Current). It reflects that over the entire life of the battery the current output from the energyShield to the load was a constant 245 mA. The next curve to take note of is the \"Output Current, 100% Eff.\" This is the current that would have been output if the energyShield was 100% efficient at boosting the battery voltage to 5V. I won't hold you in suspense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ok, maybe for just a minute . . . . . .  It is NOT 100% efficient. Actually it is about 83% efficient. What this means is that you will only be able to use about 83% of the electricity that was stored in the battery. Here in Florida the amount of electricity in the battery costs about 0.0051\u00a2, so I would say that's not really a big deal. The final two curves, Battery Voltage and Battery Current, work together. This illustrates why you can not pull the rated current capacity from the battery when the voltage is boosted. As the battery power is consumed the battery voltage decreases. As the battery voltage decreases the amount of current drawn from the battery must increase to maintain the constant output current. As the battery nears the end of its life the current drawn from the battery is almost double the amount output, which could easily over draw the battery. We are looking into some modifications that could lower the amount of extra current required towards the end of the battery life. This will allow the current rating of the energyShield to be even higher than it is today.\nProduction Plan\nDuring Kickstarter (Feb - Mar)\nOrder samples from suppliers: Because the components such as the battery and power adapter are being produced by companies overseas, we expect the shipping to take a couple weeks. We want to complete this early on so the schedule is not held back. \nDesign and order the next revision of the energyShield: Once the next (and hopefully final) prototype of the energyShield is designed, the process of ordering as assembling it will take 2-3 weeks. We plan to complete the next design during the Kickstarter campaign, that way we will be ready for production soon after the campaign ends. \nFinish writing Arduino library for the energyShield: We have a preliminary version of the library right now, but want to have the library completed before we send our backers their energyShields. Write documentation for the energyShield The energyShield is extremely simple to use, but there are several advanced features and specifications that will be explained in the documentation.\nPost-Kickstarter (Mar - Apr)\nDesign the final version of the energyShield: This will be the production version of the energyShield. Here we will make the last little tweaks to the design. \nOrder production proof of the energyShield from the PCB manufacturer/assembler: Before the manufacturer produces 100\u2019s or 1000\u2019s of the energyShield we are going to have them send us a proof; just one or two energyShields produced exactly as if they were part of the production run. This gives us the chance to catch any problems before we have a plethora of defective energyShields. \nPlace production order to PCB manufacturer/assembler and suppliers: Once we have tested and approved the energyShield proof from the manufacturer we will give them the go-ahead to make the energyShield for the masses.\nProduction Completed (May)  \nPacking and Shipping the energyShield: Once we have received all of the completed parts of the energyShield, we will pack them into kits and mail them to you!\n*Some Assembly Required\nThe energyShield will be shipped to you needing minor assembly. You will need to solder the header pins and battery to the board. This helps to prevent damage to the pins during shipping and it avoids costly FCC certification; as the energyShield is a sub-assembly sold in a kit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already overcome most of our greatest challenges. Some of these included creating our prototype design, finding manufacturers and suppliers, and bringing this to Kickstarter. \n\nNow our biggest challenges are securing distributors and telling people that the energyShield is ready for them! We have production plans in place. What we need now is for people to spread the word.

The process begins with a PCB design (that's what we did) and a parts list. The manufacturer (Jaycon Systems) took the design of one energyShield and had it made into panels of 12 energyShields (seen in update #17) to increase production efficiency. In the manufacturing line the panels begin by making their way through a stenciling machine. This machine uses a stencil, that matches the energyShield, to spread solder paste on to all of the solder pads, in the correct amounts.

Our Solarpad Kit sets a new standard for a rugged, lightweight, compact, powerful, water resistant, and easy-to-use USB solar charger that can keep a smart phone charged all day! Connect Solarpad to the Power Core battery input then use the cable that came with your smart phone and plug it in to the Power Core output. Solar charge the Power Core battery and charge your phone from this battery at the same time! We designed the Solarpad Kit without an on/off button so you just plug it in and it works automatically! If a phone has a unique connector, one end of its charge cable always has a standard USB compatible plug. No extra cables are required because they are built-in. Use the Solarpad Kit on your next adventure! Will not leave you powerless.

Thanks!\nWhat About Other Similar Solar Chargers on the Market?\nClick below for an animation comparing the Solarpad Kit vs. Competitors\nPLAY\n\nThe Solarpad Kit is designed to outlive the life of your Smart Phone! Solarpad uses a high-quality, custom Suntactics solar panel, which has a fluoropolymer film with the best light transmission, precision cut and tabbed high-efficiency solar cells, and a high-strength substrate. The panel is attached to an aluminum housing, which holds the buckle straps and 1/4-20 tripod thread in place and acts as a passive heat sink to cool the panel. Our Power Core battery uses a high-efficiency, high-power charge controller from Maxim and the housing is sealed with high-strength epoxy, which prevents water from leaking in. Also, Power Core uses the same battery that's used in the Tesla electric car, which is the best battery of its kind. Even the built-in USB cables consist of thicker gage wire, which allows the electricity to flow more efficiently. The Solarpad Kit is engineered to squeeze the most energy possible from the sun's rays in to your smart phone. No short-cuts that compromise power or efficiency are taken, period. A fully charged Power Core will recharge a dead iPhone from 0% to 100% in 3 hours even after being unused for a month! Our competitors may have a power level indicator, but for this size solar charger, power level indicators are inaccurate and not very useful. Other similar sized solar chargers can only charge a Smart Phone from 0% to 70% and take over 4 hours to recharge, so what good is a power level indicator if it won't charge your phone from 0% to 100% at any level? Power Core's Green LED lights up when charging and turns off when fully charged. Much larger smart phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S4, have a battery that's twice the size of an iPhone battery, but a fully charged Power Core can still provide a Galaxy S4 a 0% to 70% charge.\nWhy Open Source Hardware?\nThe solar USB charging market has become saturated with low-quality and poor performing products and every year the big companies are selling the same products with very little improvement. Therefore, Solarcycle has developed its open source solar USB charger to empower customers with the ability to build their own solar USB chargers and to prove that a better solar charger that outperforms anything else on the market is possible.

We've solved the fundamental problems with solar USB charging, but right now each Solarpad Kit is assembled by me in my apartment using rapid prototype components. In order to build the final production version at a reasonable cost, funds must be raised to purchase a minimum order of hundreds of solar panels, batteries, cables, brackets, tubes, circuits, and plastic components. Other equipment costs include molds for the plastic parts and creating custom assembly fixtures. The Solarpad Kit is designed be as simple to manufacture as possible and it is always being refined for the most efficient assembly. Our suppliers have given us great quality prototype parts and they are ready to manufacture the components in larger quantities. Typical manufacturing lead-times for components are about 30 days and test batches are always ordered before going in to large-scale production. Tools, fixtures, test equipment, and work benches for assembling products need to be purchased too. On top of that, there are a lot of house-keeping duties like business licenses, permits, and bookkeeping that any new start-up has to take care of. Realistically, it should take about 6 months to set-up shop, order parts, manufacture parts, inspect components, assemble each batch, final test each unit, package, and then ship them.\nFCC Compliance: NOT required because circuit frequencies are below 1.7MHz\n3-D CAD Models of Solarpad and Power Core.\nJanuary, 2014. Final Prototype. Solarpad Kit!\nSafety \nDo Not connect Solarpad directly to a Smart Phone. Solarpad outputs up to 6 Volts of raw unregulated solar power that may not be compatible with Smart Phones. Only connect Solarpad to Power Core.\nDo Not leave Power Core or your phone in direct sunlight. Keep them covered or in the shade. The USB cables allow Power Core to be connected to Solarpad while being hidden away from direct sunlight. Some competitor solar products have a built-in battery that is permanently attached to the solar panel itself, but heat from the solar panel can cause the charge circuit and battery to get very hot, stop charging, degrade the battery, and shorten its lifespan.\nModifying: Never attempt to repair or modify the Solarpad Kit yourself. The Solarpad Kit does not contain any user-serviceable parts. Disassembling the Solarpad Kit may cause damage.\nAcceptable Temperatures: The Solarpad Kit is designed to be operated in temperatures between 0\u00ba and 45\u00ba C (32\u00ba and 149\u00ba F). \nFor best results, fully charge Power Core before traveling.\nKeep USB Connectors Dry: If the USB connectors get wet, dry them off. They are water-resistant, but the metal USB connectors may rust with long exposure to moisture. Shake and blow out moisture inside the connector.\nStorage: Store the Solarpad Kit in room temperature. Power Core should be recharged about once a year to prevent over discharge.\nDon't Let Your Next Outdoor Adventure Look Like This!\nWall sockets are usually taken! Use the Solarpad Kit instead!\n  Without the Solarpad Kit, people had to search for available wall sockets before going to bed!\nTroubleshooting\nI left the Solarpad Kit outside and it didn't charge my phone:\n1) Trees, mountains, and buildings may block the sun as it moves through the sky, which dramatically reduces power output. Placement and angle of the Solarpad is very important for phone charging. Luckily, smart phone Apps like these can help predict the sun's path using augmented reality through your phone's camera so you can see where the least obstructed position and angle will be throughout the day:\nwww.sunsurveyor.com\nwww.ozpda.com/sunseeker_iphone.php\nwww.solmetric.com/solmetric-isv-iphone-app.html\n2) While a few clouds or thin hazy clouds will still work for solar charging, thick dense clouds won't. If it's a very cloudy day, Power Core may still charge, but wait until there is a break in the clouds to start solar charging your phone.\n3) Hiking through a dense forest or mountainous area with the Solarpad Kit on your backpack may not be suitable for phone charging because there may be too many shadows reducing solar power significantly. Power Core may still charge, but wait until there is a clearing in the woods or a flat area to start solar charging your phone.\n4) Charging very early in the morning or very late in the afternoon may still charge Power Core, but they are the weakest times for solar charging your phone because the sun is very low in the sky and Earth's atmosphere absorbs a lot more light. The sun is strongest in the summer from 8am to 4pm and in the winter from 10am to 2pm. Try charging your phone around these times.\n5) If Solarpad surface is very dirty, it can significantly reduce the power output to your phone. Power Core may still charge, but try cleaning the Solarpad surface before solar charging your phone.\n6) Make sure Power Core has about 15 minutes of solar charge before plugging your phone in to the Power Core. This will ensure that the battery has enough energy to compensate for brief power fluctuations and keep your phone charging.\n\nPower Core LED doesn't light up when solar charging: \n1) This can occur if Power Core is completely drained and goes in to a trickle charge mode. Solar charge Power Core for about 15 minutes and the LED charge light should turn back on.\n2) Sometimes on extremely hot days, the surrounding hot ground and air will cause the Power Core circuit to shut off and stop charging even if it's in the shade. Put the Solarpad Kit somewhere away from the sun, like indoors or in a tent, to cool down and when you feel it is cool, take the Solarpad Kit outside to charge again with Power Core in the shade and elevated above the hot ground, like on a piece of wood. If there is not much shade, putting a small towel, cloth bag, or box around Power Core may also help it keep cool. \n\nMy phone still isn't charging:\n1) Thinner USB charge cables have a history of not lasting very long. Charge cable damage can be visible, but sometimes it is not. Try replacing your phone's charge cable.\n2) After a few years of use, the battery inside the phone tends to wear out and perform poorly. If your phone's battery has trouble holding a charge or runs out of power faster than usual, try replacing your phone's battery.\n\nPower Core LED doesn't light up when charging from my USB wall adapter:\n1) This can occur if Power Core is completely drained and goes in to a trickle charge mode. Keep Power Core plugged in for about 15 minutes and the LED charge light should turn back on.\n2) USB wall adapters have a history of not lasting very long. Try another USB port or replace the wall adapter. \n\nPower Core LED doesn't light up when charging from my laptop:\n1) This can occur if Power Core is completely drained and goes in to a trickle charge mode. Keep Power Core plugged in for about 15 minutes and the LED charge light should turn back on.\n2) Some older laptops have a low current limitation in their USB ports and will disable the USB port if the current exceeds the limit. Try plugging Power Core in to another USB port. \nTesting the Solarpad Kit prototype on Ragbrai 2013", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with over seven years of experience in the semiconductor industry. I also gained a lot manufacturing experience working at my Dad's sheet metal shop since I was a kid. I have spent the last 3 years designing and testing portable energy systems for smart phones and used them while on bicycle tours, camping, and hiking. The prototypes have already been designed with manufacturability in mind, which include designs for plastic molds. From my experience with complex project deadlines, a 6 month lead-time is reasonable for this type of project with the resources available. Unforeseen issues that can delay the shipment of rewards to Kickstarter backers include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Delays in receiving components on time from vendors. \n* Delays from rejected parts during inspection. \n* Delays from the carrier in shipping the product to the Kickstarter backer.\n\nThese products are designed to last many years and they won't ship unless they've been fully qualified and tested. Backers that receive a factory defective item can send it back to us right away and we'll exchange it for a new one.

Check. \nSpilling my hot drink onto my papers on several occasions. Check. \nObserving other people spilling their drinks into their laptops. Check.\nSpending hours on airplanes without room on my tray table for both my laptop and my drink. Check. \nSpilling drinks onto lap while on airplanes. Check. \nRecognizing a problem. Check. \nSketching and sorting through ideas. Check.\nThe drawings below show some of my original solutions to the problem. One based on an extension spring. Another based on gravity. A third one based on friction. None of those solutions, however, would provide the level of safety and security I judged to be essential. \nMoreover, the device needed to be something that could be operated with one hand. It needed some sort of clamp.\nI needed a clamp design that was both strong and easy to use. One that could hold tight while being easy enough to open. I studied levers and springs.\nOne of the enjoyable aspects of inventing is learning lots of new things. Regrettably, I never took classes in mechanics. So I had to immerse myself in learning about the power of levers, forces, vectors, deformation, storage of energy, materials and springs. It was fun.\nFinally, I hit on the combination of features that delivered the functionality I required. A simple clamping machine that would be strong enough to safely hold onto a \"fixture\" (e.g., a table) but would be easy enough to squeeze open with one hand. And that would incorporate a structure that could hold a range of containers with different shapes and diameters.\nThat led me to this design of \"bent wire.\"\nI ordered up a prototype. When it arrived, I began to test it. It worked well in that it held securely onto a table and held a range of containers of different heights and diameters.\nBut it was awkward to use. And it struck me as particularly unlovely.\nFinally, I hit upon the winning design of solid aluminum. \nWhen the first prototype of this model arrived, I tested it against a large variety of cup sizes. The complete Starbucks assortment, certainly. Plus the unusually shaped and shallow cups you get on airplanes. Even thermos bottles.I redesigned the ring to hold almost all paper and plastic cup sizes.\nAfter quite a few prototypes, I arrived at the version you see below. The final version.\nIt satisfied the two basic needs while being easier to use. And it is aesthetically much more appealing.\nOn to the next stage:\nDoing patent and trademark searches. Check. \nFiling patent and trademark applications. Check. \nHunting for a factory and receiving bids. Check. \nFactory selected. Check. \nTooling made. Check. \nFirst articles received. Check. (First articles are samples made with the dies, parts and processes that will be used for the production runs.) \nWeb site designed and launched. Check.\nPackaging designed. Check.\nHunting for packaging manufacturer. Check. \nSpending lots of money. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check.\nNow I'm in the home stretch. No more development remains. The device is finalized and it works as planned. It is constructed out of high-grade anodized aluminum.\nHere is the Vector cupholder in the wild:\nIf you back the Vector cupholder, your money will be used for creating the packaging dies (for the boxes) and production of the devices themselves. And\u2014critically\u2014for marketing. No matter how good a product is, it won't be successful unless people hear about it.\nThank you for taking the time to visit my page.\nCliff", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDesign is complete. The tooling has been created and paid for. I've thoroughly tested this design with repeated cycles for more than a month.\n\nIf I reach my Kickstarter goal, I will proceed immediately to manufacturing. If I do not reach my goal via Kickstarter, I will pursue other avenues for funding.\n\nThe factory is prepared to begin fabrication as soon as I email it my purchase order. The box printer is similarly ready to go. All ducks are lined up.\n\nI expect to formally place my order with the factory and box supplier in the first half of November.\n\nThe factory tells me it will take 6-8 weeks to complete fabrication. I prefer to think it'll take 10-12 weeks. Inevitably, a key piece of factory machinery will break down or some other nonforeseeable event will intervene and production will be delayed.\n\nA strike of aluminum miners? A strike of longshoremen? Pirates? A worldwide shortage of cardboard for the cardboard boxes? It could be anything. The realistic position is to not expect anything to go smoothly.\n\nI learned that lesson with my previous invention, the iKeyboard (now called the TacType keyboard).\n\nI expect to be able to send you, my Kickstarter backers, your Rewards by late December or early January.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), built in. The BLEduino is both hardware and software compatible with Arduino since it\u2019s based on the Arduino Leonardo. Anything that runs on an Arduino will run on a BLEduino.  It's the easiest way to get Bluetooth 4.0 in your project! Control anything from your phone!\nFull Arduino Shield Compatibility\nWe wanted the BLEduino to be small enough to be used in any project, but not if that meant you'd lose the ability to use all your awesome Arduino shields.  For this reason, we created the Shield-Shield. The Shield-Shield is a handy attachment that translates the BLEduino\u2019s pin layout into the traditional Arduino layout. That is, it makes the BLEduino fully Arduino shield compatible. Note, we've noticed a trend of boards stating they are compatible with all Arduino Shields when they actually aren't.  For a board to be fully compatible you would need it to support both the old Arduino UNO pin layout and the new Arduino Leonardo pin layout.  Not only that, the boards would have to support 5V logic (which we do). The layout problem is solved by our Shield-Shield by allowing you to switch between the old and new pin layout by just flipping a switch.  In other words, the same Shield-Shield is basically backwards and forwards compatible, allowing it to work with nearly all Arduino shields.  C'mon, you know that\u2019s pretty awesome.\nModular and Compact\nThe BLEduino is great for prototyping! It\u2019s breadboard compatible, tiny enough to fit in any enclosure, and compatible with standard shields when you need it to be.\nEase of Use\nThe BLEduino works for everyone. Not an expert in iPhone or Arduino development? No problem! Simply use our free iPhone application and/or our pre-made Arduino sketches (that use our included BLE arduino library) and you\u2019re good to go!  Our iPhone app is also fully open source and broken up into modules so you\u2019re free to take what you need and ignore the rest if you want to develop your own app. There is no limit to what you can create and we're super excited to see what you build with it.\nAndroid Support\nSadly, Android does not have official support for Bluetooth 4.0.  However, it is our top priority to provide the BLEduino app to Android phones once support is established. It's been announced that the next version of Android will include support so you can expect the app shortly after the SDK gets released.  Rest assured, support is coming.\nOpen Source\nOpen source goodness.  The BLEduino is 100% open source in every way.  The iPhone app, the schematics / pcbs, and all the firmware will be released to the community once we\u2019re done with the development.\nWhy did we create the BLEduino?\nWe love creating smart and connected devices.  While tinkering away one day, we realized that getting Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) to work with existing projects wasn\u2019t exactly lollipops and sunshine.  So we decided to abstract all that nasty low level stuff, make a simple to use iPhone app, and bundle it all up in an Arduino-compatible board that the world could use.\nWhat can I do with the BLEduino?\nAll sorts of things!  That\u2019s the beauty of it! In particular, since it's based on the Arduino Leonardo you can do keyboard and mouse emulation, a feature that's uncommon on other boards. Here are a few examples of things you can do with the BLEduino (all of these are live in our video):\nHere are a few unique ones to BLEduino:\nThese are just a few of the awesome things you can build with the BLEduino.  Also, BLEduinos can communicate with each other via a hub (your phone or computer) enabling even more complex scenarios. Helicopter army anyone?\nGeneral Specs\nArduino Software Compatible \nArduino Hardware Compatible\nBluetooth 4.0 (Low Energy) \nVery small (~ 0.9\" x 1.7\" )\nIncludes BLEduino Arduino library \nIncludes all-in-one iPhone application for all your experiments\nTech Specs\nATmega32u4 with a modified Leonardo bootloader.     \nSupply Voltage - 5V     \nOnboard 5V Regulator    \nOnboard 3.3V Regulator    \nGPIO Pins - 21    \nPWM Channels - 6     \nAnalog Input Channels - 12     \nSerial Communication: UART, SPI, I2C\nDC Current per I/O Pin - 40 mA     \nFlash Memory - 32 KB. \n4KB used by bootloader.    \nSRAM - 2.5 KB     \nEEPROM - 1 KB     \nClock Speed - 16 MHz    \nLED\u2019s for serial communication (RX, TX)    \nLED for bluetooth connectivity     \nBluetooth 4.0 (BLE) - nRF8001  \nDedicated controller for nRF8001     \nExpected BLE Range - at least 80ft (Currently testing)\nWhere we're at\nThe BLEduino has currently evolved over two designs and is expecting one last design. We started out using a third party BLE module but quickly moved on to our second design, which includes our own BLE module, a change that lowered the cost dramatically. Our third and final version will be smaller, sexier, and much more polished!\nThe Shield-Shield has also gone through some evolving with one last design in the production.  The final version will allow you to switch the Shield-Shield between old and new pin layout.  (More info in the FAQ)\nWe want our iOS application to be a living example of what easy Bluetooth integration should be. For this reason we are taking extra care in making sure our app is optimized and easy to understand, that means there is still work to be done.  We are always adding things to the BLEduino so you can expect to see some additional modes and features.\nProject Timeline\nThe following is our estimated timeline (all in 2013):\nJune - Finalize design details of the BLEduino and iOS application.\nJuly - Testing of both the BLEduino and iOS application and iterate if necessary.\nAug - Release source code for the application and BLEduino designs.\nSept - Test small pre-release batch of the BLEduino and order Final production run.\nOct - Packaging and quality assurance.\nNov - Fulfillment to backers.\nThe Team\nWe're a team of engineers, designers, and doers who build things that incorporate hardware, software, or both. We created the BLEduino because we wanted to simplify Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) development and enable easy communication with smartphones. Our team: \nJonathan.  Pixel lover & leader of the pack. Co-founder, designer, and CEO.  Loves to talk about the pixels and the \"essence\" of things.  Completely obsessed with the BLEduino and is occasionally caught staring at it for long periods of time.\nRamon.  iOS terminator & back-end conquistador.  Co-founder, developer, and customer development evangelist. Kickstarter junkie. Loves to talk about startups, tech, and everything in between. \nAngel.  Hardware extraordinaire & human SMD machine.  Co-founder, hardware engineer, and front-end developer. Loves to talk about how insanely tiny our components are and how he hand soldered that one component you can barely see.\nThank you!\nWe hope you're as excited about the BLEduino as we are and can't wait to get easy Bluetooth 4.0 to everyone in the world!\nAlso, we'd like to give a special thanks to EngiWorks, the awesome folk that have been giving us office space since our inception.\nIf you'd like to know a little bit more about our story and why we're doing this, read the following Forbes article where we're featured:\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/giovannirodriguez/2013/06/25/will-the-hardware-rennaisance-come-to-puerto-rico/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs expected with any project, there are risks and challenges in delivering the BLEduino. First of all, we\u2019re still working on finalizing our design. That means some issues may still arise, however unlikely that may be. Most of the \u201cbig\u201d issues have been tackled but there is still much to do when it comes to validating the stability.\n\nMoreover, testing takes time, and we don\u2019t have a local way to produce PCB boards. Hence, having to wait almost two weeks for new boards means we always have to plan with that in mind and we would be lying if we said that wasn\u2019t a challenge.\n\nLastly, we have partnered up with a great manufacturer and have taken into account the extra costs necessary to cover manufacturing risks (e.g. sourcing, delays). Furthermore, we have assessed our goal meticulously and repeatedly to ensure a successful campaign. However, that doesn\u2019t guarantee there will be no surprises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "It's happening!", "update_content": "Hey Everyone,\nWe hope you\u2019re doing great!

The first phase is the PCB manufacturing, this is where the raw boards with no components get produced. The second phase is assembly, where all of the components get added to the PCBs.

In fact, we love it so much that we couldn't imagine the Spark Core without it. That's why we've designed the Core to run Wiring, the same simple code as the entire Arduino platform. If you're like us, the last thing you want to do is learn a new programming language or change your existing sketches.\nEASY WI-FI SET-UP PROCESS\nSet-up steps: \n1. Enter your network name and password into the Spark App and press OK.\nThat was it. Seriously. You\u2019re connected.\nThe Spark Core makes first-time configuration of your devices a breeze for both creators and users. The Core includes a brand spankin' new Wi-Fi module: the CC3000 from Texas Instruments. It features their unique setup process called Smart Config that allows makers and developers to bring their creations online in seconds.\nREPROGRAM THE CORE OVER WI-FI\nThe Core is already Wi-Fi connected, so we've decided to do away with wires altogether.* You can program your new software in our web development environment or in your favorite text editor, and with a single click, Spark Flash delivers updated firmware to your project over the web.\nSpark Flash means that your projects stay in their enclosures, out in the field, and in the hands and homes of users, where they belong. It also means that your creations can be easily changed, updated, and improved over time, without worrying about USB ports and programmer pins.\n* Of course, you can still program the Core over USB or with a JTAG programmer, but where's the fun in that? \nOPEN SOURCE AND THE SPARK COMMUNITY\nWe've benefitted tremendously from the open source community, and we're dedicated to giving back. The Core is a totally open source hardware product. All of our hardware design files (schematic, board design, and bill of materials) and firmware will be open source. The components we're using are available from any major distributor. We're also sticking with open standards (HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, Protocol Buffers) for all of our communications. We want to make it as easy as possible to extend and improve upon the foundation we've built.\nMAKE COOL THINGS\nWe made the Spark Core because we love building things \u2014 especially connected things. So while the Core is fun enough on its own, it\u2019s the projects you can build with Spark that really excite us. Here are just a few examples of what you could build:\nThese are just a few of the projects that we've imagined and built in the last few weeks. We'll be sharing these ideas, and any others we dream up in the future, through Kickstarter updates and on our community site. We hope you'll do the same!\nPOWERED BY THE SPARK CLOUD\nHARDWARE, MEET THE CLOUD.\nImagine if you could create hardware that could be changed and improved with the simplicity and speed of software.  That's the idea behind the Spark Cloud, our network of servers that supercharges every Spark Core with a suite of cool software-enabled features:\nWrite code on your phone in your Grandma's house, and update projects sitting at home in your garage.\nProgram your lights to flutter when your high-school crush changes his/her relationship status on Facebook.\nSend camera and video feeds securely through the web to share with your friends and family\nThe Spark Cloud makes your projects accessible from anywhere in the world, creates a secure environment, and allows for our simple but powerful REST API. We built the Spark Cloud to make your lives easier, and to eliminate the complexity and limitations of locally connected products. But don't worry \u2014 the Spark Cloud is and always will be free to anyone using the Spark Core.\nAnd in case you're worried about privacy or lock-in, we'll be releasing an open source version of the Spark Cloud designed for easy deployment on local machines or your own Heroku dyno, AWS instance, or private server.\nREST API\nOur REST API lets you write software for a smartphone, tablet, computer, or web application that can interact with your hardware projects in the physical world. This makes it possible for your devices for you or any other authorized users to access and control your device in any way you'd like from anywhere in the world.\nThe API has been designed around great REST APIs like Twilio, Stripe, and Twitter (and in fact pairs well with any of those other great APIs!) We've also made it easy to set up permissions so you control who and what can access your stuff.\nFor those interested, documentation for our API can be found here. Our API will be constantly growing and improving, so be sure to check back often for updates.\n128-BIT ENCRYPTION\nThe Core, the Cloud, and the entire Spark development platform is secured with industry-standard AES (on the hardware side) and SSL (on the API side) encryption to keep all your wireless communications in the right hands. This means that only the set of authorized users that you control (and not your neighborhood or its local hacker club) can communicate with your stuff.\nSHIELDS AND ACCESSORIES\nSometimes you want to start a little further along than a blank breadboard. To help, we've designed a few Shields for the Core - complete circuits that can quickly extend the Core into complex projects. Plus, through the Spark Shield Shield, the Spark Core is compatible with Arduino shields, so you can get started with the projects you've already built!\nThese Shields and accessories can help you kickstart your own connected projects.  We're making them available to you to fiddle with yourself, to expand on and improve, or cast aside altogether.  These little add-ons have helped us build the first projects with the Spark Core, and we can't wait to see the ones you come up with yourself.\nCurrent Shields:\nShield Shield - Converts the footprint and pins of your Spark Core into that of an Arduino, making it compatible with all of your existing Arduino shields and accessories.\nRelay Shield - Control any normal outlet or high voltage electronics product to switch your existing electronics on and off from anywhere! Turn your AC on when your close to home.  Switch off the lamp in your living room from your couch.  Be really mobile and/or really lazy.\nJTAG Shield - For the deeply technical, use the JTAG Shield to flash code directly to the microcontroller on the Spark Core.  If you're an embedded software expert, you want this.\nBattery Shield - Wireless projects need mobile power.  A simple 3.7V battery connects to this shield for solder-free integration with the Spark Core.\nHave an idea for another cool Spark Shield or accessory?  Post it in the comments! We'd love to hear from you.\nOUR TEAM\nWe're a team of engineers, designers, and creatives who wanted to help lower the barrier to creating compelling connected hardware.  Many people have been involved in various ways, but the core (sorry) team is as follows:\nZach Supalla. CEO of Spark, and the designer and creator of the Spark Core.  Worked in operations and product development at McKinsey & Co. Loves gadgets, coffee, arcade games, tinkering, and his dog Hunter.\nZachary Crockett. CTO of Spark, and a professional software developer for 10 years. Making Spark a secure, reliable, and scalable platform every day.  Has a Ph.D. in music composition, bikes everywhere, and donates a foot of hair to Locks of Love every 3 years.  Ask him about his earWorms.\nStephanie Rich. Spends every day thinking about you, our community of users and supporters. Worked in international sales and marketing in the film industry. Wrote a book and consistently extolls the virtues of Minneapolis despite the blizzards in April.\nWill Hart. Design engineer. Works tirelessly to imagine great new products with the Spark Core. World-renowned for his vocal licks. Extremely tall.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nGENERAL SPECS\nArduino compatible (through custom integration of Wiring libraries)\nWi-Fi 802.11 b/g\nEasy setup over Wi-Fi\nDeveloper friendly REST API\n128-bit SSL encryption\nWireless software updates\nBreadboard compatible\n\nHARDWARE SPECS\n32-bit STM32 72MHz ARM Cortex M3\n128KB of Flash memory, 20KB of RAM\nTexas Instruments SimpleLink CC3000 Wi-Fi chip\nEEPROM (supplied by the CC3000)\n2MB of external flash memory\n3.3V DC supply voltage (with on board power regulator)\n50mA typical current consumption\n300mA peak current consumption (during transmit events)\nCan be powered and programmed by USB Micro (cable included in box)\n8 digital I/O pins\n4 PWM pins\n8 analog I/O pins\nUART (Serial), SPI, and I2C peripherals\nWi-Fi range of 100-300ft\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SUPPORTERS\nFirst off, thank you! We hope you're excited about the Core. We hope you'll back our project and help us make our dream of easy embedded Wi-Fi come true.\nSpecial thanks to a number of people that have been an enormous help: Cyril Ebersweiler, Zach Hoeken Smith, Jordan Husney, Andy Warner, Jay Schrankler, Sean O'Sullivan, Bogomil Balkansky, David Recordon, John Strong, Alex Ognev, Justin Grammens, Betsy Ziegler, Jordan Dalton, Satish Nair, Paul Detjen, Bill Brown, Solange Guillaume, Ashley Soloff, and the guy who sells us bubble tea everyday.\nLike the music from the end of the video? Check out Finley Knight! They make great tunes. Also, you may have caught a peek of a couple cool open source projects form the HAXLR8R office; keep your eye out for the tabletop CNC mill from Zach Hoeken Smith and the 3D printer Deltabot from Nick Starno.\n\nFAQs\nHow does Spark Flash work?\nSpark Flash is possible when both your computer and the Spark Core are connected to the internet (although they don't need to be on the same Wi-Fi network).  You can write code in our simple web IDE and send it to your project with the click of the button.  Once the code compiles successfully on our server, you'll be sent a \"compilation successful\" notification, and the software on your device will be instantly updated.  \nWe do it this way to make deploying code to your Core as simple as possible.  If you want, you can always program your device locally.\nHow does Smart Config work?\nTo create the best user experience possible, TI created Smart Config \u2014 a one-step and one-time process used to connect the hardware devices enabled by the CC3000 (like the Spark Core) to a Wi-Fi network.  Just connect your Wi-Fi enabled phone or tablet to your access point, then enter your network's password into the Spark App, and the setup process completes in less than thirty seconds.  This is entirely unique in the current world of Wi-Fi modules that require multiple steps \u2014 including jumping between permanent and ad hoc Wi-Fi networks \u2014 to configure a device onto a network.  Smart Config leverages the standard mechanisms present in Wi-Fi to configure the device on the fly, regardless of whether a user interface is available.\nThe long story short is that we've used it with the Spark Core, it works, and we think its a game-changer for embedded Wi-Fi.\nDo I have to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the Core for it to work?\nNope \u2014 our REST API is exposed through the Spark Cloud, our servers that do cloud compilation and pass secure messages around between the Spark Core and everything else. You can access your Spark Core from anywhere!\nWait, the Spark Cloud? Do I have to pay anything for Spark Wi-Fi service or Spark apps?\nNope! The Spark Cloud is and will always be free for life when you buy a Spark Core. However, developers who create apps for the Spark Core or for Spark-powered products may choose to charge for them, by selling those apps through the iPhone App Store, Google Play, or on their own websites.\nWhat if I want to scale the project I build on the Core? Can you help?\nYes! Tight integration between the Spark Core and the Spark Cloud means that Spark is the perfect development platform for 1, 100, or 100,000 of your shiny new connected ideas. Our servers will automatically adapt to the data and back-end needs of any project in any environment \u2014 large or small, few or many. If you want to talk shop, shoot us an email at hello [at] sparkdevices [dot] com.\nDon\u2019t I know you guys from the Spark Socket?\nYou do... We're back!\nWho made your super sweet video?\nNone other than Paul Detjen of PCD Productions.  Paul is a talented videographer, musical visionary, and honorable gentlemen.  Hire him while he's still available!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Mass manufacturing isn't the same as prototype development; besides making the Core work, we have to make sure they are secure and reliable, and that they can be manufactured efficiently at larger volumes.\n\nFortunately, we've been living and working in Shenzhen, China for several months now, and have established relationships with manufacturing partners that will help us bring the Core to your doorstep. Plus, the Core does not require the same tooling expenses and long lead times that products with injection molded plastic require, which significantly decreases our fixed costs and delivery timeline.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Spark Core. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Core. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that our Cores and other rewards arrive (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "INTRODUCING PARTICLE MESH: THE NEW INTERNET, FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Cellular for Everything: Meet the Spark Electron", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Photon.", "update_content": "Hi Everyone!

I love the way your team, and the SmartThings team has created an ecosystem to self-support and grow the use of your devices, however, I would like to end up with a device (as example, think if WeMo) that if a consumer bought, would just plug into the wall, and take over as \"THE SYSTEM\" if no other instances of it exist. As such, reliance (in my opinion) on third party infrastructure such as cloud services by other businesses tends to create a dependence that takes away control for the owner, and in some sense, opens up some security holes (even if your team does the best job anybody could).

It's about time  The man's a genius!  Why hasn't this happened already?\nor\nb) Don who?\nWe want to make a movie that can live up to the expectations and desires and hopes for the people who answered a), and that can introduce Don in the best way possible to those who answered b).\nDon Buchla is a legendary instrument maker whose inventions were part of the greatest musical transformation of the 20th century.  His pioneering work laid the basis for what electronic music was to become by creating a unique analog synthesizer which completely changed the way people think about, compose, and perform music.  The list of musicians and composers who have used the Buchla range from avant-garde composer Morton Subotnick to Nine Inch Nails, with plenty more along the way.  Don hasn't stopped inventing since the arrival of the Buchla, and his other instruments combine an idiosyncratic sound with a sense of wonder and theatrical magic.\n\"Music is a mirror that we hold up to see how cultural structures are formed.  Race, social hierarchy, class, national origin the twentieth century saw a questioning of these issues on a global level, and in a sense, electronic music was the soundtrack to that intense investigation into the human situation.  Almost all traditional notions of space, time, and physicality have been reconfigured in ways that we are just beginning to understand.  I think that electronic music has helped us understand the process we've lived through.  Think about everything from the tones you hear coming out of your telephone to the frequencies underlying cellular communication to the algorithms used to route the information holding it all together -- most of this stuff has been explored one way or the other by the avant-garde.\"\n                                                                                --Paul D. Miller (DJ Spooky)\nDon was definitely part of the avant-garde.  He has been called a mad scientist, a genius, an innovator, a recluse, an iconoclast, and has gathered a horde of fiercely loyal admirers by following his own visionary path, and dancing to his own muse.  His name and instruments are known from Indonesia to France.\nWe have begun to film because there have been performances and interviews to capture that we simply couldn't pass up, such as Morton Subotnick and Ramon Sender from the San Francisco Tape Music Center, who commissioned Don to build the first Buchla; French composers Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re and Marc Battier; and performances by Subotnick and Marimba Lumina player and co-collaborator Joel Davel, who has assisted in Buchla's workshop for two decades.  \nBut now we need to raise production funding to complete the rest of our filming.  Among the other people we will be including in the film are early Buchla composer/performer Suzanne Ciani, analog synth performer/music journalist Gino Robair, Lightning virtuoso Forrest Tobey, synth maestro Alessandro Cortini (of Nine Inch Nails and Sonoio), Marimba Lumina co-designer Mark Goldstein, and, of course, Don himself.  Ideally, we're hoping you can support us beyond what we're asking for here so we can also edit and do post-production for the film. \nWith your help, we will be able to do the legacy of Don Buchla justice.\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?\nMAKE A DONATION AND GET A REWARD\nWe set a goal and a deadline.  You choose an amount you'd like to donate, and the gift you want to receive.  After our funding goal is reached we will send out rewards.  Those rewards that require the completion of the film will be sent out after it is finished.\n\nIF OUR GOAL IS NOT MET BY THE DEADLINE THEN WE DON'T GET ANYTHING\nIf we fall short of our goal by any amount then we won't get any of the money.  Even if it's only by $5.  That's why your help spreading the word about the film and Kickstarter campaign is so important.\n\nIF WE MEET OR SURPASS OUR GOAL BEFORE THE DEADLINE THEN WE GET TO KEEP THE WHOLE AMOUNT\nAll the donations will go to our production company Clarity Films, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, to help towards finishing the film.  Many folks raise much more than their goal, so the more you help us do that the sooner the film will be finished!\n\n*****TAX DEDUCTIBLE DONATIONS******\nA portion of every donation over $100 is tax deductible.  You will receive a letter confirming your donation as well as the amount that you can deduct (the donation amount minus the value of the reward).\n\nI AM INTERESTED IN YOUR PROJECT, CAN I HELP?\nYES! You can help by getting the word out and encouraging others to donate.  Tell your friends and family about the film.  Link to our Kickstarter campaign on your Facebook profile or Twitter feed.  Embed our video or widget on your web page or blog.  It's a word of mouth campaign and its success relies on people being aware of the Kickstarter campaign.  The more you can help us find new folks the closer we are to making our campaign a success.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilmmaking, especially documentary filmmaking, can encounter unforseen challenges, both in terms of shooting and in the post-production.  The funds for this campaign are for the production phase of the film; the post-production funding will need to be raised elsewhere.  (Of course, any funds we raise above our goal can be funneled into post-production, which makes the likelihood of smooth sailing that much more probable!)  \n\nWe've made a lot of films, some of them well-funded, others not at all. And we've always managed to finish them. We plan to keep all of you appraised of our progress, both the successes and the setbacks, so you'll know where things stand.

We conduct long interviews with folks (usually 1 hour and 1/2, tho some are shorter)  and will use only a variety of minutes of it in the  final film, so there will be many great stories and comments left on the cutting room floor as they say.

Open source Android apps are next.\n\nThe RFduino has a Nordic 32 bit ARM Cortex-M0 processor, so it has more power then the UNO, however it still runs the same, simple Arduino code the UNO runs, so there is no need to learn any new programming language or environment.  Your standard Arduino sketches run on the RFduino.\n\nThe RFduino GPIO lines all support, Digital IO, Analog ADC, SPI, I2C, UART and PWM.  There are 7 GPIO and fully software selectable and can be remapped as you wish.\n\nThe RFduino is similar to the Arduino UNO or DUE, except the RFduino is a fraction of the cost and size, in addition has wireless smartphone connectivity built-in!\nUp to now, adding wireless to an Arduino required an additional wireless shield which adds cost and size.  The RFduino has wireless built-in, so there is no need for an additional wireless shield.\nThe ultra small, finger-tip size board shown in video cover picture above has been put into an easy to use DIP form factor with 0.100\" (2.54mm) pins, so it easily plugs directly into your solderless breadboards.\n\n$5K goal met within the 1st day!\n\n$10k stretch goal met within 2 days!  (Added Backer chosen shield.)\n$20k strech goal met within 4 days!  (Added 2nd Backer chosen shield.)\nTechnical Story Video on the RFduino\n\nSome things the RFduino can do\nThe RFduino gives wireless senses to your iPhone and enables it to touch the physical world!\n\nSome more things the RFduino can do\nThe RFduino is a stand-alone board, just like the Arduino UNO. In addition, the RFduino has a powerful ARM Cortex processor and Bluetooth Low-Energy 4.0 built-in, which take your projects to the next level!\nPowerful enough to run your projects.\nSmall enough to fit inside your projects.\nLow cost enough to be used for all your projects.\nIt's perfect for the hobbyist creating do-it-yourself projects, to professional engineers producing proof-of-concept prototypes.\nIt can be used with or without Bluetooth 4.0.\nBeginners can use the pre-written Arduino sketches and advanced users can write their own from scratch.\nWe have several open-source RFduino and iPhone apps which are free to use, extend and share.\n\nStackable Shield Accessory Boards\nThe RFduino has been constructed with high quality, leading edge, state-of-the-art professional grade components.\nWe have also developed a few miniature accessory boards to help you with your projects.  They plug directly into 0.100\" (2.54mm) standard spacing, solderless breadboards or run fully stand-alone.  They are stackable and plug directly into each other to provide many combinations.\n\nGet It All - Pledge Level Information:\nGet It All Kit $139 Pledge Level Includes:\n2 RFduino\n1 USB Programming shield board\n1 RGB LED shield board\n1 Servo Output shield\n1 PCB USB Programming shield board\n1 Prototyping shield board\n1 Dual AAA Battery shield board\n1 Single AAA Battery shield board\n1 CR2032 Battery shield board \nGet It All (Multi Project) Kit $219 Pledge Level Includes:\n5 RFduino\n2 USB Programming shield board\n1 RGB LED shield board\n1 Servo Output shield\n1 PCB USB Programming shield board\n1 Prototyping shield board\n1 Dual AAA Battery shield board\n1 Single AAA Battery shield board\n1 CR2032 Battery shield board\n\nGet It All (Master Developer) Kit $399 Pledge Level Includes:\n10 RFduino\n2 USB Programming shield board\n2 RGB LED shield board\n2 Servo Output shield\n2 PCB USB Programming shield board\n2 Prototyping shield board\n2 Dual AAA Battery shield board\n2 Single AAA Battery shield board\n2 CR2032 Battery shield board\n----------------------------\n- White solderless breadboards, iPhones, batteries, computers, wires, cables and all other items of any type which were used in pictures, videos or demos are not included in any rewards.\n- microSD Shield and the Dual Relay shield are backer suggested shields designed during the course of this project and are not included in any pledge levels.

You'll have your choice of the black frame or the gold, ornate frame. The black frame version of PIXEL will be shipping in May '13. The gold, ornate frame is still planned for an April '13 shipment. We will send out a poll to all backers at the end of the KickStarter campaign for your preference.\nPIXEL is an LED based picture frame that displays pixel art. Pixel art is a retro form of digital art where the image is manipulated pixel-by-pixel. You set the image or animation on PIXEL from your Android device. Sorry iOS users, only Android is supported at this time :-(\nPIXEL contains over 1,000 LEDs. Each LED equals one pixel for a resolution of 32x32. \nAn image like this \nlooks like this on PIXEL\nOr an animation like this \nLooks like this on PIXEL\n\nPIXEL includes:\n32x32 LED Panel (1,024 RGB LEDs)\nSolid Wood Picture Frame with LED Panel & Wall Mounts\nIOIOMint board + LED Matrix shield\n2 Bluetooth Dongles *\nIR Proximity Sensor\nTwo-way Acrylic Mirror\nAcrylic back case\nPower Supply (110V - 240V) with US \"two pronged style\" plug\nFree Android apps with PIXEL content\nTo showcase what PIXEL can do, we've collaborated with a few leading edge Pixel Artists from around the world. \n* PIXEL uses one Bluetooth dongle, the extra one can be used in your PC if you are running the PIXEL PC App\nFeatured Pixel Artists\n  Kirk Barnett (Pixel PileDriver) is a programmer and artist. Currently he is an indie game developer and co-founder BlockLight. \n  Gabe Mir is a pixel artist who resides in South Florida. He has always been interested in video games since his youth, and has been practicing pixel art for a few years. View Gabe's work on PIXEL\nChristopher Goldsmith (imkrut) is a digital artist, living in Santiago, Chile. Art has been his passion since a very early age, together with video games, it's a match made in heaven. After graduating from law school, he came back to digital art where his heart truly is.\nClement Swennes (Atnas) is a freelance artist and animator living in Philadelphia. He's a hobbyist programmer and designer and aims to release some of his games in the future.\nEach of the artists has his/her own free Android app for PIXEL featuring their work.\nTo download and share PIXEL content with fellow PIXEL users, join the Google+ Community called \"PIXEL Content\".\nWhen powered off, Pixel just looks like a normal mirror as it includes a 2-way mirror. Hidden behind PIXEL's two way mirror is a proximity sensor. The proximity sensor enables interactive art installations where the art can change when someone is near.\nComplimenting Mirror App\nIf you look close at PIXEL, you can see the individual LEDs. Each of PIXEL's 1,024 LEDs actually contains 3 LEDs. PIXEL's color is set by controlling the brightness and mixing of the colors of these 3 LEDs (red, green, and blue).\n\n\nPIXEL's apps\nPIXEL's Android apps are free and available on Google Play now. At the moment, there are 10 Android apps available. PIXEL's apps can display still images, animations (using the animated .gif format), interactive meaning the still image or animation changes when someone is near, or something else like the complimenting mirror app for example. For still images, just set the desired image and then you're free to run other apps or turn off your phone. The image will remain on PIXEL as long as PIXEL has power. For animations and interactive apps, your Android device must be actively Bluetooth connected to PIXEL and running the app in order to function.\nFor Artists\nPIXEL allows you to focus on your art and not the programming. Prior to PIXEL, typical LED projects like with Arduino for example required coding and wiring up circuits. Arduino certainly made it easier than previous methods but still you needed to write code or wire up circuits. We wanted to change that. With PIXEL, simply author your art using your favorite image editor and then save it to your Android device. \nThere are a few nuances when working with LEDs, the main one being low contrast colors don't display well, you'll find the full set of do's and don'ts here. Also keep in mind PIXEL's resolution is 32x32. While PIXEL's apps will automatically scale images to 32x32, high resolution images won't display well.\nSilhouettes produce a nice effect\nFor DIYers\nFor those wanting a custom installation, just the insides of PIXEL are also available which we're calling PIXEL Guts. PIXEL Guts 1024 features the 32x32 LED panel including 1,024 RGB LEDs. Note the proximity sensor and proximity sensor cable is not included with PIXEL Guts. If you want the proximity sensor too, just add $12 to your pledge and send me a note so we can track it.\nPIXEL Guts includes:\n32x32 LED Panel (1,024 RGB LEDs) with cables\nIOIOMint board + LED Matrix shield\n2 Bluetooth Dongles *\nPower Supply (110V - 240V) with US \"two pronged style\" plug\nFree Android apps with PIXEL content\nPIXEL Guts Step by Step Instructions and Video Tutorial\n* PIXEL uses one Bluetooth dongle, the extra one can be used in your PC if you are running the PIXEL PC App\nCustom Installation Example Using PIXEL Guts 1024\n\nFor Developers\nPIXEL is open source meaning you or others can write your own apps for PIXEL.\nThink of PIXEL as a secondary LED based display that displays something based on the logic in your Android app. Your Android device can control PIXEL over a Bluetooth or direct USB connection. To develop your own Android app for PIXEL, you'll need to be familiar with Android programming and will use the PIXEL API.  You'll find all the gory details along with the source code at ledpixelart.com/developers.html \nDimensions\nPIXEL's dimensions are 15 inches wide x 15 inches tall x 1 3/4 inches wide, the weight is 6 lbs and shipping weight 10 lbs.\nOur Costs\nOur Cost for 250 PIXEL Units: $130 USD per unit (main driver of cost is the LED panel, they're not cheap).\n$229 (KickStarter Price) - $130 (raw cost) - $18 (KickStarter fees) - $40 shipping cost = $41 USD profit\nTo be honest, I mis-judged the costs as they turned out much higher than originally planned but that's ok, it's been a great experience and hey at least we didn't lose money. PIXEL's post KickStarter price has not been set yet, what we can say is that it will be significantly higher than the KickStarter price to account for distributors, marketing, and various other elements.\nAs a side note, here's the slides from a class I taught which talks about how a hobbyist can go from an idea to a product. A lof of the talk also goes over my experience and lessons learned from doing this KickStarter. \nProject Status & Manufacturing\nPIXEL has been in the works for 6 months. The device shown in this project's video is the third and final prototype so it's ready to be manufactured. We've selected Seeedstudio as our manufacturer. Seeed is based out of Shenzhen, China and will be taking care of sourcing, manufacturing, assembly, and shipping. Having designed PIXEL's case and frame mount, Seeed was also an integral part of the product design. A special thanks to Ytai Ben-Tsvi, creator of the open source IOIO board, for all his invaluable help on this project. \nYou can find more info on PIXEL at ledpixelart.com. Thanks very much for checking out this project. \n-- The PIXEL Team\nFAQs\nQ. Why aren't you supporting iPhones and iPads? You do realize you're missing half the market, right?\nA. Believe us, we do realize this and we really wish we were supporting Apple devices/iOS right now. The reality unfortunately is porting the project to iOS while technically possible, is a pretty big job. We don't want to over commit ourselves. Our priority is on delivering PIXEL for Android in April '13 as promised. We are however in parallel scoping out this effort and depending on how well PIXEL does, will look into taking up this endeavor post KickStarter. We're also open to paying someone else to do it, shoot us a note if you're interested!\nQ. How much will PIXEL cost post KickStarter?\nA. Post KickStarter, PIXEL will cost more. The exact price is TBD and will depend on things like volume and distribution models which still needs to be worked out.\nQ. Does PIXEL tie up my Android device/phone or can I just set the image and then use other apps or turn my phone off? \n\nA. For still images, just set the desired image and then you're free to run other apps or turn off your phone. The image will remain on PIXEL as long as PIXEL has power. For animations and interactive apps like the complimenting mirror or the fortune telling eightball, your Android device must be actively Bluetooth connected to PIXEL and running the app in order to function.\n\nQ. Does the power supply for PIXEL work with 220V/240V?\nA. Yes, PIXEL's power supply can run from 110V to 240V power. It outputs 5V DC up to 4 Amps and has a standard 2.1mm barrel jack connector. The plug it comes with is the \"two-prong style\" for US/Canada/Japan however so you'll need to supply your own plug adapter for your country.\nQ. Do the electronics show when PIXEL is hanging on well.\nA. No, you don't see the electronics when PIXEL is hanging on the wall. What you will see is the black case of PIXEL which covers up the electronics which will stick out from the wall a little bit and you will see the power cord too.  Here's a side shot.\n\nQ. What's a good image editor to use for creating pixel art?\n\nA. The free Android app, Pixels Touch, works great. Create your image in a 32x32 canvas. Pixels Touch saves images in the /Pictures folder. Use an Android file manager app to transfer these images to the pixel/pixelart folder and then launch the Pixel Art app to display it on PIXEL.\n\nQ. Will PIXEL work with any Android device?\n\nA. Well that's tough to say as each Android device manufacturer can make their own Android device modifications. What we can say is that with a few exceptions, the Android devices we have tested work with PIXEL. For sure your Android device will need to have Bluetooth so watch out for those el cheapo Android tablets as most of them don't have built in Bluetooth. Android devices 2.3.3 and above are recommended. Android devices below 2.3.3 will also work with the caveat you'll need to enter the Bluetooth pairing code each time the device is re-booted.\nQ. How much power does PIXEL use?\n\nA. When idle, PIXEL consumes 1.4 watts and when in use depending on the particular still image or animation being displayed, PIXEL will consume anywhere from 4 to 8 watts.\nQ. Who developed PIXEL?\n\nA. PIXEL is a joint collaboration between Al Linke, Ytai Ben-Tsvi and Seeedstudio.\nQ. Can I write my own apps for PIXEL and how hard is that to do?\n\nA. Yes, PIXEL is open source and was designed to be expandable by others. PIXEL apps are Android based. Android is basically Java so if you know Java, you\u2019re good. If you don\u2019t know Java but have programmed in other languages, you\u2019ll be able to pick it up pretty quick by going through the HelloWorld example code. After mastering the Hellow World example, copy one of the existing PIXEL apps and modify it for your needs.\n\nQ. Can I use a PC to control PIXEL instead of an Android device?\n\nA. Yes, the developer page has sample code for how to develop java apps that will control PIXEL from a PC (Windows, Mac, or LINUX) over Bluetooth. There are no PC apps written yet but this will come in the near future now that the PC sample code has been released.\n  Q. What would it take to get PIXEL working on iOS?\n\nA. Someone would need to port the IOIO libraries for Bluetooth to the iOS platform using Bluetooth 4.0. It's doable, we would be glad to provide support if anyone is interested and depending on how well PIXEL does, we would be open to paying for this, just shoot us a note if you're interested.\nQ. Is there a DIY version of PIXEL available for custom installations?\n\nA. Yes, the DIY version is called PIXEL Guts and comes in two flavors, PIXEL Guts 1024 features a 32x32 LED matrix and PIXEL Guts 512 features a 16x32 LED matrix. Here's an examplecustom build we did for a Halloween party and corresponding project write-up.\n\nQ. Can I replace the two-way mirror with a colored acrylic sheet?\nA. Yes, you'll need to remove PIXEL's back case and then you can swap out PIXEL's two-way mirror with your own acrylic sheet. Have one acrylic sheet in the color of your choice cut to these dimensions at 242mm (9.53 inches) x 242mm (9.53 inches) x 1.6mm thick (1/16 inches). Keep the acylic sheet with the two holes on the inside closest to the proximity sensor and then place your new acrylic sheet facing outside.\nQ. The power cord shows, any way to hide that?\nA. Option 1 is have an electrician run a power outlet into a recessed power box like this one and then place PIXEL over the recessed box hiding the power cord and power supply in the box.\nOption 2 is to power PIXEL off an external smart phone battery pack. You'll need a pretty beefy battery pack however with at least 10,000 mAH capacity/3A output. We tested the Anker\u00ae Astro3E 10000mAh which was able to power PIXEL running a continuous animation for 12 hours. You'll also need this special USB power cable. You'll need to make a few modifications/adjustments to mount this battery pack on the back of PIXEL's case.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is the schedule. Having worked with our manufacturer, Seeedstudio, on previous projects however, we feel confident for an April 2013 ship date but of course Murphy's law is always there.\n\nFrom time to time, we do find bugs in the software. We'll be updating the Android apps as we find them.\n\nThere is also some inherent risk with the Android platform as each Android manufacturer can do things a little different. PIXEL works on all the Android devices we've tested from Android 2.2 to 4.1 but unfortunately we cannot guarantee 100% compatibility with every Android device. The majority of our testing however has been on Android devices 2.3.3 and therefore we're recommending Android devices 2.3.3 and higher. Note that PIXEL is Bluetooth based meaning your Android device must have built in Bluetooth.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the C.A.T Clutch - The Ultimate LED Bag", "update_content": "Dear PIXEL: LED ART Backers, \nThank you again for bring PIXEL: LED ART to life.

Control the Lumapad any way you can imagine.\n*color adjustment available on dual channel Lumapad only\nArduino controller lets you write your own code!\nEvery Lumapad is controlled by a Arduino compatible ATmega 328P micro computer and is pin for pin compatible with most other open source Arduino boards on the market.  The control board is based on the Arduino Pro Mini 328 from Sparkfun.  Use the standard Lumapad firmware or write your own to do interesting things with this ultra bright light panel. Programmable push buttons, LEDs, I/O pins, FTDI Basic USB connector (compatible with the Sparkfun FTDI Basic Breakout Board) and other features make experimenting easy with the Lumapad.  If you purchase a Lumapad without the Electric IMP WiFI card installed, you can always purchase it from Sparkfun here. \nIf your pledge level includes the dual color LED array, you can control two sets of 16 LEDs individually allowing you to blend 3200 Kelvin and 6500 Kelvin LEDs for the color temperature that best suits your needs.  Flash each channel separately, dim and brighten them over time or even control the entire light panel via the Electric IMP WiFi controller.  The uses are only limited by your imagination and ability to write simple software code.\nOptional dual color temperature prototype shown in video\nTaking Green Energy to a new level\nWho says you have to be in the dark to go green?  The Lumapad is the first LED lighting system to pack a huge punch in such a tiny package.  Measuring only 6.75 inches wide X 4.50 inches high, this tiny light pad uses only 88 Watts of power while delivering almost 1000 Watts of tungsten equivalent soft light. Now you can go green, save energy and light actors, stages, studios or anything that needs to be flooded with nice, even lighting.  Control the Lumapad the way you want.  Add WiFi and you can control multiple lights, add special effect like lightning, fire or anything your imagination can come up with.  \nLumapad is the ultimate in energy efficient \"GREEN\" lighting technology\nWhat is an Electric IMP?\nDeveloping for the IMP is quite unlike most embedded development. No SDK to install, no JTAG pods, no long download times... you develop your code in a browser-based IDE and can compile and run your code on the IMP - wherever it is in the world - in under a second. The IMP even sends logging back to your browser.\nSoftware that runs on the IMP is written in Squirrel, a C-like language, with extensions to communicate with the hardware interfaces and the service. As the Squirrel code runs on top of the OS, you get many big system benefits like buffered I/O and crash recovery - plus you can push updates to devices in the field with a few clicks.  Visit electricimp.com for more detailed information.\nDemo showing how an IOS App can integrate with the Lumapad\nA partial list of all the technologies crammed into the Lumapad\nFully Assembled \"Kits\" will also be available\nIf you are interested in experimenting with the latest LED technology, the Lumapad circuit board is the best place to begin.  It will be available as a blank board or with all components installed and tested at a very low cost.   All the schematics and source code for this project will also be included.  Get started with this new technology now and maybe you can invent a new green energy lighting system or ultra-bright computer controlled LED Panel.\nPrototype Lumapad Circuit Board (front)\nPrototype Lumapad Circuit Board (back)\nFeatures / Technical Specs\nLumapad offers many features not found in any other ultra high lumen LED lighting system.\nUltra Bright 8000 lumen output via 32 individual CREE LEDs.\n6400 Kelvin (bright white daylight) color temperature.\nDual color temperature LEDs available (6400K / 3200K 16 per channel).\nWiFi enabled via the Electric IMP SD card module.\nUser programmable Arduino (Atmel) compatible micro controller.\nDual channel PWM dimming circuits with an additional analog dimmer.\nUp, Down and Mode buttons are user programmable.\nAdjustable light stand mount included.\nDraws only 88 watts at full power.\nFan and temperature control circuitry built in.\n6 3/4 inches (171mm) L X 4 1/2 inches (114mm) H X 1 inch (25mm) W\n120 / 240 VAC Power adapter (USA, EU, UK, Asia and everywhere else)\nLower cost 16 LED, 4000 Lumen model will also be available.\nCan be powered by standard 12 - 24 Volt DC battery packs too!\nWrite your own software to generate special effects.\nWith the Lumapad's open-source design, you can write custom software to generate many different effects.  Fire, lighting or a strobe light are just a few of the visual effects that come to mind.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.\nSimulating the light from a fireplace with Lumapad.\nUsing the Arduino compatible micro computer in the lumpad, you can write many different programs to control a scene or room's lighting.  With the expansion terminals, connectors and WiFi, you could even communicate with the outside world.  Make a remotely triggered flash, motion activated strobe, WiFi controlled scene light or just anything you can dream up.  Simulate police and fire vehicles, emergency alarms and more.  For those of you that are really good with electronics and software, you could even hook up a microphone to create all kinds of sound triggered lighting effects. \nSimulated lightning.  A bit exaggerated to make a point!\nSure, the lightning in this video was a bit exaggerated but isn't that the point when creating cool special effects?  There are a bunch of modes that are built into the Lumapad at the moment.  I expect to add more as I come up with ideas.\n\nCurrent Lumapad Modes:\nON / OFF with brightness control\ncolor temperature adjust (dual LED version only)\nStealth mode (turns fan off for silent running)\nStrobe Light with adjustable flash rate\nSimulated Fire\nSimulated Lightning\nRugged design for reliable operation\nThe Lumapad's rugged design allows for it to be used in many environments.  There are plenty of 1/4-20 threaded holes all around the edges for unlimited mounting options.  The cooling fan controller is built in, monitors temperature and can regulate the fan speed.  While the fan is very quite, the standard firmware has a \"stealth mode\" which keeps the fan turned off for silent running unless the LEDs begin to get too hot.  For a smaller form factor, where you won't be running at full brightness for more than ten minutes, the fan can be removed.  The computer will protect the Lumapad in the event of overheating so there is no need to worry.  A lower cost, 4000 Lumen model without fan will also be available for lighter, more portable operation.  Any 12 - 24 volt DC battery pack (minimum 7Ah) can also be used to power all the Lumapads.\nPrototype stage complete:\nAlthough fully functional prototypes are shown here, there is more to do. Custom switch panels, firmware development and additional hardware are needed to make this project complete.  These things can only be accomplished at a reasonable cost through volume purchases.  \nCosts to make this project a reality:\nThis is no ordinary LED light and my pledge goal is based on a small volume manufacturing run.  The unique design requires a minimum order of 100 units to get the costs down to an affordable price.  Here is a breakdown of the expenses related to a small run.\n$120.00 - Machined Aluminum case and stand.\n$63.80 - 32 CREE LEDs\n$78.00 - Circuit board and all components \n$29.95 - Electric IMP\n$12.00 - CPU Fan and Heat Sink\n$24.00 - Power Supply\n$8.00 - Front Glass\n$15.00 - Misc screws and mounting hardware\nPlus boxes, packaging and shipping costs**.\n**Lumapads are made from aluminum which makes them heavy and a bit costly to ship.\nKickstarter pledges help bring the costs down.\nWith today's technology, professional LED lighting like Lumpad can cost thousands of dollars.  With the addition of WiFi and the Audrino controller, there will be nothing like it on the market.  By joining this project on Kickstarter, we can get the cost down to an affordable level, make a unique design, save energy and have some fun in the process.\nBehind the scenes photo shoot with Lumapads.\nI try to design REALLY COOL STUFF \nI strive to invent products and technologies that people like, can enjoy and hopefully, learn something while using them.  Most of my designs are unique and require special tooling and/or manufacturing techniques.  Kickstarter offers me a great opportunity to lower these costs and get my products into everyones hands.\nHere is what is included at various pledge levels.\nReward Levels\nI wanted to give people choices, depending on their planned uses for Lumapad.  There are actually only three different Lumapad models.  All the pledge levels just have different accessories that come with them.  Read the descriptions carefully to see what is included.\nThe three Lumapad models:\n8000S - 32 daylight CREE LEDs, 8000 lumen output\n6000D - 16 daylight / 16 warm white  CREE LEDs, 6000 lumen output\n4000S - Will have lower power or only 16 daylight CREE LEDs, 4000 lumen output\nAll Lumapads are an open source design and include all schematics, parts lists and other information.  \nRECENT PLEDGE ADDITIONS\nLumapad's technology is expensive but other LED lights with 1/4 the brightness can run thousands of dollars.  I have done my best to get the costs down and recently added a few more pledges to give everyone a chance to play with the Lumapad.\nLumapad Basic - The low cost 8000 Lumen LED light pad with open frame design.\n3D printed prototype case shown. Actual Lumapad Basic will be machined from aluminum.\n\nThree Lumapad Lighting Kit with Case\nThree Lumapads in a nice zippered case are now available at the new pledge levels\nWhile fully functional prototypes are shown here, I would like to refine the design, improve the case along with the electronics and get the online community involved with writing really cool APPs.  I hope the Kickstarter community will join me in backing this project.\nBehind the scenes with Lumapad\nMy pitch is now complete.  I hope that this project will be a success here on Kickstarter.  I had fun designing and building the prototypes for Lumapad and also shooting all the videos.  I look forward to turning this idea into a reality and hearing all the cool applications the online community comes up with.\n$85,000 Stretch Goal Added\nIf this project funds above $85,000, it will give me enough extra money to add filter holders that many people are asking for.  I have already squeezed $2000 worth of technology into these lights but let's try to go a bit further.  Let's get out there and Tweet, Blog, Facebook or whatever it takes to reach this stretch goal.\nLumapad Filter Holders will be added if the stretch goal can be reached!\nNeed more information?\nBe sure to \"LIKE\" my Facebook Page\nVisit Lumapad.com for up to date information.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many risks and challenges associated with turning a new idea into a reality. Having just completed the very successful, fully funded and on-time delivered http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1324892969/soundlazer project here on Kickstarter, I am confident that the new technologies used in Lumapad will prove to be well thought out and work exactly as described. \n\nBy setting realistic goals and backer levels, Kickstarter offers me the unique opportunity to experiment with ideas never before possible. I hope the online community will benefit as much as I do from everyone coming together on this project. It is my goal to turn the Lumapad into a useful tool for the experimenter and anyone else who needs a fully controllable, open source, high intensity LED lighting system. \n\nThe Lumapad is a one of a kind design only possible through the support of the Kickstart community.

It could also be described as an adapter for Arduino Style Shields. You plug your IOIO into one side, and an Arduino Style Shield into the other, and start coding. It's a hard connection that doesn't leave any question whether or not there's any loose wires. Troubleshooting is as easy as swapping out components. The board scales levels when needed, provides power busses, and routes i2c where it's needed. \nCheck out The ISD Wiki or The Nice Details below for more info.\nWhy Kickstarter\nPrinted circuit boards and components are expensive in small quantities. Larger orders are the only way to make a product cost effective. I've made everything available open source, so if you want, you can download the Gerber files and have a board printed on your own. You can check out the parts list on DigiKey and order them yourself. There are no secrets here, it's a simple concept, however, with you help and support, I believe I can make this board very efficiently and at a price that everyone will like. \nRendering of PCB\nThe parts are still the expensive area of this project. I've offered rewards for people who don't need all the advanced features I've included. Really, some people may just need some headers and that's it. I've tried to break it up as much as possible so everyone can get what they need, and not pay for anything extra. \nThe Plan\nThis project started as a simple dock board to allow me to control a relay shield with my IOIO. I made a simple circuit, had it printed through BatchPBC, and soldered it together. I realized that it would be very useful in many projects if it could take advantage of other shields. I printed out the pinouts of both the IOIO and Arduino and got to work matching. A little EE and a lot of CAD later, I had a working prototype. \nOnce funding is achieved, one more prototype will be tested before the first big production run. I am using a PCB fabrication house called Gold Phoenix. It is the same house that SparkFun uses with it's popular BatchPCB service. For the prototypes, I use BatchPCB to keep costs reasonable. \nThe first run has to be over 100 units to be cost effective. The components will be sourced from DigiKey and the parts list openly available on the Project Wiki.\nFor the first run, I will personally assemble each board. The first prototype took me 45 minutes to solder. The second time around only took 15 minutes. For the next prototype, I am going to use larger surface mount components which should speed up production time. The goal for the production run is 10 minutes per board. That's roughly 18 hours of assembly. If there's more interest, I might expand the rewards and hire a friend to help with the soldering. \nEach assembled board will be tested for functionality with an actual IOIO. I haven't made a bad solder joint in a long time, but mistakes happen. That's why every board is tested prior to shipment. \nThe Nice Details\nPIN MAPPING\nI spent a lot of time developing the pin mapping between the Arduino side and the IOIO side to best make use of the IOIO's numerous pins. You can check out the pinout on the project's wiki. To the best of my ability, I matched function to function.\nA/D CHANNELS\nThe Arduino has 5v A/D converters, while the IOIO has 3.3V converters. To deal with this, I included a scaling circuit that scales all of the A/D pins down to 3.3V. There's also a bank of DIP switches that cutout this feature if you don't need it.\nSCREW TERMINALS\nThere's a row of screw terminals to easily and securely connect wires to the board. I'm also considering adding screw terminals to power the board like in the specialty board also available.\nPOWER\nPower Jumper Pins\nYou can pass voltage to the shield selectively. Using jumpers, you can pass Vin, 5V, and 3.3V depending on what you need. I also routed Vin through a scale and limiting circuit to measure battery voltage, if that's what you're using. \nI2C BUSSES\nDIP Switches for Pull-Ups and Screw Terminals\ni2c busses are routed to the appropriate pins on the Arduino side, but are selectable due to the multi-function nature of the Arduino A/D pins. Also, the i2c bus that goes to the screw terminals has optional pull-up resistors. If you need them, just flip the DIP switches. \nVARIANTS\nThe prototype PCB shown assembled is one I modified slightly for use in a High Altitude Balloon. Instead of an extra 6 screw terminals, I routed extra pins to headers to be used for a Parallax Altimeter. If anyone's interested, I've posted a separate reward for the specialized version of the board. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI consider risks to be factors which I can not completely control. Here's where I see problems arising:\n\nComponent Sourcing- I am buying all of the components from DigiKey. They are a fairly well know entity, yet I may be paying too much. Through the course of the project, I will strive to minimize costs, and that may mean going outside Digikey. I've priced everything so that I can fulfill rewards at prices I know I can get right now. However, sometimes components get depreciated and I'll have to find new ones. Hopefully that won't happen with anything critical. \n\nPCB Manufacturing- I know that Gold Phoenix turns out quality PCB's, because I've used them indirectly through BatchPCB, however, I haven't placed a medium run order with them personally. I have a quote for 100-300 boards and I like what they offer, but there's always a risk doing business with someone for the first time. Luckily, they're not the only one out there. There are plenty of Fab houses that I can do business with. The snag here would be in production time. If they fall through for whatever reason, it will add months onto the first run while I find another source. This factor poses the largest potential for delay.\n\nDesign- There are so many shields out there that \"hack\" different functions of the Arduino, there are bound to be some that aren't compatible with a IOIO. I strive to be the best \"messenger\" I can, but this board is just a middle man. I've tried, but I can't guarantee it will work with every shield out there.\n\nI'm sure there will be some unforeseen challenges that arise in completing this project.

No additional RF module to purchase which makes it about half the price of other wireless Shields.\nThis Shield will work with both Arduino and Arduino clones.\nIt has a substantial range improvement over Zigbee, Xbee, Bluetooth and WiFi. \nWe did range testing the same way you would do range testing, in a real world, live application.  The Google maps below illustrate our wireless RF Shields results against Zigbee (the best competitor tested):\nWireless Inventors Shield for Arduino range test result (no configuration needed).\nZigbee radio module test - best configuration.  In comparison our Shield had nearly 3x more range.\nZigbee radio module test - worst configuration. In comparison our Shield had over 20x more range.\nIf the above Zigbee radio modules were tested in an open field, without being near any WiFi or other types of interference, they too would perform the same as our Wireless Shield in either configuration.  However this is simply unrealistic; since typical usage is in heavily populated WiFi areas.  Unless your radio device is immune to WiFi interference, it's range is going to be drastically reduced.\nOur Wireless Shield had no range reduction.  It is immune to all WiFi and other 2.4 GHz noise, therefore performing consistently and reliably in typical usage scenarios.\nFeatures:\nIt's plug & play.\nNo settings.\nNo configurations.\nNo long manuals to read.\nNo data sheets to understand.\nNo MAC addresses to deal with.\nNo need to find the right channel.\nNo complex functions to call.\nNo escape command sequences to learn.\nNo need to know anything about wireless at all.\n2.4 GHz worldwide compliant.\nLEDs for TX and RX\nBuilt-in antenna.\nCompliant and approved: FCC, IC, CE, ETSI, RoHS\nHow do I use it?\nJust plug it onto your Arduino Uno (or clone).\nHere is all the code you need to know to send and receive wireless data:\n           Serial.begin (9600);\n           Serial.write (SendByte);\n           ReceivedByte = Serial.read();\nThat\u2019s it.  Yes, it really is just that simple!\nWhat can I do with it?\nYou can make any Arduino project wireless instantly.  This is a clean wireless-pipe, any bytes you put in one end, you get out the other.  Since there is no protocol to adhere to, you are truly unrestricted.\nWhat else can I do with it?\nYou can use a USB dongle, which allows the Arduino to wirelessly communicate with any computer or the web.\nYou can use multi-button keyfobs to add very cool remote control capability to your Arduino projects.\nYou can also use your Arduino Wireless Shield to communicate with a stand-alone breadboarding RF module that can plug into any standard solderless breadboard, giving you full range of flexibility with your project.\n(Note: White solderless breadboard shown in above picture is not included in the rewards.)\nCan it work in groups and multi-point networks?\nYes!  You are only limited by your creativity and your imagination.\nCan it also be used in classroom environment?\nYes!  You can have multiple PRIVATE wireless pipes running independently.\nWhat do you mean by Open Source?\nThe full set of code examples, schematic, PCB, Gerbers, BOM and production information for the Shield will all be published for easy use and extension by anyone.\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nThe funds will be used directly for the manufacturing run of the Wireless Inventors Shield.

It is a basic air pressure sensor that detects positive and negative air pressure.  The shield gets its name from the similar devices used by persons with disabilities that allow them to sip and puff into a tube to control medical devices.  The shield can detect air pressure up to 1.45 PSI which is more than enough to be triggered by sipping and puffing by mouth.\nHow does it work?\n1) Copy the library file into the Arduino folder on your computer. \n2) Create a reference to it in your sketch.\n3) Start using it.\nThe library contains a digital mode and analog mode.  The digital mode will return a 1 when positive air pressure is applied and a -1 when negative air pressure is applied.  If the sensor is neutral, a 0 is returned.  The analog mode returns a number that reprsents positive air pressure, or a negative number when negative air pressure is applied.  The more pressure applied, the higher the number returned.  Less air pressure will return a lower number.\nThe pressure sensor on the shield has a 3mm outer diameter nipple.  Most tubing with a 3mm inner diameter should work.  One foot of silicone tubing is included with the sensor.\nCheck out the Sip'n Puff Ipod Dock here.\nWhere's the code?\nOnce the project is funded, we will release the final version of the Arduino library and sample code on our Github repository.\nWhy a Sip'n Puff Shield?\nThe idea for a Sip'n Puff Shield came about after seeing an article on a DIY site for an xbox control that was made for disabled persons who had no use of their arms.  In the article it mentioned that the man making them was older and wanted to retire and there was no one else making special xbox controllers.  To us, it seemed that there should be more people building these kinds of controllers, especially in the DIY community.  This got the wheels turning and after a quick inventory check, we discovered a few pressure sensors left over from a previous product build that fit the specifications.  A few days later, the Sip'n Puff shield was born.\nAlthough we don't personally know anyone who does not have use of their arms or hands, we'd love to see this shield used by the DIY community to help those that do.  The shield also has many other uses as well.\nControl your Arduino when your hands are full or it's not practical to use your hands. Such as when both hands are on a RC remote control and you need to control that one extra thing or your hands are busy holding a camera and you need to control something else at the same time.\nDetecting positive or negative air pressure.\nBuild a Morse code keyboard or mouth controlled mouse.\nInstall it behind your halloween mask to trigger hands free spooky events.\nCreate Arduino based projects for persons with disabilities.\nSip'n Puff Ipod Dock\nWhy KickStarter?\nSome things are just worth doing right.  We believe this is one of those things.  Currently we have a working prototype which is shown in the video.  To do this project right would require making at least 100 shields.  Why 100?  Air pressure sensors aren't cheap. It takes at least 100 to get a decent price break on all the parts and to make it cost effect for everyone.
