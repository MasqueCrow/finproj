I am a commercial fisherman by trade and love a great steak. However, sometimes the weather can be against us and we cannot afford the better cuts of meat. So we figured a way to make this cheaper and tougher cut of meat tender and juicy. So during this we always would cut these juicy steaks and make a mess because all the juices would flow off the the cutting board and all over the counter. One day while commercial fishing I had this idea of making a board that would save the juices in a trough so that you could spoon them out over your sliced meat. I then realized that many people have tried to design a complex solution. Could the answer be so simple. We spend thousands of dollars on grills and cooking devices to make meals \"juicey\"we spend hours prepping and marinading our food just so that when we carve into them the juices end up all over the counter.

Our backers wowed us with so many creative applications of the Circuit Scribe pen, and these were the inspiration for our new DIY kits.  Welcome to the world of DIY paper electronics!\nWhat's Circuit Scribe?\nCircuit Scribe is the original conductive ink rollerball pen. With a non-toxic, highly conductive, silver and water based ink, you can draw your own circuits by hand. Our customers have used the pen for education, prototyping, and electronic art. The educational kits come with magnetic component modules that snap onto the circuit, allowing you to create fun electronic paper crafts using a range of basic to advanced circuit concepts.\nApply What You Learned\nThe new DIY kits are a continuation of our mission to make learning about electricity fun and engaging, but you don't need the educational kits to create with the DIY kits! \nOur original kits emphasized education by teaching basic circuitry principles, while our new kits emphasize application by allowing you to apply those concepts to DIY projects, using the classic Circuit Scribe pen to draw the connections.  The chart below shows how these fundamental concepts are applied to tangible projects that are useful (or just fun!) in your daily life. \nThe Drone Kit\nThis kit really flies off the page! Create a 4-propeller drone using cardboard and the Circuit Scribe conductive ink pen. The DIY Drone packaging will have perforated sections you can punch for perfectly proportioned structure, then draw the electrical connections, add the 4 propeller clamps and the motor to the body and you've made a remote control drone. This kit can be reconfigured to change the drone's size or even turn it into a flying paper airplane.\nIf you're already a fan of drones or quadcopters, try your hand at creating one out of paper!\nThe Calculator Kit\nWe partnered with Dr. Saar Drimer of Boldport for the artful design of the DIY Calculator kit. This kit lets you design your own calculator key pad on paper. In addition to a calculator module & Circuit Scribe pen, the kit includes an easy to read guidebook that teaches you about touch sensors. Follow our outline when creating your calculator or get wild & crazy by drawing your own unique touch pads. \nOur original calculator prototype\nWe want our community to have endless opportunities to be creative with the kit so we're working on a new V2 prototype that will be solar powered (no pesky batteries or wires!) and have a unique paper-clip design that will allow you to move from notebook to planner to desktop!\nOur new design is a unique clip-on board\nThe LiteWing Kit\nNow your Circuit Scribe creations can move using the maple seed as inspiration. Your version of this \"helicopter seed\" spins to the ground with an LED on its wing and a coin cell battery on the weighted base. Simply connect the battery to the LED with your included Circuit Scribe pen and toss in the air. \nThis kit is perfect for anyone who knows their circuit basics!\nKit Contents\nAll of our kits will come with everything you need in the box! A Circuit Scribe pen to complete the circuits, the appropriate modules & supplies, plus an instructional guidebook to ensure the project will come to life.\nCustomize and Share your work\nBecause your DIY creations are made out of conductive ink and paper, they are easy to customize. Get artsy with colored pencils and pens, or add your own paper engineering elements with custom folds.  You'll be able to find detailed instructions and visual aides for our brand new kits on sketch.circuitscribe.com.  Our platform also lets you upload your work and inspire other makers.\nWhy We Need Kickstarter\nThese brand new kits are a departure from our original color-coded magnetic modules, using a few new innovative ways to attach components to paper.  While it's exciting to introduce some new methods for attaching components to paper, we need to open brand new product tooling and create new protocols for assembly. That's why we're coming full circle and asking you, the Kickstarter community, to help make this possible!\nDrone: has a flex board based hub, plus new app for flying\nCalculator: uses a patent-pending thin PCB clip-on design\nLiteWing: components are pre-attached to the paper, and precisely weighted for peak aerodynamic action \nWe also want your input to help us figure out what the final designs will look like.  All of the products that you see in our campaign are functional prototypes; we'll keep everyone up to date on our design evolution and take your feedback into account.\nBacker Rewards\nWe have some great rewards for our backers!  All funding levels come with everything you need right out of the box, including instructions.  See the sidebar for details!  Our highest backing level - $1500 - comes with our maker space oriented kit, represented below.  You'll get all of our available products in one handy carrying case, plus you'll have access to some of our newest offerings such as resistor pens!\nMeet Circuit Scribe\nIt all started with an idea, some conductive ink research, and the help of over 12,000 backers on Kickstarter! \nWe now have a close-knit team of 5 working on the Circuit Scribe kits.  We bring together expertise in engineering, STEM education, marketing, and product manufacturing to give you the best products possible.  We're also obsessed with tinkering and having fun with electronics!  \nCustomer Feedback\nSince 2014, we have received some incredible feedback from our community!  We're happy to have contributed to helping kids and adults, alike, learn about the circuits that run our modern world.\n| \"They are so much fun and bring electronics concepts into a playful learning experience.\"  -Amazon review\n| \"My son is 8 years old and likes this pack so much...After a few days, his workbook was full of creative ideas.\"  -Amazon review\nNot only have our customers shown support, they have made some pretty creative projects that inspired us to design our new line of DIY kits.  Check out some of their social media posts below, and join in the fun using #circuitscribe.\n Shout Outs!\nSpecial shout out to some of the makers featured in the campaign, thank you!\nlinneakirby.com\n@mrbombmusic\n@kfaisteele\n@workbenchplat", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Stay up to date with our progress!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "DIY LiteWing Kit", "descp": "An intro kit for all ages to circuits and aerodynamics!

It was first made by mixing RP-1 rocket fuel (similar to kerosene) with magnetite particles so that magnetic forces could pull the fuel into the rocket engines in zero gravity. \nIt's a very unique substance that has only recently been available for use outside of industrial applications. I sought to utilize these unique properties of ferrofluid and bring them to life visually in the RIZE.\nThe RIZE is activated when you place the sculpture onto its magnetic base.\nThis magnetizes the giant machined screw in the middle and causes the ferrofluid to spin around and rise up in a beautiful display that will keep you mesmerized.\nThe RIZE captivates childlike curiosity and amazement when people view it, and it makes for the ultimate distraction on your desk or centerpiece in your office.\nEven after interacting with these displays for years they still give me inspiration when I see them in action.\nThe sculpture itself is also a feast for the eyes, created with a variety of different metals and finishes:\nEvery square inch of the RIZE is hand crafted and museum worthy.\nIt's also 100% made in the US, right here in our studio in Opelika, Alabama. We are also shipping anywhere in the US for FREE!\nThis project has taken years of research to perfect, and now we even have colored ferrofluid available.\n    4 metallic color-shifting pigments are available:\nGold\n  Red-Orange Color Shift\n  Blue-Purple Color Shift\n  Purple-Pink Color Shift\n   Each RIZE also includes a powerful handheld N52 neodymium magnet.\n The handheld magnet also seperates into 2 smaller magnets for more interaction:\nPLAY\n\nMy Background and Inspiration\nHey I'm Matt, and I've been working with ferrofluid full time for the last 3 years. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and have always enjoyed creating art. After surviving a plane crash I decided that life was too short to waste in a cubicle and that I would pursue my dream of inventing cool products full time.

You gain valuable feedback from the backer community and can also offer the product at a highly discounted price before launch (because you can cut out retail middlemen and pass those margins on as savings). We had a great experience launching our last project on Kickstarter (the Ferroflow) and look forward to another successful completion!\nAnother good thing about Kickstarter is that your credit card won't even be charged until the funding period is completed (9/18).\nDelivery Schedule:\nSeptember/October - finish Kickstarter campaign, order parts\nNovember/December - receive parts and begin assembly\nJanuary - begin sending out RIZE sculptures\nIt's going to be close but our goal is to ship out the early backer rewards before Christmas!!!   We will be shipping out the finished RIZE sculptures every day as soon as we complete them, so the others won't be far behind.\nThanks for your support! \n    Would you like to feature the RIZE in a story?

Working with readily available water test kits, the CitizenSpring app uses computer vision to read the test results and then uploads the results to a map so everybody can see where it's safe to drink.\nUse CitizenSpring to identify safe drinking water for you and your family. Easily test any water source in your community and share the results for all to see.\nLead contamination can be focused in a single building or even a single faucet, but can also cover an entire street or city supply main. And if one of the faucets you drink from tests positive for lead, you simply need more data to know whether you should call a plumber, your building management, your local government, or the EPA.\nPLAY\n\nCitizenSpring aims to be part of the solution by recording not just test results, but also details such as time, date, and location, effectively turning citizens into scientists.\n  Lead is toxic [1], particularly in children where it can cause reduced IQ, ADHD, symptoms of autism, and memory disruption, among many other problems. And recently lead has been showing up in our drinking water all across the country [2], including schools and daycares [3], and officials have been found systematically delaying and even falsifying public testing records [4]. \n[1] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/lead-poisoning-why-lead-p_b_609383.html\n[2] http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/ \n[3] http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/03/17/drinking-water-lead-schools-day-cares/81220916/\n[4] http://gothamist.com/2016/06/25/city_found_to_have_falsified_water.php\n    Why can\u2019t we just test water at the source?\nThe issue is that even if an initial source of water is pure, lead can seep into water from the corrosion of old pipes, be it on a whole street or a single faucet. The only way to determine whether water is contaminated is to test each faucet directly, but there are over one billion faucets in the country and local municipalities just don\u2019t have the resources to test every single one.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re creating CitizenSpring and why we need your support! Whether it's at home, the office, at school, or at the park, we want to empower individual citizens to test their own water and share the data on a map.  \nSo that together we can identify where it\u2019s safe to drink, hold our public officials accountable and help set priorities to update our aging infrastructure.\nCitizenSpring is more than an app, it\u2019s about creating a movement. Our aim is to give people like you a tool to create change in your own life and in lives of your community. We want to empower people with information to make water quality testing more transparent instead of being centrally organized and largely opaque.\nWhen you use CitizenSpring to test the water in your school or home or any other faucet in your community, and you put the data on a map, you become a Citizen Scientist. You become a part of the solution to identify the patterns of contamination in your community. Right now, local governments and federal agencies just don\u2019t have the resources to test every single faucet. \nAnd that\u2019s where you come in!\nLet\u2019s cut through the red tape and blame and take matters into our own hands to create a grassroots movement and help put every water faucet on the map.\n  My name is Sean Montgomery and I run a technology company called Connected Future Labs. CitizenSpring is my personal mission to leverage the expertise at Connected Future Labs and help make the world a better place by identifying safe sources of drinking water.\nAs a neuroscientist, I\u2019m acutely aware of how toxic lead is to the body, particularly the developing brain. And I think with a little 21st century ingenuity this is a problem, that together, we can solve. Because our team at Connected Future Labs has a wealth of experience creating apps that capture data in the cloud and using computer vision to solve problems ranging from 3D body imaging to recognition of facial expressions to the augmented reality applications, we know that the technology needed for CitizenSpring is well within our grasp and all we need is your support to make it a reality.\nAt CitizenSpring, we are a small and dedicated team that believes in the power of technology to connect people and to make a true difference in lives of individuals as well as many.\nThis is a problem that we can solve!\nAnd we need your support!\nWe have a working prototype iOS app that can read lead test strips and display strip information on a map.\nWe need your support to make the following a reality:\nCreate a full ios app and backend database to guide you through the process of testing your water \nRefine and cross-validate computer vision algorithms\nData upload to the cloud + cloud infrastructure maintenance\nData parsing and loading onto a map \nHelp you take the next steps if unsafe lead levels are detected\nWhile each piece of the technology puzzle is squarely within the Connected Future Labs capabilities, every piece requires careful design and engineering to create a lasting impact.\n          Waterbottle mock up (actual bottle may vary)\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Connected Future Labs we have a depth of experience developing apps and data sharing infrastructures.

By taking advantage of the limits of human visual perception, this optical illusion sculpture appears to be doing the impossible \u2014 right before your eyes. Slow Dance combines technology, science, and art, in order to remind us of the natural mystery, beauty, and wonder that surround us every day.\nWatch the following video to learn about how this project went from wedding gift to manufactured sculpture, why this work is important to me and how I got involved with it.\nA TESTAMENT TO BEAUTY\nIt\u2019s like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen in real life. It looks like a picture frame, except that there\u2019s no picture and no glass \u2014 instead, two clips hold objects inside the frame. Plug in Slow Dance and see the magic for yourself.\nReactions to seeing Slow Dance for the first time.\nThe sculpture quiets the mind with an unexpected beauty that appears right in front of us, lowering our stress, and helping our attention become completely present. As far as we've found, it is the easiest way to meditate. It literally reminds us to slow down.\nAN ONGOING EXPERIMENT IN WONDER\nPlay and experiment! YOU bring the objects to Slow Dance \u2014 it is a blank canvas for you to compose. From weeds on the street to flowers in the garden to bird feathers, each object will reveal a new slow motion world. After two years of playing with it ourselves, we are still enchanted when we try out a new object \u2014 the world it reveals seems to be never-ending. It will change how you will see plants and other objects forever.\nDifferent modes allow you to cycle through different dance patterns, some slow and smooth, and others that make the object appear to jump through space!\nMode: Slow Dance - in this mode the object appears to move in slow motion.\nMode: Double Trouble - in this mode it looks like the object starts as one, and splits into two parts before reforming!\nMode: Pop and Lock - in this mode the object looks like it jumps through space, the way that slow motion movies in the 30s did!\nDESIGN\n\"Slow Dance\u201d is made from a 2\u201d pine wood frame. The pine shows the elegance and beauty of the wood grain, while being exceptionally sturdy. Two springs hold objects in the frame, lit from recessed LED lighting.\nSlow Dance comes with two optional feet for added stability.\nThe frame comes with an optional hook for wall mounting, like a picture frame.\nRubber bands allow you to easily change out the 2 provided feathers with any object you might find including other feathers, plants, and your own custom creations.\nA brass faceplate on the bottom of the frame holds the brightness knob, mode button and power plug.\n\nHOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nStrobe lights are nothing new. From the photos of Edwaerd Muybridge to the photos of Doc Edgerton, extremely fast strobe lights have been helping us to see into fast motions. On a dancefloor, strobe lights turn us into stop motion animations. But we\u2019ve put strobe light to use in a different fashion.\nBy using high speed strobe lights blinking 80 times a second, your eyes cannot even see that they are blinking \u2014 the light looks continuous. By synchronizing the strobes to the high-speed vibration of objects (feathers, branches, flowers, etc), we create the visual illusion of those objects moving in slow motion. This is a phenomenon called persistence of vision, and works similarly to the way a TV works \u2014 by flickering frozen images quickly enough that we perceive them as continuous motion.\nFor more information check out this Mr. Wizard video about persistence of vision!\nBy varying the timing of the strobe lights, it's possible to make the objects look like they move in impossible ways \u2014 moving in slow motion, jumping discretely to new positions instantaneously, and more. The objects can even be touched, and appear to be moving in slow motion despite the user\u2019s interaction.\n\nSLOW DANCE LIMITED EDITION\nWe are also offering a premium limited edition of 10 Slow Dance sculptures, hand-fabricated from walnut. Each unit is numbered and signed. Get your limited edition piece fabricated by craftsman Forrest Stone.\nLimited edition of 10 in walnut.\n\nPRODUCTION\nOver a year ago we built the first version for our friends Eric and Emily, as a wedding gift. It\u2019s still running in their house (so we have hundreds of hours of working prototypes to trust). From people\u2019s excitement, we saw that others would like to enjoy their own 'Slow Dance.' Shortly after, we built several additional prototypes for manufacturing. \n\nWe have been working for over 9 months with our manufacturing firm, who has manufactured multiple previous successful Kickstarter campaigns, including the original Makey Makey. They have received two of our prototypes and have already sent us prototypes designed for large-scale manufacturing.\nJan 2015: First prototype/gift made\nMar 2015: First discussions with manufacturers\nOct 2015: First prototypes sent to China\nMarch 2016: Receipt of manufacturable prototypes from China, testing, iteration\nAug 2016: Kickstarter campaign \nSept/Oct 2016: Tooling and design of final production version, and finalize packaging. \nNov/Dec 2016: Creation of first production run, assembly, and manufacturing. \nFeb 2017: Shipping, fulfillment, product delivery to backers.\n\nPROTOTYPING\nThis project has been developed over the last two years; below see some images of development. We've been through the process of going from initial prototypes to final object during our dayjob as artists, so this was straightforward - fabricating custom electronics boards and designing our parts for injection molding, to figuring out what parts can be sourced and manufactured in the thousands.\n\nVarious prototyping sketches and mechanics.\nTECH SPECS\nDimensions: 12.5\" x 14.5\" x 2\" (W x H x D)\nWeight: 3 lbs.\nColor Temperature: Warm White \nPower: 12 Volts with US/EU Plug (Global Voltage Compatible 100 - 240V)\nPower use: 2-4W (depending on brightness)\nUsage: Indoor (the darker the better it works)\nLoudness: Virtually silent depending on the object used (more in FAQ).\nIncludes: \n Slow Dance crafted pine frame with two starter feathers \n Two stabilizer feet \n Wall mounting hook + screw \n Extra rubber bands for object mounting\nWe also want to mention that this project will be open source. When we finalize production, the firmware for the Atmel microcontrollers will be made available to all. For the techies out there, the circuit is Arduino compatible so it is easy to re-code Slow Dance to dance in any way you can imagine!\n\nTHE SLOW DANCERS\nThe Slow Dance team brings together backgrounds from MIT to the forests of Maine, from robotics and graphic design to meditation, music, and painting.\nOur Team: Jeff, Danjo, Nick, Hannah, and Muffin\nJeff Lieberman explores the connections between the arts, sciences, education, creativity, and consciousness. He hosted 'Time Warp' on the Discovery Channel, using technology to see beyond the limits of our normal human perception. He shows technological sculptures around the world, to bring people an emotional and mystical connection with science and the universe.

My hope is that Today brings the limitless potential you feel up there, down here.\nWhat inspires me.\nThe spectrum of time\nToday is the spiritual follow-up to my first Kickstarter project, ThePresent, the 365-day clock that reframes your perception of the year.\nMy first Kickstarter project, ThePresent\nThe creative adventure of producing, distributing, and giving talks about ThePresent gradually opened my mind to seeing time as a spectrum.\nThink of it this way: on one end of the \u201cspectrum of time\u201d you have the standard clock that reveals every second of every minute of every hour at a glance.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, we find ThePresent.\nAs a balancing corrective between these two points on the \"spectrum of time\" is Today, a timepiece that reveals the entire day at a glance.\nYour day at a glance.\nLet's start Today\nI've brought three different styles of prototypes to 90% and I need your support and input to finalize the finishing touches and push this project to completion.\nPictured below are the final prototypes of Today, available in 3 different constructions. \nTODAY - 5\" Desk Clock - Bamboo - $88\nTODAY - 5\" Desk Clock - Bamboo\nTODAY - 11\" Wall Clock  -  Bamboo - $118\nTODAY - 11\" Wall Clock - Bamboo (showing 3pm)\nTODAY - 11\"  Steel and Glass Wall Clock - $158 \nTODAY - 11\" Steel and Glass Wall Clock\nWe are also offering ThePresent, my first Kickstarter project, as a reward bundle option.\nThe bottom 4 rewards to your right contain ThePresent as a bundle option.\nOwn the Present (you really can, as a reward bundle).\nToday specs\nDiameter \nBamboo Desk Clock: 5\" in diameter and 1.5\" deep.\nBamboo Wall Clock: 11\" and 1.5\" deep. \nSteel and Glass Wall Clock: 11\u201d in diameter and 2.25\u201d deep. \nThe edge of the bamboo clock is beautifully finished and meets the edge of the clock face precisely\nWeight: \nBamboo Desk Clock: 1.0 lbs.\nBamboo Wall Clock: 1.4 lbs.\nSteel and Glass Wall Clock: 2.0 lbs.\nBattery life\nRequires two AA batteries. \nDesigned to run for a minimum of 3 years.\nToday takes regular AA batteries and will last at least 3 years until you need to change them\nI've stress tested the supply chain for Today with the same local team of highly skilled craftsmen and women locally in Brooklyn, USA that I worked with to produce thousands of editions of ThePresent.\n\nFrom a plane.\n\nMaking time\nYour pledge will fund the final stages of production:\n\nProduction of all Steel and Glass and Bamboo Clocks in the USA\nTransporting all components to and from vendors to final assembly\nTooling costs for smaller hand to be used in the Desk Clock\nTooling costs for branding \"Today\" into steel battery backplate\nPerfecting the highest quality print to last for decades\nPost Kickstarter e-commerce site design and build\nEngineering and assembly of the movement itself\nQuality control, fulfillment, handling and shipping\nTime and small staff to help bring Today to life\nPackaging design, prototyping, and execution\nAssembly of the clocks and quality control\nKickstarter and Stripe processing fees\nMOQ for the custom domed glass cover\nContingency\nMy Kickstarter goal is modest. The pricing is structured so that if we hit and go over the goal, we are equipped to deliver the clocks by December 2016. After running two successful campaigns, I am confident that your clocks will be delivered on time and on budget. \n\nThe Today fam.\n\nBacking this project will give you a front row seat to the finishing touches and full scale production of Today. I love making videos, and I'm excited to document and share the process with you. \n  Why make Today?\nToday is primarily inspired by living with ThePresent. After raising the initial funding with the help of 837 backers with the first Kickstarter, I've produced and distributed over 3,000 editions of ThePresent. Owners in 48 countries now live with ThePresent.   \n\n\nSideview of ThePresent with Bamboo construction.\nI never imagined myself as someone who introduces new scales of time, but I can't imagine being involved in anything more urgent, meaningful, and rewarding. The way we measure time dictates our behavior and so we deserve access to scales that are more appropriate for the way we live our lives now and far into the future.\n\nI see a world that is less anxious and more grateful about time. A world where time is not an enemy, or money, or something we find new ways to kill. I feel a pull to use technology to positively impact our collective quality of life. \n\nThat view.\n\nThe meditative simplicity of dawn, noon, dusk and midnight was the only way we related to time for tens of thousands of years before modern clocks were popularized during the industrial revolution.\n\nWe are well into the information revolution and yet we have not updated the way we measure time.\n \nNearly everything has changed, except how we measure time. \n\nWe have the chance to change that together, Today.\n\n  What people are saying about ThePresent\n\"It's a beautiful clock that I am proud to have on my wall.\"\n\n\"It helps me find some grounding, or a moment of reflection, a good thought, a deep breath...\"\n\"A subtle reminder to be present throughout the day.\"\n\u201cThis is seriously one of my favorite things. Besides the iPhone, I don't think I've ever been impacted this hard by anything I've ever owned...it's art.\u201d\n\"It is a gentle reminder to breathe.\"\n\"ThePresent removed the borders, the constraints. It's a ballerina's pirouette, a swan's glide, a wind with no beginning or end.\"\n\"It grounds me and shows me where I am in time.\"\nTalking about time.\nWhat the press is saying about ThePresent\n\"It\u2019s all about encouraging us to experience time as a natural, contiguous slipstream, instead of something to stress out about having too little (or too much) of in arbitrary chunks.\" \u2013\u2013 Fast Company\n\n\"Anti-Anxiety Object, ThePresent is a very special clock.\" \u2013\u2013  ArtInfo\n\n\"One of the most Zen clocks we've seen.\" \u2013\u2013 Coolhunting\n\n\"Have you ever felt like time is moving too fast?

In the same year, Thrift was recognized by Good Magazine as one of the GOOD100, an annual list of people on the cutting edge of creative impact. Thrift has spent the past few years building clocks and giving talks on the subjects of time and media at TED@NYC, TEDxStPeterPort, Applied Brilliance, PSFK. \n\nBack to 1st person...On a personal note, I feel like I am in the right place at the right time most of the time. My work with ThePresent and now Today is the most profound and exciting thing I can imagine doing with my time.\nRux Design: RUX is a NYC-based design studio specializing in product innovation, design, and brand creation.

We wanted to create something that inspired both boys and girls. \nThere\u2019s not enough making and coding together: Over the last 3 years of making with thousands of kids and parents, we have learned that when you introduce coding alongside crafting and making, it boosts confidence and enthusiasm, leaving kids wanting to learn more.\nPeople Will Save Us!\nWe launched Tech Will Save Us after we worked for many years in education and design realized it wasn\u2019t moving fast enough for the pace of tech.

Please read our final update or visit Modkit.io to learn more.\nModkit.io is an Event Oriented Multithreaded Programming Language\nModkit.io is a new kind of programming language for the Internet of Everything for Everyone. It has a rich, yet surprisingly intuitive, multithreaded and event oriented syntax that will be familiar to millions of young students and educators who have been exposed to Scratch. And it works with Wiring, the microcontroller framework used in the Arduino IDE as well as development tools from TI, Particle, and Intel.  \nMultithreading is traditionally thought of and introduced as an advanced programming concept, but it just means you can have multiple things going on at the same time. Event-oriented simply means things can alert other things when something interesting happens. Unlike most programming languages, both of these concepts are built-in to Modkit.io, not introduced as a complicated afterthought.\nSupported Editors and Hardware\nModkit.io works with the most popular programming environments\nModkit.io works with the most popular microcontroller development environments including the Arduino IDE, Particle Build, TI Energia, and Wiring.  If your hardware is supported by one of these environments chances are you can use Modkit.io to program it and make use of all of your existing libraries! The boards in the image below have already been tested.\nModkit.io supports the most popular development boards\nBut we could never test the 100's of possible boards ourselves. Be one of our first 1000 $1 backers by June 1, and help us test Modkit.io for your favorite development hardware.\nHelp us test Modkit.io with even more boards by pledging just $1\nPre-campaign\nImportant: We will add additional rewards once we reach our goal of 1000 pre-campaign supporters. But if we fail to reach our pre-campaign goal by June 1, our campaign will be cancelled due to insignificant demand.\nUnlike most Kickstarter campaigns that start giving out rewards months (sometimes years) after funding success and add additional \"stretch-goals\" once they reach their initial fundraising goal, like most everything else at Modkit, we thought we'd do things a bit differently. So instead of a stretch-goal we set a pre-goal that's actually not about money at all. Our goal is to get our new programming language Modkit.io out to 1000 backers before we even start our campaign!\nOur official campaign starts on June 1, but to connect with our earliest adopters and potential partners, get important feedback, and gather stories about how you will use Modkit.io, we're offering 1000 backers a single download of our Modkit.io library for Wiring-based microcontrollers for the absolute minimum Kickstarter pledge of $1. If we don't reach our pre-goal by June 1, we plan to cancel our campaign and if we don't reach our final goal by June 30, none of our backers will be charged. So if we're not successful you will actually get your pre-reward for free!\nWhat do we mean by Internet?\nThe Internet starts with local networks\nWhen people think about the Internet they often think about being able to communicate with anyone and everyone, anywhere in the world. But the Internet is simply a network of networks and it all starts with local networks. The same Internet protocols that allow you to communicate with a website or service across the world, allow you to send a document to a printer or to stream content to a television across the room. These same protocols can even be used to communicate between different programs on a single computer or device. This makes the Internet both technologically and socially democratic.\nWhat do we mean by Everything?\nThe Internet of Everything starts with Things\nJust like the Internet starts locally, we believe that the Internet of Everything should begin with a single thing and scale up from there. When developing programming languages to talk to things across the world, it is interesting to think that the same languages people use to talk to each other are the very languages we use to formulate thoughts, make personal plans, and ultimately to talk to oneself. \nWe've seen many tools and languages proposed for the Internet of Things that do not provide a way for things to talk to themselves and to other things across the room in the same way that they talk to other things or computers across the world. Modkit.io was designed to democratize and bring the true essence of the Internet to Everything.  Our preview Modkit.io library for Wiring is focused on the most local network of things, the individual components connected to a single circuit board, and helping them communicate with each other more fluently than ever before.\nWho do we mean by Everyone?\nInspired by Scratch for beginners - Multithreaded and Event-driven for everyone\nMost text-based programming languages and other serious tools for technology creation are designed for engineers or computer scientists. With over 40 combined years of research and development in STEM education programs, Fab Labs and graphical programming languages such as Scratch and Modkit for VEX, we took a completely different approach and designed Modkit.io for Everyone. Just as text editors like Microsoft Word and Open Office are used everywhere from elementary school to grad school and by everyone from amateur lyricists to professional lawyers, we do not believe well designed tools have to appeal to only one audience or use case. We have seen graduate students at MIT struggle learning programming languages and young students from low-income neighborhoods excel at the same. This unique and broad exposure has led us to see far more commonalities than differences across novice and experienced programmers and it inspired and enabled us to design a programming language truly accessible to Everyone.\nRelated Languages\nModkit.io comes from a large family tree\nModkit.io is influenced by a large family tree and has benefitted from extensive interaction between its designer Ed Baafi and the designers of some of the most popular languages used by hobbyists and in education. For Ed it started over a decade ago, when Amon crossed the same bridge you see in our video carrying a flash drive containing Scratch, a new graphical programming language from his advisor Mitch Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. Ed had experience teaching with Logo, one of Scratch's text-based predecessors, alongside one of its original designers Dr. Cynthia Solomon. Amon said that like Logo, Scratch was designed to make coding more accessible for kids and that just like hip-hop DJs would remix beats, vocals, and samples from existing material, Scratch was designed to let kids remix sounds, images and the programs that control them into whole new digital creations.\nHistory\nWe founded Modkit to bring the same accessibility as Scratch to microcontroller programming, originally targeting Arduino compatible development boards powered by the C++ based Wiring framework which itself has its own rich history. But Wiring/Arduino was single threaded, forcing programmers to coordinate everything in a single event loop and Modkit's early tools suffered this same limitation. If Scratch allows kids to remix like an experienced DJ with a set of turntables and a multitrack recorder, trying to remix with a single thread of control is like trying to mix with a single turntable and only one track. It's not impossible but you need a live band and you need to tightly coordinate everything. If you want to make any changes you usually have to redo the whole song. It wasn't until Modkit partnered with VEX Robotics to create Modkit for VEX, that we finally had the opportunity to bring a new language into the world. Originally called Wiring++ to honor Wiring's creator Hernando Barrag\u00e1n, Modkit.io has been in heavy development ever since and sits behind Modkit for VEX's powerful graphical programming blocks.\nFuture\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns that are complete when they produce a film, gadget, or electronic hardware and ship rewards to their backers, for Modkit.io our Kickstarter campaign is just the beginning. Once a physical item is shipped there is not much left to do but we understand that the nature of software is that it is never complete. This is why we are offering $1 rewards even before we start our campaign, but it is the same reason we need a critical mass of supporters and partners if we are to build a community around the Modkit.io language and meet that community's needs well into the future. We will update you about our plans for the future once we have reached our pre-goal, but if we fail to reach 1000 backers for $1 by June 1, we are afraid there may be no future for Modkit.io at all.\n\n\nRewards\n1000 Early Adopters get a single download of our Modkit.io Wiring library for Particle, TI Energia, and Arduino\nWhile Modkit.io is a programming language for Everything and Everyone, our pre-rewards are designed just for Early Adopters and Early Evangelists. Both rewards feature a preview release of the Modkit.io library that brings the Modkit.io language to popular Wiring-based editors such as the Arduino IDE, Particle Build and TI Energia. Early Adopters get a single download of the Modkit.io library for just $1 even before our Kickstarter campaign has actually begun. We believe that once you try our simple event driven multithreaded programming, and after we open up additional rewards, you'll want to increase your pledge so that you can continue to follow our development and make room for another early adopter to try it out.\n100 Early Evangelists get a Modkit flash drive to help spread the Modkit.io language and show support\nEarly Evangelists receive a limited edition Modkit flash drive that will only ship if our campaign is successful. Use it to share the Modkit.io updates you'll receive for one year from our funding completion. We know that many of our potential supporters are educators or members of local Makerspaces and Fab Labs so this is a great way to pass Modkit.io along to others. While it is too early to decide how we will license Modkit.io, the preview will be released under a special license that allows you to share it with your colleagues, friends, classmates and students. Help us spread the word and we'll be sure to add some more reward tiers as these begin to fill up.\nModkit Team\nThe core Modkit team met while designing and running the first of over one thousand worldwide Fab Labs as well as a one-of-a-kind youth maker program called Learn2Teach, Teach2Learn. In alphabetical order we are:\n\nEd Baafi is the lead instigator and founder of Modkit and the designer of the Modkit.io language. In 2011 he dropped out of the MIT Media Lab to focus on Modkit and hasn't looked back. From time to time he gets a chance to write including a chapter on hardware and software standards in Building Open Source Hardware. \n\nDr. Susan Klimczak is a self-proclaimed education geek who loves integrating art and technology in youth programs across Boston. She received a doctorate in education from Harvard University focusing on informal educational environments.  She is also a fellow in the FabLearn Fellows Program at Stanford University. \n\nDr. Amon Millner is Assistant Professor of Computing and Innovation at Olin College of Engineering.  While studying for his PhD with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, he helped design Scratch and related technologies. He is immortalized as a character in Scratch so you can program him to do your bidding.  \n\nCollin Reisdorf is the designer who focuses on the user interfaces and experience for Modkit's graphical programming tools.  He taught himself programming while studying design at MassArt and has designed experiences for some of the world's most recognizable brands before Ed convinced him to join Modkit.\n\n\nCredits\nModkit.io was designed and developed by Ed Baafi with support from VEX Robotics and inspired and adapted from Scratch from the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\"Modkit.io - the Most Important Technology\" stars Ismael and Sang, directed by Michael King and co-produced by Ed Baafi and Michael King.

We also already have the flash drives in hand which is currently our only physical reward. The biggest risk is for our company and for the future development of Modkit.io which cannot continue without significant support.\n\nLarge companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google have historically been the only players who have built successful businesses around programming languages and we are aware that there are not many established paths for us to follow. But we are not deterred. We believe that the current state of hobbyist programming languages and tools is so far behind and so badly fragmented that educators, students, makers, hardware manufacturers, media outlets and other interested parties will get behind our efforts to change this and create a viable business around the Modkit.io language and tools.

Let your creations come to life as you light them up with LEDs, make noises with buzzers, and spin with the motor.\nWho is Squishy Circuits for?\nEveryone! Squishy Circuits has been used in classrooms, homes, libraries, and museums in all 50 states and over 20 countries. The stories and experiences we have heard are incredible, ranging from science fair exhibits to nursing home activities. Squishy Circuits has even been invited to the White House! \nSquishy Circuits is truly for all ages - we have led events with 3 year old students who easily grasp the basics with just a little individual attention and workshops with adults. \nHow does it Work?\nSquishy Circuits is very simple and is based on two play doughs - one that is conductive (electricity flows through it) and one that is insulative (does not allow electricity to flow through it). We are excited to have pre-made dough that you can purchase directly from our store, or you can make your own doughs with the provided recipes.\nPower is supplied by a 4AA battery pack and travels through the conductive dough to provide power to LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes), buzzers, or motors. \nSquishy Circuits are easy to make! View our Quick Start Guide or check out this video which walks through the most basic Squishy Circuit.\nWhat are Squishy Circuits Kits?\nLite Kit \u2013 The lite kit is the most basic kit and includes everything that you need to make your first Squishy Circuits light up quickly and easily. It is ideal for classrooms, parties, or events where every participant needs their own battery pack and wants to get started building right away.\nStandard Kit \u2013 The standard kit includes most of the components to be used with Squishy Circuits for more design creativity. It does not include dough, but the dough is easily made with the included recipes and common kitchen ingredients.\nDeluxe Kit \u2013 The deluxe kit is our most complete Squishy Circuits kit. It comes with more items than the standard kit and comes with pre-made doughs so you can start circuit building right away! This kit also includes a deluxe battery holder which has a knob that allows your lights to blink and buzzers to beep at different speeds.\nHow are these kits different than the older versions?\nCurrently we offer one Squishy Circuits Kit that is very similar to the new standard kit (view it on our current website and on Amazon), however we have made significant improvements and will be discontinuing the older style. \nThe newest generation of kits have a brand new design that is easier to manufacture, are more durable, and are safer.\nWhat do I get for Supporting this Kickstarter?\nWhy is your help needed?\nDevelopment and sourcing for the new Squishy Circuits Kits started in early 2015 and we have created strong relationships with our vendors. Now, we need the upfront capital to start production and meet our vendor's minimum order quantities. This is only possible with your support. \nFurthermore, we need your help to grow Squishy Circuits and bring hands-on STEM education to more people around the globe. Your support will allow us to expand the Squishy Circuits brand and develop additional projects.\nWe have an aggressive timeline and we are committed to delivering the new kits before the start of the new school year. \nWho is Behind Squishy Circuits Store?\nMy name is Matthew Schmidtbauer and my Squishy Circuits journey began in early 2011 when I was an electrical engineering student at the University of St. Thomas and had just started working with AnnMarie Thomas (the creator of Squishy Circuits) on the Squishy Circuits project. From the very beginning, I thought that Squishy Circuits was a fantastic idea \u2013 and I was very excited to be working on it. After attending several events, I realized that many people were looking for a single source for all of the components required for Squishy Circuits. As my mom stated, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have bought this for you growing up. I wouldn\u2019t know what to call these things, let alone where to buy them.\u201d \nAlthough developing a business plan, sourcing parts, and building a website were not necessarily things I thought I would be working on during my free time that spring, I started learning more about the process and finalized the Squishy Circuits Store idea. By June I had gained permission from AnnMarie, Sam (Squishy Circuits\u2019 previous student researcher and recipe developer), and St. Thomas to continue forward. On June 15, 2011, I filed the paperwork for Squishy Circuits Store LLC. \nArmed with a small loan from my parents, I ordered raw materials. Upon their arrival, it became quite clear that \u201csome assembly was required\u201d and my parents and I began producing Squishy Circuits Kits out of their basement and garage. By September I had the first versions of the Squishy Circuits Kits available online and had started selling them. Learning to juggle school, work, kit production, and everything that filled the spaces in-between proved to be challenge, but, looking back, I can only think of it as a positive, learning experience. \nProducing the very first Squishy Circuit Kit in late 2011\nFast-forwarding to present day, I am proud to have sold thousands of Squishy Circuits kits in over 20 countries around the world. Although no longer a student researcher for Squishy Circuits, I continue to be a proponent of the program and am a firm believer that learning can be accomplished through playing and self-discovery.\nAnnMarie Thomas and Matthew Schmidtbauer accepting a 2015 Eureka Award for Squishy Circuits\nAbout Squishy Circuits\nSquishy Circuits was developed at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota by AnnMarie Thomas. It began as a summer research project in her Playful Learning Lab with past student Sam Johnson, and quickly grew in popularity. It especially became popular when AnnMarie demonstrated it at TED in 2011. \nToday, the Playful Learning Lab continues to expand upon Squishy Circuits and works on developing new technologies. Squishy Circuits Store is proud to support the Playful Learning Lab by contributing a portion of all sales and developing new Squishy Circuits resources.\nMatthew and Playful Learning Lab students at the 2015 National Maker Faire in Washington DC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDrawing upon our experience of selling thousands of Squishy Circuits Kits, and having spent over a year developing and sourcing components for the new kits, we are confident that they will be a high-quality product. We also believe that we have taken the appropriate actions to ensure a successful campaign and are even optimistic that our timeline will be accelerated and shipping may happen early.\n\nWe believe we have two major risks, mainly regarding quality and importing times. Regarding quality, we have done several prototype runs proving that our vendors can provide components built to our requirements. We will be testing many of the production parts and plan on ordering extra in case of defects. This will ensure the final products are high quality.\n\nOur vendors are primarily located overseas which means our products must be imported. In the past, we have had delays (port strikes, customs inspections, etc.) that have increased the importing process by weeks. We have built in some time so that if these unforeseen circumstances occur, we can still deliver on schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Please help our friends with their monthly STEM kits!", "update_content": "We are excited to announce that things are on track for delivery in August or September (depending on your backing level), as originally promised.

Thimble is a unique direct-to-your-door monthly delivery subscription that contains a project with electronic components to teach kids and adults how to build a fun and useful device. \nOur very first kit we\u2019re launching through this Kickstarter is a WiFi-enabled robot that you control with your phone, tablet, or laptop. The robot arrives with everything you need to build the project and a learning app you log into to follow instructions. The learning app provides step-by-step tutorials to help you throughout the construction process and provides a community of other makers to share knowledge and best practices. \nBy making the Wi-Fi robot, you will:\ncreate an Android/iOS app that makes things move\nunderstand how electricity, motors, and microcontrollers work\nprototype your own ideas to improve the robot\nhave fun showing off your creation.\nGet all the parts to build your project\nFollow steps on our learning app to construct the kit\nYour first kit: a WiFi-controlled robot\nLearn to program the app that controls the robot\n Who is Thimble for? \nThimble kits are for curious minds - kids and adults (ages 13 and up) - interested in building electronics on a monthly basis that want a guided path to learn through step-by-step instructions on our learning app.\nFor ages 13+ (soldering is involved)\nMade for those curious about hardware and software: make things move!\nWhy Thimble?\nKids and adults want to be creative and develop the right technical skills to build something fun and useful. But they\u2019re hesitant to jump in because:\nthey don't have the right project ideas\nfinding components is time consuming\nthey don't have the knowledge to assemble their project\nThat whole experience is a massive barrier and we\u2019re going to fix it.  By offering monthly kits, we are bringing the makerspace to your home; it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or how old you are, people want to understand how individual electronic parts work together to make something function. As you progress from project to project, you will learn the art of soldering, programming languages, micro-controllers, and theory. Our hope is that you will learn enough to build, operate, and manipulate your own projects in the near future. \nPLAY\n\n The Mechanics:\nThe Wi-Fi robot is built around the Arduino microcontroller platform which may or may not be included in the kit depending on the reward level you select. The robot shield plugs into the Arduino and contains the motor controller and wifi module. You program the firmware (low level software) on the Arduino to talk to the Wi-Fi module in order to connect to your wireless network and receive commands from the internet to control the motors and make the robot move. The Thimble app that you program (for Android or iOS) then talks to the Wi-Fi module via the internet (UDP packets, specifically) to discover the robot on the network and send it commands to move forward, backward, left and right. We also show you how to add buttons to the app to read from sensors that you can add to the robot. \n Soldering is involved:\nAssembling components involves some soldering and can be accomplished by following instructions on our learning app in case you\u2019re unfamiliar. Additional tools will be required to assemble the project and future kits; they can be purchased on our website after the campaign and will be shipped with your reward (if you don't already own them). The tools you\u2019ll need are a soldering iron, soldering stand, solder, wire, wire cutters, diagonal cutters, a glue gun, and a screwdriver.\nWhat parts will I receive in my first kit?\n16 parts and you put it all together\nLearn how to assemble the robot and code by following tutorials on our learning app.  Once the robot has been constructed, kids and adults with no previous exposure to electronics or programming will easily figure out how to code the wifi-robot to move forwards, backwards, left, and right. If you\u2019re already a pro in some or all of these areas, you can skip over to see only the parts you\u2019re interested in. We will also guide you through writing an app for the robot which will work for iOS and Android devices.\nEasy-to-follow pictures, videos, and engaging community\nOnce you\u2019ve completed coding the robot, you can enjoy driving it around. If you\u2019re someone who likes to push the envelope, we encourage you to get creative - modify it and add components to the robot to make it do all sorts of things. This is truly where Thimble kits come alive! For example, add a sensor to make the robot avoid obstacles, or chase your dog around the house, or blink an LED when the lights are turned off! To get you started, we will show an example of how to read sensor data back to the app you develop. \nOnce you build the robot, program the app to make it move\n Our goal is pretty simple: To help you learn and build electronics in a more structured way. (without feeling overwhelmed!)\nFuture Kits:\nOther projects you could receive in later months include quadcopters, alarm clocks, LED cubes, light control devices for your home, weather monitoring, and more. If monthly is too frequent, or you just want to try the first kit out, we can ship kits when you\u2019d like them.\nSneak peek at our second kit: RGB LED cube with an integrated 9DOF IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)\nControl the color of every pixel (LED) of the cube, program it to react when you move or tap it\nOver this past summer, we did a one-month pilot program with the Boys and Girls Club of Buffalo to promote their STEAM curriculum. We had 12 students participate. Before the program, none of the students had experience with electronics, soldering, or software engineering and after it, 9 of the students wanted to become engineers and further pursue careers in software and hardware. To support that effort, we are partnering with the Boys and Girls club for a \"Give a Kid a Kit\" pay it forward initiative: if you would like, you can give a kit to a kid at the Buffalo Boys and Girls Club. We can also send it to a school or afterschool program in your local area. After the campaign is over, we will send out a survey asking where you would like the rewards that you selected to go.\nHow it all began...\nIn December 2014, Dave and Oscar met on Hacker News and quickly realized they shared the same passion for the maker movement. They met up in person and shared their goal to find ways to better engage kids and adults in electronics. Thimble was finally ignited by idea of month-to-month kits accompanied by a learning app that would provide seamless progression into hardware without feeling intimidated or demoralized.\nTogether, they\u2019ve been bootstrapping this idea for almost a year. It has taken them eight months to get everything ready for production; there was also the challenge of figuring out what parts should be included in the kit and what the educational content on the learning app should look like. All throughout, they\u2019ve spent their time learning about manufacturing electronics, meeting with manufacturers and suppliers, building relationships with partners, and designing future kits. They\u2019ve tested Thimble kits with Maker Spaces as well as organizations such as the Boys & Girls Club to make sure they\u2019re making something kids and adults will have fun learning and building.\nAlso, the team was recently accepted into New York\u2019s Next Top Makers Fellowship. It is a community-sourced incubator dedicated to connecting ideas like Thimble with local development in NYC.  \nDavid Brenner and Oscar Pedroso\nA big thank you to our friends and family whose support has helped make this campaign possible.

Install micro-controllers inside diamond skulls. We think the gallery world should just be slightly more fun. We think we can accomplish a part of that with huge hearts and a fist-full of wire.\nMediaLounge is on a mission to blow minds. We're sticking cutting edge artists, art works and advocates into the same space and shaking it up. We're going to put tools in the hands of the public by hosting workshops from the very people who are developing award winning software and hardware that make digital art possible.

Click on each to be directed to their project page on medialoungenyc.com.\n    From 2009-2010 MediaLounge presented the work of over 100 artists. We gave them time, space, and resources to realize their visions. Uncoiled, ran, tangled, struck, untangled, and coiled over 500,000 miles of cables.

That means good songs with a sense of humor, soulfully played, packed with hooks, and bursting with aural pleasure.\n*Update 11/4: We've hit the first two stretch goals! I've just added the \"Magic Pack\" reward. This reward and all others above $222 will include this limited-edition David Hale LUNA MOTH print (the same design I have tattooed on my right arm):\nThe Songs\nI've got a menagerie of original songs on hand, and here's what they're saying:\nLive joyfully, live playfully, live honestly. Pleasure is good for you. Sex is fun. Shame is a waste of time. Women are powerful superheroes. Respect yourself. Fuck the haters. Loneliness hurts but we need it. Love hurts but it is also the point of living. Feel love (and pleasure, and everything) often, and with relish.\nHere are two of the songs that will be featured on the album. These are demos, and have not yet blossomed into the fullness of their pop glory, but I think they give a hint of the possibilities!\nHot Night:\n Ravenous:\n If you'd like to hear the rest of these demos, plus the other songs we're taking into the studio, become a backer!\nThe Money\nI'm asking for $22,000. What I actually need to complete the record is $29,500. Whatever I don't make here, I will borrow (or steal, or beg for). To realize my ultimate vision for the record, which includes extra studio time and more musicians, I need about $36,000. To hire a publicity team who will see that the album gets heard far and wide, I need about $50,000.\nMy ultimate stretch goal is $69,000. If I were to reach that (incredible, beautiful, astronomical) number, I could make music videos for three of the singles from the album, hire the best (and fanciest) publicist in the business, and order additional CDs and vinyl. And, of course, sexy numbers are good luck.\nFor more info on the budget, scroll down.\nWho do you think you are?\nI'm a singer/songwriter living in New Orleans (by way of Philadelphia PA, Eugene OR, and Luray VA). I've been making records for ten years, writing and performing for fifteen, and singing my whole life. I've been interviewed on NPR and toured as an opener for Paul Simon, The Weepies, The Wood Brothers and many more. My last Kickstarter made over $60K, and resulted in a damn fine record, too.  \nNew to my music? Catch up at www.carsieblanton.com!   \nThink crowdfunding is the bomb? I agree. Visit my Patreon page!\nWhy pop?\nWell... I love pop. I love the attitude of pop: playful, joyful, unabashed, hedonistic. I love the sound of pop: melodic, lush, groove-laden, hook-driven. And I love so many of the artists who have been called \"pop\" over the last century: Nat King Cole, Paul Simon, Carole King, Michael Jackson, Dolly Parton, right up to Beyonce and Bruno Mars.\nI also love that pop is not really a genre. It spans all genres, but has no allegiance to any. The Beatles, for example, were only a rock band until about \"Rubber Soul\". Then, they were something else; something which included baroque horn concertos, Hindustani classical music, and English children's folk songs. As a musician with an equally feverish love of Ella Fitzgerald, Joni Mitchell, Queen, and Prince, this approach strikes me as the ultimate expression of musical freedom, creativity, and playfulness.\nBut, in case you think \"pop\" is a dirty word, let me remind you that all of the aforementioned artists, PLUS Bob Dylan, had multiple hit songs. In other words: historically speaking, a lot of pop songs have been smart, soulful, well-crafted, and honest. I plan to make a few more of those.\nWhy Pleasure?\n\"We must risk delight. We must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world.\" - Jack Gilbert\nI subscribe to the radical notion that pleasure is good for you (and for me, and for all of us). Pleasure is a source of joy, inspiration, connection and aliveness. It relaxes us, invigorates us, and re-connects us to ourselves and each other. I'm not talking about the shallow pleasure of Oreos and reality TV (not to knock either), but the deep-soul-pleasure of making love, night-time swimming, vigorous cuddling, and good, sweet, true music. \nFor me, music is the ultimate hedonistic pursuit: I make it, and listen to it, and love it, just cus it feels so dang good. This is the attitude I'll be bringing into the studio; become a backer if you want to hear what I bring back out.\nPhoto by Bobby Bonsey\nThe Team\nBesides the songs, I've got two weeks of scheduled studio time (in January), and a plan to attack this project with moxie and playfulness. But better yet, I've got a group of disgustingly talented musicians who are ready and willing to make this crazy thing happen.\nOur merry band of pranksters includes: Pete Donnelly, founding member of The Figgs and producer of my 2009 record 'Buoy' (as well as many other excellent records); Joe Plowman, bassist extraordinaire, friend and collaborator since 2009; Pat Firth, NYC pianist and jazz/pop/R&B aficionado; and Jano Rix, world-class drummer/percussionist/vocalist/melodica player/salsa dancer.\nThese guys are talented. But not only that; they are silly. And smart. And committed. They know that the point is to feel good, and play with feeling. And between them, they can draw on a massive sea of musical references.\nI am confident that with this crew, a lot of playfulness, and a little good luck, I can make anything I can imagine.\nThe Budget\nHere is a more detailed breakdown of costs for my original ($29,500) goal.\n \"Recording Costs\" include:\nPaying the producer and the musicians who play on the record.\nStudio time, lodging, and food during the recording sessions.\n\"Design and Manufacturing\" includes:\nPrinting CDs and pressing vinyl records.\nPaying for cover art design.\n\"Kickstarter Costs\" include:\nKickstarter takes a 5% fee from the funds collected.\nAmazon payments takes another 3% for credit card processing.\nMy estimated expenses for Kickstarter rewards not included in other parts of the budget.\nThe Take-Home\nThank you, in advance, for every penny you're willing to part with. I am grateful every day for the people that make it possible for me to sit in my little pink studio (The Watermelon, pictured below) and write songs; or to hunker down with my favorite musicians and turn those songs into a record. \nI feel blessed and honored, 100% of the time, to make music. (Yes, even when I am cranky.) I love this work, and I love you for making it possible. I don't take this opportunity lightly (though I do, of course, take it playfully). \nI love you madly!\nCarsie\nPhoto by Bobby Bonsey", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'll be the first to admit: good pop is hard to make. If it wasn't hard, there would be a lot more of it. It's hard to write a song that is true and good and bursting with hook and melody; but I believe I have a few up my sleeve. It's hard to create a delectable aural confection like \"All You Need Is Love\" or \"You Send Me\" or \"Where Did Our Love Go?\", but goldang it, I'm willing to try.\n\nOther than that, my struggle (as always) is trying to operate respectably here in the material world.

The mobile app used to play totems is called Stylus.\nTotems are encoded with music and visuals that can be played back using the Stylus mobile app.\nOur platform lets artists express their music in physical and visual form, and gives fans an interactive, multi-sensory experience that they can share with others. REIFY is a new medium of creative expression for artists, and a deeper, connected music experience for fans.\nWe've spent the last 9 months building and testing our platform in direct collaboration with musicians. Now we've partnered with a group of amazing artists on this Kickstarter to release their music on totems, to fans everywhere.\nHEALTH, mae, YACHT and Tim Fain are REIFY early adopters designing totems for this Kickstarter.\nEvery totem can feel as unique as the song it represents.\n                                                      Close up of a 3d printed PLA totem.\nClose up of a 3d printed PLA totem.\nClose up of a cast bronze totem.\nWe\u2019ve designed hundreds of experimental totems for many different kinds of music. Through many beautiful trials and educational errors we've established an audio-to-physical design process where each totem can look and feel as unique as the song it represents...while remaining structurally sound.\nWe've prototyped our totem fabrication processes to find a balance between creative flexibility and lasting, physical objects. The rewards for this Kickstarter will be 3D printed in PLA plastic, with limited editions cast in bronze.\nWhen not being used to experience music in a whole new way through the Stylus mobile app, each totem is also a beautiful stand-alone art object. Imagine having your favorite music live in your home as physical art you can hold, display and share.\nTotems are also stand-alone art objects you can hold, display and share.\nThe opening scene of HEALTH's Dark Enough experience.\nOur free Stylus player app will be available on iOS at public launch. We also have a functional Android version that we plan to get ready for public release late spring next year.\nWhen a fan points their mobile device camera at a totem, the Stylus app plays back a music and interactive visual experience, also designed with the artist.\nEach experience is unique in style and content. Some are game-like. Some are conceptual explorations. Others are both...and neither. All are direct expressions of the artist's creative vision.\nEach totem experience is unique in style and content. This is an untouched real time capture of HEALTH's Dark Enough experience.\nAnother untouched live shot of HEALTH's Dark Enough experience.\nTotem experiences can be incredibly detailed. These untouched real time shots were taken from a mobile camera about 4 inches away from the HEALTH Dark Enough totem.\nWorking with HEALTH to create a totem for their single, Dark Enough.\n1. MAPPING\nWhen we partner with an artist we first provide a range of visual interpretations of a specific song, in the form of abstract 3D models. These models are based on both the artist's creative goals and the automated mapping of various musical attributes to physical and visual ones by Harmony, our custom audio-to-physical engine and parametric design software.\n2. DESIGN\nUsing these models as a starting point, we work with the artist to design a custom totem that matches their creative intentions and visual aesthetic. We also collaborate to create an interactive visual experience which includes and represents the song. The creative choices and decisions made for each totem are saved and learned by our system, and used to improve our generated Mapping models for every collaboration that comes after.\n3. PRODUCTION\nOnce both are complete, we 3D print the totem and encode it with the experience using Unity and Vuforia. The combined experience of physical, audio and visual can take nearly any linear, exploratory or other form of narrative the artist wants to create for their fans.\n4. RELEASE\nFans who purchase the totem and download our free Stylus app can play back the music and interactive visuals on their mobile device, experiencing the artist's song through sound, sight and touch.\nOur Harmony software learns the creative choices made by each artist, improving every collaboration that comes after.\nYACHT - \"Music is by nature immaterial, but people need something to hold onto, to help make it feel concrete. Physical albums used to serve that purpose; the death of the physical album, in a way, opens up new possibilities beyond vinyl and acetate. We've always been interested in designing objects and experiences around our music, but REIFY's concept of a totem that embodies the sound itself is light-years ahead. We're early adopters.\"\nHEALTH\nmae - \"Sometimes things aren't lost in translation, they are FOUND in translation. 100 years ago Wassily Kandinsky said that \"The arts are encroaching one upon another, and from a proper use of this encroachment will rise the art that is truly monumental.\" Kandinsky used his paint to SHOW us music. Now, 100 years later, technology has given us the ability to SEE music in a new way yet again. REIFY is taking music beyond the realm of sound and into the realm of the multisensory aesthetic experience.\"\nTim Fain \nIvy Ross, VP Google, Head of Glass - \"I have been waiting to be able to not just live in rhythm, but to hold it in my hands. Reify ignites this new blending of the senses in a way that will provoke more questions then answers, which is the best part of our journey.\"\nJake Friedman, Manager/Co-Founder, We Are Free - \"In this moment of 'on demand' everything, Reify has created a new physical format. And that format promises to return ritual and aura to recorded music. Who wouldn't be excited about that?\"\nPaste Magazine - \"The swirling structures are artful representations that could just as easily be seen in your living room as in a museum.\"\nColossal - \"Sound wave interpretations in your hands, as 3d-printed sculptures.\"\nThe Creator's Project - \"Music becomes tactile and textured.\"\nBloomberg Business - \"It's hard not to get excited about staring your favorite song right in the face.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal - \"Shapes that can be printed and then played back with an app that divines the sound from a scan of the object made to represent it.\"\nTeen Vogue - \"How One Girl Turned Her Favorite Songs Into Sculptures with Computer Software\"\nThe REIFY pins and stickers include an interactive visual you can play with the Stylus app!\nWe've been a self-funded full time project until now.

Suppliers may miss a deadline, a machine may start malfunctioning or a shipment can get lost. Those things can cause delays, Nevertheless, to minimize any setbacks and inconveniences, we are going to work with the most reliable suppliers, manufacturing plants and shipping agencies, to ensure you get your rewards by the intended delivery date.\n\nDESIGN\n\nThe physical form for each artist's REIFY totem is designed by REIFY and that artist, using our custom software. The Stylus experiences for each totem are designed by REIFY, that artist and an digital artist versed in 3D motion graphics and working directly in Unity. \n\nHEALTH's totem and full Stylus experience are complete and ready to move to production. We've begun initial concepting and collobration with some of the other Kickstarter artists. \n\nGiven the variable nature of any creative collaboration among multiple artists and designers, each full project may take different amounts of time and effort to reach production-ready designs. Potential delays to production could occur if design time extends past what we planned for.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nWe're partnered with Voodoo manufacturing for 3D printed totems and a private bronze casting partner in NYC for the numbered edition totems. \n\nThe HEALTH totem's manufacturing process has been tested and confirmed. Optimizing for production of that totem at scale is currently underway. Fabrication testing and optimization for the other artist's totems will depend on the complexity of the final physical designs, materials, etc.\n\nWe're working closely with Voodoo and our bronze partner, and using our experience from our work with HEALTH, to predict and remedy any manufacturing challenges before we move to mass production. Potential production delays could happen if an artist's desired design proves a high effort to fabricate, needs to be reworked for predictable printing or casting, etc.\n\nPACKAGING AND FULFILLMENT\n\nOur totems are to be packaged and fulfilled from a dedicated location in Brooklyn. Our design, manufacturing and packaging facilities are all within 1 mile of each other. We have sufficient storage space to fulfill at scale. \n\nWe have a plan for fullment that requires a dedicated production management hire + knowing just what and where we're shipping all our rewards, in order to confirm our predications on effort and time for delivering rewards. Both will happen upon Kickstarter rewards successful funding our campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "REIFY\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nREIFY is a group of designers and engineers who use technology to create cross-sensory experiences of sound.

I grew up as a math and science guy that loved comics and my dad taught me to read using comics. I know for a fact that comics work! Now that I have two children of my own I\u2019ve worked to get my own kids interested in STEM. I did not find the existing materials to be very engaging. I am convinced that comics are a better way to getting this information into the hands of kids.\nMy dream is to eventually create a SERIES of these STEM career comics for kids. Each comic will focus on a STEM job and give some insight into what that job is like, what they would spend their days doing, and what kind of money they can make. Each story will show how a middle school kid became a STEM professional.  \nREWARDS - In our reward section we describe a variety of packages that you can use to bring \u201cDavid, Software Engineer\u201d into your classroom, groups or communities. Our packages are designed to fit the needs of most school classrooms, groups and communities, but every situation is a bit different. If you\u2019d like to describe your class, group or community size and composition we can recommend a package appropriate for you. Contact me at: pgamble422@att.net\nSTRETCH GOAL - Reaching the stretch goal of $25,000 will provide enough funding to do storyboarding, writing and preliminary art for a draft of a SECOND STEM Career Comic Book as we've done for \"David, Software Engineer\". All backers of $15 or more will be able to vote for the Stem Career of the 2nd Book through a short survey!!!!\nHere is a list of possible careers for a second Stem Career Comic Book: Aerospace Engineer, Architect, Cellular Biologist, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Marine Scientist, Mathematician, Mechanical Engineer, Nuclear Engineer and Petroleum Technologist. Let us know what career you would suggest making into a 2nd book.\nKids need to know that the jobs that will allow them to live a life of their dreams are in the STEM fields. We need to draw a connection between their school efforts and their future lives\u2026this is where communication has been failing between parents and children and teachers and students.\nUnfortunately, the depicted parental lecture scene is happening all over the country.  Instead of lecturing your kid (again and again) my comic provides you with an alternative for getting STEM career-related information to your kids in a format they will listen to.\nThere are more forecasted STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) jobs then we have students in the pipeline. We know those jobs are among the highest paid.\nKids are losing interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).\nKids continue to tell us they do not understand how math and science are relevant to their future. They want to know how that the Algebra I class they do not like impacts their future career and lifestyle. The lack of relevancy leads to disinterest, lack of motivation and decreased engagement.\nMaterials are needed that Engage, Stimulate Interest and Expose kids to STEM concepts and careers that focus on WIIFT (What's In It For Them).\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it, check out some of the great feedback I have received from kids about the draft of my comic.\nI loved comic books as a kid (and STILL Do!), and I realize that a better way to expose kids to STEM is through a series of comic books focused on STEM careers. \nI\u2019ve been working on this idea for quite a while and have already made up two drafts of the comic.  I\u2019d like to introduce you to \"David, Software Engineer\". \nDavid, like most other students, has no idea what he wants to be when he grows up. David is always messing around and fiddling with phones, calculators, and computers. His interests seem to be more on gadgets than actual studies and therefore throughout middle school and high school he gets tutored by a girl named Carlie. What he didn't realize was that if he just applied what knowledge he used with his gadgets and gizmos to everyday life, he would be just fine. While being tutored by Carlie, he realizes he likes her but is too shy to say so. Will David ever find out how he can better apply his unique skills towards his future? Will he ever get the courage to tell Carlie how he feels? \nIn showing my first draft to kids I've got input that indicated I needed to make some changes for girls. I have modified the comic book so that it appeals to both Girls and Boys. The feedback has been positive from both boys and girls. We\u2019re now ready to finish things up and move forward.\nWhile the work of developing the comic book is nearly complete, we need your help to finish up \"David, Software Engineer\" and to build up a community interested in bringing the STEM careers message to students in comic book form. \n\"David, Software Engineer\" is different than other career-related materials in that:\n1. It has an engaging story  \n2. It uses graphic art to add to the \"text\" in the story  \n3. It includes career-related information from the viewpoint of a young person\n4. Maps the necessary skills, knowledge and attributes of a STEM career to specific middle and high school classes\nSample - Career-related content\nI am also creating Educator, Student and Parent Guides to make the comic book a more effective educational tool.\nThe guides will focus on Vocabulary, Guided Discussion, Discussion Questions, Post Reading Activities, Character Analysis, Standards, Additional Activities, Knowledge Gained, Graphic Organizers and Guided Reading.\nStudent's Guide Sample Page\nAll of the educators that have reviewed the unfinished guides have commented on how helpful and useful they are.\nBy supporting this Kickstarter you are helping get \"David, Software Engineer\" into the hands of the audience it is designed for...KIDS!\nYour support will allow me to do the following:  \n1. Print and deliver comic books to parents with kids, schools and other organizations that serve youth to begin to make a DIFFERENCE  \n2. Create and provide access to digital copies of the comic book for mobile devices  \n3. Research and Identify another STEM career with a Female main character for a 2nd Comic Book \n4. Identify an audience for delivering career-related information about a STEM career in a comic book \n5. Collect feedback on how to Better the product moving forward", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project there are no guarantees. This project has three key areas of risk: content creation, delivery of promised rewards and communication.\n\nContent creation - I have created drafts of the comic book. I understand the process of collaborating with writers/artists and making changes. \n\nDelivery of promised rewards - I have a background in project management and I am used to delivering things on a deadline. I am good at creating a schedule and following up to make sure things get done. \n\nCommunication - A lack of communication can lead to unmanaged expectations and a poor relationship which will reflect poorly on the project.

Light up your robot, house, or spaceship! Our Build Upons are based on the smallest 1x1 brick we could fit an LED into to create elegant and flexible designs. The Build Upons system has three types of bricks: an LED brick, a power brick, and a bridge brick. \nYou can power an LED brick by stacking it directly on top of a power brick, or use the bridge brick to route power to LEDs throughout your design, allowing LEDs to be placed anywhere! \nThis 3D printed prototype shows an LED brick stacked on a bridge brick stacked on a power brick.\nThe bridge bricks allow for flexibility within the design. The below examples use the bridge bricks to route power from the battery pack to the LED bricks, wherever the LED bricks happen to be. The bridge bricks function even when turned 90 degrees!\nBuild a Helicopter!\nThese are only a few of the projects that highlight our bricks, we can't wait to see what you do!\nWe have created these prototype bricks, but we need you to get to a production run!\n                                                         Specs and Process\nThis product will be released as open source hardware upon shipping! Trust us - Alicia wrote the book on it.\nWe are using standard surface mount white LEDs in the bricks powered by a 4.5v battery pack. AA batteries not included. The bricks have metal running through the top and bottom creating connections where they stack. We have gone through several prototyped designs, improving each one. \nHere is a walk through of our design changes in R&D.\nEach iteration reflects a change to make our product more manufacturable and easy to assemble. We are now in our fourth major design iteration and ready for production. The earliest prototype was done with 3D printing, copper tape, and inserting LEDs into a plastic brick by hand, which was time consuming and tedious. In order to build lots of these bricks we need to invest in injection molding. \nThe Team\nThis was the only photo that Puppet had her eyes open.\n *Alicia Gibb* Alicia Gibb is the CEO of Lunchbox Electronics.

Frustrated with the lack of opportunities for scientific exploration present in the traditional classroom environment, in 2008 Ramsey began hosting summer science camps for Bay Area youth designed to transcend traditional curriculum and expose students to the wonders of inquiry. STEM SLAM weekends have emerged from Ramsey's original ethos, but aim to provide young minds with a chance to explore a specific area of interest during the regular school year. \n\nAfter a weekend of cutting edge exploration removed from paradigm of traditional schooling, participants will return to their respective classrooms with a kit of materials and associated lesson plans in hand ready to empower their peers and teacher(s).

We believe that our chocolate is some of the healthiest available on the market today, based on our commitment to organic and sustainable farming and wild-harvesting practices, the origin of our unique unroasted heirloom cacao, low-glycemic sweeteners, and the diverse selection of exotic botanicals and supplements we infuse into our products. As a modern social enterprise, we invest our profits into local communities and projects, with a special interest in preserving the legacies of the people and communities that have made it possible for you to enjoy the botanicals, spices, and cacao we use to make our modern vintage chocolates.\nFor this Kickstarter campaign, we are raising a portion of the money we need to invest in new packaging that will allow us to put our best chocolate bars on the shelves at local grocery stores, along with some new equipment that we need to help us meet current production demands.\nIn my own words... \nThis Kickstarter will really help me take the company to the next stage in our evolution. I'll be using the funds raised here for two separate needs that the company currently has - packaging and equipment. For our packaging, I am committed to using 100% recyclable and/or compostable materials that are ethically and sustainably manufactured. To make these ethics meet the reality of our business needs, we'll need to purchase and print our packaging in bulk, which will require a significant initial investment. So while the initial costs will be high, we'll be able to maintain our ethics, keep the costs of our bars lower, and pass along these savings to everyone who purchases them from a grocery store or local market. Additionally, we'll need a more efficient tempering machine to mold our bars and enrobe our truffles, which will allow us to further decrease our production costs - a savings that we will again be passing along to all of our fans. In the end, I hope to produce chocolates that are ethically sourced, as healthy & nutritious as possible, and made with the highest quality ingredients available today, all while maintaining an affordable price point for our fans. I really hope to make the world a better place with every chocolate I produce, from the cacao growers, to our environmentally-friendly packaging, to one day being able to use the profits of the company to support ecolgical stewardship and human rights efforts related to our mission. By supporting this Kickstarter, you'll help us make our ethics meet the reality of business, and get some absolutely amazing chocolates in return. Every contribution you make will help secure a more sustainable future for our small, mission-driven company.

Inspired by the Tinkering School started by Gever Tulley in the Bay Area (check out his TED talk here), we saw a need and opportunity to inspire the next generation of ATX Makers, hackers, and inventors. Austin has always been a haven for the DIYers, craftivists, tech-savvy innovators, and think-outside-the-box-ers and we needed a school that not only could teach skills but provide access to space, tools, and materials so kids and adults could design, build, create, as well as strengthen their ability to problem solve, collaborate, and innovate.  \nAnyway, here we are, 5 years later.  We've built go-carts, roller coasters, pinball machines, tree forts, hovercrafts, 2 story waterslides, and countless other projects both big and small.   We've offered classes in arduino, robotics, raspberry pi, and 3D printing.  We've had guest Makers teach classes in enameling, video game design, concrete casting, soap making, and lots more.  We even started the Austin Mini Maker Faire (now in it's 4th year), which is a two-day, family-friendly event to MAKE, create, craft, learn, play, invent, and be inspired.  So let's just say we are ALL about the Making.\nAnd we are SO ready to move out of the backyard and into a centrally located, community oriented, kid- and family-friendly Makerspace!  We want to bring these meaningful hands-on Maker experiences to more kids and adults all over Austin.  We also need a Tinkermobile (a truck with a dedicated set of tools and locking tool boxes) so that we can more easily bring tinkering projects to schools, rec centers, afterschool programs, churches, events, and everywhere that kids are found.  \nWe would like to find a warehouse, old auto repair shop, or other industrial space with a fenced-in side yard (kids need playspace and room to build big) for around $2000 a month.  The amount of funding we are attempting to raise will provide us with a $1000 per month towards rent for one year , which will ease our financial situation considerably, and will allow us to establish ourselves at the new location.  $4000 to spend on a used truck for our Tinkermobile would be fantastic.  The remainder would go towards Kickstarter fees and expenses, as well as remodeling of our new space, signage, and a few new tools.\nAnd Boy Howdy yes do we have stretch goals!\n$1000 for a welding set-up \n$2100 for a Blacktooth Laser Cutter \n$2000 for additional computers and software \n$1000 for a kiln\n$2200 for a Makerbot Replicator 2 3d printer\n$5000 for a desktop Shopbot\n$5000 would enable us to buy a stepvan and to create a more complete Tinkermobile.\n$12,000 for another year in the new space!\nKids love tinkering.

Much like people, musical instruments evolve over time. Sometimes these evolutions are the result of changes in musical styles, and sometimes they are the cause of them. And either way, it's hard to imagine an instrument that is more in need of a radical change than the DJ's turntable.\nYes, there have been some changes to the turntable since it started being used as a musical instrument, but these changes still adhere to the same basic design -- a design which, let's face it, was never meant for cutting and scratching. Turntables are fragile and sensitive; that delicate needle sits precariously in the groove and bounces around with the slightest jostling. Scratching is incredibly difficult and frustrating.  Now it's certainly true that the things that make musical instruments difficult are sometimes the very things that give them their signature sound. But in the case of turntablism, I think that an easier user interface could open up a galaxy of sonic possibilities. Imagine instantly alternating between parallel playlists, or creating layers of sound by using each of your hands to do the work of a separate DJ. Imagine routing a singer's microphone into a device that lets you scratch with live audio in near-real time!\nOver the past few years, I've been developing the specifications for a more versatile and intuitive way to scratch, without the latency of digital or the fragility of vinyl. Your donations will be used to hire a product design firm to build a functional prototype of my device, which I'm calling The ScrubBoard. With The ScrubBoard, you scratch by moving a slider up and down a track, much like how you'd move the sliders on a standard mixing board. But the ScrubBoard's slider doesn't adjust volume levels; instead, it's internally attached to a movable tape head that makes contact with a strip of audio tape inside the device. As you move the slider, the tape head moves up and down the tape, thus generating a true analog scratch.\nAn important part of the turntable arts is the DJ\u2019s use of a switch or fader to rhythmically mute and un-mute the audio from the turntable. This is commonly referred to as \u201ccutting.\u201d With the ScrubBoard, you achieve this effect by using a two-fingered push-button that sits atop the slider. I call it the Seesaw Killswitch, because pressing down on one side makes the other side come up. When either side is pressed down, the audio is un-muted. When it\u2019s in the \u201chalfway position\u201d (with neither side all the way down) the audio is muted. Users can open and close the audio signal by alternately pressing with their index and middle fingers, and they can grasp the slider with their other fingers, thus allowing them to cut and scratch with the same hand.\nPressing either side of the Seesaw Killswitch all the way down un-mutes the audio.\nSo why would you want to cut and scratch with the same hand? Because you can use a second ScrubBoard with your other hand! With two ScrubBoards, a skilled scratcher could create a pretty impressive interlocking, polyphonic sound that would be impossible using traditional equipment, even with two people. After all, two musicians will never be as perfectly in sync as your own two hands are with each other.\nWhile the Seesaw\u2019s halfway position always has the effect of muting the audio, the effects of pressing down the right and left sides can be customized.  That's because the ScrubBoard uses the audio tape's four tracks to create two stereo playlists that run alongside each other, and it uses a dual crossfader system to route the audio to the two sides of the Seesaw.  Adjust Crossfader 1 to determine which playlist you\u2019ll hear when pressing down the left side of the Seesaw.  Adjust Crossfader 2 to determine which playlist you\u2019ll hear when pressing down the right side.  \nKeeping both crossfaders on the same side allows you to double your cutting speed with one playlist. Keeping them on opposite sides allows you to instantly seesaw between the two playlists. \nAt this point, you may have noticed a problem with all of this: Movable tape heads might be great for scratching, but turntablists do more than just scratch. A big part of turntablism is the controlled use of the turntable motor's automatic rotation. In other words, sometimes you need to just let the record spin.  So for straight playback, The ScrubBoard makes use of a motorized tape loop.  But unlike a standard tape loop, this loop uses a conveyor-belt design so that the play head is able to slide up and down the slider track without losing contact with the tape.\nThe \"conveyor-belt\" tape loop\nThe audio tape is mounted to the center of a loop belt, which is held taught by two rubber rollers. The loop belt has a writable surface, so users can hand-label all the transient audio events and then follow their movement as the loop belt turns.\nTo preserve one-handed functionality, the controls for the loop belt transport are on the slider. While grasping the slider\u2019s base with your pinky, ring finger, and thumb, you can control the loop belt transport by twisting the grips on the base. Twist them to the left, and the loop belt will roll forward. Twist to the right and the loop belt will roll backward.\nNotice how the user is interacting with the orange grips on the slider's base.\nThe grips will snap back to a neutral position and the belt will stop rolling when you stop twisting them. You can change the speed at which the belt rolls by adjusting the IPS control, which is above the crossfaders.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf my fundraiser is successful, I'll be working with the Bay Area product design firm Connekt, LLC, which will handle the CAD modeling, electrical engineering, and the manufacture of a working prototype. Because the ScrubBoard has not yet been engineered, Connekt could not give me an exact estimate for the manufacturing phase, so instead they have given me a \"not to exceed\" figure, which is the basis for my fundraising goal. This means I'll likely have leftover funds to reinvest in the ScrubBoard after the prototype is complete. But it is also possible that manufacturing will cost more than expected. If this is the case, I will sacrifice some of the ScrubBoard's functionality to keep costs down. That being said, Connekt, LLC has a solid reputation for providing quality, cost-effective design services, and I have every confidence that they will be able to complete my project within the budget they've indicated.\n\nThis prototype is meant to demonstrate the core concepts of the ScrubBoard, and as such will not feature all of the functionality mentioned in the promotional materials, regardless of whether there are budget concerns. The \"ScrubBoard Guitar\" attachment (mentioned in the video) will probably not be included. Also, the loop belt will not be housed in a removable cart, but instead will be permanently built into the console.\n\nFor more info on Connekt, LLC:\nhttp://connektllc.com/\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jeremy Bell\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nI was born to work with audio.

And how they would back their cars all the way up the windy one lane road of Five Mile Mountain to load their trunks with whiskey so they could barrel through the brigades of police cars coming to break up the party.

It was built right after World War II. The building pumped water from Dodds Creek before treating it and sending it on to the town\u2019s water tower, where it was then gravity fed to both Floyd\u2019s businesses and residences. As the town grew, wells were drilled to facilitate the increasing need for water and in 1976 the old water works building was closed. It remained vacant and deteriorated slowly until July of 2013 when it was purchased and repurposed for the distillery.\nWith great determination and lots of blood and sweat, life was brought back into this beautiful old structure. Renovating this rustic building was a very odd task due to the removal of thousands of gallons of water, thousands of pounds of steel and cast iron pipe, and very old, hard concrete. We feel as though all our hard work was well worth it to save such a unique piece of Floyd\u2019s history.\nWhere will the money go?\nYour money will be used to help us take the next steps to create a distillery in Floyd, VA.

We developed volumetric printing over the past year so that we could bring any 3D scene from digital space into the real world in magazine-resolution color.  A bioluminescent jellyfish. An amoeba magnified 100X. A boa constrictor consuming an elephant. \nThis isn't likely something you've seen in 3D object printing or holography before.  Volumetric 3D scenes in millions of colors with full opacity and transparency control are now possible.  Meaning for the first time ever we can volumetrically print a thunderstorm you can hold, with the lightning visible through the clouds. \nIf you can dream it, now you can hold it in a Looking Glass. \nTake this translucent frog, for instance (available as one of the Rewards for this Kickstarter).\nTranslucent Frog Looking Glass, modified by T.Y.F.\nLooks like a real frog specimen in a box, doesn't it?  Perhaps caught and clarified in the marshes of Cameroon?  Ah, but don't let your eyes deceive you - we wouldn't be so cruel.  Get ready for a mind-blow.  There's actually no frog in that box.\nIt's just ink.  It's made up of hundreds of sheets of lucite, each printed with a tiny slice of the 3D modelled frog, complete with see-through skin and internal skeleton. When those slices are stacked, put into a vacuum chamber, and injected with a refractive index-matching fluid, the result is a volumetrically printed Looking Glass.\nReward Choices (NEW CURIOSITIES!)\nAnd now we want to make volumetric printing available to all of you.  By backing our project, you will receive one or more of the world's first volumetric prints. Choose from any of the Looking Glasses below.\nWe've already unlocked twelve Looking Glasses, each available in three sizes.  And backers can now vote on unlocking the 13th Curiosity from the list below:\nDetail on Each Unlocked Curiosity\nCT-SCANNED HUMAN FOOT\nThis is the first, and thus far only, volumetric print ever made directly from a medical CT scan. Lisfranc injury. Dislocation of 2nd through 5th metatarsals.  Scanned two hours after injury in Manhattan. And now, dear backers, it can be yours!\n\nBOA CONSTRICTOR DIGESTING AN ELEPHANT\nThis Looking Glass is an ode to one of our favorite books, The Little Prince.  When 6 years old, the author explains how he embarked on a career to become a magnificent painter with his first ever drawing: a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. However, when he showed his drawing to the grown-ups, they could not see a boa constrictor or an elephant - all they could see was a hat.  They promptly recommended to the author that he pursue another career path.\nThis Looking Glass is for the non-grown-ups out there.  From afar, it will look like a three-dimensional hat.  But when held up to the light, its true nature will be revealed - as a realistic boa constrictor with an elephant in his belly, as if caught mid-digestion in the jungle and preserved in lucite.\n\nTRANSLUCENT FROG WITH SKELETON\nA see-through frog with fully visible skeleton that looks insanely realistic.  But we've got to tell you - and I hope you're sitting down - there's no frog in that box.  It's just ink.  This is one of the first Looking Glasses we made with transparency.\n\nINTERNAL HUMAN ORGANS\nby Dr. Scott Camazine\nThis is a realistic drawing of the full internal organs of a human by fellow Kickstarter creator Scott Camazine.

That being said, if you choose this Curiosity and you tell your friends it's an alien skull discovered off the coast of Florida, we won't say anything.\nCT-SCANNED HUMAN SKULL WITH ILLUSTRATED BRAIN\nby Dr. Scott Camazine\nWe were told by more than one backer that a Cabinet of Curiosities wouldn't be complete without a human skull.  So, for those backers we've tried to do something special - this is a Looking Glass based on a genuine CT-scan of a human skull down to the shoulders.

Anything new isn't going to come into the world without a fight and a bit of screaming, even for the most experienced teams. This rule applies to both inventions and babies.\n\nBut knowing what's coming has given us a chance to prepare, to lessen the risk of delays associated with this first Looking Glass Kickstarter campaign. \n\nMost importantly, our fundamental volumetric printing tech already exists. It's no longer experimental - it's real, having been refined over the past year. In the lead-up to this Kickstarter, we've created hundreds of volumetric prints to refine both our process, hardware, and software.\n\nEven so, we're pushing the technology to a new level for backers - we're upgrading to new suppliers of the input materials, transforming our prototype printer into a production volumetric printer, and adding a couple new Looking Glass sizes. We're confident we know how to manage the risks associated with these improvements, but we're human.

A class that helped you become a more self-motivated and self-directed learner?\nNeither did I. \nYet when we finish school, self-directed learning is exactly what we need most. It's a mindset and toolkit that enables us to: \ndesign our own careers instead of simply accepting what's offered\nbuild things from scratch (whether it's a blog, a business, or a house)\ncontinue our educations without formal classes or assignments\nlive a life that\u2019s very different from our family's or society's vision\nI grew up going to traditional schools, but in college, a series of events conspired to radically open my eyes to the alternative path. Since then I've dedicated my life to tracking down the people, places, and theories that exemplify the spirit of self-directed learning.\n\nMy last two books\u2014College Without High School and Better Than College\u2014showed you how to get a higher education without a formal background. Unlike them, The Art of Self-Directed Learning is a more general-interest collection of the best stories and insights I've gathered from a decade of working with self-directed learners of all stripes: unschoolers, world travelers, small business owners, freelance creatives, and the founders of innovative camps, schools, and retreats.\nI'm excited to get this book into world because there's a lot of confusion about self-directed learning that I want to help clear up. Many people think it means doing everything on your own (it doesn't), that's it's only for people blessed with self-discipline (it's not), or that it's all about online learning (quite the opposite). Such a powerful approach to education\u2014and life in general\u2014deserves more thoughtful consideration.\nWhen finished, the book will be a quick read (~20,000 words) and each chapter will be accompanied by an original illustration. \nIf you're: \nan independent young adult (or the parent of one)\nsomeone thinking about going back to college\nan educator who doesn't buy into the mainstream approach\nsomeone working in (or toward) an entrepreneurial or creative career\nanyone considering a big life change that requires independent learning\n...this book is for you. \nPlease help me bring The Art of Self-Directed Learning to life by contributing to the campaign, sending a link to a friend, or pitching it on your favorite social media account.\n(First time on Kickstarter? Scroll to the bottom where I explain how it works.)\nAbout the Author\nI'm an author, educator, and entrepreneur who took a 180-degree turn in college from studying astrophysics to get involved in the world of alternative education. Read more about me on blakeboles.com.\nTo pay the bills, I run the travel and education company Unschool Adventures, through which I lead life-changing international trips, month-long writing retreats, and leadership retreats for young adults who don't go to traditional school.\nI'm also the author of College Without High School and Better Than College. \nHere's what a few people I respect have said about my books:\n\"Boles offers an antidote to the over-scheduled, grade-driven, and sadly uncreative existence of most high-schoolers today.\"\n\u2014Daniel H.

The more you contribute, the snazzier your reward. Here are details about some of the more complex rewards.\n$50-level backers get a silky smooth American Apparel t-shirt printed with your choice of any illustration from the book (not just the ones shown below). You'll get a chance to browse the full book before making your decision, so you know what your illustration represents. Both unisex and women's fitted shirts are available. (And if you choose the poop truck illustration, I will personally e-mail you and commend your boldness.)\n$60-level backers get three lightweight, flexible, 3D-printed illustrations from the book: muses for summoning your inner self-directed learner. Keep them on your desk, pin them on your wall, or prop them against your laptop. (One will be the \"Carry Your Own Carrot\" illustration\u2014a metaphor for self-motivation\u2014and the other two are TBD.) 3D-printing by Shapeways.com. \n$75-level backers get an extra-large soft-cover Moleskine notebook\u2014my favorite tool for self-directed learning\u2014embossed with the \"Carry Your Own Carrot\" illustration. The interior pages are blank, and the notebook opens flat no matter which page you're on. I've gone through about 10 Moleskines over the past decade. They're badass.\n$175 backers get an hour-long Skype session in which you can ask me all your unanswered questions about self-directed learning. (You may also gift this conversation to someone else.) If you want our talk to be recorded, we'll save it to a YouTube video. In addition to the conversation, you also get your choice of the full $50, $60 (U.S. shipping only), or $75 reward.\n$1000 backers get to bring me out to wherever you are in the continental United States to give a talk on The Art of Self-Directed Learning. This is a great option for schools, homeschool groups, colleges, and extended families. (Drop me a line to talk details before selecting this option: yourstruly@blakeboles.com.)\nNo matter how much you contribute, I will list your name as a supporter in the back of the e-book.\nStretch Rewards\nIf this campaign earns more than its $6000 goal, then I'll have enough funds to do some pretty awesome stuff:\n$8000: Audiobook\nIf we get to $8000, I'll create an unabridged, professionally recorded audiobook of The Art of Self-Directed Learning. All backers who contribute $7+ will get a free copy! (This goal was previously $9000.)\n$10,000: Video Animation\nAt $10,000, I'll have The Art of Self-Directed Learning turned into an animated whiteboard video like this one by Sir Ken Robinson and this one by Daniel Pink. The video will be uploaded to YouTube and free for all. (This goal was previously $11,000.)\n$12,000+: Book tour!\nAt $12,000 and beyond, I'll hire a publicist and do a book tour, beginning in the San Francisco Bay Area, in either the fall or winter of 2014. The more money I raise, the farther I can travel! (I'll make it a priority to visit the cities and towns where campaign backers live.)

Thanks again.\nWhat Is ScratchJr?\nScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5-7) to create their own interactive stories and games. Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves \u2013 then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.\nScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language, used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children\u2019s cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.\nWhy Are We Creating ScratchJr?\nCoding (or computer programming) is a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.\nAs young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just interact with it. In the process, children develop design and problem-solving skills that are foundational for later academic success, and they use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy.\nWith ScratchJr, children aren\u2019t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.\nWhen Will ScratchJr Be Available?\nOur long-term goal is to make ScratchJr available for free on many different platforms, so that all children everywhere will have easy access to coding with ScratchJr. Our first step is to make ScratchJr available on iPads in 2014. We have already developed and tested initial prototypes. We hope that this Kickstarter campaign (coordinated by the Code-to-Learn Foundation) will help us raise the funds we need to launch ScratchJr for iPads later this year, and start work on other platforms.\nSign up for updates about the ScratchJr release!\nWhat Are People Saying About ScratchJr?\n\"I love how much of themselves the kids can put into their creations.\" (Parent)\n\n\"My daughter always thought that she wasn't as good with technology as her brother, but ScratchJr showed her how much she was capable of.\" (Parent)\n\"ScratchJr is awesome!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun\u201d\n\u201cI love ScratchJr!\u201d\n(Kindergarten classroom students)\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool, I can make whatever I want.

They are definitely very engaged and interested in the program. I love that it requires them to do multiple steps on each page, and that carries over into other areas of their curriculum. I like that they have to think in advance what they are going to do and then test it out throughout the process.\u201d (First-grade Teacher)\n\u201cI love that there are math elements with the grid and figuring out how far to make your character move, and literacy since they are making a story in the project. I can definitely see myself using this in a regular curriculum unit.\u201d (First-grade Teacher)\n\u201cThere are a lot of skills the kids have been learning throughout the school year that have definitely been reinforced when they use ScratchJr, like problem solving, trial and error, creating directions and then following them. ScratchJr has really given them a chance to be creative and design their different projects, and it\u2019s been really great to see so many of the students learning from each other.\u201d (Second-grade Teacher)\nWho Is Creating ScratchJr?\nScratchJr is a collaboration between the DevTech research group at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development at Tufts University (led by Prof. Marina Umaschi Bers), the Lifelong Kindergarten research group at the MIT Media Lab (led by Prof. Mitchel Resnick), and the Playful Invention Company (led by Paula Bonta and Brian Silverman). The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr are created by HvingtQuatre Company, Sarah Thomson, Jillian Lombardi, and Peter Mueller. The initial development of ScratchJr has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Code-to-Learn Foundation, the LEGO Foundation, and British Telecommunications.\nThe DevTech research group at Tufts focuses on creating technologies and pedagogical approaches that take into consideration the developmental needs of young children to promote positive development. More about Marina\u2019s work and approach can be found in her books: Blocks to Robots: Learning with Technology in the Early Childhood Classroom (Teacher's College Press, 2008) and Designing Digital Experiences for Positive Youth Development: From Playpen to Playground (Oxford University Press, 2012).\nThe Lifelong Kindergarten research group at the MIT Media Lab develops new technologies and activities that, in the spirit of the blocks and fingerpaint of kindergarten, engage people in creative learning experiences. The group developed ideas and technologies underlying the LEGO Mindstorms robotics kits and Scratch programming language, used by millions of young people around the world. The group also co-founded the Computer Clubhouse, an international network of after-school centers where young people from low-income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.\nBoth Marina and Mitch were mentored and inspired by Seymour Papert, the mathematician and educational visionary who developed the Logo programming language and laid the intellectual foundations for many of today\u2019s creative learning technologies. In creating ScratchJr, Marina and Mitch are aiming to fulfill Papert\u2019s dream of a world in which all children have the opportunity to explore, experiment, and express themselves with new technologies.\nScratchJr project leaders: Marina Bers, Paula Bonta, Mitch Resnick\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always some challenges in completing a software project.

Imagine all the cool combinations you can get!\n$60,000 Stretch Goal: Everyone who has pledged $20 or more will get an extra Kickstarter Green Metallic Frame. This frame will be exclusive to Kickstarter Patrons.\n\nThe Inspiration\nWe love cars and often find ourselves surfing the internet for cool car designs, drooling over muscle cars, race cars, concept cars, toy cars, playing with our kids' cars and adding to their (or our) collections. We think and hope that a lot of you are like us and never really \"grew up\".\nOur goal was to create toy cars that are sleek, gorgeous, fun, durable, drivable, buildable and interchangeable.\nDesigned from the beginning for immersive, long lasting, hands on, open ended play. Interact with real mechanics, feel physics in action, build with tools, invent new tricks, design new car looks and color schemes, experiment with performance, create your own worlds and story lines.\nToo often a toy breaks (or the batteries die) soon after a child receives it. This is expensive for the purchaser, a waste for the environment, but most important is the pain it evokes in the kid who loves that now broken toy. Furthermore, most toys aren't much fun after the novelty wears out. At ThoughtFull Toys we believe that toys should be built to withstand hours and hours of open-ended play. \nReal metal frame, high impact plastic suspension, high grade plastic bodies, metal screws go into metal inserts that won't strip; this all adds up to a toy that should last generations of real play.  Plus, no lost screws (they\u2019re retained in their respective parts). If lost, the tool can be replaced with a standard hex-shaped Allan wrench. \nWe will also have replacement parts for all our cars, tools and accessories on our website.  We have a testing lab that we work with closely. The cars will all be tested to meet or exceed US and foreign requirements (ASTM, etc.).  The cars will be free of BPA, PVC, Phthalates, Lead and other worrisome materials.\nDrive, customize and collect! \nWe also see Modarri as a way for us and our fans to interact at different levels: \n -Register your car's unique license plate on our website to get started. \n -DIY (Do it yourself) cars you can paint and upload images of your custom paint jobs for others to see and copy. \n -Use our website to 3D print car parts in custom materials and colors. \n-We plan to post downloadable CAD files of some Modarri car parts to let you create, post and 3D print your own designs. \n -Use social media to share images of your Modarri cars, where they've been, cars they've been photographed with and to vote on images. \n -We also plan to use Facebook to allow everyone to vote on our new Modarri car designs and your uploaded CAD designs too. \nAbout Thoughtfull Toys \nWe are a small toy company based in Santa Cruz, California. Started in early 2013 by David Silverglate, creator of the Oball and Woosh, we are dedicated to creating and selling beautiful, functional, durable toys.\nDavid Silverglate has invented, patented and licensed numerous toys including Woosh Ring, SkyBlaster, and Hoopla. After working 25 years in design, engineering, toy inventing & licensing, patent & trademark preparation, and other related businesses, David decided to start his own company, Rhino Toys, in January of 2001. Rhino Toys was responsible for the development of the stunningly successful Oball product line as well as the Beebo, Stranz, Links, and SkyO lines.\nDavid sold Rhino Toys to Kids II Inc. in 2010 and worked to develop new products for them through 2012 under a management transition agreement. The products developed by David and his team are currently sold by the millions each year in all major retailers, and some are currently still under development by Kids II.  \nAlthough he could have drifted off into retirement, David wasn't done playing and wasn't done inventing. He assembled the crack team that is now Thoughtfull Toys and started cranking out new ideas and products. But this time, no more baby toys! David likes cool cars and wanted to create toys that he would enjoy. Hence Modarri.\nThroughout his 25-years as a product designer, Brian has demonstrated great skill in designing toys that reflect art, fine craftsmanship, excellent detail and above all, playability, the magic ingredient that fires the imagination and keeps kids (and adults up) past bedtime.\nBrian has designed over 200 toys including entire toy lines that have been successfully marketed and sold. He has designed for and consulted with over 50 toy companies, a veritable Who\u2019s Who of major producers, including Mattel, Hasbro, Leapfrog, Wild Planet, Cranium, Wham-O, Klutz, Fisher Price, Wowwee, Jakks Pacific, Sega, Playmates, Galoob , Tyco, Green Toys and Anki Drive. In addition to toy design, Brian has been an Adjunct Professor for the Industrial Design Department at California College of the Arts in San Francisco for over 20 years.\nBrian is lead designer for Modarri Cars.\n\u201cThis has been an incredible opportunity to design exactly the kind of toys I wanted as a kid\u201d\nTrevor is an operations specialist with 20 years of experience in managing lean profitable companies. He has worked with companies in multiple fields including Toys, Amusement Rides, Bikes, Tools, Health Care, and Education. His customers have included Rhino Toys, Kids II, Chance Morgan Coasters, Fox Racing Shox, Douglas Tool, and Lucille Packard Children\u2019s Hospital.\nTrevor brings a diverse skill set required in a start-up environment, and has brought over 100 products to market. Trevor was operations manager for Rhino Toys when David sold the company to Kids II, continued to work with David and Kids II as project engineer for 2 years, and joined ThoughtFull Toys upon its creation in early 2013 as chief operations officer.  \nYou, as an early backer of Modarri, can have confidence that this team combines vast amounts of critical experience to ensure success, from inspiration to design to manufacturing to supply and retail channels.\nDevelopment\nNot only did we think it would be fun to design great toy cars, but we took a hard look at the market and we found some open space for innovation. We wanted to create modular cars that weren't made of wood, bricks, sticks or blocks.\nEvolution of Modarri\nWhen designing Modarri, our designer, Brian Gulassa wanted to bring the elegance and maturity of full-size exotic cars into our toys. For each of our cars he drew inspiration from various areas.\nFor our first street car, the \u201cS1\u201d, Brian looked to the exotic supercar vehicles of the world, particularly that of Italian sports car companies like Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati. Our first dirt car, the \u201cX1\u201d, has roots in today\u2019s extreme endurance Baja and other custom all-terrain vehicles. Brian pulled the \u201cT1\u201d track car out of modern Le Mans racers. The cars don\u2019t stop there, take the fenders off the T1 and you have an \u201copen wheel racer\u201d put the dirt tires on the street car and you have a rally racer. Each hybrid creates a new kind of vehicle.\nBrian's Sketch of Street Car\nWe created awesome parts: Front and Rear Suspensions each with a unique stiffness and clearance for the three types of cars; Wheel Rims in different designs and colors; Tires grab the race course with treads suitable to the cars\u2019 function and with wild colors (Brian wants them tinted); unique Fenders, Frames and Hood/Windshields. All twelve parts in each car make them amazingly easy to create endless mash-ups. We wanted to make them drivable. Our kids adore finger skateboards (such as Tech Decks from Spinmaster). They fiddle with them constantly and we admire the tricks they can do with them. \nWe wanted to integrate this fun into Modarri. With our cars, one finger in the bucket seat allows for smooth driving in circles, figure-eights or just about anywhere; two fingers placed respectively, one in the car seat and on the back tail allow you to spin, kick, jump and pop wheelies. We built in performance suspension and real steering linkages to aid in your tricks. Each of the Fenders, Frames and Hood/Windshields allow for different hand positions to create new moves.  \nModarri Cars have performance, looks, modularity and tricks. We think that makes Modarri something pretty special for car lovers of all ages.\nNow all we need is you\nWe have a lot of work ahead of us in order to get Modarri to the market. \nWe have finished the overall design of the cars, made prototypes, and chosen a factory to make Modarri. \nWe have finished the tooling drawings and the factory is currently making the injection molding tools. \nWhat's Next:\n-Finish the packaging designs\n-Continue building tooling and shoot some parts before Chinese New Year. Balance of parts for making twelve working samples will be 3D printed. \n-All samples in our office by February 1st with packaging, in time to take to NY Toy Fair starting Feb. 16th\n-Finalize Tools and Start Production: February 15th - March 15th  \n-First shipments to US: April 15th\n-Ship to our Fans: May 1st\nMany of these necessary next steps are very expensive, and we need outside help to get our products off the ground. That\u2019s where you come in. \nWith your support we\u2019ll be able to:\n-Finish paying off the tooling\n-Pay for the packing design and production\n-Produce the first batches of Modarri Cars\nTHANK YOU! \nYour support is truly inspiring. Thank you for taking a leap of faith, putting your trust in us, and believing in our product as much as we do. It really means a lot. \n Sincerely, \n The ThoughtFull Toys Team\nWant to stay up to date on additional news about Modarri and ThoughtFull Toys?

We have lowered our goal requirement since we are much further along in the process of development. Meeting our goal will help us to pay for some of the balance of the tooling, the package design and our first production order.\n\n#2 The Modarri tag line is: \u201cFeel the Road\u201d and we want to live up to that expectation. Our biggest challenge is to meet David\u2019s Three Design Rules for Modarri:\n\nA) The cars must be beautiful no matter how they are assembled from any of the different car parts. \nB) The cars must feel great in one\u2019s hands no matter what parts are put together to make a car. \nC) The cars must steer, the suspension needs to work plus the body parts and chassis can't interfere with the tires in any configuration.\n\nThis is no easy challenge even for our seasoned design team and our carefully selected factory but we know we are going to succeed.\n\n#3 One of the biggest challenges most new toy companies face is finding a quality factory in China to make the toys at a competitive cost and communicating effectively to insure the product is produced correctly and on schedule. We've been to China dozens of times and have relationships with high quality factories. We've successfully executed tooling and manufacturing of hundreds of toys during our careers. At this point we have a manufacturer, a reasonable cost, a completed CAD design for the three car designs, tooling has been started on all the parts, package designs are nearly complete and we will have samples for New York Toy Fair.\n\n#4 All of our team has decades of experience bringing new toys to the market, selling them to both \"mom & pop\" and \"big box\" retailers and we create toys that sell.\n\n#5 We have a deep understanding of the toy industry, its business cycles and the key players. We are excited by the challenge of combining our vision of a unique toy car line with our toy experience and knowledge.\n\n#6 Life is a risk...we're betting on Modarri.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #43", "update_userinfo": "STRETCH REWARDS UNLOCKED!!!

We\u2019ll have tutorials for each one to show you how to play. Choose a friend to Headbutt and begin the game. The scores are broken down by accuracy and time \u2013 know the answer or don\u2019t and just guess, but just make sure you get it right faster than your opponent. Answer correctly and see how you stack up against your opponent. The game consists of 10 rounds and whoever has the most points at the end\u2026 wins.\nWins = Stats = Badges = Bragging on Facebook.  \nGame concept\nGame Concept\nHeadbutt is based around one simple idea\u2026.trivia can be entertaining, but only if it is fun. Some of us here at Squirrel Media love playing bar trivia, but we grew frustrated at how amazingly un-fun most trivia games/apps are. We set ourselves on a goal to find out if it was possible to make a trivia app that was actually fun to play. After some research, testing, and a little bit of soul-searching we came up with three key ingredients that when mixed properly help make the game we had been searching for:\nTiming is Everything\nLet\u2019s face it, Google is the best trivia player ever and anyone who possesses this power is unstoppable. The only way to stop someone from cheating is to make each question time-based, however we just couldn\u2019t see designing a regular, boring timer. We decided instead to pit players head to head. But to do that requires actually having to play live against each other, and who has the time for that? Enter asynchronous live play. Big word I know, but in a nut shell when one player challenges another, his answers and the time it takes to answer are matched against the opponent. By playing headed to head, it is important to answer questions correct, but also in less time than your friends.\nGood Questions\nThis one may seems obvious, but it\u2019s a bit tricky. You need questions that are challenging but not impossible, interesting without being obvious, and relevant enough to appeal to the masses. We don\u2019t pretend to be expert question writers here, so we have enlisted some professionals. We've made agreements with trivia hosts to get the right question database started.\nThe more support we get, the more questions we can add.\nInteractive\nTriva is the basis for almost every television game show ever made with the only major difference being how the contestants answer questions. The ones with good formats make good shows; it\u2019s that simple. We took this idea and applied it to the app. Gone are the days of the monotony of 4 multiple choices to pick from. We looked at today\u2019s smartphones with all the taps, swipes, pinches, shakes and every way else we can interact with a phone and said \u201cNow, that\u2019s how I would want to answer a question.\u201d Each game has 10 questions, each with its own \u201cinteractive mini game.\u201d We have applied all the user interface, graphics, and animation skills we have learned over the years into making lots of question types that test both your knowledge and your finger dexterity.\nThe more support we get, the more types of games we can develop.\nWe've taken the time to mix these 3 key ingredients for a great app and came up with Headbutt.\nMenu Screen Concepts\nGame Screen Concepts\n About this Squirrel guy\u2026\nSquirrel Media is an Orlando based design studio.

The machine can do a few of these things \"out of the box\", but is also made for people who want to make their own 3d printer, or candy sorting machine, or.. whatever you want. The SB-1 is made of renewable materials, but has some fancy technology under the cardboard hood, and is probably fast and accurate enough to do most of the things you would want that require sub-millimeter positioning. more\n\n\nWhat can I do with the SB-1 CNC Robot?\nThe SB-1 comes with a pen holder and stamper, so you can get started with painting, pen printing, and stamping using included parts and software. Since the machine is modular, and Arduino based, you can also make your own accessories. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\nAdd a frosting dispensor and make a robot that can frost cookies with vector graphics. \nAdd a RGB LED and time exposure camera to render pictures.\nAdd a color sensor and gripper to make a sorting machine for candy.\nAdd a fluid pump and make a drink mixing robot.\nAdd a conductive ink pen and start printing your own PCBs. \nAdd a hot wire cutter and start carving up foam using g-code.\nBelow are a couple examples of \"custom head\" starting points. These are things that could be attached to the SB-1 and controlled by the included Arduino. The frosting dispenser could be used by makers and educators to draw fancy graphics on gingerbread houses.  The foam cutter could be used by engineers and designers to rapidly create foam models with complex shapes. \nWho is the SB-1 for?\nMakers:  The SB-1 is made first and foremost for people who make things. People who are excited about process, and want to do things like paint pottery with vector graphics, pour the perfect latte art, and make the perfect cocktail from their iPad using code they helped write. Since the SB-1 is \"hackable\", it is a great base for making your own creations.\n\nEducators:  Programming for education is now accessible, but in a world of tablets and mobile devices, it is hard to keep students engaged. For teachers of STEM subjects, the SB-1 is the perfect way to take programming technologies like Scratch and Processing, and make them tangible. For teachers looking to teach physics and math, a \"make your own SB-1 accessory challenge\" can be a great way for students get engaged in hands-on engineering projects.\n\nDesigners and Engineers: If you are an engineer, the SB-1 is a \"hackable\" way to make something that moves. Buy a couple and see what you can make. Designers, want to see what your custom vector graphics look like when using your favorite markers and card stock? The SB-1 is a great way to print on everything you can't fit in a standard printer, using graphics you can make in Illustrator.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that the SB-1 will take longer than thought to manufacture.

It is made of a glue stick and roughly $10 worth of parts. When I teach workshops on technology to students, I typically start with \"ingredients\" a collection of parts, and a small example of working technology - get a light to blink, a motor to spin. This is the perfect time to ask students to finish the project with their own ideas. \"What could you make spin? Blink?\". \nA frosting dispensing mechanism is the first step, perhaps groups of four make one and share a single SB-1. Once code is the barrier of something cool happening, stand back, students will find a way (usually by asking you or google to do it for them).

The SB-1 is not a replacement for a CNC mill or router, it is not a replacement for a printer. Try to see the SB-1 as a general purpose tool for doing things that a printer or CNC couldn't do, or would otherwise be overkill with a normal CNC or printer. \n\"Why not just use a printer?\", You could, and should, but if you want to print on ceramic tiles, good luck putting them in your HP printer. Say your client wants you to do a wall mural that involves putting a complicated vector graphic on a wall of tiles. You could tell an intern to use a projector and spend hundreds of hours tracing patters on tiles, OR... you could use the SB-1 to paint each tile with paint you can fire and glaze. This process is repeatable and for $250, the SB-1 can increase your design firm's client offering without solutions that involve treating interns like robots for hire.

We\u2019re all about creating low-cost, high-quality electronics. We wanted to get electronics into people's hands and thought that using things as ubiquitous as pen and paper was just the way to do it. So we've developed a non-toxic, water-based, conductive silver ink for use in rollerball pens.  Back in 2011 we published a paper in Advanced Materials: \nPen-on-Paper Flexible Electronics Analisa Russo , Bok Yeop Ahn , Jacob J. Adams , Eric B. Duoss , Jennifer T. Bernhard , and Jennifer A. Lewis.\nPress Coverage\nOur conductive ink was named Invention of the Month by Popular Science!\nAnd a video of our brewing process was featured in Chemical and Engineering News: \nPrototype Process\nWe got a ton of emails asking if we could make the pen available commercially. So we started tinkering and sending out prototype pens to Makers.  The feedback was great! Check out what Jay Edry made with the prototype:\nTechnical Details\nCircuit Scribe\nWe've done quite a bit of development work in order to make the pen you see in the videos.  The prototype pens are Sakura Gelly Roll Metallic pens.  We clean the pens by hand and refill them with the conductive silver ink.  The ink has to be precisely tuned so that it flows just the right amount of ink in order to create a conductive circuit - otherwise it spreads into the paper too quickly or doesn't flow smoothly out of the pen.   \nThe final design of the basic Circuit Scribe pen will look similar to the prototype displayed here and in the video.  We plan to purchase the parts directly from Sakura or partner with them outright to manufacture the pens.  The quality of the pen and the reasonable price make this the ideal choice for our ink. The rollerball pen design works really well, is cost effective, and we love the utilitarian simplicity of it.  It also writes for a while (60-80 meters).  The written lines achieve a conductivity of 50-100 milliohms per square per mil.  \nComponents: \nThe final components will look very similar to the prototype components in the video & photos.  We're working with a USA based manufacturer to produce these components and get them to you on time!\n The LED component contains two different-colored LEDs, if you flip the component to change the direction of the current, the other LED will light up: \n You can add your own resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and many other components to our 2 PIN board:\nWhat would you build with Circuit Scribe?

Primary risks include:\n\nENGINEERING\n\nIn order for the pen to work very easily for the end-user, we have spent a considerable amount of time designing and optimizing the ink to work reliably in the rollerball pen. As we work with a manufacturer to take Circuit Scribe from prototype to product, we will need to ensure that the functionality and reliability of the pen are never compromised. \n\nLOGISTICS\n\nThis is perhaps the largest challenge of them all. Right now we produce the ink and load the pens on our lab, which means we have direct control over the quality of our product and our production timetables. In order to produce a large run of pens, several manufacturers must work in tandem to make this project a reality, which introduces many variables, potential complications and potential timeline setbacks. We will work directly with contract manufacturers to produce and optimize the ink, we will also work with pen manufacturers to produce and package the pens after the ink has been produced, and finally, we will work with the pen manufacturer to make sure the pens achieve the quality necessary for a finished consumer product that will write easily and reliably while producing conductive traces that dry quickly at room temperature. We already have a working relationship with the contacts listed to speed to development and manufacturing process to ensure timely delivery to our backers.

We think and hope that a lot of you are like us and never really \"grew up\". \nOur goal was to create toy cars that are sleek, gorgeous, fun, durable, drivable, buildable and interchangeable.\nModarri cars can easily be disassembled and redesigned by changing their parts. This is hands-on experimentation with real physical objects. While driving the cars around, kids learn about the physics and mechanics of suspension and steering. By swapping out parts, kids' fingers can feel the differences in performance. \nToo often a toy breaks (or the batteries die) soon after a child receives it. This is expensive for the purchaser, a waste for the environment, but most important is the pain it evokes in the kid who loves that now broken toy. Furthermore, most toys aren't much fun after the novelty wears out. \nAt ThoughtFull Toys we believe that toys should be built to withstand hours and hours of open-ended play. We have designed Modarri cars to be sturdy using a combination of metal and high strength plastics.  Plus, no screws to lose (they\u2019re retained in their respective parts). If lost, the tool can be replaced with a standard allan wrench. \nAbout Thoughtfull Toys\nWe are a small toy company based in Santa Cruz, California. Started in early 2013 by David Silverglate, creator of the Oball and Woosh, we are dedicated to creating and selling beautiful, functional, durable toys.\nThe Team\n  David Silverglate has invented, patented and licensed numerous toys including Woosh Ring, SkyBlaster, and Hoopla. After working 25 years in design, engineering, toy inventing & licensing, patent & trademark preparation, and other related businesses, David decided to start his own company, Rhino Toys, in January of 2001. Rhino Toys was responsible for the development of the stunningly successful Oball product line as well as the Beebo, Stranz, Links, and SkyO lines. \n\nDavid sold Rhino Toys to Kids II Inc. in 2010 and worked to develop new products for them through 2012 under a management transition agreement.  The products developed by David and his team are currently sold by the millions each year in all major retailers, and some are currently still under development by Kids II.\n\nAlthough he could have drifted off into retirement, David wasn't done playing and wasn't done inventing. He assembled the crack team that is now Thoughtfull Toys and started cranking out new ideas and products. But this time, no more baby toys! David likes cool cars and wanted to create toys that he would enjoy. Hence Modarri.\nThroughout his 25-years as a product designer, Brian has demonstrated great skill in designing toys that reflect art, fine craftsmanship, excellent detail and above all, playability, the magic ingredient that fires the imagination and keeps kids (and adults up) past bedtime.\nBrian has designed over 200 toys including entire toy lines that have been successfully marketed and sold. He has designed for and consulted with over 50 toy companies, a veritable Who\u2019s Who of major producers, including Mattel, Hasbro, Leapfrog, Wild Planet, Cranium, Wham-O, Klutz, Fisher Price, Wowwee, Jakks Pacific, Sega, Playmates, Galoob , Tyco, Green Toys and Anki Drive.

We wanted to create modular cars that weren't made of wood, bricks, sticks or blocks.\nEvolution of Modarri\nBrian's Sketch of Street Car\nWhen designing Modarri, our designer, Brian Gulassa wanted to bring the elegance and maturity of full-size exotic cars into our toys. For each of our cars he drew inspiration from various areas.\nFor our first street car, the \u201cS1\u201d, Brian looked to the exotic supercar vehicles of the world, particularly that of Italian sports car companies like Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati. Our first dirt car, the \u201cX1\u201d, has roots in today\u2019s extreme endurance Baja and other custom all-terrain vehicles. Brian pulled the \u201cT1\u201d track car out of modern Le Mans racers. The cars don\u2019t stop there, take the fenders off the T1 and you have an \u201copen wheel racer\u201d put the dirt tires on the street car and you have a rally racer. Each hybrid creates a new kind of vehicle.\nWe created awesome parts: Front and Rear Suspensions each with a unique stiffness and clearance for the three types of cars; Wheel Rims in different designs and colors; Tires grab the race course with treads suitable to the cars\u2019 function and with wild colors (Brian wants them tinted); unique Fenders, Frames and Hood/Windshields. All twelve parts in each car make them amazingly easy to create endless mash-ups. \nWe wanted to make them drivable. Our kids adore finger skateboards (such as Tech Decks from Spinmaster). They fiddle with them constantly and we admire the tricks they can do with them. We wanted to integrate this fun into Modarri. With our cars, one finger in the bucket seat allows for smooth driving in circles, figure-eights or just about anywhere; two fingers placed respectively, one in the car seat and on the back tail allow you to spin, kick, jump and pop wheelies. We built in performance suspension and real steering linkages to aid in your tricks. Each of the Fenders, Frames and Hood/Windshields allow for different hand positions to create new moves.\n\nModarri Cars have performance, looks, modularity and tricks. We think that makes Modarri something pretty special for car lovers of all ages.\n\nThese are our rewards:  \nBesides the joy of helping to make Modarri a reality, you'll also receive the following rewards for your support (see images below too):\n$5           Facebook and Webpage \"Thank you\"\n$10         Modarri Stickers designed by Brian\n$20        Early Bird savings on One Modarri \"S1\" Street Car (100 Avail.)\n$23         Grey Modarri DIY (Do-It-Yourself Car) \"S1\" Street Car.

Our biggest challenge is to meet David\u2019s Three Design Rules for Modarri: \n\n1) The cars must be beautiful no matter how they are assembled from any of the different car parts.\n2) The cars must feel great in one\u2019s hands no matter what parts are put together to make a car.\n3) The cars must steer, the suspension needs to work plus the body parts and chassis can't interfere with the tires in any configuration.\n\nThis is no easy challenge even for our seasoned design team and our carefully selected factory but we know we are going to succeed.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges most new toy companies face is finding a quality factory in China to make the toys at a competitive cost and communicating effectively to insure the product is produced correctly and on schedule. We've been to China dozens of times and have relationships with high quality factories. We've successfully executed tooling and manufacturing of hundreds of toys during our careers. \n\nWe also have experience bringing new toys to the market, selling them to \"mom & pop\" and \"big box\" retailers and creating toys that sell.\n\nWe have a deep understanding of the toy industry, its business cycles and the key players.

When plugged in to a computer, the VERVE behaves like a standard keyboard and mouse. Plug in any sensor (light, force, motion), and suddenly you're controlling the computer by squeezing, waving, pressing, dancing... You get the idea? You have complete control over how to interpret the sensor information and convert it into meaningful keystrokes or mouse actions to control your favorite application or video game. Everything is easy to use and no coding is required.\nThe standard VERVE kit comes with a VERVE unit, seven useful sensors (adventurous users can make their own--we'll show you how), two banana clips for the touch sensor, seven cables to connect the sensors to the VERVE unit, 5 extension blocks, and a USB cable to connect to your computer. The VERVE unit comes with an App that makes it easy to configure the sensors, as well as a \u201cquick start\u201d guide that contains step by step examples on how to use the system. Once you configure the sensors for your application, *no software is needed*. The VERVE will work with ANY device or software that accepts keyboard and mouse, including Macs, PC, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc. Furthermore, the sensors settings are stored as a human readable text file to share with friends. \nBeginners can control any game or app (including web pages); techie's are free to write their own apps. Our goal is to have you playing with sensors and controlling your computer within minutes after opening the kit. Anyone can use the VERVE. Below, one of our first inventors shares her project with you.\nPLAY\n\nVelostat touch pad: You may have wondered what that black material was in the \u201cGigantic game controller\u201d application. It\u2019s called Velostat and it enables you to make some really cool touch pads. Simply cut the Velostat into any shape and size and connect it to the touch sensor via alligator clip.\nBelow is a short video for the inner musician in all of us. For this application we used a touch sensor connected to Velostat, a light sensor, and a motion sensor (to detect jumping). We used http://www.buttonbass.com/Drums1.html to turn the keyboard commands into drums. \nPLAY\n\nWho is it for?\nThe VERVE is four things in one. First, it is a recreational gadget that allows you to have lots of fun playing with your computer in new ways. Second, it is a DIY (do-it-yourself) kit for students and inventors to prototype or build new technical solutions to problems. Third, it is an educational product for budding engineers and scientists to learn about science, sensors, controls, computers, and technology. Finally, it is a new kind of creative medium. This kind of \u201cphysical computing\u201d device empowers artists and creators of all kinds to explore new ways to delight and share our humanity in ways beyond traditional forms of artistry. We can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll do with it!\nFun \nSince when did it make sense to control a video game with a mouse? Why not play a baseball game with a baseball bat? With VERVE it\u2019s easy. Attach a sensor to your favorite sports toy and use VERVE to translate your activity into game controls. With VERVE, people come up with all kinds of amazing ways to play their games: Jumping, swinging, slapping, and even touching hands.\nPractical\nThe VERVE lets you try out ideas quickly and prototype new systems. VERVE can be as serious as you want. The same easy-to-use interface allows you precision control of the sensitivity of your sensors and up to 10 actions per sensor channel. In minutes, you can set up a system that tracks your movements, detects a burglar, or even monitors a factory. Almost any kind of sensor works with VERVE, so there\u2019s no reason not to think big.\nEducational\nThe VERVE dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for learning about physical computing systems. Even elementary school children can use sensors, control computers, design technology, and measure the world without the need for a degree in electrical engineering. The VERVE experience builds intuition about sensors and computing systems, and generates excitement about technology from the start. An educational pack, prepared by award winning educators and scientists, is available for teachers, complete with lesson plans and projects designed to teach children about science and technology in a way that is natural and fun.\nCreative\nMany artists are discovering that technology is the new medium for creative expression. But getting to use that medium has traditionally required the artist to face formidable technical obstacles. The VERVE changes that. With the VERVE, artists can produce incredible multimedia experiences that connect with people through touch, movement, sound, and interaction\u2014all without having to write code or configure computers.\nMeet the sensors\nAll of our sensors are designed to be easy to use, right out of the box. Plug in a cable (provided) and the sensor is ready to go. We\u2019ve picked the most useful and fun sensors for you. But we\u2019re adding more all the time, so you should be able to find a sensor to fit your needs.\nHow does it work?\nFirst, plug your VERVE into your favorite computer\u2019s USB slot, then pick a sensor and plug it to one of the seven sensor slots on the VERVE. The VERVE kit comes with seven useful sensors ready to go and you can order more from our website. \nSecond, open the up VERVE application and see how each sensor responds in real-time. This comes preinstalled on the VERVE device.\n  Third, choose what you want your sensor to do. You can make each sensor look like any keyboard or mouse action. Simply move the bars on each sensor channel to set a threshold. Then click on the area above or below the threshold bar to choose your keyboard or mouse event.\nAnd that\u2019s it!\n......But I want more power! Alright, you got it.\nSimply click on the individual sensor tab and you\u2019ll find more advanced mappings options. Here you can increase the sensitivity of each sensor, assign up to 10 keyboard/mouse commands, and tell the computer how fast/slow you want each action to happen.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe think Kickstarter is the ideal place to launch this product. Kickstarters are our kind of people--forward looking, tech savvy, doers who aren\u2019t content to wait around for things to happen by themselves. VERVE is an idea whose time has come. We need Kickstarters to help us get our product into production, thereby enabling a generation of technical and creative people to make awesome technology and creative projects. If we hit our funding target then we can afford to build the devices at costs low enough to be affordable enough to put these devices in the hands of anyone who wants one \u2013 and in time for the holidays!\n\nOur Story\nThe VERVE project started at the University of California Irvine as a research project in exergaming systems for health applications. Under the guidance of Professor Mark Bachman, then-UCI students Nizan Friedman and Jordan Linford developed sensors and games for exercise bicycles, treadmills, ellipticals, and other equipment. However, the in-house games just didn\u2019t seem to match the quality and fun of commercially available games, and the team felt disappointed in the results of their effort. Eventually, the team moved its attention to using commercial and open-source games with beautiful graphics and immersive gameplay. To accomplish this, at first the team simply hacked a game controller (which worked great). However, it quickly became evident that a dedicated electronic unit that could map sensor inputs to game controls was a far better solution. The team spent many months developing the first prototype on a breadboard.\nVERVE V1: Early breadboard prototype of the VERVE. This unit could map sensors to computer controls. However, it was not easy to configure by non-experts, did not use a standard sensor interface, and was not suitable for widespread use.\nOver the course of 18 months, the team improved the design, started getting printed circuits made professionally, and made the system capable of saving configuration files on an SD card, so that sensor settings could be saved.\nVERVE V2: This PCB prototype was much more robust than the breadboard. However, this unit still required custom sensor development and did not allow for an easy way to map sensor inputs to computer controls.\nThe unit was a great success--any kind of exergame could be created to match any kind of gameplay. These units are now used in several exergaming projects at UCI and other institutions.\nJordan demonstrates an early version of the VERVE on standard exercise equipment at UCI. This unit showed the promise of a user-programmable device for mapping sensors to game inputs.\nAfter Nizan and Jordan graduated, the team felt that it would be a great idea to convert this project into a commercial product that could be made affordable and easy to use. With this in mind, the team developed the VERVE, a device that can be mass manufactured, has internal storage, can fit in an enclosure, and accepts seven standard 3.5 mm jacks for sensor input. In addition, the team developed pre-calibrated, plug-and-play sensors designed to be easy to use with the VERVE unit.\nVersion 4: After four design cycles, the VERVE is ready for production. It is robust and easily connects to sensors. The unit can be controlled and updated from any Mac or PC. The circuit board is housed in a portable and attractive aluminum enclosure.\nThe team also developed a beta version of a user interface software that makes mapping from sensor inputs to computer controls a breeze. With these changes to the initial designs intended for research, the team feels that it has made the project accessible and affordable for everyone to use.\nThe project cannot continue without funding. The team still has to complete software development for a bulletproof user experience, get professional enclosures produced, manufacture the units in large quantities, and package everything together. However, the project is mature enough that most of the headaches usually associated with developing a new project are taken care of.\nProduction and Fulfillment plan:\nWe want to be perfectly transparent with you every step of the way. Here\u2019s some information on how we will be turning this product from an idea to a product that you can hold in your hands.\nProduction and fulfillment will be handled in a three step process.\nStep 1: Manufacturing: Printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication, PCB population, enclosure manufacturing, and packaging will all be handled through NOA Labs. This manufacturing firm has a proven track record. They have worked with giants such as BMW and Airbus as well as countless small businesses and start-ups. To personally vet the company, we purchased an initial sample run of printed circuit boards and enclosures (shown in VERVE V4 picture). The company is ready to produce up to 50,000 units per month and quoted us a lead time of 10-12 days for production. Shipment will take another 3-5 days. In parallel, we will order the colorful sensor cables, the cable extenders, and the mini-USB cables from a trusted electronics supplier. We received initial sample units of all these components from this supplier and they too are ready to ship at a moment\u2019s notice. Their quoted lead time is 5-7 days with another 3-5 days for shipment. The second you help us hit our funding goal we will begin this process.\nStep 2: Assembly. We will begin assembly the same day the units arrive from both NOA labs and our electronics supplier. We will program the microcontrollers, add the VERVE software to the flash memory located on the PCB, and test each sensor, board, and cable to make sure that everything works perfectly. We then package this item in the supplied retail box. We already have 10 people signed up to help us out with this step. This process is expected to take between 3-5 days depending on the number of orders.\nStep 3: Fulfillment. We partnered with a local fulfillment center that is ready to ship out all the units. This process will take 1-2 days. It will take an additional 3-5 days for UPS to get the item to your door.\nWe will push as hard as humanly possible to get this item to you before December 21st. If we hit our funding goal before the end of the Kickstarter campaign, this will greatly improve the chances of us reaching this deadline.\n Who you're funding\nThe inXus Interactive team consists of Mark Bachman (left), Nizan Friedman (middle), and Jordan Linford (right).

We aspire to help children develop skills in the areas they are truly interested in, abilities that would allow them to pursue on their own goals and achieve their own vision. \nOur Project: \n For the past year, we have been partnered with a fantastic hackerspace, but our programs have been so popular that we\u2019ve outgrown the space. We have signed a lease on a great location in Oakland and will be adding to the city's ever growing and industrious Maker culture! \n In Oakland alone, we have an average of 70-90 kids every Open Lab. We currently have one Guild running, with over 70 kids on the wait list. We need to open at least three more Guilds to serve this need! We also have a full wait list already for our new Sparks program and schools lined up for our outreach programs. \n We are working with partners in our community, such as The Workshop for Young Engineers, who will be running engineering and technology classes for kids in our space, the Crafty Avenger, who will be adding amazing sewing and e-textile workshops to our programming, Young Makers for mentoring Faire projects and The Maker Education Initiative to support educators in integrating STEAM and making into community programs and schools. \nTogether, we are creating an Oakland Lab that is both practical and exciting! This space is significant and we need your help! As the Hacker Scouts National Headquarters it will serve more than the Bay Area. Programs and activities designed by Hacker Scouts, as well as our partners, are often prototyped and tested in Oakland and released open source to benefit the global making community.\n If funded your support will give our families access to equipment such as 3D printers and laser cutters and fund low cost classes in everything from robotics to woodworking to programming, and together we will fulfill a larger mission of providing a new kind of education to as many kids as we can. \n This will be a place to educate teachers and mentors so they can join us in our work to create a generation of creative innovators who know how to build with their hands, adapt new technology, and value sustainability. We are building a place for kids and their families to experiment, ask questions, build confidence, think big and create BIG. \n Our Budget: So what do we need to make this happen? Here's how we have come up with our target goal: \n We are seeking to develop new programs and badges, support initiatives of affordability and accessibility, and assist us in the collaborative work we do with community partners at local and national levels. Materials and prototype costs: $9500 \n Equipment and technology (soldering irons, laser cutter, 3D printer, woodshop, textile and electronics lab, projector for classes, laptops,etc): $19,000 \n Space improvements, furniture, and code compliance, including venting for laser cutter $6500 \n This will give us a great start in serving our communities, both locally and nationally! \n Thank you for your support! The Hacker Scouts Team, Leaders, Volunteers, and Families.\nBiospheres!\nOur Programs: A variety of experts and mentors from the community ensure a well rounded and high level of attention and skill building for all ages through accessible programs that meet the different needs of our young makers. Hacker Scouts provides open source material and a support program for Hacker Scout programs globally. We currently have over 30 programs running nationally, and are expanding internationally this fall. \n\n Our current programs include: \n\nOpen Lab: Public, all ages workshop designed to expose kids to new skills and concepts while promoting family and community engagement. \n\nGuild: A weekly membership based program for kids 8 through teens that supports building knowledge and skills through self-direction and mentorship. Includes our foundation project, the Hackerling Circuit, and an extensive offering of Badges that allow kids to pursue their own interests and goals. \n\n Sparks: A weekly membership based program for kids ages 4 through 7 that explores concepts and skills and encourages independent thinking.\n \nMore about the rewards:\nStickers, badges and tshirts all feature our Hacker Scouts robot logo on a black background. They really stand out!\n\nThe mold-making class will include the fundamentals of moldmaking using milled metal casting plates and produce plastic robot heads (the robot on our logo) that have an LED light inside, when you insert a battery- they light up! If you also want you child to participate in the mold-making class, let us know!\n\nThe VIP Open Lab will include at least 3 activities and covers the materials for one person for each of those activities. You can bring up to 4 people to learn new concepts and skills!\n\nThe Hackerling Circuit is our foundational Guild project. It includes all the components (board, Arduino, enclosure, etc) to make your very own!\n\nThe private class on a skill or tool will include sewing, laser cutter, CNC, soldering, and 3D printing. You choose, we teach!\n\nThe Hackerling Circuit private class includes a Hackerling Circuit for you and a friend and guided instruction on building your own Arduino, from soldering to programming to making a custom enclosure on the laser cutter!\n\nBirthday Party/Workshop will be held at the new Oakland space and we will give you a choice of activities.\n\nThe VIP Dinner will be held in Oakland, and the date will be determined by the availability of our guests, most likely in the new year. Join us for an amazing evening with prominent inventors, entrepreneurs, and enthusiastic Makers!\n\nFinally, our highest reward gets you a Founder, who will fly out and personally teach a workshop (we will decide together on the subject)! This includes domestic travel costs. We are willing to travel internationally, but will need those extra costs covered. \nThanks again for your support!

There will be no vocal acrobatics, no virtuosic solos, no cheese, and no chimes. Just kickass old songs, simply arranged, simply performed, and simply produced. \nIf you are a jazz geek, though, I won't hold it against you. I'm as geeky as they come. I'm looking to make a record that we geeks can take home and listen to with our mothers, our grandmothers, and even our indie-band loving hipster siblings. \nThe Songs\nHere are samples of a couple songs that will be featured on this album. These demos feature only vocals and piano, but the real album will feature a quartet or quintet. To hear (and even download) the complete demos, become a backer!\nDo You Know What it Means to Miss New Orleans? By Eddie DeLange and Louis Alter:\n Two Sleepy People by Hoagy Carmichael:\nAnd here's a complete version of Sweet Lorraine, by Cliff Burwell and Mitchell Parish (accompanied by me myself and I):\nThe Money\nI'm starting out asking for $29,000. What I need to complete the project is $34,000. To realize my ultimate vision for the project (which includes hiring some big-name jazz legends, and a publicity team for the album release), I need $40,000-$50,000. To take the whole show on the road, I need $50,000-$60,000. For more deets on the budget, scroll to the bottom of the page (\"The Boring Part\").\nThe Inspiration\nI got this crazy idea into my head when someone hooked me up with the record Louis Armstrong Meets Oscar Peterson. This is a classic, simple, sweet record. It also happens to be utterly, mindbogglingly gorgeous, from the first track to the last. After a few listens, I couldn't help but think, \"Why doesn't anybody make records like this anymore?\"\nFor about a million years, I've been obsessed with the recordings of the Nat King Cole Trio, Billie Holiday with Teddy Wilson, and early Chet Baker. What all of these recordings have in common is that they are heavily song-focused. The emphasis is on the lyrics and melodies, and the players are subtle, sensitive and restrained. The tracks are short and to-the-point. The vocalists (who are among my all-time favorites) sing simply and straightforwardly, sticking close to the melody. They sing with plenty of emotion, but they are restrained, so they come across as honest, rather than theatrical.\nMy aim is to make a record that can hold its own with these heavy-hitters, proudly stacked between Chet Baker and Nat Cole.\nThe Nerve\nYou might be thinking to yourself, okay, sure, but there are probably lots of people out there who are qualified to make this record. What makes you so special? \nTo that I have two answers.\n1) I'm not a jazz singer.\nJazz has changed since the 1940s. Somewhere in the progression from swing to bebop to modern and fusion and whathaveyou, the song started to get lost. The favor in jazz has moved away from the song and towards the player - there's a lot of emphasis on smart, impressive, and virtuosic playing, and not as much emphasis on recognizable melodies and memorable lyrics. \nThus, a lot of modern jazz singers will blow your mind with amazing vocal acrobatics and clever note choices. I can't do that, and that's not the sort of record I'm making. \nWhat I can and will do is sing the sh*t out of each song, like I mean it. Like I have something important to tell you, and I want you to understand it. I'll do my very best to get out of the way of these beautiful songs, and let them smack you around themselves.\n2) I'm a songwriter.\nInstead of keeping up with the Joneses in the jazz vocal realm, I've spent my life up to this point thinking about and writing songs. Songs take up at least 75% of my brain power (I think this is why I'm always losing things, and have bruises all over my shins).\nAnd I'm a darn good songwriter. Sometimes I get to open for big-shot songwriting legends, like Paul Simon. Sometimes these guys even say incredibly nice things about me, like \"Carsie Blanton is up at the top of my list... great songs, singing and presentation.\" (Loudon Wainwright III), or \"Carsie Blanton is a rare talent as a modern songwriter... reminds me of a female Cole Porter.\" (John Oates). Or, my personal favorite, \"Carsie's lyrics are an iron fist in the velvet glove of her voice.\" (Peter Mulvey).\nBecause I am a bona fide songologist, I believe I have a bit of an edge in the song choice department. I can promise you, I've chosen well. (Curious? Become a backer. Song choice will be revealed via Backer Updates over the course of this campaign.)\nThe Team\n*Campaign Video By Robin Walker: theladyrobin@gmail, with sound engineering by Russell Welch. Campaign photo by Bobby Bonsey.*\nJohn Porter will be producing this record. John was born in England, and came to New Orleans after a long stint in Los Angeles. He is a Big Fancypants producer of blues, rock and Americana. He hasn't worked on many jazz records, and I consider that an asset (see I'm not a jazz singer). Instead, he's worked on the records of Taj Mahal, Buddy Guy, Keb Mo, B.B. King, Los Lonely Boys, Steven Stills, The Smiths, and Elvis Costello (swoon). Ten of those records won Grammys. \nDavid Torkanowsky (\"Tork\") will be arranging and playing on this record. Tork is a pianist, composer and producer who was born and raised in New Orleans. He's worked with tons of great artists (Al Jarreau, Irma Thomas, Solomon Burke, Maria Muldaur, Dianne Reeves, etc etc etc), and is a brilliant and tasteful player. \nA Bunch Of Other Famous Guys who we Have To Keep Secret For Now. Suffice it to say that the majority of the tracks will feature a tasteful small combo including bass, drums, piano, and the occasional guitar and/or trumpet.\nThe Boring Part\nThe problem with Big Fancypants people is that they want to be PAID for their TIME. It's crazy! This record is going to cost a bit more than my previous ones because this kind of project requires some expensive talent. I am committed to hiring the Fancypantses, because I know they can make something worthy of that aforementioned spot in the record-stack. \nHere is a graph that tells you two things about the budget. 1) Personnel and studio costs are more than half the budget. 2) I am not asking for enough money to cover fun extras, like promoting this record so that people (other than you and I) actually get to hear it. \n\"Recording Costs\" include:\n- Paying the Producer, arranger, engineers, and the musicians who play on the record. \n- Paying for studio time. \n- Paying for mixing and mastering the album.\n\"Manufacturing Costs\" include:\n- Printing 2,000 copies of the CD and 500 copies of the vinyl record. \n- Paying Lauren J. Andrews (my artistic director for Idiot Heart, and the director of 'Backbone', 'Backseat' and soon-to-be-released 'Smoke Alarm' music videos) to create cover art and merchandise for the album release & backer rewards.\n\"Kickstarter Fees & Reward Fulfillment\" include:\n- Kickstarter takes a 5% fee from the funds collected.\n- Amazon payments takes another 3-5% for credit card processing.\n- My estimated printing and mailing expenses for Kickstarter rewards (excluding shipments outside the US, to which a shipping fee is added).\n- A small budget for the airfare required for some rewards (\"small\" because I have loads of air miles which I plan to deploy.)\nIf all goes according to plan, this album will be funded by the end of August, and we'll be in the studio in September. If not, we go to plan B: beg a label to fund the record, even if they require a sliver of my soul and the heart of my firstborn. (This would be bad. Don't make me do it.)\nMeeting the project goal will guarantee that the album gets recorded, printed, and sent to you. But, I already have \"stretch goals\" planned, in case you completely blow my mind and we meet our goal before our 30 days are up. Meeting the goal early will allow me to unveil my super-top-secret stretch rewards, and raise the money to fund additional goals like hiring a publicist for the album release, making a couple of music videos, and hiring one or two more of the amazing jazz legends who hang around New Orleans. \nThe Rewards\nDig this amazing paper doll (this is just the mockup), illustrated by Lauren J. Andrews! You'll get your very own with every pledge of $75 or more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLicensing fees! I've never released a recording of a cover song before, so this is new territory for me. There are online services that allow an artist to pay a one-time fee for each cover they release. If I were to pay this licensing fee for all the songs up-front (covering each copy of the album that gets printed, before it gets sold), it would cost around $2,500. My current plan is to pay as I go, meaning, for each album sold, some percentage will go towards licensing fees. If we reach our project goal early, I may add licensing fees as a stretch goal so that I can pay for everything up front.\n\nMy main challenge, as an artist, is keeping my head on straight. It's hard for me to remember to bring my keys when I leave the house, let alone meet deadlines that are months in the future. It will be a challenge for me to stay organized enough to print, package and deliver everything on time. That's why I'm planning to hire an intern (probably through Craigslist, which I've had success with before) for a limited period surrounding the album release. The ad will read: \"Seeking incredibly organized intern who ACTUALLY LIKES going to the post office, for short-term employment in the GLAMOUROUS MUSIC BIZ.\"\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "I'm making another album!", "update_content": "Hello, friends from long ago!\nThe \"Jazz is for Everybody\" Kickstarter was funded more than 7 years ago.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), built in. The BLEduino is both hardware and software compatible with Arduino since it\u2019s based on the Arduino Leonardo. Anything that runs on an Arduino will run on a BLEduino.  It's the easiest way to get Bluetooth 4.0 in your project! Control anything from your phone!\nFull Arduino Shield Compatibility\nWe wanted the BLEduino to be small enough to be used in any project, but not if that meant you'd lose the ability to use all your awesome Arduino shields.  For this reason, we created the Shield-Shield. The Shield-Shield is a handy attachment that translates the BLEduino\u2019s pin layout into the traditional Arduino layout. That is, it makes the BLEduino fully Arduino shield compatible. Note, we've noticed a trend of boards stating they are compatible with all Arduino Shields when they actually aren't.  For a board to be fully compatible you would need it to support both the old Arduino UNO pin layout and the new Arduino Leonardo pin layout.  Not only that, the boards would have to support 5V logic (which we do). The layout problem is solved by our Shield-Shield by allowing you to switch between the old and new pin layout by just flipping a switch.  In other words, the same Shield-Shield is basically backwards and forwards compatible, allowing it to work with nearly all Arduino shields.  C'mon, you know that\u2019s pretty awesome.\nModular and Compact\nThe BLEduino is great for prototyping! It\u2019s breadboard compatible, tiny enough to fit in any enclosure, and compatible with standard shields when you need it to be.\nEase of Use\nThe BLEduino works for everyone. Not an expert in iPhone or Arduino development? No problem! Simply use our free iPhone application and/or our pre-made Arduino sketches (that use our included BLE arduino library) and you\u2019re good to go!  Our iPhone app is also fully open source and broken up into modules so you\u2019re free to take what you need and ignore the rest if you want to develop your own app. There is no limit to what you can create and we're super excited to see what you build with it.\nAndroid Support\nSadly, Android does not have official support for Bluetooth 4.0.  However, it is our top priority to provide the BLEduino app to Android phones once support is established. It's been announced that the next version of Android will include support so you can expect the app shortly after the SDK gets released.  Rest assured, support is coming.\nOpen Source\nOpen source goodness.  The BLEduino is 100% open source in every way.  The iPhone app, the schematics / pcbs, and all the firmware will be released to the community once we\u2019re done with the development.\nWhy did we create the BLEduino?\nWe love creating smart and connected devices.  While tinkering away one day, we realized that getting Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) to work with existing projects wasn\u2019t exactly lollipops and sunshine.  So we decided to abstract all that nasty low level stuff, make a simple to use iPhone app, and bundle it all up in an Arduino-compatible board that the world could use.\nWhat can I do with the BLEduino?\nAll sorts of things!  That\u2019s the beauty of it! In particular, since it's based on the Arduino Leonardo you can do keyboard and mouse emulation, a feature that's uncommon on other boards. Here are a few examples of things you can do with the BLEduino (all of these are live in our video):\nHere are a few unique ones to BLEduino:\nThese are just a few of the awesome things you can build with the BLEduino.  Also, BLEduinos can communicate with each other via a hub (your phone or computer) enabling even more complex scenarios.

We started out using a third party BLE module but quickly moved on to our second design, which includes our own BLE module, a change that lowered the cost dramatically. Our third and final version will be smaller, sexier, and much more polished!\nThe Shield-Shield has also gone through some evolving with one last design in the production.  The final version will allow you to switch the Shield-Shield between old and new pin layout.  (More info in the FAQ)\nWe want our iOS application to be a living example of what easy Bluetooth integration should be. For this reason we are taking extra care in making sure our app is optimized and easy to understand, that means there is still work to be done.  We are always adding things to the BLEduino so you can expect to see some additional modes and features.\nProject Timeline\nThe following is our estimated timeline (all in 2013):\nJune - Finalize design details of the BLEduino and iOS application.\nJuly - Testing of both the BLEduino and iOS application and iterate if necessary.\nAug - Release source code for the application and BLEduino designs.\nSept - Test small pre-release batch of the BLEduino and order Final production run.\nOct - Packaging and quality assurance.\nNov - Fulfillment to backers.\nThe Team\nWe're a team of engineers, designers, and doers who build things that incorporate hardware, software, or both. We created the BLEduino because we wanted to simplify Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) development and enable easy communication with smartphones. Our team: \nJonathan.  Pixel lover & leader of the pack. Co-founder, designer, and CEO.  Loves to talk about the pixels and the \"essence\" of things.  Completely obsessed with the BLEduino and is occasionally caught staring at it for long periods of time.\nRamon.  iOS terminator & back-end conquistador.  Co-founder, developer, and customer development evangelist. Kickstarter junkie. Loves to talk about startups, tech, and everything in between. \nAngel.  Hardware extraordinaire & human SMD machine.  Co-founder, hardware engineer, and front-end developer. Loves to talk about how insanely tiny our components are and how he hand soldered that one component you can barely see.\nThank you!\nWe hope you're as excited about the BLEduino as we are and can't wait to get easy Bluetooth 4.0 to everyone in the world!\nAlso, we'd like to give a special thanks to EngiWorks, the awesome folk that have been giving us office space since our inception.\nIf you'd like to know a little bit more about our story and why we're doing this, read the following Forbes article where we're featured:\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/giovannirodriguez/2013/06/25/will-the-hardware-rennaisance-come-to-puerto-rico/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs expected with any project, there are risks and challenges in delivering the BLEduino. First of all, we\u2019re still working on finalizing our design. That means some issues may still arise, however unlikely that may be. Most of the \u201cbig\u201d issues have been tackled but there is still much to do when it comes to validating the stability.\n\nMoreover, testing takes time, and we don\u2019t have a local way to produce PCB boards. Hence, having to wait almost two weeks for new boards means we always have to plan with that in mind and we would be lying if we said that wasn\u2019t a challenge.\n\nLastly, we have partnered up with a great manufacturer and have taken into account the extra costs necessary to cover manufacturing risks (e.g. sourcing, delays).

The first chapters are a comprehensive history of an institution so universal it garners 147,000,000 results in a Google search while its roots in early 19th century nature study are barely known today. While the final sections delve into the profound influence of kindergarten's design-based techniques and play-driven pedagogy on the development of 20th century abstract art and modern architecture.\nThe second kindergarten play-gift\nKindergarten, the \"garden of children,\" invented in 1837 as the first pre-school by German crystal scientist, Friedrich Froebel, was a means to teach little children about their place in the universe, and how nature designs. With music, dancing, gardening, nature walks, and play with a series of geometric toys Froebel called \"gifts,\" children learned basic lessons in rhythm, symmetry, unity, creativity, interconnectedness, and self direction.

If we hit $120,000 in funding, we\u2019ll create a graphical user interface for authoring your own light sequences, and associating them with trigger events from our personality modules.\nFor example, Clyde\u2019s \u201cAfraid of the Dark\u201d module triggers a sunset sequence when you turn the lights off. But what if you want him to just glow yellow until you turn him off? Or flash pink for five minutes? Our authoring software would allow you to create these new behaviors by simply dragging and dropping sequences of colors, with no programming required.\nWe\u2019d expect this authoring software to ship in March 2014, as an upgrade to Clyde.\n$150K: Clyde gets an internal clock\nClyde reacts to his environment, but wouldn\u2019t it be awesome if he could respond to the time of day? If we hit the $150,000 reward level, we\u2019ll embed clock software into Clyde along with easy-to-use authoring software for time-based behaviors. Here are a few things this would enable you to do (even if you don\u2019t want to program):\n\u2022 Make Clyde chime every hour, half hour, or 15 minutes.\n\u2022 Make Clyde turn on automatically when you want to wake up in the morning.\n\u2022 Make Clyde shine in different colors depending on the time of day.\nWe\u2019d expect this software to ship in May 2014, as an upgrade to Clyde.\nMeet Clyde\nHe\u2019s a kind of a character. Clyde is a versatile, expressive lamp that\u2019s made to be tinkered with. Here\u2019s what he\u2019s got going for him:\nUnique, organic design, crafted from high-quality materials.\nHigh-intensity, energy-efficient LED task lighting. At about 6W, our LEDs output more light than a 40W incandescent.\nSoft, colorful ambient lighting.\nPoint him where you want: Bendy legs can rest on or hang off of almost anything.\nYou decide: add \"personality modules\" to make Clyde react to his environment in different ways.\nArduino compatible and easy to program to do whatever you want.\n\n\n\nClyde is the first offering from Fabule Fabrications.\nIn the Press\n\"Williams told Mashable that since expressiveness makes people feel strongly about their things at home, she believes 'it's important for people to be able to adapt that expressiveness to their own taste.' That's reflected in Clyde's different levels of customization.\"\n\"Clyde\u2019s makers, Fabule, were among the standouts from a largely impressive group of startups, considering few were little more than an idea just 15 weeks ago... Fabule\u2019s Amanda Williams said that she wanted to create an object that was \u201cnot just smart but expressive and delightful\u201d. It\u2019s a nice contrast to the more staid, robotic spins on the smart home.\"\n\n\"Clyde is a hackable, customizable desk lamp designed for both utility and creative expressiveness. He is hopefully the first in a line of objects for everyday life that are accountable to their end user, encouraging hacking, modding, and personalizing.\"\n\n\"many people want more warmth, welcome, and creativity from their smart devices and Clyde\u2019s \u201cdelightful and quirky\u201d personality make him a pleasant addition to any home.\"\n\n\"Clyde is an Arduino-compatible, expressive lamp that looks like a fun way to experiment and get creative with hacking your physical environment\u2026 We predict it will be a winner.\"\n\"The Clyde Lamp is best described in a few words as cute, clever, and quirky. It is a great conversation piece for your desk or home that has a multicolored LED light with a bright personality.\"\n\nLots of personality\nAt Fabule we think that \u201csmart\u201d things are great, but we also need warmth, welcome, personality, and creativity. Our home is a place for the people, pets and things that we love. Clyde is the kind of device that we\u2019d want to invite in.\nWe spent a lot of time designing a delightful, quirky personality. Our whole process was driven by questions like: what does he look like when he\u2019s laughing? Purring? Sleepy? As you get to know Clyde better, you'll be able to shape his behavior by adding and changing his \"personality modules\".\nHow to use Clyde\nTouching Clyde's squishy silicone \"eye\" will turn him on and off, and switch between ambient and task lighting.\n\n\nTouching Clyde's legs will make his ambient light cycle through many colors. Stop touching him when you find the color you want.\n\n\nWe also supply an \"afraid of the dark\" personality module that will make Clyde sensitive to ambient light levels. Install it to make him light up softly for a while when the room goes dark.\n\n\nWe've mentioned these \"personality modules\" that you can give to Clyde. Here's what that means. Clyde responds in certain ways to his owner and environment: to your touch, to light levels, etc. His personality modules contain sensors that allow him to perceive all this stuff, and respond accordingly. You get to use these to determine how he acts. Don't worry! It's all very easy.\nEasy to customize\nEven if you don\u2019t know anything about programming or using sensors, you can simply twist off Clyde\u2019s top, pop in a new personality module, and then close him back up.\nWe will deliver Clyde with the following personalities for you to choose from:\n\"Afraid of the dark\": A small light sensor attaches to the end of Clyde's leg, covered by one of his translucent silicone feet. When the room goes dark, Clyde will light up in a sequence of gorgeous sunset colors, then over the course of 20-30 minutes he'll slowly fade into sleep.\n\"Touchy feely\": A touch sensor inside Clyde's head attaches to his legs and makes them touch sensitive. When you touch him steadily, he'll cycle through all of his colors. You should also tickle his legs and see what happens.\nAt the $150 reward level, we'll give him a voice and infinite customization abilities, too!\nWe're currently developing a \"Loudmouth\" module with a small speaker to allow Clyde to make some sounds.\nWe will also supply a \"Multiple Personalities\" module with a mini-breadboard, so you can add your own sensors and personality designs to Clyde.\nWe'll do our best to support your tinkering efforts, and that starts with choosing an easy and freely available programming platform for anyone interested in customizing Clyde at such a deep level.\nArduino compatible\nIf you do want to program, or to learn how, Clyde is Arduino-compatible, which means you have endless possibilities and great community support. He\u2019ll work with any standard Arduino shield, so you can set him up with Wifi, Bluetooth, or XBee connectivity.\nYou\u2019re not limited to our personality modules either. With just a little bit of coding, you can add LEDs to the ends of his legs, accelerometers or microphones inside him, and anything else you can think of. We're committed to creating great documentation to support all of our fellow tinkerers.\nLimitless Tinkering Possibilities\nWant to add and program your own sensors? Here are a few ideas...\nAdd an XBee shield for easy local wireless communication. Control Clyde from your computer: turn him on and off with a button press, or choose his color with a click of your mouse.\nWireless control of Clyde's color.\nAdd a moisture sensor at the tip of one of Clyde's hollow legs. Run the wires up into his head and get him to glow red when your plant needs water.\nTreehugger Clyde looks after your plants.\nAnd more:\nAdd an accelerometer and make Clyde wake up when you shake him.\nOr with that same accelerometer, make Clyde change color when you tilt him.\nAdd a WiFi shield (or a Spark Core!) to hook Clyde up to the internet and make him display stock market activity, today\u2019s temperature or air quality, or just blink when you have new mail.\nLimited Edition Wooden Clyde\nWe're planning to make a limited run of 100 wooden Clydes, CNC milled from cherry wood and finished in tung oil for a warm natural glow. Each wooden Clyde will be engraved with a number out of 100.\nChanges from the current prototype\nThe prototype that you see in the video and photos here is very close to what the final product will look like. We are planning to make the following improvements to Clyde before delivering him to our backers:\nThe piece on the lower portion of Clyde's body, which contains the high-power white LEDs, will be made from aluminum instead of plastic.

Angela Gabereau has ensured that our website is in great shape, and Silvia Lindtner helped us figure out Shenzhen and get over some language barriers. All of these people were an absolute joy to work with. Our work on Clyde would not have been possible (at least not at this level of quality in such a short time) without the help and mentorship we received at HAXLR8R.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBacking a project on Kickstarter always carries some degree of risk inherent in product development. You're investing in us, so we want to do everything we can to minimize that risk.\n\nThe biggest risk in any product design project is that it will come time to mass-produce a prototype, and we'll discover that some aspect of it is a poor fit for production methods like injection-molding or vacuum forming. We've already been working to minimize this by doing our prototyping in Shenzhen, at the very center of our supply chains. This means that we've already spent a couple months collaborating with factory engineers during the prototyping phase, and designing for manufacture and assembly from the very beginning. They have already approved our current models as manufacturable.\n\nThe opportunity to visit factories has also given us a chance to check out the premises and ensure that we're only collaborating with businesses that provide decent working conditions. If we smell gross fumes without ventilation, don't see safety procedures posted, see people working in poor lighting or eating at their workstation because they don't have anywhere to take a break, we don't work with that manufacturer.\n\nAnother risk, for projects involving hardware, involves changes in the availability and lead-time of our electronic components. This is mitigated partly by the fact that we've been able to prototype with the very components we'll use in production. We have also been working with Seeed Studio (http://www.seeedstudio.com), which has extensive experience helping entrepreneurs produce electronics, and who can provide us with some guidance regarding cost and availability of components.\n\nIf this project is successfully funded, we'll be able to return to Shenzhen for 4-6 weeks to oversee production and quality assurance, working face to face with our manufacturers in order to discover and solve any problems very quickly. In all matters we will keep lines of communication with our backers open, and update you about any developments.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "More Shipping and Chatterbox Progress", "update_content": "Back from China\nWe spent the last few weeks in China lining up some resources for sourcing and production of the Chatterbox Shield.

With the ability to make custom circuitry, we can now build our own smart objects - medicine bottles that email reminders, shoes that tell you how fast you went, and even glasses that know when you need to put on sunscreen. The Othermill is our contribution to custom circuit design and the desktop manufacturing revolution.\nThanks and Stretch Goals!\nWe are incredibly grateful for the support that we have received. We had no idea that we would reach our goal in less than 24 hours. You might be wondering, \u201cif they have already reached their goal, what does my contribution enable?\u201d\nJOB CREATION: At $100,000, a job gets created! We can hire another machinist, and we can manufacture your machines faster.\nSOFTWARE FEATURES: At $250,000, (first we jump up and down, and then...) we hire a third software engineer. This means the first release of Othercam has even more features and is able to do things (DXF importing, etc) currently planned for future versions.\nDOUBLE PRODUCTION: At $500,000, we add a second production line in a larger manufacturing space with more staff. This has the long term effect of establishing our US manufacturing facility, far ahead of schedule. This means we'll be able to increase the speed at which we produce your mills and get them to you faster.\nTHE DREAM: $1 million. We get back to our mission of \u201cshop class for the 21st century, ahead of schedule.\u201d We began our work as part of a government funded push to revive high school shop class, with a modern twist: tools for digital design and CNC manufacturing. If we reach this goal, we will be able to allocate the time and the staff to create the resources for teaching these skills to the next generation.\nKickstarter campaigns are about so much more than contributions and rewards. They are about doing something together that would have been impossible to do on your own.\nWhat is the Othermill?\nThe Othermill is a portable, computer controlled, 3-axis mill that is specifically designed for use at home or in a small workspace. Our objective is to build a mill that is compact, clean, and quiet enough for use at home, yet is precise enough for high level electrical and mechanical prototyping work. The Othermill will be at home on your desk, in your workshop, or on your kitchen table.\nOur current Othermill prototype\nWhat Can You Make With the Othermill?\nWith our mill, you can produce custom circuit boards quickly and cheaply. You can make all your projects light up, beep, and move. Wearable circuits, custom guitar effects pedals, and quadcopter electronics are all within reach - without waiting for boards to come back from the manufacturer. Even though the Othermill is optimized for cutting circuit boards, it can also cut metal, wood, wax, and plastic. It is great for engraving and milling 3D shapes for jewelry or mold making.\nAn LED pocket watch made from a custom PCB and a 3D printed body.\nPrinted Circuit Boards\nThe Othermill was designed with PCBs in mind, and they were the very first thing we tested when we had a working machine. The precision and accuracy of the Othermill allows you to reliably cut 10 mil trace and space on FR-1 PCB stock. You can create custom circuits that fit into odd 3D printed parts, seamlessly integrate electronics into your clothing, and free up your Arduinos for other applications.\nJewelry\nAny tool with a 1/8\u201d shank can be used with the Othermill, including all Dremel and Foredom Flex-Shaft accessories. You can use these tools to create complex and beautiful jewelry out of materials that are as varied as brass and birch.\nMolds\nThe Othermill beautifully cuts machining wax. Machining wax is one of our favorite test materials because we can use the mill to cut a positive model from the wax, fill it with silicone, and make molds for almost anything. We\u2019ve been trying our hands at chocolate and ice molds, but you could make figurines, jewelry, or even cast precision parts.\nWhat Makes the Othermill the Premier Desktop Mill?\nA number of features set the Othermill apart from other compact computerized mills:\nYou can grab it and take it on the bus, toss it in your trunk, or put it in your bike basket. The Othermill is a ten inch cube and 15 pounds, so it is small and light enough to carry with you. It even has handles.\nForrest and Martine take the Othermill out for a morning stroll.\nThe Othermill is not a kit. It comes fully assembled and ready to use, right out of the box. The Othermill also has a transparent, approachable design that encourages modification.\nIt has a quiet, high speed spindle. Machines can be loud, and we\u2019ve worked to keep noise to a minimum, so that you can work next to the Othermill in comfort. In addition to being quiet, the Othermill\u2019s brushless DC motor ensures a long spindle life. \nAny milling tool with a 1/8\u201d diameter shank can be inserted into the spindle. We opted to use a Fairloc collet for tool holding, rather than the more commonly used set screw. The Fairloc collet enables reliable and repeatable tool holding under vibration at high speeds.\nThe frame is packed with innovative features like self-aligning flexure bearing mounts. The Othermill is made from high density polyethylene, which is chemical resistant and moisture proof, leading to a longer lasting machine.\nYou won\u2019t have to worry about your parts breaking down just as you are getting into your project. We have incorporated high performance parts into our design wherever possible. For instance, each linear actuator consists of a stepper motor that is rigidly coupled to a teflon-coated lead screw with an anti-backlash, wear-compensating nut.\nOur emphasis on noise reduction and high performance parts greatly decreases the vibration of the Othermill. The timing belts in the spindle assembly are an example of a vibration-conscious design decision. Our timing belts have a polyester core, rather than fiberglass, which reduces vibration and noise. Every reduction in vibration leads to an increase in the precision of your machine.\nYou can keep using your favorite CAM (computer aided machining) software if you like, because the Othermill uses the TinyG motion controller. We love TinyG because it's open source firmware and has a built-in g-code interpreter. TinyG also uses a USB interface, so it\u2019s easy to connect the Othermill to your computer.\nThe Othermill is a high-speed, precision CNC milling machine that delivers quality at an affordable price.\nA CAD model of our pre-production Othermill design.\nHow Do You Use the Othermill?\n\nRight now, the Othermill can use any CAM processor that is compatible with the open source TinyG controller board from Synthetos. This includes tgFX, as well as several 3rd party CAM interfaces. You can use any software that outputs standard g-code in arc/mm.\nHowever, we think machining should be simpler than using the typical CAM software. Currently, CAM software practically requires a degree to use. To encourage and enable more people to use CNC machines, we're creating simple software that eases the transition from digital design to 3D object.\nWe're working hard on an integrated front end for the Othermill. Our software is called Othercam. When the Othermills ship, Othercam will be able to import both EagleCAD board files and SVG files. This means you can use Illustrator (or any other vector based editor) and EagleCAD to design both shapes and circuits to cut on the Othermill.\n\nA screenshot of Othercam, ready to cut a board.\n\nOur direct modeling interface syncs up with the machine in real time to show you what's currently happening with the machine and what's about to happen.\nAs Othercam develops, we'll be adding more CAM processors to handle other file formats. We're a small software team, but we're extremely passionate about making machines that are simple to understand and easy to use.\nThe Othermill, hooked up to a computer running Othercam and ready to cut.\nTechnical Specifications\nWhy we need your help\nWe\u2019re a small technology company that wants to bring a high quality and affordable product to market. We\u2019ve created a fully functional prototype and have spent the last several months putting it through its paces. Now we just need to manufacture the mills. We\u2019ve surveyed a lot of options for manufacturing and decided that the only way to provide a reliable machine is to use high performance parts. The only way to include these components affordably is to place bulk orders. We believe in the utility of the Othermill and know that once it exists as a product with customers, we can gain even more momentum and make it even better.\nWith your support, we will finally have the chance to turn our hard work into machines for other people.\nWe will do three things:\nOrder volume batches of our materials and motors at significant discounts. (It is SO expensive to buy two motors at a time.)\nHire our manufacturing engineer full time. (We are really happy to have her!)\nPour gasoline on the CAM software development fire, by hiring another developer to help Mike optimize the path planning code.\nShow your support with a t-shirt. Pick a design based on the original patent art of our favorite tools: the claw hammer, bit brace, caliper and plumb bob. Shirts will be heather grey with oxblood graphics (see claw hammer image for example).\nDelivery Timeline\nOtherfab has been working on desktop CNC machines for over a year. Our final Othermill prototype has been in testing for the last two months, and we are confident in our design. We are updating the frame for the final product (Did we mention the handles? We love the handles!), but the guts will stay the same. We will continue to improve our design as we set up our factory and ramp up production.\nWe\u2019ll begin shipping Othermills in August 2013. That\u2019s so soon! All of our sourcing has been lined up, and we have purchased some parts that are hard to find on a tight schedule, but we need to place final orders for everything else. Production of Othermills will begin as soon as the Kickstarter has successfully completed, and we will continue until all machines have shipped. Once a machine is built and put through its quality control paces, it will be out the door and on its way. Our estimates point to an in-house production capacity of 10 - 20 machines per week.\nPlease note that shipping is not included in reward prices. We want to keep your shipping costs as low as possible, so we will be in touch after the Kickstarter ends with individual shipping prices. Please see the FAQ for more details. Thanks!\nWho We Are\nOtherfab is a team inside Otherlab, a small incubator and research lab that was founded by Dr. Saul Griffith. From our converted organ factory in San Francisco, Otherlab works on software tools for computer aided design and manufacturing, robotics, energy, and education.

We\u2019ve also had help along the way from the kind folks at Synthetos and Shopbot. Our intern, Jake Read made the beautiful video at the top of the page with music from Joseph Wharton. Thanks everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are two main risks with the Othermill project: supply chain and machine manufacturing.\n\nThe supply chain risk looks like this: the best linear actuator motors for our machine are made by one company, and they have a patent on the design. If we run into trouble with the manufacturer of the motors, we have other options, but we would be making an unknown sacrifice in the lifetime of our machine. We currently have a great relationship with our motor manufacturer and barring any natural disasters, we foresee no disruptions in our ability to obtain products from them.\n\nOn the manufacturing front, it\u2019s important for you to know that we make these machines ourselves, in our shop in San Francisco. This gives us extreme flexibility for design and manufacturing optimizations. We can also get products into the hands of customers without having to wait weeks or months for overseas shipping. However, we are new to the mass production game, and the Othermill will be the first commercial product to come out of Otherfab. We are smart, capable people, with years of prototyping experience, and we are excited by the new challenges of coordinating manufacturing, inventory, and juggling customers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Impossible challenge, unlikely team, and a small-yet-mighty machine: Year 1", "update_content": "Of everything that has happened since Kickstarter, I am most proud of this:\nWe made CNC less intimidating.\nI don\u2019t have official numbers, but I guarantee we have more women and young people using our machines than any other CNC mill.\nMany always wanted to be able to fabricate their own electronics, and now they do.

I'm really overwhelmed by the incredible support from friends old and new. I cannot WAIT to make this album, and am so grateful for your help. Additional funds raised beyond the goal will go toward promoting the album once it is finished.\nThank you!\n-Tyler\n--\nHi!\nMy name is Tyler Matthew Smith. I started writing songs about five years ago and got really fired up about it. I got so fired up that after a while I moved into my van so I could free up disposable income to invest in the music. I did that for three years, touring when I could, and substitute teaching to keep gas in the tank.\nI released my first full-length album about a year ago, and I learned a lot in the process. I'm confident now that I know how to make a great second album, but I need your help.\nAfter a lot of thought, I've decided to get professional-level equipment and record the album largely myself. By doing this I hope to capture the energy I had when recording some of my original demos. It will also allow me to be flexible enough to support the songs in the most musical and creative way.\nIf you're new to my music, you can check out the last record I produced, or find out more about me on facebook. The songs that I'll be recording on this album are by far my best yet, and I can't wait to lay them down! I've also developed an amazingly talented network of musicians over the last couple of years who have come up with some great parts to add to the recording.\nTo me, this is worth the blood, sweat and tears because I know there are a lot of other people out there who would enjoy this music but don't even know it exists. Please help me make this album by buying an advance copy for yourself, and then pass it along to 5 people who you think might be interested!\nI really appreciate your support, and I look forward to getting these songs to you!\n-Tyler\n*Many thanks to Diana Cordero and Angie Amaro for their videography and Darius Dodge and Leslie Smith for providing photos.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough this project, I'm proactively limiting one of the most costly potential risks when producing an album--spending money on expensive studio time and not getting what is needed. By owning my own equipment, I'll be able to experiment, repeat sessions, and spend the time necessary to get it right at virtually no additional cost. \n\nAnother crucial challenge is musical--getting the songs to sound great! Fortunately, all of the material that will be on the album has already been written and road tested, and the musicians who will be recording have all contributed to the arrangements through countless live performances. \n\nThe hardest thing about recording my first record was facing so many choices about how to do things.

Lives in Transit promises to be a wild ride. I can't wait to find out where it takes us. And it's only possible because of a massively-scaled collaboration made up of filmmakers from around the world, and our Kickstarter backers. Please join me and support Global Lives today on Kickstarter and help unlock their matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts!\"\n-Jane McGonigal\nWorld-renowned game designer; Inventor of SuperBetter; Author of New York Times bestseller, Reality Is Broken.\nThe Project: Lives in Transit is a new series to be produced by the Global Lives Project. From bus fare collectors to flight attendants, mule packers to bicycle rickshaw drivers, we will faithfully capture 24 continuous hours of routines and rituals in the lives of 10 individuals instrumental in moving people and goods throughout our world.\nThis new series will stay true to Global Lives Project\u2019s tenet of unfiltered access in the way that we follow participants, but it will be the first time we use a theme to juxtapose individuals with parallel circumstances, namely occupation, in order to highlight cross-cultural differences and universal similarities.\nThe production of Lives in Transit will bring together nearly 100 accomplished filmmakers and media artists to undertake a globally-collaborative work of art that raises questions about the relationship of human connection and disconnection, similarity and difference, distance and proximity.\nThe Complete Project Deliverables Include:\n1. Production of ten 24-hour shoots and 10 video shorts.                              \n2. Post-production of all 240 hours of footage.                                             \n3. Transcription and translation of all 240 hours of footage.                          \n4. Uploading full collection to YouTube and the Internet Archive where all footage is under Creative Commons licensing and can be downloaded in full HD quality.        \n5. 10-screen immersive Video Installation Premiere (date and location TBD).  \nAbout Global Lives:\nThe Global Lives Project is a video library of life experience. A nonprofit, volunteer-driven effort of 1000+ filmmakers, translators, and educators, we create and curate films that capture 24 continuous hours in the life of individuals from around the world. We use visual media to cultivate the ethics of global citizenship and cross-cultural empathy for a global audience.\nOur first set of 10 films did really well, got a lot of press, etc. Over 100,000 viewers from 159 countries experienced our work at exhibitions and screenings, on our website and DVDs, and in classrooms. Here are a bunch of links for you to go through and see how awesome we are.

We have learned a lot from this endeavor, which has prepared us to go into this new series with more confidence and knowledge on how to mitigate challenges. \n\nPer our National Endowment for the Arts grant agreement, we are required to match our grant from NEA. The support from Kickstarter will bring our total project budget to $100,000. When we accepted the grant, we created a \"worse case senario\" budget for only having $75,000 to complete the project. Without Kickstarter funds, we will have to reduce staff time dedicated to the project, and lower the budgets that we give to filmmakers to cover production costs, which would slow down production. However, the Global Lives Project's real resource is our community. Even without additional funds, we have the power to move people--getting them excited to participate in the creation of \"Lives in Transit\" as volunteers.\n\nAlthough we have previously coordinated ten 24-hour shoots, this series is on a quicker timeline. We are currently receiving support from a pro bono team at Adobe, who are helping us revamp our production and translation guidelines to streamline our process. The new guidelines will help us manage multiple production teams and translation volunteers across countries simultaneously. \n\nThe biggest challenge we have faced over the years is getting 24 hours of footage translated with less common languages, especially in areas where internet access is low. We have had successful exhibitions in the past with powerful imagery and no subtitles. As our network continues to grow, we are hopeful that we will be able to get more people interested in volunteering to translate and coordinate translators in their home countries. Through a relationship with the Rosetta Project (http://rosettaproject.org), a global collaboration of language specialists building a publicly accessible digital library of human languages, we will be able to reach translators of less common languages. \n\nDealing with 240 hours of HD footage is extremely challenging. We are talking about 3-6 Terabytes for each series! We have developed a new file naming system to improve our organizing and processing of footage and metadata, that will make this series go a lot smoother. We have also developed a partnership with the Internet Archive who host all of our footage online. We deliver them a hard drive and they handle the uploading of all the footage. Once it is online, we are able to distribute the footage to other sites like YouTube and DotSub easily.\n\nAs for our rewards fulfillment, there is a challenge getting all the rewards delivered by the estimated time, but we know we will deliver everything promised. As a nonprofit, we have years of experience managing donor acknowledgement letters and gifts.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Thxgiving Exclusive: Rough Cuts\u2014Lives in Transit", "update_content": "First deadline for Inquiries: March 17, 2013\nThe Global Lives Project is seeking filmmakers in all parts of the world to contribute to its new curated series of ten 24-hour films \u2014 Lives in Transit.

There are 1,000+ hackerspaces across the world. Mothership HackerMoms is the first dedicated women\u2019s hackerspace.\nWhy a hackerspace for moms?\nWe are a new kind of playground and workspace for creative mothers. Fun to us is not mani-pedis, but making, breaking, learning and hacking our bright ideas. HackerMoms model active creative lives for our kids who learn, explore and create as mini-makers alongside us. We offer members daily childcare. We also welcome dads.\nWe started our non-profit organization in April 2012 because traditional hackerspaces don\u2019t really have safe spaces for babies and young children - or, consequently, their mothers. Our mission is to give creative moms the time and space to explore DIY craft and design, hacker/maker culture, entrepreneurship, and all manner of creative expression - with childcare. Mothers sometimes need a room of their own! Learn more about who we are and our philosophy at http://mothership.hackermoms.org/. In a word, it's...\nDaughters Lucy and Scarlett use their magic \"femomist\" wand in our Kickstarter video!\nHelp HackerMoms Grow.\nWe\u2019ve been in our 1,000 square foot space for 6 months now - long enough to know that we must build out the workspace, equipment selection and programs in order to keep growing. The 350 square foot childcare room was soundproofed and furnished first. Our Kickstarter goal of $10,000 will pay for tools, equipment and renovations for the remaining 650 square foot adult space that accommodates 20+ members. Here is our space:\nHackerMoms and babes in the flesh. With your help, this main room will become an efficient workshop with workstations.\nAs you can see, we currently have a co-working and communal space (behind us are two 6-foot collapsible tables), but we lack individual workspaces. Our goal is renovation. Our strategy is to tackle this like a NYC apartment, with ingenuity, Ikea and a CNC machine. We will convert the majority of the main space half into a workshop and half into workstations. The front will remain a communal living room/nursing area. The tiny back office will turn into a quiet computer room. The storage loft above our heads will be ladder-accessible and hidden by a curtain.  \nThe Breakdown in Dollars \nHere is the complete wishlist with estimates. Totals are at the end.\nTools and Equipment = estimated $8,750\nSmaller power tools for wood/metal/leather/jewelry/textiles - $1,000 \nSecondhand industrial textile printer - $3,000 (new is $6,000) \nLarge-format scanner - $2,400 \nOffice printer - $300 \nVideo camera + equipment - $600 \nSerger - $300 \nSewing machine - $200 \nSoldering/Arduino/electronics kits - $500 \nRepairs for Juki industrial sewing machine - $300 \nUtility sink to replace bathroom sink + plumber - $150 \nMain Room - Workshop along one wall = estimated $1,850 \nLumber and materials for 4 DIY rolling workbenches - $500   \nCabinet for safe storage of power tools - $600 \nTrack shelving or Metro shelving system with closed cabinets - $500\n3 Wall mounted Pegboard cabinets for hand tools - $600 \nMain Room - Workstations along other wall = estimated $1550 \nLumber and materials for 3-4 DIY rolling privacy cubicle screens - $150 \n2 tilting Drafting/drawing tables - $500 \n3 wall-mounted dropdown desks- $400 \n Track shelving or Metro shelving system with closed cabinets - $500  \nSmall back Office - Quiet computer room = estimated $1250-1650 \nTemporary ceiling for noise control, possibly of heavy fabric ($150) or framed foam ($500) \n Lighting - $50 \n3 Library carrel-like desks with mounted privacy separators - $200 \nFiling cabinets - $100 \nMember storage in lockers or cupboards - $500 \nTrack shelving or Metro shelving system with closed cabinets - $300 \nCommunal living room/nursing area at entrance = estimated $700\nBookcases with cabinets that act as library, supplies storage and room dividers - $500 \nDisplay case and shelving for a corner selling space - $200 \nLoft storage space = estimated $350 \nTelescoping Ladder - $150 \nSafety hand rails - $50 \nSimple pully system - $50 \nInstall curtain to hide storage - $100 \nCommunity Outreach and Kids Programs\nOutside of nuts and bolts, we\u2019d like to allot up to $2,000 towards program development. Our vision is to add more robust offerings in the areas of children, charity and independent businesses in addition to current programs for art/craft techniques, personal growth and practical parenting. \nAfter equipment and renovation, your dollars will hire teachers to introduce young kids to STEAM (science, tech, engineering, arts, math) in our new Hacker Sprouts program. We also want to foster a business incubator for the many women who shift careers after children with hired experts and speakers. Anything more will go towards helping needy moms and families as part of our \"mom rescue\" philosophy.\nRenovation = $6,100 \nEquipment = $8,750\nProgram development = $2,000 \nTOTAL ESTIMATE = $16,850 \nReality Check \nAt $10,000, we've underasked to avoid falling short of the goal and losing all funding, per Kickstarter policy. We hope that with your help, we will outperform our goal. Also HackerMoms are a scrappy group that reuses and recycles from salvage yards, craigslist and flea markets whenever possible. We\u2019ll find many things on the cheap, and budget for what we can\u2019t rescue or make ourselves. We run HackerMoms like our own households. Every penny will be put to good use. \n  Mama Thanks You\nYou can help HackerMoms build a strong foundation for the future.

With the environment on the brink of collapse, we ask a pressing question: at a time when corporate forces have bought and sold democracy, how can we effect real change? Our answer: get every viewer involved in the struggle.\nhelp keep us afloat\nThe Yes Men Are Revolting completes a trilogy of funny feature docs we started a decade ago. In our first film, The Yes Men (2004), we posed as spokespeople for the World Trade Organization, acting out comedic vigilante justice against the elite. In The Yes Men Fix the World (2009), we delivered a bunch of hard-hitting, hilarious stunts that show why we must change our corporations-first system, and what\u2019s in store if we don\u2019t. The Yes Men Are Revolting will be even more jam-packed with screwball comedy, nail-biting suspense, nasty stings, and informative documentary. It'll also have a gripping personal storyline the first two films lacked\u2014as well as a human-staffed platform to convert viewer enthusiasm into direct action, letting everyone join in the fun and contribute to the movement for change.\nWe're hatching our most ambitious plan ever: a human-staffed platform to help every inspired viewer of our film\u2014or anyone at all\u2014get involved. Our \u201cAction Switchboard\u201d taps our 100,000-person database, as well as some much bigger lists, to create fun, meaningful, movement-building projects around the issues we all care about.\n\nThis is a plan that invites everyone to join us in revolt. But we need your help now to get the movie and the Switchboard off the ground.\nUSB Secret Decoder Ring - your pass to goodies and actions throughout the movie's release\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nFor the last four years we\u2019ve worked with dozens of groups on infiltrations, impersonations, and mass actions to try to make a difference. Check out the video on this page for a little taste! After the part where we ask for your support, you\u2019ll see a scene where we hold a press conference pretending to be from the US Chamber of Commerce (big-money lobbyists who spend hundreds of millions blocking and dismantling environment, labor, housing, and health laws). The press conference goes well, and the Chamber\u2019s real PR guy even shows up\u2014comedic vigilante justice at its best.\nBut as we continued pulling off actions like the one against the Chamber, the Obama years rolled by, and as money's chokehold on democracy got tighter, we got more frantic. We even took it out on each other, and our \u201cband\u201d almost split up. But then, a sequence of unbelievable global uprisings, from Tahrir Square to Occupy Wall Street, got us excited about the idea of a global revolution\u2013and we began to realize that we can do it too.  Then, energized by our involvement with the Occupy movement, we came to realize our true role in social change.\nWhen our first movie came out, studios and television networks were paying pretty well\u2014but then the the market for indie films went into freefall. \nToday, we're really in a pinch. Corporate sponsorship, of course, is right out. So we're turning to you. The money we raise will go towards paying for a few more shoots and a couple more actions around the globe. We also need money to pay for editors, equipment, archival footage, legal counsel, and all the technical work it takes to get a movie finished and into the world. Finally, we'll need funds for \"outreach,\" mainly the creation and staffing of the Action Switchboard, a way to plug inspired viewers into ongoing projects and help generate new ones. It'll come out at the same time as the film.\nIf you kick in now, you can join in this steamy synergy. Hurry!\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?\nKickstarter is a way to \u201ccrowdsource\u201d fundraising. In the absence of real funding for films or activist platforms, it enables a lot of people to give what they can in order to make good things happen\u2014which is a bit like how social movements work, sort of.\nMAKE A DONATION TO THE FILM AND YOU GET A REWARD.

The next chapter of 3D printing is just beginning.\nPre-order your Form 1 at Formlabs.com\n\nRead about the Form 1 on: \nengadget  Wired  TechCrunch  boingboing  core77  Xconomy  Make:  The Verge  The Boston Globe  Fast Company\n\nAre you frustrated that low-end 3D printers don\u2019t have the quality to make the true beauty of your designs real? Do you dream of having the power and resolution of a truly professional machine on your desktop? We\u2019ve created an easy-to-use system that rivals the output of high-end printers at a fraction of the cost.\nFormlabs is disrupting 3D printing.\nOur reason for starting this project is simple: there are no low-cost 3D printers that meet the quality standards of the professional designer. As researchers at the MIT Media Lab, we were lucky to experience the best and most expensive fabrication equipment in the world. But, we became frustrated by the fact that all the professional-quality 3D printers were ridiculously expensive (read: tens of thousands of dollars) and were so complex to use. In 2011, we decided to build a solution to this problem ourselves, and we are now ready to share it with the world.\nHigh resolution belongs on your desktop.\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work for over a year, and with your help, we\u2019re ready to take the Form 1 into full-fledged production. By supporting this effort, you\u2019ll be the first to get your hands on an amazing 3D printer AND help usher in a new era of 3D printing - an era in which your creative output is no longer limited by price or dauntingly complex machines.\nThe Form 1 will change creative design.\nWe\u2019ve gone to extraordinary lengths to design a complete 3D printing experience:\nThe Form 1 printer is engineered to produce high resolution parts with the touch of a button\nForm software is intuitive and simple to use so you can spend less time setting up prints and more time designing\nThe Form Finish post-processing kit keeps your desktop organized so that you can easily put the finishing touches on your masterpiece\nRead on for more details on what you\u2019ll help bring into the world (and onto your desktop) if you support this effort.\nHardware - The Form 1:\nFor most designers, the extruded plastic (i.e. FDM) of low-end printers is simply not capable of the high resolution and quality surface finish necessary for professional work. So, we decided to go straight for the real deal: a stereolithography printer we call the Form 1.\nStereolithography (SL) is the gold standard for accuracy and resolution in the 3D printing world, reaching layer thicknesses and feature sizes that are worlds ahead of what is possible with FDM. The process is pretty straightforward - a laser is used to draw on the surface of a liquid plastic resin that hardens when exposed to a certain wavelength of light. The laser draws and hardens a layer at a time until the entire model is built. It\u2019s simple, reliable, and quiet.\nUnfortunately, SL is traditionally one of the most expensive 3D printing processes. With pricey lasers and high-precision optical components, SL 3D printers can easily cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Until now.  Check out these pictures of parts made with the Form 1 as compared to a currently available FDM printer:\nAfter a great deal of research, engineering, and experimentation, we\u2019ve figured out how to do it at a much, much lower cost, making this premium technology available to everyone.\nThe results are amazing: the Form 1 can print layers as thin as 25 microns (0.001 in) with features as small as 300 microns (0.012 in) in a build volume of 125 x 125 x 165 mm (4.9 x 4.9 x 6.5 in). This means you can print complex geometries with the exquisite details and beautiful surface finish that will make your creations stand out.\nForm print software: \nGreat hardware is only half the battle. We painstakingly designed our Form software to have a simple, intuitive user experience that streamlines the process of importing .STL models from any 3D CAD package. Generating smart support structures for complex geometries and sending jobs to the printer is as easy as a few clicks.\nA key advantage of the Form software is the ability to precisely generate thin, breakable support structures that serve their purpose during printing but are easily removed afterward. Test users have delightfully compared this part removal to a feeling almost like separating Velcro. You can finally print those designs with crazy overhangs!\nMaterials:\nWhen the Form 1 is released, it will come with our first material - a neutral matte gray that is great for look-and-feel models, standalone parts, or even as a base color for painting.\nAfter a successful launch (thanks to your support!), we will continue development of an entire palette of materials for your printer. A variety of colors, transparency, flexibility, and even burnout capability for lost wax casting processes are all possible with SL.\nAccessories - Form Finish kit:\nWith any 3D printing process, there are key finishing steps to get your print into its final and ready-to-use form. With SL, each part comes out of the printer with a small amount of liquid resin on its surface.\nWe\u2019ve designed the Form Finish kit - a finishing tray and accessories set to assist you and keep your workspace clean and organized during this process.\nAfter printing, all you need to do is remove the build platform from the printer, set it into the tray, snap the model off its supports, and use the rinsing basket to clean the print for final use. Check out our website for step by step photos!\nWe are ready for full production with your support.\nSo where are we in this whole process? We\u2019ve:\nFormed an awesome team in Boston, Montreal, and London\nEngineered the system to be mass-manufactured\nBuilt and tested 7 generations of prototypes\nTested a wide range of material formulations\nWritten and optimized thousands of lines of code\nTested a production run of alpha units\nWe\u2019re nearly ready to set up full-scale manufacturing to get your Form 1 delivered as soon as possible. We take this last crucial step seriously, and we\u2019ll need a lot of support to do the job right. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve turned to Kickstarter to get the production lines up and running!\nIf you decide to pitch in, you\u2019ll get a discount and be one of the first to have our product on your desktop. But more importantly, you\u2019ll play a huge part in starting this revolution in 3D printing by providing your feedback and creating amazing things with the Form 1. We can\u2019t wait to see what you can design!\nWhat do the Gyrocube and T-Shirt rewards look like?\nThey look like this:\nSpiffy, eh?  \nThe Formlabs Gyro was inspired by \"Gyro the Cube\" designed by Virtox.

The primary risks for us include:\n\nENGINEERING\n\nTo achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we have to design and engineer a very complex system. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success. 1) We have formed an amazing team of engineers and designers, and 2) we test our printers with an obsession for perfection. In the last year, we have built 7 generations of prototypes, a production run of alpha machines, we will have a run of beta machines with significant user testing, and we keep enormous amounts of data to guide our future work. \n\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues finding suppliers and engineering products for mass-production. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks. We take this lesson seriously and have been working for months negotiating with suppliers, testing component quality, and building a team that can execute on our promises. Our plans are nearly in place, and we now mainly require the resources to execute them. \n\nTEAM\n\nFinding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Success in 3D printing requires a team of talented, passionate, and motivated designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. We have already formed a truly awesome (and fun!) team, but we will have to bring in more Formlings to realize this dream.

We've been getting questions about why it's important to run a popup hackerspace and why we're asking for 27,500 dollars. GEMSI works to create a cascade of hackerspaces across the Middle East and North Africa. We do this by supporting the development of short term and long term spaces. Our efforts start with temporary spaces and workshops to do community discovery and connections then leads to supporting the development of a year round space. This Kickstarter supports all this work but is focusing on our work this fall for Iraq. By our efforts in Beirut we are working to discover the translation of hackerspaces to the Middle Eastern cultural context which we hope to share with Baghdad. Beirut is also where we are running a comic hackathon at the hackerspace to illustrate the Iraqi stories. Lastly part of our funds have been allocated to a micro loan that  Middle Eastern hackerspaces can apply to to help with the hackerspace build out.\nWith our current funding efforts GEMSI is trying to step up and seriously consider the sustainability of our project and long term impact on the region.

And for an overview of the Middle Eastern hackers and hackerspaces.\nWho are we and what do we do?\nGEMSI works to develop engagement, service, and entrepreneurship by uniting communities of makers around the world, facilitating the creation of hackerspaces, running workshops and creating platforms for storytelling. A hackerspace is a community-supported collaborative workshop where passionate people create and share. We believe that hackerspaces can act as a catalyst to unlock creativity, inspire action, and create hope. Hackerspaces build hope by giving people access to tools and a local/global community through which people are enabled to invent their own future.\nWe need your help.\nWe need your support to extend our reach into Baghdad. Without your support we cannot run these events in Iraq:\nRiwaya wa Bidaya (Oct 5): A livestream conference to share stories of everyday superheroes in Baghdad who take initiative to solve problems. We are inviting submissions until Sept 22 [apply here!] - top stories will be illustrated by a professional graphic comic book artist and published in Arabic and English.\n'Amal wa Amal (Oct 18-19): In collaboration with TEDxBaghdad, we are setting up a temporary community hackerspace to share local tools and solutions. We hope this will provide an inspiration for an ongoing community and hackerspace to develop in Baghdad. Bringing in members of hackerspaces from the middle east to run workshops and share the process of creating a collaborative community space.\nOur previous work in Egypt\nWe have a track record of success at sharing maker and hacker culture in the Middle East and North Africa. Our previous backers will remember that GEMSI ran a kickstarter last October to create a temporary hackerspace in Egypt \u2013 we're happy to say the world is a brighter place because of it! There are now at least 5 hackerspace initiatives in Egypt: Giza Hackerspace, FabLab Egypt, Cairo Hackerspace, El Minya Hackerspace, Alexandria Hackerspace. Egypt has also seen a successful making festival hosted by Fab Lab Egypt and Giza Hackerspace, and a home-brewed Cairo Maker Faire is in the works. \nIn addition to creating collaborative community spaces, these makerspaces offer kids the chance to learn and explore with innovative tools that are typically inaccessible: 3D printers, laser cutters, open-source electronics, and more! Supported by passionate mentors, they have the opportunity to become involved with positive making activities first-hand. The broader community and its spaces are evolving over time and both success and failure generate great lessons to be shared. One success that we are joyful to see is the creative play coming out of Cairo. The beautiful lamp below was created in a competition co-sponsored by GEMSI and run by Mahmoud, a GEMSI member, out of FabLab Egypt and Giza Hackerspace.

Here's a story to help you imagine a vision for the future that we think is beautiful:\nImagine you are a young Iraqi student, just graduating college. Opportunities to work in the country are few, and working outside Iraq is difficult due to strict visa requirements. Your country still experiences violence weekly, while also facing many technical challenges characteristic of a developing country. You want to build the country, you want to share \u2013 but you feel isolated. You hear about a group of people who have an open space near the center of town where you can build almost anything. One day you decide to see what it\u2019s about. There, you find others like you: looking at the world around them and thinking about how they can start creating solutions. They are creating open source medical devices, filling potholes in city roads, creating clean street initiatives, or making alternative energy products to fix the intermittent power issues of Baghdad. These are people taking initiative. They are looking to take ownership of their cities and build the change they want to see \u2013 serving their communities on the most direct level. At this open space, you have finally found a home to put your talents and energy to work. You\u2019ve found a group you can trust, they are courageous, curious, and want to help you create a better future. You feel happy, you feel capable, you've found your people.\nWe are eager to see the attitudes of hope and initiative proliferate through creativity, problem solving, and service. To make this happen, we are running a few concurrent and sequential events described below.\nOur Strategy!\nEvent 1: Riwaya wa Bidaya \u2013 Stories and Beginnings (Story deadline Sept 22, 2012)\nRiwaya wa Bidaya is a program to help us draw out stories of engagement and courage. We will use the TEDxBaghdad and GEMSI networks to gather stories and showcase the creative talent of community members as they come across challenges in their neighborhoods and cities. On Oct 5th, the top stories will be showcased to hackerspaces around the world during a GEMSI-hosted live-streamed discussion from Baghdad to the hackerspaces of the world. Through some clever timing, these stories will also be showcased at the Share Conference in Beirut. Riwaya wa Bidaya builds connections and provides a platform from which stories of initiative can grow. In addition, the best visual stories will be illustrated by a professional comic artist. These comics will then be transformed into a self-published book and proudly presented in both English and Arabic.\nEvent 2: \u2018Amal wa Amal \u2013 Work and Hope (Oct 18-19th, 2012)\nCollaborating with our storytellers from Riwaya wa Bidaya, we will run a two-day hackerspace just before TEDxBaghdad, which takes place October 20. Workshops will be conducted based primarily on the stories and projects proposed at Riwaya wa Bidaya. We will invite local artists to run workshops on their crafts as well as run skillshares that promote the idea that everyone has something valuable to share. The hackerspaces of Beirut and Cairo will assist in the organization and development of this event and will host their own workshops to share ideas and engage in the community. Our goal is to provide a space that bridges and bonds together the individuals and communities which are the heartbeat of the hackerspace movement that is growing in the Middle East.\nWhere your (tax deductible) donations will go:\nAll of our time is volunteered, but we're looking for your support to fund these events. Specifically, we need funds for:\nThe live streaming set up and crew\nPrinting the comics\nTraveling to Iraq \nBringing hackers from Beirut and Cairo to Iraq \nInsurance while in Iraq \nMaterials and rental equipment for the 2 day hackerspace \nVideo supplies and editing time to create video documentation to share what we're learning about hackerspace development in the Middle East with as many people in the Middle East and North Africa as possible\nPromotional materials for the events\nArtist and speaker honorariums\nSee you in Baghdad!\nDon't be a stranger!

Now, we want to take this to the next level!  If we can raise $100k, we'll redesign the expensive CNC laser cutter in the Pocket Factory and release the designs under an open-source license for anyone to use and build upon.  And if we can raise $150k, we'll make the solar pocket factories solar-powered.  Solar-powered machines that make solar energy.  Kapow!  Tell your neighbors, tell your friends, help pitch in.  Let's make this thing HAPPEN!\nAnd now, back to the main kickstarter:\n*************************************************************************************\nWhat if you could have electricity anywhere there was sunlight? What if the charge on your phone could last for weeks, the poorest, most remote homes in the world could have electric home lighting, and adding a USB charge outlet was as simple as slapping a sticker onto a sunlit wall? All of these are becoming possible thanks to microsolar: small solar panels that are small and cheap enough to go anywhere.\nWe are Shawn Frayne and Alex Hornstein, two independent inventors who fell in love with the dream of clean energy, everywhere, for everyone. Inspired by this dream, we built a half-dozen products based on microsolar panels, like solar lights and distributed USB power grids, but in the process, we learned that the current solar panels leave a lot to be desired: the panels break after a few years, they're expensive, and they're not made very well. We loved the possibilities that microsolar offered, and we kept asking ourselves, \"Could we make it better?\" \nThis simple question led us on a voyage of investigation and discovery through the world of small, low-cost solar; through rotting solar factories in Southern China to shivering, soaked motorcycle trips across unelectrified tropical islands in the Philippines and countless late nights working on prototypes in an industrial building in Hong Kong.  And all along the way, we kept asking questions, and started to find answers.  Would it make a difference if we could make better, cheaper microsolar?  Yes!  Could we invent a way to make microsolar better?  You bet!\nIn search of solar truths\nWe're six months into our exploration, and we've done a lot of observing, thinking, designing, prototyping and testing.  We found that about 50% of the cost of a microsolar panel is in the assembly:  every part of the panel is made by hand, from breaking apart the silicon wafers into small pieces, to soldering them, gluing them onto a panel and covering them with plastic.  We also found that many of these panels are flawed--about fifteen percent of the microsolar panels are rejected and thrown out because they were soldered imperfectly.  Finally, the materials used are cut-rate, and will fail in a few years as UV from the sun breaks down the cheap plastic that coats the panels, even though the silicon cells trapped inside can easily work for twenty-five years.  Looking at all these problems, we started coming up with solutions.\nWe figured that if we could automate the production and testing, we could save about 25% of the cost of a panel.  Precise, repeatable assembly and automated quality testing could cut down on the number of panels that have manufacturing defects and help us rework the ones that do, further decreasing our costs.  We could put some of those savings into using high quality materials, so our panels will last longer and gather more light.  As an end result, we could make microsolar panels about 30% cheaper than the existing panels and make them  last five times longer in the sun.\nSo we got to work.  we've spent every cent we can scrounge building a Solar Pocket Factory, a small, automated machine that can make solar panels anywhere in the world, at a pace and quality that beats a sprawling factory. We work with a small team of brilliant people from around the world who put their own inspiration into this machine, improving and refining it. Our baby is getting pretty good, now, cranking out solar panels and doing it right.  But if we want to impact the world of solar, we need to scale up to get our panels out of our workshops and into people's hands.  And we want to do that with kickstarter, making this the first crowd-funded advance in clean technology.\nSure, we could dig up a couple of suits and run around trying to convince People With Money that we're the next big thing.  But if we're wearing suits and giving presentations, we're not doing what we love to do:  invent.  And that's why we're coming to Kickstarter.  We want to try something a little new and a little crazy:  we want to fund a new clean-tech invention with crowd support, and in return, bring our backers along with us, in a front-row seat as we work to change the world of microsolar.\nThe Pocket Factory making a solar panel\nWe're inventors today because we grew up reading stories of great inventors and the projects that they dove into.  And now that we're diving into a project of our own, we want to open it up to the world.\nThe first part of this is to share the tools we use when we work with solar.  We've made hundreds of solar panels by hand, and it turns out that it's pretty easy and fast to make your own solar panel to power your own electronics and projects.  We've worked out some neat ways to make solar panel, at home, without any fancy skills or materials.  We can power arduinos off solar harvested from ordinary indoor lights, charge our phones with chargers made in a few minutes out of household materials, and build our own solar battery chargers.  We've put up step-by-step instructions for our projects on instructables, so anyone can make our projects at home and experiment with building their own solar panels.  \nWant to see how easy it is to put solar in your life?  Here's a video from one of our instructables showing how to make a solar-powered cell phone charger in just a few minutes:\nThe materials we use to do this are pretty simple:  glue, silicon cells, glass and plastic, and we provide links for anyone to buy them on their own.  But to make it easy to get started, we put together The Solar Pocket Kit, with everything you need to make your own panels.  These are the same techniques and materials that we use when we're experimenting in the lab, and the silicon cells in the kit will be custom scored and broken using a part of our solar factory.  By getting this kit, you get an easy way to experiment with solar, and you support us as we build up the factory, and publish more DIY solar projects along the way.  \nThe Solar Pocket Kit\nWe're also offering the Solar Explorer's Kit--the Solar Pocket Kit along with an assortment of devices that you can power with the panels you create, and the Solar Phone Charger Kit--the Solar Pocket Kit and the components you need to assemble a smartphone charger.  Photos are below, and full descriptions are in the rewards section on the right side of the page.\nThe Solar Experimenter's Kit\nThe Solar Phone Charger Kit\nIn addition to sharing our tools, we want to share the story of the invention.  We're trying to do something pretty ambitious:  disrupt the billion dollar microsolar industry from a couple of tiny workshops.  It's not going to be easy.  Along the way, there'll be breakthroughs, explosions, moments of strife, hope, bizarre discoveries, hard work, tales of social injustice, good people and an awful lot of solar panels.  We'll capture all of this, releasing it in weekly videos and stories as we go.  And after a year, we'll collect the postings and put together a book that tells the story of the evolution of the solar pocket factory, complete with exclusive behind-the-scenes photos and stories.  By backing us and reading our story, you get an inside view into the world of solar, and you'll help us make our dream a reality.  We don't know how this will all turn out, but we're making two promises to our backers:  we're gonna do everything possible, and then some, to make solar pocket factories real, and we're going to be brutally honest in our writing.\nFor us, working on the solar pocket factory is already a dream come true.  We get to invent new solar technologies, and there's nothing that we'd rather be doing.  And now we're at a point where our invention can start to bring solar into people's lives on a large scale, and we need Kickstarter's help to get us there.  Anything you can contribute, large or small, helps push us along, and for your help, we are profoundly grateful.\nShine!\n***************************************\n  STRETCH GOAL UPDATE!!!!!!\n***************************************\n...And now, for a bit more on the stretch goals:\nIf we reach $100k, we'll re-engineer the laser cutter from scratch and open-source our lasercutter designs. The single most expensive item in a Solar Pocket Factory is the CNC laser scorer that scores the raw silicon cells to whatever size we need. Off the shelf, a 50W laser scorer costs ~$10k and is big--about the size of an ice chest. To develop a compact, low-cost pocket factory, we need to re-engineer this laser cutter from the ground up to be small, integratable, and cheap. We'd like to get the cost of this laser down to $1,000, buidlable using readily available components. But lasers are good for all kinds of things, not just scoring silicon. If we can reach $100k, we'll release our designs and instructions under an unrestrictive, Creative Commons 3.0 license, for anyone to make their own or build upon in future designs. Because as long as we're building little robot factories, we should make sure they have powerful lasers.\nIf we reach $150k, we'll solar power the Solar Pocket Factories. Can you dig it, Kickstarter? Solar-powered machines that make solar panels! We've already got machines like the Rep Rap that can make the parts to make more of themselves. What if we could make machines that can make the power to power themselves? Being able to make grid-independent production is a big deal not just for us, but for the new field of distributed manufacturing as a whole. Because as long as we're building little robot factories with lasers, we should make them self-replicating and self-sustaining.\nThese are big dreams, but we like 'em that way. We've given these a lot of thought, and we know that we can make this happen. These are extensions of the Solar Pocket Factory concept that make it more accessible, more powerful, and more disruptive. With your help, we can make our Solar Pocket Factory a bucking bronco, right out of the gate. So saddle up, pardner! Help us hit these goals and build some wonderful technology. Help us get the word out--tell your friends, your family, tell everyone you know! And above all else, help us do big things with small solar!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Hello world", "update_content": "Patrons,\nNUMBER FIVE IS ALIVE!!!\nJust kidding.

Unfortunately, I was not carrying a power supply. So in turn, I had to wait until I reached my lab before I could power my circuit board to test the new firmware. This new innovative project, the USB Based Variable Power Supply, will solve this issue effectively, affordably, and reliably.\nA quality power supply is crucial for anyone who is into computer engineering but most variable power supplies are AC/DC, which are large and very inconvenient to carry while traveling.\nVariPower-USB-500A is open source hardware. All hardware design files and firmware source code are released under the GPL v2 license. It's a great way to get started with electronics!\nDownload file: http://www.etonnet.com/download.aspx\nOriginally I used an LM317T 3 terminal regulator to build the first prototype. It works, but I found the voltage drop under a load is too high. Obviously, this is not a good solution for the USB based variable power supply, since the max voltage for USB power is around 5V. If the output voltage drop is too high, it doesn\u2019t meet the developer\u2019s requirements. After I compared a bunch of different regulators performance and cost, finally, I chose MP1401 as the voltage regulator chip. This chip has a very low voltage drop (around 0.17v) under a load, plus it supports high current output; although the max current for USB is 500mA, using an external AC/DC USB adapter it allows higher current power output (up to 2A). MP1401 also supports a wide input voltage. With the same PCB board, we built one universal battery charging station with a 12V input. The output voltage is adjustable so It can charge a single cell li-ion battery or multiple serialized li-ion batteries. To help the user easily find the output voltage, I provided a \u201c3-digit\u201d segment LED to instantly display the real time voltage. An R8C 16 bit Renesas microcontroller is used to monitor the voltage with 10mV accuracy.  \nFor most circuits, 1.2v to 5V voltage and low current is enough. In case a user needs higher voltage or higher current output power, then an additional USB based AC/DC power adapter is required. \nNow, I carry this portable power supply in my laptop bag all the time . I can use it to power most of my circuit boards. I can use it to quickly check LEDs and find any that are malfunctioning. I am also considering the addition of a new feature in the firmware to turn this unit in to a USB based voltage meter as well. I find this is a very useful device and I hope you will too.\nPlease support this project and get power for your Arduino, BeagleBoard, Uno32, chipKIT Max32, hacks, and any other circuitry projects you may have.\nBy the way, the T-Shirts look great, here's a peek:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "ETONNET LLC\n2 created \u00b7 6 backed\nmike@etonnet.com - an inventor.

That's why we designed the NeuroDreamer sleep mask.  Through ambient music and gently fading lights the NeuroDreamer sleep mask weaves a subtle spectrum of brainwave frequencies -- the same spectrum that naturally appear in a person as they fall asleep.  Simply close your eyes and listen to the music, and let your brainwaves do the rest...\nThe NeuroDreamer sleep mask is made of super comfortable memory foam, with a washable soft cotton cover.  Use it whenever and wherever you want to get some quality rest -- on a plane, on a break from work, or at night in your bed.\nWe\u2019re excited to offer these two Kickstarter-only, special editions of NeuroDreamer sleep mask!\n     * Meditation version\n     * Lucid Dreaming version\nSee premiums to your right, and more description below.\nWe all need rest.\nBut we don\u2019t always get it.  In our hectic modern lives, we\u2019re frequentlyrushing from one thing to the next all day long, and by the time we finally do rest our heads on our pillows at night, we all too often find our minds racing in circles of thought, with stress getting in the way of drifting off into dreamland.\nPerhaps you don\u2019t rest very easily on a long airplane ride.  Or maybe, like me, you have trouble with jet lag after flying from one continent to another.\nThis is why we created the NeuroDreamer sleep mask.  Through soothing sounds and fading lights that go along with the brainwaves of relaxation and sleep, the NeuroDreamer sleep mask can gently guide you and your brain into the rest you want.  That\u2019s the idea.  Worth a try for you?\nIs the NeuroDreamer\u2122 sleep mask for everyone?\nNot everyone, no.  Not many things are.  But a NeuroDreamer sleep mask may be helpful for you.\nNeuroDreamer works with light and sound to gently guide your brainwaves into a pattern of rest.  Research has shown that this method works for about 70% of people tested.  Even if you are not in that majority, you may benefit from the comfortable memory foam sleep mask that filters out light and absorbs external sound.  You may also enjoy the soothing, restful effects of the NeuroDreamer\u2019s beautiful sounds.\nWe have tested the NeuroDreamer sleep mask on lots of people who wanted to try it out, and they overwhelmingly liked it.\nThere is a small subset of people who are sensitive to blinking lights, and perhaps even to brainwave frequencies embedded into sound.  Many devices and environments that use blinking lights, including strobe lights, cameras, disco lights, TVs, and NeuroDreamer sleep mask, MAY CAUSE SEIZURES in this subset of people.  Please read more for the complete WARNING and disclaimer...\nHow does the NeuroDreamer\u2122 sleep mask work?\nThe NeuroDreamer sleep mask is an entrainment device that uses binaural beats and fading lights.\n\u201cEntrainment\u201d is the the process of externally presenting brainwave frequencies to the brain, allowing it to synchronize to those frequencies.  A \u201cbinaural beat\u201d refers to the frequency that is perceived when two tones that are close together in pitch are played in each ear.\nThrough light and sound, the NeuroDreamer sleep mask generates a sequence of brainwave frequencies that correspond to the natural sequence of brainwave activity as observed in a person as they fall asleep.  These frequencies are produced using binaural beats embedded within beautiful music, and synchronized with fading lights \u2013 all generated by the NeuroDreamer sleep mask\u2019s microcontroller, which is concealed inside the mask\u2019s memory foam.\nThe insides of the NeuroDreamer sleep mask\nThe NeuroDreamer sleep mask is an advancement over prior entrainment devices which attempt to entrain the brain with only a single brainwave frequency at a time.  The NeuroDreamer sleep mask uses up to four brainwave frequencies simultaneously (mixed at different amplitudes), to more closely replicate the full spectrum of frequencies present in a person who is falling asleep.\nIn addition to binaural beats, the NeuroDreamer sleep mask utilizes a second method for audio entrainment.  An ambient noise, somewhat like ocean surf, is played in one ear. The same surf sound is played in the opposing ear, but with a slight time delay (called \u201cphase shift\u201d).  By changing the length of the time delay, the brain perceives the surf sound as moving between the ears, setting up a \"beat\".\nThe NeuroDreamer sleep mask has 3 buttons.\nWith one button, the user has a choice of five different songs, all with this same full spectrum of frequencies, to help them rest.  Four of the songs are musical, and one is an ambient ocean song.\nIn the ambient ocean song, the NeuroDreamer sleep mask uses phase shifted noise sources rather than binaural beats for audio entrainment. This is offered to provide an array of pleasing audio choices for the user.\nWith the second button the user can change the volume of the music, and with the third button the user can change the brightness of the lights (or turn them off entirely).\nTogether with the ergonomic memory foam mask, the choices available with the three buttons give all users a comfortable, enjoyable, and restful experience.\nFor more information on the operation of the NeuroDreamer sleep mask, the full User's Manual can be read on the NeuroDreamer website.\nIf you would like the complete, geeky details on how the NeuroDreamer sleep mask works, they are available on the documentation page of the NeuroDreamer website.\nSpecial Rewards!\nKickstarter-only:  get a NeuroDreamer sleep mask at a 10% discount, plus free shipping!\nThe planned retail price for the NeuroDreamer is $100 each -- but for our Kickstarter campaign, we are offering a production sleep mask for only $90 -- a 10% discount that includes free shipping in the US!\nSpecial Lucid Dreaming Version \u2013 Kickstarter-only!\nFor people who give $100: you will receive a special Lucid Dreaming edition of the NeuroDreamer sleep mask after production.  In this version, with the push of one button:\n   * get the rest you want with our great sleep sequences\n   * control your dreams with visual and auditory cues to trigger lucid dreaming\n   * an optional alarm to wake you up so you can write down your dreams\n   * an optional alarm to wake you up when you want\nAll of the features of this version of NeuroDreamer sleep mask are configurable by the mask itself without the need of an external computer. \nProduction mask in October, plus Kickstarter-only prototype without waiting!\nIf you give $180, as a premium you get a production sleep mask when they are ready, plus a fully functional prototype as soon as the Kickstarter campaign is funded -- no waiting! If you're interested, please act fast, since this is limited to the first 200 people only.\nSpecial Meditation Version -- Kickstarter-only!\nFor people who give $225, as a premium we will send you two NeuroDreamer sleep masks after production: one for rest, and the other with a custom, Kickstarter-only meditation brainwave sequence.\nPlease see the list of all of the way cool premiums available on the column to the right!\nOur NeuroDreamer.com website is not yet complete, but will be by the time the Kickstarter campaign is over. You can check it out now, if you'd like:\nhttp://www.NeuroDreamer.com\nHelp us help you get the rest you want, and in so doing, help us help others too! We all need quality rest.\nHow will the money be used? What's the plan?\nAbout a year ago I made a bunch of prototypes for testing purposes.  Lots of people tried them out and gave us their valuable thoughts and feelings, all of which we used to make the NeuroDreamer sleep mask much better at its task.  We also used the prototypes for solving all of our manufacturing issues.  It took a year to perfect, but we're finally ready!\nI\u2019ve already bought many of the required parts.  To purchase the remaining materials, and to start the manufacturing process, we need $66,000.  Any and all additional money will help us make more units and ship them from our manufacturer in China to the US.  It will also help us create version 2 of the NeuroDreamer sleep mask, with even more cool features.\nThe manufacturer I use is called Etonnet, and is located in Shanghai, China.  I've used them for all of my products since 2007, including TV-B-Gone remote controls, and my open hardware kits.  As well as providing high quality manufactured products, they treat (and pay) their employees well, and still give me a decent price -- all of which is important!  I visit them every year, they're great.  I look forward to them manufacturing NeuroDreamer sleep masks as well.\nThis is an Open Source Project\nI make a living creating and selling open source projects that I love.  All of my projects are open source.  Up until now, my main project has been TV-B-Gone universal remote controls (I\u2019ve sold 390,000 of them).  I also have a bunch of kits for people to learn electronics.  You can see all of my projects here:\nhttp://www.cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe_mfaire.php\nOpen Source is a great way to go!  I love sharing my knowledge with anyone who is interested.  Others can learn from what I share, and if they wish, can improve upon my projects, and then share their improvements with me, thus making my product much better than it would have been working on my own.  I can then, in turn, share these improvements with the world, and the cycle continues.\nAlso with open source, people can use my ideas for their own cool purposes.  Open source encourages creativity and innovation.\nAll of the above is why the NeuroDreamer sleep mask is an open source project.\nThe only requirements for the open source license I use are:  give me credit, and share what you use from me as open source, with the same license.  The license I use is \u201cCC BY-SA 3.0\u201d\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/\nEverything we have, including all source code, schematics, and PCB layouts, will be on the NeuroDreamer.com website after the Kickstarter campaign:  http://www.NeuroDreamer.com/documentation.html\nInitial documentation can be found at the above link.  Please check back, as we\u2019ll be adding more as we go along.\nThanks and Acknowledgements\nHuge thanks to my friend Vladimir Gitlevich, who is responsible for the quality of our project's video.\nThanks to my friend Nina Paley for her slightly modified graphics for the sleep mask, taken from her extremely beautiful, animated, autobiographical, open source film, \"Sita Sings the Blues\", which anyone can download for free.\nMany thanks to all of the people at Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco, where a lot of people tested early versions of the NeuroDreamer sleep mask, helping make it way better.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Release of the first batch!, and a favor?", "update_content": "Hey Everyone,\nI feel really lucky to have had such a fantastic group of Kickstarter backers.

Get involved and see where we're headed next!\n\nWhat's Modkit Micro?\nModkit Micro is a graphical programming environment for microcontrollers.  Microcontrollers allow programmers and engineers to add behaviors to everyday objects and electronic gadgets.  We created Modkit Micro to bring the world of microcontroller programming to the masses.  Modkit Micro helps almost anyone to make almost anything smarter through a simple, yet powerful visual programming interface. \nHow does Modkit Micro work?\nWe designed Modkit Micro to be as intuitive as possible, while still retaining the power and flexibility of a real programming environment.  See the workflow below to get an idea of just how intuitive Modkit Micro is:  \nThis looks like Scratch, how is it related?\nModkit Micro is based on years of research at the MIT Media Lab including the popular Scratch project, so it will look familiar to the over 1 million kids and novice programmers who have already been introduced to Scratch.\nWhat Hardware does Modkit Micro Support?\nWe developed Modkit Micro to be flexible enough to support many different microcontroller platforms and boards.  See the list below for our currently supported boards:\nIf you are looking for hardware that we currently don't support, make sure to check out the FAQs at the bottom of this page for info on requesting additional board support.\nIs Modkit Micro for kids?\nYes. We recommend Modkit Micro for kids of all ages \u2014 from 6 to 106!\nModkit Micro is really for anyone who wants to add interactivity to their everyday lives \u2014 without dealing with the obstacles associated with traditional programming.  This includes artists, inventors, kids, designers, engineers, educators, students and everyday makers. We've tested Modkit Micro with these diverse audiences in workshop settings, Maker Faires and our Learn 2 Teach, Teach 2 Learn educational program.  \nHere are some clips from a short 40 minute workshop for elementary school students at TEDxKIDS Brussels.  Participants made a tangible version of the standard \"Hello World\" project by tracing their hands on paper and programming servos to wave at their command:\nWhy is this important?\nOver the last few years, the DIY/Maker communities have pushed to make electronics and microcontrollers more accessible.  As a result, microcontrollers are no longer just for engineers \u2014 anyone can now pick up an Arduino board at their local Radioshack!  Now that microcontrollers are even easier to find and buy, they should be just as easy to interact with and program.  Modkit Micro works to make microcontrollers accessible to anyone, regardless of their particular background or skill set.  \nNow that the DIY/Maker communities have helped move microcontrollers to the mainstream, it is important to support projects like Modkit Micro that help to democratize programming.  By supporting Modkit Micro, you are supporting a tool that will enable the Maker mindset and culture to reach a much wider audience, including schools, community centers, art spaces, and basically anyone else with the desire to create.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe're launching Modkit Micro on Kickstarter to produce copies of the desktop version on a flash drive and to provide early access to the online version to our supporters.  Unlike most Kickstarter campaigns, we wanted to give our supporters something before our campaign is even finished.

Let's make that easier.\nA detailed draft specification of the Standard Information Sharing Label can be found at http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/Standard+Information+Sharing+Label\nWith your help, we will take this technical outline and make it ready for use by websites everywhere. The funds raised by this project will be used to design a user-friendly, beautiful, easy-to-read version the label and produce a short compelling video to introduce the label to the world. We\u2019ll promote the label through the Information Sharing Work Group, the Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium, the Internet Identity Workshop, and other appropriate venues.\nSimple. Easy.

The Creatures, Elly the elephant, Rory the rhino, and Geno the giraffe, are each made up of cardboard pieces that you assemble using tabs-and-slots. By turning the wire handle the creatures come alive with a simple mechanical motion.\nKinetic Creatures also...\nencourage people to build with their hands, minds and imagination. Use sustainable and recyclable materials and support local manufacturing.\nKinetic Creatures takes a complex mechanical linkage, popularized in Theo Jansen\u2019s Strandbeest, and makes it accessible through an easy assembly and friendly cardboard form.\nA collaboration between Alyssa- a Visual Arts Teacher and Artist and Lucas- an Industrial Designer, the Kinetic Creatures are intended to encourage building and thinking creatively at home and in the classroom. \nHow big are they?\nBigger than a bread box. Here are the dimensions:\nElly the elephant is 11 1/2\" tall x 15\" long, Rory the rhino is 9 1/2\" tall x 15 1/2\" long, Geno the giraffe is 21 1/2\" tall x 18\" long. \nCan they walk on their own?\nWhy yes, our gear kit allows the animals to be powered by a small electric motor and laser-cut wooden gears. The creature\u2019s insides are an open platform for mechanical and electrical additions. \nThe Gear Kits:\nBuilding the Gear Kit requires only glue.  Both Elmer's glue or Superglue work great. We will prepare and solder the Gear Kit's wires or you can let us know if you would like to do the soldering yourself!\nThe Kinetic Creatures are an open platform for paper robotics and if you are super into electronics and you want to build your own mechanism, the platform specs will be open sourced on our website. \nThe Gear Kits contain: wooden gears, a geared axel, a motor, AAA battery case with on/off switch.\nKinetic Creatures Art Workshops:\nAlyssa will be using Kinetic Creatures in her art classes and workshops to inspire and encourage youth to be builders, thinkers and inventors. Students will learn about Industrial Design, Kinetic Sculptures and the process of developing an idea into a product. Kinetic Creatures allows students to succeed through an accessible assembly of a complicated mechanical project.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nKinetic Creatures are a culmination of four years of design, research and play. The kits are ready- they have been prototyped, developed and are currently made using a laser cutter, but it takes over two hours and expensive laser time to build each kit. \nNow that the designs are done, we want to cast the patterns onto die-cut-tools at a local cardboard manufacturing facility. Using a die-press, the time-per-kit comes way down. That means we will be able to share the Kinetic Creatures with hundreds of makers and art students. \nHelp us send Kinetic Creatures into the world, and we'll mail you one of the first kits.\nThank you for your support!\nAlso, a special thanks and shout out to friends near and far & our supportive families & Elizabeth and Nicholas at Cathedral Laser LLC & Jason at Portland Bindery.\nMusic credit: Eric Steuer, Alastair Cameron & Grapes.\nThank you to Shayla, Dae'Onna, Alex, Alexander, Marco, Sofia and Lisa- my amazing 8th grade art students whose insight, creativity and humor make projects like these worthwhile.\nKinetic Creatures are recommended for ages 11 and up because they contain wire and small cardboard parts.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Send us your Creature Photos!", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nWe have exciting news- after many months of designing, building, coordinating, soldering, lasercutting, visiting factories and kitting- we\u2019re very excited to report that we\u2019ve started shipping your Kinetic Creatures!\nThe bulk of the national orders have already shipped and the international orders are soon to follow.

You look around at your surroundings and begin to wonder what's going on.

A world filled with a tragic love story, a strange haunted estate to explore, and an emotional, dynamic soundtrack. \nThis game will be playable on your iOS or Android powered mobile Device. \nThe Game play is simple, you navigate from room to room,Finding items and solving puzzles in an effort to find the cure to your new found vampirism and bring an end to the Curse of Shadow House. This is the first in a series of adventures for the character..(who's name has not been finalized)\nI really just want to make this a game where you can relax and enjoy the story, graphics, sound and mood of it all while exploring and solving the puzzles. No stress of zombies chasing after you, just you taking it all in and using your wits to unlock the mystery.\nThe Game is really starting to come together well, but i need money to make it a reality. It looks and sounds great so far, but with so much to do, I cannot get the time I need to get it done without your help. Your help will  enable me to spend all of my time developing the game and that means a better game. You know how it works.\nI am personally creating all of the artwork in the game, composing and performing the music, writing the stroy and putting it together so it all works well on your mobile device. Since the nature of the gameplay is pretty basic, programming the game is the easy part.\nThe hard part is actually creating the graphics and the music and because I'm not getting paid to build this game, I need you to act as the publisher and In return, I'm offering you some VERY cool rewards.\nIn addition to art prints and soundtrack downloads, I am personally handcrafting Two of the Books that are found in the game, and you get a choice of either one for supporting the project at the $50.00 reward level. I will be including a unique original sketch and a personal thank you, in each book as well. The rest of the pages are blank for you to let your own creative inspirations flow. I am also handcrafting the necklace that is found in the game, and I'm including that at the 25.00 reward level.

It's as Easy as Downloading an App.\nPebble is the first watch built for the 21st century. It's infinitely customizable, with beautiful downloadable watchfaces and useful internet-connected apps. Pebble connects to iPhone and Android smartphones using Bluetooth, alerting you with a silent vibration to incoming calls, emails and messages. While designing Pebble, we strove to create a minimalist yet fashionable product that seamlessly blends into everyday life. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH APPS\nApps bring Pebble to life. We're building some amazing apps for Pebble. Cyclists can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. Runners get a similar set of data displayed on their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. Don't worry about the rain, Pebble is water-resistant! If you're a golfer, feel free to bring Pebble onto the course. We're working with Freecaddie to create a great golf rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses world-wide. Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to the green right on your wrist. These apps will be the first, with more in the works!  \nCUSTOMIZE WITH WATCHFACES\nPebble can change instantly, thanks to its brilliant, outdoor-readable electronic-paper (e-paper) display. We've designed tons of watchfaces already, with more coming every day. Choose your favourite watchfaces using Pebble's iPhone or Android app. Then as the day progresses, effortlessly switch to the one that matches your mood, activity or outfit. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you need to stay on top of things, Pebble can help with vibrating notifications, messages and alerts. Dismiss a notification with a shake of your wrist. Don't worry, it's easy to disable all notifications.\nIncoming Caller ID\nEmail (Gmail or any IMAP email account)\nCalendar Alerts\nFacebook Messages\nTwitter\nWeather Alerts\nSilent vibrating alarm and timer\nAndroid users can also receive Text Messages (SMS) on their Pebble. Unfortunately iPhone does not expose this data. Have any suggestions for other notification types? Leave us a message in the comments! \nCUSTOMIZE BY CODING\nWant your watch to tell you when your next bus is leaving? Maybe you're jonesing to see your compile status or recent github commits.. Think push notifications, directly to your watch using the data connection on your phone. Want to check-in on your watch, or create an app that can monitor your sleep? Pebble can send data from the accelerometer and buttons back up to the internet. \nPebble can receive simple alerts and notifications from if this then that (ifttt.com) or our web-facing RESTful endpoint. More adventurous developers can use the Pebble SDK, with its Arduino-like abstractions and simple C structure, to gain full control of the watch. Multiple apps can run on Pebble, along side watchfaces and regular notifications.\nLoad apps using Bluetooth \n144 x 168 pixel display black and white e-paper\nBluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)\n4 buttons\nVibrating motor\n3 axis accelerometer with gesture detection\nDistribute apps via Pebble watchapp store\nDetailed SDK specs are available on our Pebble Dev Blog.\nHow does it work?\nPebble connects by Bluetooth to your iPhone or Android device. Setting up Pebble is as easy as downloading the Pebble app onto your phone. All software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your Pebble.\nCompatibility\niPhone 3GS, 4, 4S running iOS 5 or any iPod Touch with iOS 5.\nAndroid devices running OS 2.3 and up. Works great with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)!\nUnfortunately Pebble does not work with Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, or Palm phones at this time.\nWhere we're at\nWe\u2019ve been working on smartwatches for over 3 years now. The Pebble that you see in the video is a real, working prototype.\nWith your support, we can bring Pebble onto wrists worldwide. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will help fund:\n- Production tooling\n- Large component order\n- Global Bluetooth certification\nREWARDS\nEach Pebble has a textured plastic case, shatter resistant lens with an anti-reflective optical coating and a custom-designed 22mm rubber strap. You'll also receive a special USB cable that recharges the watch.\nColor Option: Voter's Choice You're part of the design process! Three color options are already set: Arctic White, Jet Black and Cherry Red. If you back any of the color options, we'll email you a survey after the project closes so you can vote on a new, 4th color option. Later on, we'll email you again asking which of the final color options you'd like to select. Even if you don't like the Voter's Choice, you'll be able to choose from Red/White/Black.\n$99 - Early Bird: 200 Black watches available.\n$115 - One Black Pebble.\n$125 - One Color Pebble.\n$220 - Two Black Pebbles.\n$235 - Prototype Pebble for early app development + one Color Pebble.\n$240 - Two Color Pebbles.\n$550 - Five Color Pebbles.\n$1000 - Ten Color Pebbles.\n$1,250 - Custom watchface + five Color Pebbles.\nFAQ\nQ.

If you think Remee deserves to be available at Brookstone, vote here!\nLucid Dreaming, really?\nYes, really! For nearly as long as recorded human history, the idea of consciously recognizing and controlling our dreams has been around. From the Hindu Upanishads to Aristotle's On Dreams, people have been puzzling out the mysteries of lucid dreaming for centuries. These days, there's more information on Lucid Dreaming, the science behind it, and modes and methods of experiencing it than there ever has been. Yet the idea still remains relatively unknown to the average person.\nTo us, this is kind of a shame, sort of like being unaware of the existence of books or music. Lucid Dreaming can be one of the most profound things you can experience in this life - but explaining it to someone who has never done it can be a bit difficult. It is so visceral and hard to put into words that it can rarely be related in a meaningful way to a non-lucid dreamer. Conversely, when a lucid dreamer meets another lucid dreamer comin' through the rye, general excitement and lots of note-comparing ensues. It almost feels like a secret club. We want you to be in that club, too. \nGreat, but why would I want to do it?\nThis is an easy one. You saw in our video some of the more creative applications of Lucid Dreaming. Sure, you can perform any feat from the sublime to the superhuman. But the potential benefits of lucid dreaming are truly limitless. Flying through the galaxy riding a giant kitten might not be your thing, but what about having a roundtable discussion with your ego and id? Maybe you can finally get over your fear of public speaking in the safety of your own dreams. What about trying to write a short story, or compose a melody? Paul McCartney and Mary Shelley, among others, might have a lot to say about harnessing the creative power of dreams. Build skyscrapers in your mind, attack unsolved mathematical problems, or just try and figure out what happened at the end of Lost. Lucid dreaming is a path, a journey - what lies at the end of the path, magnificent or mundane, is your call.\nOk, but why Remee?\nThere's a lot more to Lucid Dreaming than simply acknowledging that it's real and crossing your fingers. It's tough! Your body has a been dreaming one way for your entire life, so teaching it to dream a new way requires some effort. Dozens of websites have cropped up where lucid dreamers, novice and expert alike, flock to swap stories and tips. Some of these techniques include Reality Checks - a quick \"lucid test\" that requires forming simple habits during waking life that you then perform during dreams. Other methods, like WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming) involve taking a very active role in the process of falling asleep, which can lead to entering directly into a dream from wakefulness. Remee aims to make all of this a lot easier by providing recognizable external input into your dreams. You may find that you don't have to remember to ask \"am I dreaming?\" and count your fingers - with its customizable light patterns, Remee is doing the reminding for you. You may find yourself sitting at an outdoor bistro with Ellen Page and suddenly a soft pattern of red lights appears in your field of vision. Back and forth. Back and forth. \"That looks familiar.\" you think. Wait. Remee! That's Remee! I'm dreaming! This is a dream! \nBoom. Congratulations. You're lucid. With luck, and a little help from Remee, you can stay that way!\nHere's some great info for people new to the concept:\nWNYC's Radiolab - We've been listening to Radiolab for ages, so we thought it was great when they recently released a short about someone using lucid dreaming to overcome a recurring nightmare.  The podcast has a great overview of lucid dreaming and is as usual well produced and entertaining.\n/r/LucidDreaming - Reddit's active, knowledgeable, helpful Lucid Dreaming community. 25,000 dreamers strong and growing!\nLucidipedia - A veritable treasure trove of information about the practice of lucid dreaming. Tips, tricks, & techniques.\nExploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge - from the father of all modern advancements in lucid dreaming research, and the creator of several useful lucid techniques, comes this, the Lucid Dreamer's bible.\nSo how does it work?\nSleep stages are divided into two main categories: non-REM sleep and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, where dreams typically occur.  Over the course of the night a sleeper will cycle through the five stages of sleep a number of times with the REM stages lasting longer and longer towards morning. \nIn default mode, Remee targets these long chunks of REM sleep towards the end of the sleep period. Before bed, turn Remee on, fine tune the brightness of the lights (if needed) and then go to sleep.  Remee will wait for an initial long delay, usually 4-5 hours, until you're in the heart of the heavy REM stages, before initializing light patterns.  After the initial long delay Remee will display light patterns for 15-20 seconds with a second shorter delay, default at 15 minutes, between each signal.  During non-REM sleep the lights are unlikely to effect you, but if you're in REM sleep the lights will bleed into your dreams, presenting a perfect chance to become lucid.\nWhy six lights and why red?\nWe spent a lot of time making sure that Remee's lights were configured in such a way that it would work well for all face shapes and head sizes. Six lights creates a much larger effective signal area so that even if the mask shifts during sleep you'll still most likely have at least a few lights over your eyes.  Even cooler, by having six lights we make it possible to create much more unique signals that can strobe, sweep and blink in ways that are not only recognizable, but that stimulate your visual field in a more tangible way.  In addition,  red light penetrates skin much more readily than other wavelengths.  Remember when you were a kid and you put a flashlight in your mouth to make your cheeks glow red? That happens because red light is able to pass through your skin, and in the case of Remee, your eyelids, much more easily.  On a side note, red LEDs also use much less power than other colors so we were able to keep you from strapping a 9v battery to your head.\nCustomizable, you say?\nYou bet. You'll be able to edit the standard full night sleep long delay and short delay, as well as setting both the short and long delay for nap mode.  Nap mode lets you trigger signals after a delay as short as 15 minutes - perfect for a quick lucid siesta. This is also great for the Wake-Back-to-Bed technique, which veteran oneironauts can attest is one of the best methods for lucid dreaming. In addition to setting Remee's timing, you'll be able to select from a variety of unique signal patterns and also modify the brightness to suit your paper thin or ogre thick eyelids.\nI own a soldering iron, give me specs!\nCongratulations, you're probably into tinkering and hacking just like we are, and most likely you want to know the skinny on Remee's guts. Remee is built around an atmega168 running on the internal oscillator.  Which means its fully compatible with the Arduino IDE.  If you're inclined, you'll be able to load whatever code you like on Remee and we'll be sure to create a tutorial to show you how. We are working on a simple way to hook an ISP to the board with no soldering or messy wires too. The light sensor bit-banging is pretty cool and we can't wait to share that with the world with a forthcoming tutorial, including part numbers and settings so you can use it in your own projects.

The film is being produced by a small group of film and design students from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. \nThe summer journey will start with a kick-off event hosted by the United States Federation of Worker Co-operatives in San Francisco on June 1st and proceed across the northern U.S., concluding in Amherst, Massachusetts at the start of September. In each major city along the route, Co-Cycle will collaborate with various co-op businesses, staging workshops and events to educate the local community about socially-conscious ways of living.\nAt these pitstops, new bikers will join or leave the cycling group, promising a constant presence of dynamism and happenstance for our cameras to capture. Our film crew will trail the bikers along the entire journey, putting together a story with the twelve main bikers of Co-Cycle as the major pieces of the puzzle, while the new faces we collect as we go will guide the rest of the way.\nWhat is a co-op?\nA cooperative is an organization owned and controlled equally by the people who use its services or by the people who work there. It is a workplace system abiding by absolute democracy, operating on the principle that ownership and leadership should be comprise of each member's cooperative contribution rather than their capacity to invest financial capital for profit. Co-ops that dates far back into early civilization, and its development is on the rise in the modern world, with numerous American organizations and enterprises continuing to showcase the system's capacity for positive ecological and social impact.\nWhy does it matter?\nThe past ten years have set the scene for change: The first African American President was elected in the US, Gay marriage has been legalized in six states, democracies are forming as countries around the world are liberating; All of these events have been fundamentally youth-driven. In light of recent events, specifically movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring Uprising, we are presenting a different mode in which our generation is taking matters into our own hands in search of a brighter, more sustainable future. Instead of onscreen pedagogy lamenting problems, these young voices will present a solution through actions. \nThe narrative we will tell through the dreams and willpower of a small group of young people will mirror our own journey as a group of budding filmmakers set out with a goal that affects so much more than ourselves. Through the specific lens of the co-operative movement, we will watch these able representatives of our generation experience this country in new and powerful ways in their determined attempt to not only mobilize and educate the communities they encounter, but themselves as well.\nWhat will my donation be used for?\nNot only are we scrambling to put together a film we are wholeheartedly invested in, we are also trying to plan a three month cross country road trip!

There you will find daily updates with extra photos that we want to show everyone, along with commentary from each location.\n\nWe\u2019ve also set up an Instagram (@weregoingnowhere) where we\u2019re posting photos from our phones to show you our day-to-day life.\n\nThere is a Facebook page as well:\n\nThank you all again for helping make this project happen!\n\nAndrew and Jake"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Hooray.", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\nWe are very excited to get out on the road and make this happen.  We've tested our printing setup and are very happy with the quality of the postcards we'll be producing.  The cards look and feel great.  Of course they will become a little weathered en route to you, but that's part of the whole thing.\n\nNow we need your information!  It's important for us to get it as quickly as possible so that we can get organized in time.  Please give us your name and address, and if you have any special requests (states, messages, whatever!) let us know and we will do our best to accomodate them.

It is an inescapable reality of life here, and lasting improvement is hard to see through: some owners fled the city and never returned, many others came back but remain financially paralyzed, and others are just intractable. I've passed by these former homes every day in my neighborhood for years, and I'm tired of seeing pieces of my community become dangerous ruins and expressing nothing but despair. It's time to flip the script.\nBut what can be done with a house where there is nothing left but the frames of its exterior walls? The answer is rather obvious to me - turn the open floor plan into a giant ball pit! A ball pit, 30 feet long, 16 feet wide, 4 feet deep full of balls to jump and play in - and rather than waste everyone's time with those weak, boring 3\" balls you'd find at McDonald's, I'm going for it all: using thousands of 10\" and 15\" soft, bouncy playground balls. Yes, these!\nHow will it work? With the property owner's permission and for NO admission fee, the ball pit will be open to the public (or at least those members of the public willing to assume risk for the fun they'll have); supervised kids, adults - anyone, everyone - will be welcome to take advantage of this new community resource for outdoor play, neighborly engagement, and communal socializing. Open during the day and in the evening, there will be special events including live music, projected film screenings, and more, but most often the ball pit will be just an arena for glorious, glorious play. Netting will keep the balls in the pit, and foam padding on every exposed beam will make it safe and comfortable for everyone.\nWhen and where? The ball pit will be ready to go by early May, with an official grand opening tentatively scheduled for Saturday, May 12, and will be open for about a month or six weeks - until it gets too hot, basically. The house is located at 2816 Burgundy St in the Marigny (that's New Orleans, LA, 70117). \nWho are you and what do you think you're doing? I'm Josh. When I do things out loud, I mostly do them with film, the past several years in New Orleans with Court 13 - from directing Big Freedia's music video for \"Y'all Get Back Now\" to working in the art department for the 2012 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winning Beasts of the Southern Wild. I've never built a giant ball pit in an abandoned house before, and that's fine by me.\nCall this an interactive art installation, a neighborhood development initiative, or just totally crazy - to me it's simply a giant ball pit. Silly, I know, but it is serious too! There's really important work to do to bring attention to these dangerous properties and the slow progress of improving them in New Orleans. Fortunately the only way I know how to fight these serious problems is to facilitate absurd, riotous joy with equal and opposite force.\nThis is a two step process: the first has been to secure and clean up a seriously exposed and threatening location (for example, we have repaired an entire exterior wall that has nothing to do with the ball pit itself, except for the fact that it is part of the house, and was in imminent danger of collapsing onto adjacent, lived-in homes; pictures of all progress are available here). The second step is to turn the newly safe and functional building into something worthwhile. And bringing neighbors together, just to have a little fun in the spring sunshine, particularly in a place that used to be a problem beyond simply going to waste; that's something that's worthwhile to me.\nHow you can help: This project is really as simple as it sounds - all I'm going to do is thoroughly clean and secure the house, put up the netting/padding, fill it up with balls, and create a comfortable space to visit and spend time. This all takes a fair bit of money, and all donations will go directly into these four tasks, and it really is a more-is-more situation: more funding means a more secure house, a more comfortable area to rest and chat in, and so on. Extra funds will be thrown into publicity and maintenance once it's built. If you're in New Orleans and would like to participate in ANY part of the process, you are more than welcome - a ball pit is nothing without all of the people in it, starting with making it actually exist.\nThis will be a truly memorable and exciting addition to the community, and serve as a reminder that our neighborhoods are what we make them. In New Orleans, we can continue to ignore decay and abandonment but I think it's time we transform the neighborhoods ourselves, using the best and most abundant tool we have here: communal joy. It's happening, and I hope you'll join me.\nEmbrace the craziness-- get involved, and find us on facebook here! And thank you so, so much--\nWE HAVE HIT OUR GOAL. The outpouring of support has been overwhelming, empowering, and inspiring. Your clicks, likes, and especially your donations have brought us attention from Grist, Next American City, a whole lot from The Gambit, the local news, and more. That's just the beginning, and only in the last few days. So what will we do now? Well, the basics have been covered: making the house safe and secure, and purchasing the raw materials for the pit. Any other funds we receive will go into making the experience a comfortable and enjoyable one on top of the glory of being in a giant ball pit. First on our wish list is providing a bathroom on-site (wouldn't that be nice?), establishing/maintaing an effective and efficient rain contingency, offering comfortable seating, having refreshments available, the list goes on. So let's keep going - we'll be open in 2 weeks!!! WHOA!
