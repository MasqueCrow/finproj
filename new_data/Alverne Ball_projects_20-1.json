[{"backer": "Alverne Ball", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Pg. 1 from OneNation: Stronghold #1\nIn OneNation the Tenth are a group of Keramats (metahumans) whose interventionist philanthropy rocks the world's status quo to its foundations. This volume tells the origin of Stronghold, the Tenth's resident muscle, growing up in rural Louisiana while coming to terms with his sexuality and his racist family history.\nOneNation: Stronghold #1 will be a 23-page, full color comic. For ages 15 and up.\nPg. 2 from OneNation: Stronghold #1\nPg. 10 from OneNation: Stronghold #1\nSince 2012 it has been our mission to create the stories we wanted to see in comics and media in general. Stories inclusive to minority voices with Black protagonists, villains, superheroes, and gods with their own agencies.  OneNation was the very first comic we published with that in mind and we're thrilled to be bringing you more action, adventure, and drama, from Sundiata, Paragon, and the rest of the Tenth!\nPg. 15 from OneNation: Stronghold #1\nPg. 18 from OneNation: Stronghold #1\nPg. 20 from OneNation: Stronghold #1\nOneNation: Stronghold #1 (Cover A)\nOneNation: Stronghold #1 (Cover B)\nOneNation: Stronghold #1 (Cover C)\n Damian Strong AKA Stronghold\nDamian Strong AKA Stronghold is our hero. One part of the group of superhero organization the Tenth. Damian is also what is known as a Keramat, a person on born with extraordinary abilities. In Damian's case he possesses superhuman strength and durability. Damian (and his twin sister Daisy) also have Albinism, defined as a lack of pigmentation in the eyes, skin, and/or hair.\nDamian grew up in rural Louisiana in a prosperous family of alligator hunters.\nDamian (young)\nAll his life Damion was always taught to hide. As a kid he hid from his older brothers' wrathful hazing because he was the youngest boy. Living in a small bigoted town as a mixed-race kid where he and Daisy were forced by their parents to straighten their kinky hair so they could pass for white, Damian was raised to hide his Blackness.\n\nHe hid his growing Keramat abilities from his family fearing that it would hurt his family's image and as a young man coming into his own, hiding from his own sexuality. But soon there would come a reckoning, and Damian would have to face all the things that make him. In order to be the hero he could be, to become Stronghold, Damian will have to realize himself.\nDaisy Strong (young)\nDamian\u2019s twin sister and his rock. Daisy knows all Damian's secrets but still has a few of her own she's has yet to reveal. She was always faster to adapt to situations in their tumultuous family, and is the more independent of the twins. Daisy also has Albinism. In their youth she was also made to straighten her hair, but has learned to let it grow and become kinky, embracing her Blackness as she got older. Now, a doctor who works closely with Mansa with all to help solve medical heath issues related to Keramats.\nRandall\nRandall and Damien meet when Damian leaves home for college. Not afraid to wear his sexuality on his sleeve, his truth is jarring to young Damian who's never been out of the watchful eye of the conservative Strong family.\nOptical\nStronghold\u2019s right hand on the Tenth's away team is Optical. A Black woman with the ability to blast heat beams from her eyes, x-ray vision, and other eye based abilities. She's a model soldier and always ready for the smoke.\nShielder & Surge\nRounding out Stronghold's away team are Shielder and Surge. Shielder's Keramat ability allows him to create constructs of energy he uses as force fields to cover/ and protect. \nSurge's Keramat ability let's her convert the adrenaline in her body to pure energy she can project from her hands. \n Mansa\nAKA the Nation. The Keramat home base.\nThe Strongs\nThe Patriarch of the family Alton Strong is a hard, callous man, who took a generations old tradition of alligator hunting and expanded it into a franchise of hunting/sporting good stores, restaurants, and eventually a conservative-style reality TV show called: Keeping the Faith Strong.\n\nBrittany Strong is the matriarch. A stone cold woman who values appearances over the well being of even her own children. She is furious at her husband's infidelity and is mortified when Alton decides to take his out of wedlock, mixed race kids into the family. Her rancor for the twins manifested in punishing them when they weren't acting 'Christian enough' and denying them their cultural awareness, even forcing them to cut or change the texture of their hair to appear more \u201cwhite.\u201d \n\nJunior and Davis Strong are sociopaths who exist to please their father, as you all will soon see.\nBlabbermouth\nOf South Asian descent, Blabbermouth's Keramat abilities work similar to Optical's with one big difference: He can create energy blasts, sonic beams, poisons, shoot flames, etc. and it all projects from his fat mouth! \nBlabbermouth is traitor to Mansa and now lives his life as a mercenary, waging wars for the highest bidder.\nMammal\nMammal is also a mercenary whose Keramat abilities let him shape shift into any animal. \n\nShadowpuppet\nA shadow manipulator. Completely pitch Black.\nOneNation: Stronghold (BLM/Pride Pin-up)\nPUBLISHER\n Jason Reeves is the owner of 133art, a comic book publishing imprint and printer.

Animal life ceases to exist. Radiation and extreme forces of nature make the surface inhabitable for extended periods of time. War has taken it's toll. To make matters worse the world has become overrun with bio-mechanical monsters called Mechai. The Human race struggles to survive as their numbers dwindle day by day.\nAt one point in History there was a lone warrior who stood against the Mechai and kept them at bay, giving humanity a fighting chance. After the mysterious disappearance of this lone warrior the world was left without a protector. \nThe Okemus Hunters - Mesar, Tisena, Sahta, Bain\nIn an attempt to recreate their missing hero a rogue science division genetically experiments on four military operatives giving them extraordinary abilities. These four warriors would become known as the Okemus Hunters. Their mission is to annihilate the Mechai by traveling through time and stopping them before they even began and finding the source of the genetic anomaly.\nRewind to the year 2015. After the four Hunters arrive in the past and begin their mission they stumble upon what they seem to be looking for. A young man genetics student at Purdue University named Cale. Drama, action, twists and turns ensue. How can one normal young man be at the center of all this fantastical story?! \nCale: Meet your Destiny\nGrab ALL Five issues to find out!

Walker, drawn by Sean Damien Hill, colored by Mx. Struble, lettered by Becca Carey, and published by Solid Comix.\nTHE HATED cover art by Sean Damien Hill with colors by Mx. Struble\nIt is 1872, and the war between the North and South is over. Neither side won. After years of bloody conflict, both sides entered into a truce, resulting in the formation of two nations, the Union States of America, where blacks are free, and the Confederate States of America, where blacks are still enslaved. Araminta Free is a former slave turned bounty hunter. She specializes in crossing the border into the Confederacy, and liberating slaves. She also tracks down Confederate war criminals, which has made her a woman with a price on her head in the southern nation. When a group of Confederate Raiders illegally ventures deep into the Union to kidnap free blacks and sell them into slavery, the stage is set for a deadly showdown between Araminta and the men who want her dead.\nImagine if director Sergio Corbucci (DJANGO, THE GREAT SILENCE) made a western starring Pam Grier as a badass, gun-slinging bounty hunter. Now imagine the story takes place in a world where the Civil War ended differently \u2013 instead of a victory for the North, there is a truce, and what had been one country is now two. This is THE HATED.\nThe first issue of THE HATED is 100% drawn and inked, and is currently being colored. Here are some samples of the amazing work by artist Sean Damien Hill and colorist Mx. Struble.\nWHAT ARE YOU FUNDING?\nThis campaign is funding the first issue of THE HATED, a mini-series written and published by David F. Walker, drawn by Sean Damien Hill, colored by Shaun Struble, and lettered by Becca Carey. This will be a full color, 40-page comic book plus cover.\n30 pages of story\n10  back-up pages\nStandard sized comic\nThe purpose of this campaign is to fund the production and printing of THE HATED #1, fulfill all backer rewards, and cover the cost of shipping and handling for all reward tiers. Because THE HATED is more pages than ONE FALL, the cost of printing and shipping is more, for that reason, we have set our goal higher this time. But all of the money is going towards the costs of producing and delivering all rewards, any remaining/extra funds will go toward the production of THE HATED #2.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe wanted the freedom to create a series on our own terms, and at a pace that works for our schedules. The first issue of THE HATED is drawn, inked, and partially colored and lettered. By the time this campaign is over, the first issue will be 100% complete and ready to go to print. The money raised from this campaign will go to fund printing and productions costs of the first issue of THE HATED, production of other rewards, and shipping. Any money raised over the target goal will be used as seed money for the second issue of THE HATED.\n\nTHE HATED #1 - We've got some great rewards for this campaign, starting the the comic itself. You will have a choice of a digital comic or a physical copy. There are multiple options for covers of the physical copy, including the main Cover, and the variant Cover B (image only, no text). \nTHE HATED #1 - David Mack Variant Cover - since a picture is worth 1,000 words, we'll just show it to you...\nDavid Mack variant cover\nTHE HATED #1 Black and White Limited Edition - Solid Comix is pleased to offer a limited edition, black and white version of THE HATED #1. This is the exact same comic as the color edition, only without the color. This edition will have a limited print run for Kickstarter. There will be no second printing. The black and white edition will only be available here on Kickstarter (and at conventions if any are left) -- no digital copies, not available online, and no retailer copies. Once these are gone, they are gone. \npages from the Black and White Limited Edition\n KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!! This amazing sticker (2\"x3\") featuring Araminta Free is included with all physical copies. Not available anywhere else, this is special thanks to everyone supporting Solid Comix and THE HATED. \nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!!\nBadAzz MoFo's Book of SPAGHETTI WESTERNS by David F. Walker - every order of THE HATED comes with this FREE digital of David F. Walker's book about spaghetti westerns, reprinted from the pages of his 'zine BadAzz MoFo. This digital book features reviews of more than 40 films and a historic overview of the Eurowestern genre -- 114 pages, including reviews of DJANGO, THE GREAT SILENCE, A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL, and many more. This is special thanks to everyone supporting Solid Comix and THE HATED.\nADD-ONS\nThe Joelle Jones 8.5\u201dx11\u201d pin-up is now available as an add-on to all print copy reward tiers for $10 each (sorry, not available with digital only). This was supposed to be the $20k stretch goal...but since we likely won't hit that goal, and since this is such an amazing work or art, and because I appreciated all the support everyone has shown to this campaign, it is being made available. \nTo add the pin-up to your existing reward tier click the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (it should be on the right side of your screen). This will take to a page called \u201cChange Your Pledge.\u201d Change the \u201cPLEDGE AMOUNT\u201d to reflect the adding of the pin-up or any other add-ons.

Let\u2019s call it the \u201cI Love Indie Comics\u201d tier. This is a special bundle that includes The Hated #1 (Cover A) along with three indies titles that I really like \u2013 Harriett Tubman: Demon Slayer #1, Crescent City Monsters#1, and Is\u2019Nana the Were-Spider: The Ballads of Rawhead & John Henry.  All three are comic projects they I have backed on Kickstarter, and I want to share them with a select group of backers. You get physical copies of all four of these comics for $20, as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Stickers and a PDF of BadAzz MoFo\u2019s Book of Spaghetti Westerns. Limited to only 10!!!\n NEW TIERS ADDED!!! (UPDATE - All gone!!!)\nI\u2019m very happy to announce two new reward tiers. I have a limited number of BITTER ROOT #6 variant covers \u2013 both the \u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 tribute cover and the \u2018My Neighbor Totoro\u2019 tribute cover. Both are extremely rare, and going for upwards of $100 on eBay. I have eight copies of each cover, and once they are gone, they are gone.

I have been using the post office as my main source of business shipping for more than 25 years. In that time, I've had more problems in the last six months than in all those years combined. There have been more copies of The Hated that have simply disappeared than anything else I've ever shipped. In most cases, tracking shows that these packages were delivered, even though they weren't.

Wherever Lyndsey finds someone who has seen the Box, chaos ensues. Soon, even her own sanity falls into question. In the end, Lyndsey will have to decide if she really wants to see what\u2019s inside the Box of Bones.\nDescribed as \u201cTales from the Crypt Meets Black History,\u201d Box of Bones is a supernatural nightmare tour through some of the most violent and horrific episodes in the African Diaspora.\nVolume 1 contains art from John Jennings, Sole Rebel, Damian Duffy, Frances Olivia Liddell-Rodriguez, Tommy Nguyen, Jarmel and Jamal Williams, and Bryan Christopher Moss with covers by Stacey Robinson!!!\nHelp us raise $10,000 to bring this book to print.\nBy Anthony Moncada\n\nTHE CREATORS\nAyize Jama-Everett\nAyize Jama-Everett was born in 1974 and raised in Harlem, New York. Since then he has traveled extensively in Northern Africa, New Hampshire, and Northern California. He holds a Master\u2019s in Clinical Psychology and a Master\u2019s in Divinity. He is the author of three novels, The Liminal People, The Liminal War, and The Entropy of Bones.\n\n\"When John Jennings first brought the idea to me years ago, I never imagined it would involve so many other creatives that I\u2019d admired from afar. It\u2019s been amazing to collaborate with some of the most talented up and coming and established artists. The fact that we\u2019re organizing around what\u2019s basically a bad fever dream of my historically obsessed black brain is a bit humbling, but I think the narrative and our process gives everyone a chance to shine. My hope is that this work is transformative to the industry, showing creatives and publishers that narratives around black people in the US are as diverse and marketable as any other stories. I\u2019m proud to be a part of this and excited for what happens in the future of the Box of Bones.\"\nBox of Bones #1 -- Cover by Stacey Robinson\nJohn Jennings\nJohn Jennings is a Professor of Media and Cultural Studies at the University of California at Riverside. His creative and academic work centers around intersectional narratives regarding identity politics and popular media. Jennings is co-editor of the Eisner Award-winning collection The Blacker the Ink: Constructions of Black Identity in Comics and Sequential Art and co-founder/organizer of The Schomburg Center\u2019s Black Comic Book Festival in Harlem. He is co-founder and organizer of the MLK NorCal\u2019s Black Comix Arts Festival in San Francisco and also SOL-CON: The Brown and Black Comix Expo at the Ohio State University. Together with Damian Duffy, he worked on the New York Times Best Selling Kindred: A Graphic Novel Adaptation (for which he won his second Eisner) and Parable of the Sower: A Graphic Novel Adaptation. His debut solo effort, the hoodoo noir Blue Hand Mojo: Hard Times Road, and Pitch Black Rainbow: The Art of John Jennings are his other Rosarium projects. He was recently tagged to direct and curate a new imprint for Abrams, Megascope.\n\n\"We created Box of Bones because we wanted to figure out a creative way to talk about black history and teach people about the injustices that black folk have had to endure. We were thinking about the Movement for Black Lives and our current political climate and how violence against people of color has been both normalized and erased.

We chose to do this project because of the need for more illustrated stories based on African/African Diaspora culture and traditions, and also because it's fun! For years readers have enjoyed the tales of Changa and his crew, so now we're bringing it to you fully illustrated.\nJason Reeves, owner of 133art, has assembled a talented team to bring the first story of Changa's adventures to life. Written by Robert Jeffrey, Illustrated by Matteo Illuminati with Letters and Color Art by Loris Ravina, the story of Changa and his crew's search to find the secrets of the Jade obelisk jumps to life in the pages below!\nChanga and the Jade Obelisk #1 will be a 20-page, full color comic.\n\n\nThe Story\nChanga and the Jade Obelisk is adapted from the novel Changa's Safari by Milton Davis.\n           'In the 15th century on the East Coast of Africa begin the amazing exploits of merchant/adventurer Changa Diop. From the Swahili merchant cities of Mombasa, to the secretive kingdoms of Madagascar, Changa, the sorcerer Panya and the mysterious swordsman The Tuareg experience adventures beyond the imagination when they pursue the malicious Bahati, keeper of the Jade Obelisk!\nThe Characters\nChanga\nIn the city of Mombasa Changa became the apprentice of one of its most successful merchants, Belay. In death, Belay bequeathed to Changa a portion of his merchant fleet. Changa has decided to use Belay's gift to amass enough wealth to raise an army, free his people from the sadistic grip of Usenge, and avenge his father\u2019s death. Let the grand safari begin!Forced to flee his homeland of Kongo when his father, King Mfumu, was overthrown and killed by the evil sorcerer Usenge, Changa Diop has led many lives. Trained as a thief, later a warrior, dubbed Mbogo \u2018The Bull\u2019 in the fighting pits of Mogadishu, merchant, and finally mariner.\n\n  Panya.\nPanya lived a peaceful and sheltered life in Yorubaland until she discovered her betrothal to a local oba she despised. Desperate to be free of her obligation, she called on the orisha Oya for help. Oya responded in kind. Oya 'sat on her head' during a violent confrontation between her and her betrothed and Panya, possessed by Oya, took his life. Owing a debt to Oya came with drastic physical consequences, but breaking the laws of her homeland would mean her life! With that, Panya fled her home, using her skills and a healer, fighter, and daughter of Oya to survive. She eventually found her way to Mombasa, where chance brought her together with Changa.\nThe Tuareg\nOnce the scourge of the Sahara, El Sirocco fell for the charms of a sorceress who brought him to his knees and sold him into slavery. Seeing his downfall as a sign from Allah, El Sirocco, known to his captors as \u2018The Tuareg,\u2019 took a vow of silence until he could atone for his sins. His path led to the fighting pits of Mogadishu, where on the day his masters planned his death he was saved by the intervention of Mbogo \u2018The Bull.\u2019 His benefactor purchased him then freed him, but instead of returning home, he pledged his life and his sword to Mbogo, a man also known as Changa Diop.\nAmir (Prince) Zakee\nAmir Zakee ibn Basheer was the third and youngest son of Sultan Basheer ibn Raheem of Yemen. Though the youngest, he was the most promising and was sure to be the next ruler of the Yemeni sultanate. Zakee had proven himself in battle, marching with his father and grandfather to defeat the followers of the Red Priest. The infidels worshiped a strange artifact, a jade obelisk that emitted amazing powers. The Yemeni defeated the Red Priest and his denizens, took the jade obelisk and locked it away. As a reward for his valor, Zakee was appointed governor of Aden, the most important port of Yemen. Zakee\u2019s rule was peaceful; the people of Aden loved him. Then one day a mysterious ship arrived in the harbor, carrying a people from a land unknown to Zakee and the others. The commander of the ship was the most beautiful woman Zakee had ever seen. When asked who she was, the woman answered. Her name was Bahati, and she was seeking an object of great value to her people. Zakee asked this woman who had captured his heart what she sought. A jade obelisk, she replied.\nBahati\nThousands of seasons ago, a war raged between the Ancestors and the Sorcerers. In a bid to defeat the ancestors' greatest champion, the sorcerers created the great and terrible Bahati. Her emergence into the the war proved to briefly turn the tide, but eventually the ancestors prevailed crushing the Sorcerers. Punished for their insurrection, Bahati was dispersed into the ether and the power of the Sorcerers was divided and contained in twelve talisman, which were scattered throughout the world. However, the Ancestors made a mistake, Bahati had been diminished, but she had not been destroyed. She reincorporated herself then set out to find all the talisman in hopes of regaining the power of the sorcerers and to destroy the ancestors once and for all.\nThe Creators\nCreator/Writer\nMilton Davis\nMilton Davis is an award winning Black Fantastic writer and owner of MVmedia, LLC, a publishing company specializing in Science Fiction, Fantasy and Sword and Soul.

Sometimes in life things happen that make it hard for you to keep fighting for what you love. It's not so much a matter of ability, but rather a testament to the will of the human spirit. We can all find strength and creativity in the most surprising places and this story exemplifies that. \nOur Goal\nMaking an animated film is hard work. Everything from art to the final product takes tons of effort from talented people. We're hoping to raise at least $40,000 to get us through the production and post-production process. We have a stretch goal of $55,000 to make this the best quality film as it can possibly be. This project is extremely near and dear to our hearts and we hope you can help us bring it to life! \nProduction Costs\n\nOur Team\nThis project is such a collaborative effort. We've put together a team from all over the world of incredibly talented artists and each of them have brought something special to the film.\n\nFrank Abney III - Director\nFrank began working in the entertainment world over a decade ago. He's been fortunate to work in Games, TV, and Film, on a variety of projects.

Paige's background in animation gives her a unique perspective on how to get things done in an efficient manner while always maintaining the creative integrity of any project she works on. \nTB Choi - Character Designer\nSojin (TB) is a freelance character designer. TB has been instrumental in creating some of the characters of Canvas, bringing masterful appeal. Her design for Mom elevated the character to a whole new level. When she's not creating gorgeous pieces of art, she's teaching drawing skills.\nRandy Bishop - Character Designer\nRandy is a hard working and talented character designer who has been working as a freelancer for the past several years in the animation, gaming, and publishing industries. Randy has a passion for storytelling and cherishes any opportunity to be part of a project that tells a good story. He lives in eastern Idaho with his wife and four kiddos.

Written by Robert Jeffrey (DC Comic Writers Workshop, DC New Talent Workshop, Route 3). Illustrated by Jordi Perez (Top Cow's Grand Theft Astro). Colored by Paris Alleyne (IDW, Boom! Studios, Lion's Forge). \nRET:CON #1 will be a 20-page full color comic.\nThis is 133art's first Kickstarter and we wanted to come out of the gate strong. If you know anything about our little studio, you know we strive to produce inclusive quality entertainment in the realms of Superheroes, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy. Its our goal to see faces of color as the heroes and champions of modern mythology. RET:CON is an extension of that goal, and ultimately, making comics like this is the joy of our lives.\nThe Story\nIn a time when artificial intelligence governs the remains of a world ravaged by violent temporal ruptures, the RET:CON Agency is formed to stop reality from falling into entropy. Agent '4 am' is a part of RET:CON's elite unit, the Slingshotters, who's mission is to breach the time stream to repair the future.\n\n        The A.I. designed to analyze and direct the Slingshotters in fixing the ruptures, the RET:CON Engine, requires very unorthodox methods, alterations previously thought to result in a time catastrophe.  4am's first mission:  infiltrate the Wolfsschanze and Kill Hitler!\n The Characters \nAgent 4am\nAgent 4am is the consummate soldier. Astute, aggressive, allegiant, and best of all compliant. 4am believes in the RET:CON agency's mission and will do anything, remove any obstacle, to see it through. He can see no flaw in the system... but what if that's the problem? \nPandora\nWhile the RET:CON Engine keeps a watchful eye on the time stream, Pandora is the woman in charge of the Slingshotter's well being.\n  Once a soldier herself, Pandora has risen through the ranks of the agency to become its lead physician. Her specialty is in time travel psychology, specifically treating its effects on the human brain. While the physical toll on Slingshotters is high, she finds that managing the mental effects of rigorous temporal transit is even more treacherous. Pandora has made it her mission to solve these issues to keep her soldiers physically safe and mentally healthy. \nAgent Noon\nDon't let Agent Noon's aloof vibes and eclectic style fool you, she is one of most capable agents to come out of the RET:CON agency. She is the perfect time agent with extensive knowledge and expertise in temporal warfare. She's a formidable pilot, certified in a wide array of weapons and time tech, stealth extraction, subterfuge and infiltration. Dedicated and fiercely loyal to her cause, Noon will do anything to save our future. \nMidnight\nAs the battle to save space and time continues, Midnight stands at its center as the biggest unknown quantity. Is he an ally? Or is this man another obstacle in the organization's goal of saving our future? \nSlingsuit\nThe Slingsuit is designed to push and pull, or 'slingshot' the RET:CON Agents through the time stream. The suit protects the wearer from the potential harmful energies of time travel, also the under armor provides upgraded physical strength and protection.\n Aashini Anika Khatri \nThe first time travel pioneer or 'Slingshotter'; was an Indian woman: Airman Aashini Anika Khatri. \nThe Creators\nPublisher/Creator\nJason Reeves.

There may be no single pledge level to get all the items you desire, but with Add-ons you can get what you are looking for.\n The first thing you do is look at the additional items and determine the cost associated with products that are not provided in your pledge level rewards.  If you would like to change your pledge, just click the 'manage your pledge' button, which should have replaced the 'back this project' button at the top of your page. Then, you increase your pledge by that additional amount. \nWhen our Kickstarter campaign is over, you will be asked to fill out a survey so we have your correct address and you will be able to alert us to the extra items included in your pledge. \n A Little About Us\nThe award winning studio 133art is a Los Angeles based comic book imprint founded by illustrator Jason Reeves. The studio is comprised of a small group of freelance professionals including illustrator Jason Reeves, writer Alverne Ball, & colorist Luis Guerrero.

Although primarily a comic book production studio, 133art offers services in comic book printing as well through the other wing of the company: 133art Printing.

This is why we are able to offer such a quick turnaround on the pledges (except for the 1/6 scale custom figure which will take a bit longer to paint and the fan feature RET:CON back-up story which needs to be written, illustrated, lettered, and colored). So while we don't foresee any difficulties in fulfillment, we have experience in providing customer service in those areas.\n \nWe plan on having weekly updates for backers after funding and will keep everyone in the loop should there be any delays.\n\n Have a question or a concern?

A  testament  to  the  true  depravity  that  inhabits  the  souls  of  man.  \nThe  little  girl  who  escaped  the  demonic  forces  which  occupied  the  LaLaurie  New  Orleans  mansion  on  a  sunny  day  in  1833,  though,  called  it  something  else:  the  site  of  a  rebirth.  The  little  girl  swore  on  that  day  that  she  would  never  be  anyone  else\u2019s  victim,  and  so  began  a  centuries  long  campaign  of  bloody  revenge.  The  Retribution  Cabal  (RC)  was  born,  protecting  only  those  descendants  of  America\u2019s original sin.  \nNow  on  a  cyberpunk  stage  where  technological  wonders  leave  no  place  for  creatures  of  legend,  the  LaLauries  and  their  denizens  reappear,  continuing  their  blood-soaked  quest  for  obtaining  ultimate  power.  Time  will  tell  if  the  remaining  members  of  the  fractured  Cabal  can  stand  as  the  bulwark  between  humanity  and  the  rising  hordes  of  darkness.  \nTHE CHARACTERS\nLAYLA\nA  hired  gun\u035f,  Layla  lives  her  life  fast  and  loose.  Doesn\u2019t  answer  to  anyone  and  shirks  responsibility.  Drafted  for  the  Retoch  Frontier Wars, she  was  one  of  the  more  talented  recruits,  but  didn\u2019t  like  the  stifling/  authoritative  environment  of  the  military.  Added  to  that,  she  questioned  the  Manifest  Destiny\u035f rhetoric  of  Earth\u2019s  forces  and  was  promptly  kicked  out.  With  all  the  training  that  she\u2019d  received,  and  no  shortage  of  crap  on  Earth  to  weed  through,  she  became  a  mercenary  for  hire.  She finds herself reluctantly pulled into the shadowy war of The Retribution Cabal.\nTRAVIS\nAn operative of the Retribution Cabal. A  recent  recruit  in  the  organizations  fight  against  against the demonic/ supernatural hordes which exist back home Earth.  Travis is a gifted pilot, and trained  in  various  forms  of  hand  to  hand  combat,  and adept at using a variety of high  tech  weaponry. Travis is a  veteran  of  the  Retoch  Frontier  Wars  which  took  place  with  humanity\u2019s  push  to  the  farthest  reaches  of  the  universe.  He was recruited  by  Prya  when  he  got  back  home  to  join the ranks of The Retribution Cabal.\nPRYA\nA ranking member of the Retribution Cabal. Even in a  world  of  the  far-flung  future The Retribution Cabal has  still  found  itself  busy  fighting  for  the  disenfranchised  in  a  world  beset  by  the  terrors  that  go bump in the night.  Prya  is  at  the  forefront  of  this  fight,  being  tasked  to  recruit  the  best  and  brightest  to  join the ranks of a failing organization.\nLIANA MATTHEWS\nThe current head of The Retribution Cabal. She\u2019s made it her goal to continue the fight of the fractured organization, by any means necessary.\nTHE LaLAURIES\nHistory tells of the horrors which this couple meted out in a French Quarter mansion. The Retribution Cabal has made it its goal to ensure that the couple is wiped from existence, but the LaLaurie\u2019s have always been able to stay one step ahead of the group. \nA LOOK INSIDE\nPage 1, Inks to Colors to Letters.\nPages 1-6\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nROBERT JEFFREY II - Writer\nA freelance writer with over 14 years of experience, Robert Jeffrey II was chosen along with 5 other writers (out of more than a thousand applicants,) to take part in the 2017 DC Comics Writers Workshop.

Tell a friend or two!\nGOAL REACHED!! STRETCH GOAL #1 NEXT - $16,000!!\nTHE CROSSOVER EVENT!! \nStretch Goal Crossover Event by Vol 1's Walter Ostlie!\nGiven that my character Is\u2019nana and his father, Anansi the Spider, have been established with the ability to travel through different worlds, I thought it\u2019d be fun to take advantage of this and introduce people to different books and series in the indie comic world. With the stretch goal of $16,000, the Is\u2019nana team are hoping to raise enough money to add 40 extra pages of story content to allow Is\u2019nana to go through these different worlds, each illustrated by their respective creators. The goal is to raise enough money to pay all the artists/creators involved.\nSo we have Vol 1's artist Walter Ostlie's Shiver Bureau, Micheline Hess' Malice in Ovenland, Shauna J. Grant's Princess LovePon, Chuck DragonBlack Collins' Bounce!, Keef Cross' DayBlack, Mike Priebe's Barrdok the Wanderer, and N Steven Harris' and Robert Garrett's Ajala! I thought it'd be great to do a sort of cross promotion between each creator and books and given that I have a good set of readers and fanbases, I'm hoping I can not only introduce readers to more Black folklore and mythological characters, but also get more people into other indie books and franchises. If anyone is able to jump in to help, that'd be wonderful, or even spreading the word and discussing what the mission goal is! So please pledge today and spread the word!\nTHE STORY\nA horror-fantasy, coming of age story, Is'nana the Were-Spider: The Hornet's Web is the second part to an on-going series of one-shots/graphic novels.\nIs'nana the Were-Spider, Vol 2 Cover\nAccidentally breaking a barrier between our world and theirs (called THE MOTHER KINGDOM), Is'nana (the son of Anansi the Spider God of Stories) accepts the responsibility for releasing creatures of horror into our reality, villains who want nothing more but to cause chaos and mayhem to achieve their own diabolical or selfish goals. With guidance from his father, Is'nana not only strives to live up to his father's name but to also reach his own potential while he seeks to discover his individuality and place in the world.\n After defeating Osebo the Leopard, Is'nana must now face Queen Mmboro, her daughter Princess Kantite, and their family of hornets, wasps, and bees who unite and seek to inject themselves into human beings and take over our reality. \nQueen Mmboro and her Harvest\n  Attack of the Killer Were-Bees\n Unfortunatley caught amongst the mayhem is the Baptiste family, Leland, Gina, and Jenka, who fight to survive and protect each other at all cost against Queen Mmboro's evil hive...\nThe Baptiste Family\n ...while Is'nana must not only test his physically limits but also deal with rising tensions with his father who sees fit to control and protect his every move.\nTension between Father and Son\nBe sure to Like and Follow the Facebook Page. \nTHE MISSION\nLast year since the success of the Kickstarter for Vol. 1 of Is'nana the Were-Spider and following the official publication release, the book has been met with acclaim, new fans, and supporters. Fans of Anansi the Spider were welcomed with a modern take on the old mythological folklore of West Africa and the Caribbean, while new fans were introduced to rich characters from old (and sometimes forgotten) stories. Just as the last volume, I hope to continue to make sure these characters and stories are not being forgotten, as Is'nana pushes forth to continue on the legacy of Africana and Black-based folklore and mythology. Your support, donations, while sharing this project through friends, family, and social media will help to further continue this mission.\nAnansi the Spider and Papa Legba of Haitian Stories\nI am hoping to use the funds raised to print copies of not only Vol 2, but reprints of Vol 1 that is currently sold out. This Kickstarter will also allow new readers to pledge for a copy of Volume 1 and catch up with the mission. \nVol 1 (currently sold out) and Vol 2\n WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\nJust like last year, the production of the book from pencils, inks, colors, and lettering are being paid out of pocket. We are currently almost half way through the coloring stages and will begin lettering soon. Money raised will go to final production and printing physical copies of Vol 2 and reprints of Vol 1 (currently sold out) for backers, stores/retailers, libraries, and conventions. Money will also be going into merchandise, rewards, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.\nTHE TEAM\nGregory Anderson-Elysee is the writer and creator of Is'nana: The Were-Spider. On pencils and inks is Daryl Toh (Outer God), with Lee Milewski (Hunter's Lore) providing colors, Joshua Cozine (The Untamed) on letters and production, and last but not least Walt Msonza Barna on the covers!\n REWARDS\n            Daryl Toh (Vol 2 artist)\n  Chris Giarusso (G-Man, Mini Marvels)\n  Miguel Blanco (OogeeMan)\n  Line work by Levi Fari-Raqub / Colors by Leonard Anderson\n  Chris Koehler (Legend)\n              Greg Anderson-Elysee (Is'nana Writer/Creator)\n  Scott Bratek\n   +Add $50 to Original Pin Up Print Pledge for ALL 7 Pin Ups\n       - Anansi the Spider\n- Is'nana the Were-Spider \n- Is'nana the Were-Spider (Spider Form) \n- Papa Legba, Loa God of the Crossroads\n - Queen Mmboro \n- Osebo the Leopard\n- Kantite, daughter of Queen Mmboro \n    (Add $15 to original Pins pledge for all 7 Pins)\n               4 T-shirts to Choose From\n                 -  Change Pledge $70 (instead of $50) for 2 different Is'nana T-shirts, or $100 for all 4 T shirts.\n  Custom Is'nana Funko Pop Vinyl Toy\n    3 of 28 Original Pages from Is'nana Vol 1\n     Add Ons and Prices\nIf you wish to add in an extra reward to your pledge, read below for the prices of the Add On which you will put in addition to your pledge.

STRETCH GOAL!! $16,000\nIf the initial goal is exceeded into the next goal (16,000), an added 40 pages of story will be included in the book for no extra charge. The art will be drawn by Vol 1's artist Walter Ostlie (Shiver Bureau).\nThe story will follow Is'nana on a mission from Papa Legba, the Haitian Loa God of the Crossroads, to find his dog who's gone missing due to Is'nana breaking the barrier between worlds in Vol 1. Unfortunately, other trickster characters from Haitian folklore, Ti-Malice, Bouki, and Kompere Chat have other plans for Legba's dog. Also entangled with his own motive is Jeremy Tableau, a trickster guided by Legba himself, there to ensure Is'nana's quest is not an easy one...\nThe Black Sheep, Jeremy Tableau (stretch goal character)\n The story will also feature crossovers and interactions with characters from  other indie comic book properties like Shiver Bureau by Walter Ostlie, Bounce! the Comic by Chuck Collins, Malice in Ovenland by Micheline Hess, DayBlack by Keef Cross, Barrdok the Wanderer by Mike Priebe, Princess LovePon by Shauna J.

I am expecting Vol 2 book to be fully completed before the end of the year, but added time was added in case of any unexpected delay. Although Vol 2 is already currently being funded, the added pages, if we achieve the stretch goals, may add to a longer wait time for the book due to not just the pages from Ostlie, but also the pages from the guest creators and their properties.

Animation is at the forefront of effective communication and expression but has historically been a time-consuming, technical process. dodl.es has simplified this process to help users create impressive animations faster than ever.\n  By leveraging the creative content of others through dodl.es' open marketplace, users can produce animated stories (or \u201cdodles\u201d) without requiring drawing or animation skills.  The user simply searches for pre-animated characters, objects, and scenes they want to add to their dodle, and selects licensed assets to tweak, if necessary.  Users can then quickly develop a dodle, visually directing these assets by selecting actions and recording audio for characters to lip sync to.\ndodl.es is positioning itself as an advocate for creators by offering new revenue streams for those publishing animated stories and those wanting to license scenes, objects, characters, sound effects, music, and voice acting, while also protecting their intellectual property.\nThe groundbreaking animation techniques within dodl.es  revolutionize the process of creating animated messages, memes, interactive comics, stories, games and more. The capabilities of the app appeal to both the casual hobbyist looking to create the next viral meme as well as the serious professional seeking to produce interactive advertising more efficiently.\nWe put dodl.es to the test and let you be the judge.\n      Craig Doriot has worked hard to overcome the challenges of autism and believes dodl.es will be a tool that helps those on the spectrum build effective outlets for their incredible gifts.

Tuskegee Heirs is a futuristic sci-fi adventure that follows a squadron of young, gifted aviators who are forced to become Earth\u2019s last line of defense against a menacing race of artificially intelligent villains bent on destroying civilization.\nTuskegee Heirs team\nWhat is The Premise: The duo looks to pay homage to the historic Tuskegee Airmen, while bringing forth a new set of character rich young heroes. With a graphic novel set to release mid 2016, Marcus and Greg intend to push this project towards animation. Following in the Japanese animation genre's age old practice of dropping unusually talented youths inside the cockpits of enormously powerful machines, the amazing pilots of this series will be no exception. \nTuskegee Pilot \"Able\" & Mech\nThe Tuskegee Heirs will be set 80 years in the future where a world sculpted by rapid progressing technology will come to ban human pilots from operating aircraft and go as far as to criminalize the act of even training pilots. Our young pilots, however, have found a secret training facility and refuge in the historical airfield once used by the fabled WWII War Heroes, the Tuskegee Airmen.  Under the careful guidance of Col. Mars, a long retired veteran pilot, the team of young hopefuls are trained and educated about the strong ethics that made the classic airmen the formidable unit that they were. Not long into their training, a mysterious military force composed of highly advanced self-aware war machines fixated on destroying civilization as they know it, declares war on all societies. Suddenly the teens are thrust into the middle of a war for humanities' right to exist. They will have to use their training as pilots, knowledge of history, and unique skill sets to defeat this fearsome enemy. \nTuskegee Heirs Pilot \"Able\"\nThroughout the series, we plan to highlight not only the history of the Airmen and their accomplishments, but also expose some of the lesser known history of the world. From Easter Island to the pyramids of Sudan, the Cahokia mounds of the midwest to the Olmec heads of Mexico, the team will see and share it all.\nWho are the Main Characters?\nABLE-\nAble\nOne of the most naturally gifted pilots on the team, Able was born to fly and with the extended hands-on training from Col. Mars, he may quickly become the most skilled pilot on the planet.\nAYANNA-\nAyanna\nThe team leader and strong moral compass that keeps the team in well oiled shape. A brilliant strategist and cool head under pressure, Ayanna was born to lead, and you'll be hard pressed to find a team member that will admit otherwise.  \nOMAR-\nOmar\nThe field mechanic on the team and talented tech specialist, Omar is a balanced pilot with strong will and a laid back demeanor. A hoarder of information, he proclaims himself a historian should the need for knowledge present itself.\nGENESIS-\nGenesis\n The brains of the outfit and team geographical/topographical expert that keeps the team up to date and informed on all mission details. An otherwise sweet and timid soul, Genesis comes alive in combat and is a truly fearsome force to be reckoned with.\nSLIP-\nSlip\nThe weapons expert of the team and thrill seeker with a cool head under pressure (sometimes too cool). The comic relief, Slip may be the shortest member on the team, but he boast the largest personality around. He often plays the dumb role to throw off his opponents only to later reveal just how sharp he truly is. \nJena-\nJena the Mechanic\n Every bit the mechanical genius, Jena keeps the Tuskegee Heirs flying while obsessing over all things Hi-tech. Just don't damage her planes without just cause because that has proven to be problematic.\nCOL. MARS- \nCol. Mars\n The founding Tuskegee Heir. Mars is the guiding force for the kids and keeps them together with lessons of team building and core values that aid them in all of their endeavors. While he takes a backseat to the action overall, underestimating this original Tuskegee Heir would spell disaster for any opponent.\nWhat will the comic look like? Stay tuned to both this page and the Tuskegee Heirs Facebook page as we will be releasing sample pages throughout the campaign to keep the eye candy flowing!\n-Flames of Destiny Cover art concept:\nFlames of Destiny\nThe Guys of Tuskegee Heirs\nRoad Trip\nWhat's the purpose of the Kickstarter? We're crafting this story to merge everything we love about science fiction, action-adventure, comedy, and rich character growth, to highlighting historic jewels of information to create a unique series for all ages. \nTuskegee Heirs Jet Concept\nCreating a graphic novel is no small feat, so producing the art, securing the right printer, paying for the print run, to delivery of such a product will take careful planning and tons of energy. Tuskegee Heirs is something we consider unique and needed to help inspire, educate and morally boost our young generation into seeing what wonderful potential they all have. \nKickstarter is a springboard platform that allows fans of this series to directly express their support by helping to financially fuel the creative art machine needed to produce and make this concept a reality. Everything from a comic, toy, animated cartoon, and video game series are possible. \nTuskegee Heirs Mech Concept\nStretch Goals:\n$15,000- ***(UNLOCKED)*** At this point we can craft for your reading & visual pleasure Issue #4 to tell a bit more of the story as it continues from (We'll send a digital copy to everyone who pledges $25 to $49. Physical copy to everyone who pledges $50 and up)\n--------\n$25,000- ***(UNLOCKED)*** Consider another graphic novel volume paid for and the birth of 3 more story issues (4-6) will be crafted. At this point we will be able to hire on some additional help to move things along which could result in less production time spent making the books. (We'll send a digital copy to everyone who pledges $50 to $79. Physical copy to everyone who pledges $80 and up)\nSma\n--------\n$35,000- ***(UNLOCKED)*** If we are able to reach $35,000, we'll proceed to create a Tuskegee Heirs T-Shirt line for Men, Women and Children. This means T-shirts that will feature character, vehicle and classic planes (for the aviator household out there).\nT-Shirt Lineup\nYouth Shirt Lineup\nSmashed 35K\n----------\n\n$45,000 ***(UNLOCKED)*** At this goal, we will be able to move forward with producing a family geared board game and sweet mobile game app. We've already begun talks with game designers/developers that are excited about creating a unique mobile experience that anyone could enjoy while on the go via mobile devices.\nEarly Game designs\nThere will Absolutely be action and adventure that drive the player throughout the mobile game, but we are passionate about creatively crafting a gaming experience that charges our players to pull up Google as they progress to research the history for themselves. Here's some rough concepts of what could be.\nConcept Game Art for the mobile app\n$45K Mobile game UNLOCKED\n-----------\n$55,000-In the case that we raise $55,000, we'll get started with developing a full figurine lineup of all the Tuskegee Heirs Characters including the Jet and Mech for your viewing pleasure. These will be available in both resin and color 3D printed versions and will stand in various heights starting around 5 inches and up.\nFigurine Lineup\n-----------\n$65,000-At this goal, there's no reason at all that we won't be able to produce a prototype toy of one of the characters and jets to approach toy manufactures with. We will start humbly and create the most clean working prototype that 3D printing will allow working with the same 3D artist that will help bring the figurines to life. Upon successfully producing the prototypes our goal will be to secure a toy line for the mass market.\n----------\n\n$75K and UP- ANIMATED PILOT (Short piece)\nIt is no secret that our ultimate goal is to get this concept animated into a series that can be enjoyed on monitors big and small. \nRough Storyboards-1\nRough Storyboards-2\nThe short Pilot piece will be use as a pitch piece (proof of concept) since we plan to approach subscription networks like Netflix, Hulu or OnDemand to be the publishing house for our series in an effort to give fans direct unfiltered access to the animated show upon the successful completion of it's 1st season. \nAnimation work in progress\nAnimation as a whole can be very expensive and even an animated short can have very steep estimates. The more support we have to reach this pilot goal, the more realistic the goal of crafting a proof of concept and later a full series will be. \nThe ladies of Tuskegee Heirs\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any creative project, there is a chance of delay before presenting a final product.

In the past few months though, it has turned into something bigger than I could have ever imagined. Having sparked hundreds of fan art submissions, becoming a trending topic on Google, and having thousands of shares on Tumblr and Facebook...I am hoping to turn this project up to the next level for fans of this project.\nWho are some of the characters?\nBlackmayne: Leader of the Trill League. His father (an ex-Black Panther) and mother were killed during a robbery attempt. In order to avenge their death, he has dedicated his life to fighting crime, but instilled with his father's views, he takes \"black power\" to the extreme by refusing to use anything white. This includes writing on paper, drinking milk, or stepping inside of any building that is white\u2026..but some would believe that he may be secretly attracted to white women. \nSparrow: Blackmayne's 11 year old bad ass lil' sidekick who is all about having fun and making sure his crime-fighting gear is fresh. He can often be found making sure his uniform match his kicks, doing the 'NaeNae' dance after defeating a criminal, or tweeting hip-hop producers during missions to listen to his mixtape.\nWondeisha: The \"First Woman\" of Trill League armed with superhuman strength and agility. She's often called ratchet due to her behavior, but no one can ever excuse her of not keeping it real with her teammates (she refuses to fight crime for more than 8 hours a day and mandatory weekends off). She's more concerned with fame and fashion than fighting crime. \nSoul: A pimp who gets one of the most powerful weapons in the universe must now devote his time to not only fighting some of the world's most dangerous villains, BUT also keeping his hoes in check.\nSwolemayne: The muscle of the team. With superhuman strength, agility and senses as well as the power of flight, there's not much he can't do. And he will let you know this! With one of the cockiest attitudes on the team and obsessed with his perfect physique, he uses all of this to his advantage to sleep with all the women who throw themselves at him. \n\u2026I'm talking TONS!\nWhat is the premise of the story?\nThe 1st Volume of the Trill League graphic novel starts off with the Wondeisha/Swolemayne sextape being leaked publicly. As a result, this causes turmoil amongst the team, which allows another superhero team to take over...\n\u2026but Blackmayne is suspicious of who is really behind this mysterious new squadron of heroes.  \nSo what is the purpose of this KICKSTARTER?\nAs a professional artist, currently working in Hollywood in both animation and comics, producing work for studios requires the majority of my time and I am unfortunately unable to devote my full attention to illustrating the graphic novel I have written for Trill League. I would like to put all of my energy into a product with not only a hilarious and engaging story, but high quality art as well. I also plan to illustrate posters/prints, revise the look of the current cast and develop new characters. The story line for the first graphic novel will have the Trill League going up against the Trillionaires (The Trill version of the Avengers) and also include parodies of other series including One Piece, Naruto, and Power Rangers as well as many hip-hop and urban culture references. \nPowers or no powers during superhero sex?\nIf this Kickstarter campaign is successful, I can temporarily suspend working for clientele and studios to fully devote energy into this graphic novel project. I will be able to take the art for this project to the next level, flesh out existing characters, create new ones and put together a world where all the characters hilariously interact with each other.\nWhere will the money go if this campaign is successful?\nThe initial goal is to raise $7,500 to produce the FIRST 2 ISSUES of the comic series. This will cover time to spend working on the comic and reward items as well as printing and shipping expenses. This is the bare minimum needed. \nThe first volume of the graphic novel consists of 6 issues though, so any additional funds above the initial $7,500 will allow me to work on more issues of the comic, as well as collaborate with other talented artists to speed up productivity (see Stretch Goals below). \nA new way to play card games\nMany people who have followed the project since its inception, enjoy the comedic writing of the characters and comic strips, and this is something I would love to further develop for people who enjoy this series as well as new readers. I feel this project is a first of its kind, merging both superhero and hip-hop culture in a hilarious story\u2026\n...and this is only the beginning.  \nTrill League takes hip-hop personalities like Diddy and Iggy Azalea and merges them with popular comic villains\n(*all reward items are mock-up designs and the look of the final product will differ)\n STRETCH GOALS TO PRODUCE MORE ISSUES!

The graphic novel is currently planned to be at least 75 pages and will consist of a collection of Urban Myth stories delivered by a great group of artists.  Our project goal will allow us to complete the art and editing of the graphic novel.\nAs a backer, you become part of the team and help us decide things, and if you choose, you can even create a place for yourself in the mythology.\nFor millennia, select individuals have been given a gift of cosmic proportions. In our history, those granted with this tremendous power have walked the earth as heroes and gods.\nThese uncanny women and men have been worshiped, feared, hunted and immortalized in lore.  Their stories have been chronicled in the varied mythologies of the world.  Overtime the legacies of Isis, Odin, Aries, Raiden, and others have become legend and fairy tales almost forgotten.\nToday a new era begins as the supernatural cycle renews. New mythologies will be born, and it all starts on a street block in your city. \nThe pages of Urban Myth are filled with heroes and villains who reflect our world. Stories and artists include:\n\nThe Gifting with art by Paulo Barrios\nOur story begins with \u201cThe Gifting\u201d which introduces us to a mixed family given the powers once embodied by the gods of Greek and Roman mythology. The block will change forever with the arrival of the New Olympians. As a reward, The Gifting is represented in whole as an independent comic book and also part of the collection of stories in the graphic novel. This story is drawn by the super talented Paulo Barrios, a sure star in the making.\nThe Pride with art by Eric Battle\nIn \u201cThe Pride\u201d we have the first sparks of international conflict between the new gods of Urban Myth. In the lush mountains of Jamaica, the Aeis of Norse Mythology are reestablished. The Pride of new gods are quickly forced to test themselves against a rival group intent on murder. This story is drawn by the amazing Eric Battle, an industry veteran of incredible ability. Eric\u2019s credits include comic\u2019s biggest titles such as Batman, JLA, Aquaman and the X-Men titles.\nGods of War with art by Raymund Bermudez\nWar is big business, and business has always been good. And in the world of Urban Myth, these guys have the monopoly. Gods of War is drawn by the incredible Raymund Bermudez. \"Berms\" is another rising superstar.\nSword Maidens with art by Gerardo Sandoval, Roc Upchurch, Ace Continuado and more.\nThe Sword Maidens are the first hero collective in the world of Urban Myth.  This section is a gallery to highlight the leading female heroes of the Urban Myth world, power players at the heart of everything we do. Each hero introduces themselves over art by a collection of outstanding artists. \nEpic with art by Kim Jacinto\nThis is an all-age story, suitable for young children and enjoyable by the whole family. The story features the three youngest New Olympians as they start to learn the ropes of crime-fighting . Epic is represented in whole as an independent comic/creative workbook and also part of the collection of stories in the graphic novel Art provided by the multitalented Kim Jacinto, a Marvel prospect.\nPantheon with art by Paulo Barrios\nPantheon is a continuation of the dream.  This story picks up right where the Graphic Novel leaves off and Paulo and I are anxiously hoping to hit the stretch goals to allow us to go deeper into this world with you.\nUrban Myth is as diverse as the Mythologies that have influenced it.  From our international team of artists to the global scope of our characters, Urban Myth is truly as multicultural as our world.  Imagination and cultural relevance are key drivers for creator Raymond Ayala.\n\n\"I've been building this universe since I was eight years old, and it's always been about telling cool stories.  Urban Myth is about imagination and possibilities, the multiculturalisms just happen.  Each concept grows organically, evolving through an integrating of elements from my environments, surrounding cultures, and history.

(see below)\nThe Story in a Nutshell\nDistractions is the story of Gill, a failed bodyguard who realizes that his quest to revenge the assassination of his client is nothing but a desperate attempt to avoid dealing with both the death of his wife and with taking on the scariest challenge he will ever face\u2026fatherhood.\nClick here for a 40 page sample!\nSet against the backdrop of a near future Chicago that has returned to the dark days of violence, corruption, and organized crime that defined the Windy City in the 1920\u2019s and 1930\u2019s, Distractions is a thriller with noir-ish undertones.\nGill's journey poses questions about moral ambiguity, loyalty, and personal responsibility. This is a story about recognizing the distractions we cling to, to avoid dealing with the most painful parts of life, and finding the courage to let those painful experiences change us and mold us into better people.\nThe Project\nDistractions is a graphic novel told in 4 parts. Each of the 4 parts is being released separately in digital formats. The print edition will contain all 4 parts as well as some great additional \"behind the scenes\" material. \nParts 1 & 2 are finished! With your support we can finish Parts 3 & 4.\nThe book is  colored in a \"reverse Wizard of Oz\" style. The first part, before the murder of Gill\u2019s wife, is in full color, but the majority of Gill\u2019s story is told using a very muted palette to reflect his emotional state. There are a few important pops of color that break through Gill\u2019s grey-colored haze, but full-color will only return if Gill can find a way out of the labyrinth of distractions he\u2019s hiding in.\nDistractions was designed from the ground up to look great not only on the printed page, but as a digital comic presented on small screens like the iPhone and other hand-held devices. Each page (maybe \u201cscreen\u201d is a better word) is drawn with a \u201cwide-screen\u201d  aspect ratio to take full advantage of the screen real-estate. \nThe text and the artwork were designed to be clear on even the oldest \"smart phone\". \nThis would be a \"screen\"....\nTwo \"screens\" make one page in the print edition.\nAlthough the guiding concept of the project is \u201cdigital before print,\u201d print considerations were always kept in mind. For example, each of the first 3 chapters is 44 \u201cscreens\u201d long, and as two screens stack nicely to fit a traditional comic page, it works out to 22 pages. The 4th chapter will come in at a higher page count as there is too much climactic awesomeness to contain in 22 pages!\nMaza is already hard at work on Part 3! Click to see more.\nThe Team\nWes Sturdevant is obsessed with story. His passion to become a storyteller led him from his home town of Bloomington, IN, to Chicago where he studied at Columbia College Chicago, and earned a BA in film production followed by an MFA in fiction writing. Distractions is one of a number of graphic literature projects he is developing. He is also working on other writing projects for both children and adults. His off-beat supernatural thriller Dirt Bird is available from Amazon and from ebook retailers including Apple, Barnes & Noble, Sony, and Amazon.\nWes lives in Indianapolis, where his lovely wife, darling baby girl, affectionate cat, and irrepressible three-legged mutt, somehow find a way to tolerate him.\nYou can learn more about Wes and what he\u2019s up to at: www.storyandmedia.net\nMaza (aka Milorad Vicanovic) is an extremely efficient and prolific illustrator whose talent and versatility allows him to do illustrations for books and magazines, as well as comics. Besides Distractions, he is currently working on two graphic novels for French publishers; Wunderwaffen for Soleil and Lady Spitfire for Delcourt. His comic portfolio includes Triangle Rose, and two tomes of the Vekovnici graphic novel series and he is the creator of The Uninvited Hero. Maza also organizes Salon Stripa Laktasi, an annual comic festival that gathers together the most important artists from the Balkans.\nMaza lives in Laktasi, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where his wife and two sons occasionally let him use his computer. If you ask him why he is an artist he will tell you, \u201cThere's no life without drawing and breathing.\u201d\nYou can see more of his work here: http://mazastrip.blogspot.com\nThe Money\nWhat will we do with the money? \nAchieving our $3000 goal will make a nice dent in the myriad of expenses involved in producing Distractions. This includes covering all of the costs involved in producing and delivering those sweet backer rewards, as well as some of the tools (both physical and digital) that Maza and I use in creating the book. If we exceed our goal we are likely to blow the additional money on Gatorade to replenish the electrolytes lost via the sweat equity we have, and will continue to, put into this project. Maza might also use some of the money to feed his cat.\nMaza's cat thinks you should back Distractions!\nYou can find out more about the project and the creators at www.storyandmedia.net \nPlease note that Distractions is intended for mature readers\nNew Rewards!\nDistractions is not the only collaboration between Maza and I. He and I have been working together on a 23 page children's picture book titled Clever Little Hermes. It\u2019s my retelling of the classic myth about how the infant Hermes (the Greek messenger god) pulled a clever prank on his brother Apollo (the sun god). The Illustrations are a collaboration between Maza, who did the drawings, and Ozren Mi\u017edalo, who colored and textured them.\nThe book is nearly finished. Ozren is completing the colors on the last pages now and I expect it to be done and in print by the end of the summer.\nThrough a special arrangement with Maza and Ozren, I\u2019m now able to offer backers of the Distractions Kickstarter advance copies of both the paperback print edition and a PDF edition of Clever Little Hermes!\nI tried my best to keep the new rewards simple. Basically, you can upgrade most reward levels to include a paperback print copy of Clever Little Hermes for an additional $15. There are also options for getting more than one print copy and an option to receive a PDF copy.\nAlready a backer?\nIf you are already a backer and you would like to adjust your pledge to get your advance copy/copies of Clever Little Hermes, all you have to do is use the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button, adjust your pledge amount, and choose the reward you would like.\nThanks for taking the time to check out Distractions and the new Clever Little Hermes rewards!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Richard", "content": "Any new information you can give us backers?", "time": "almost 7 years ago"}, {"username": "Richard", "content": "I was just wondering if there were any updates about how things are progressing?", "time": "over 8 years ago"}, {"username": "Gerolf Nikolay", "content": "The combo with Clever Little Hermes is even a better package.
