[{"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Accession was formed from the question, \"Can it ever be a good idea to 'brick' your own computer?\"\nYES, YES IT CAN.\nThe focus of this project is to build a prototype of Accession.\n\nWhy Not Use Hardware AND Software to Protect Your Data?\nAccession is a different way of looking at security for your computer. It is a combined hardware and software solution designed to make your computer completely inaccessible when you are not using it, employs a philosophy of compartmentalization in design, integrates a multitude of security software to help protect it AND utilizes a USB \"key\" to run it.\n\nHardware Designed for Security\nThe building blocks of Accession start with the hardware. Accession will be built utilizing three separate encrypted solid state drives; one to store specialized operating system files (not actual operating systems) and two additional drives to store daily backups and hourly snapshots.\nVisual Representation of the USB \"Key\"\nAt the core of Accession is a USB flash drive that it uses as a \"key\". This flash drive houses RiseOS, our own operating system that runs the entire computer. When this \"key\" is removed, it \"bricks\" the computer, making your data completely inaccessible as there is no operating system to hack.\nImagine being able to physically secure your computer in something as simple as a lock box when your work day is over. Accession allows you to do this and more. These \"keys\" can even be assigned to workers or employees if multiple people use the same computer.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nIntegrated Software Solutions\nAccession doesn't only rely on its unique structure for security, it will contain software solutions to help protect your data. This includes encryption on all hard drives, automated primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your entire computer in the event of a catastrophic viral infection (including ransomwares!) or other disastrous failure, real-time monitoring and a data loss prevention (DLP) system.\n\nCompartmentalization\nCompartmentalization- the division of something into sections or categories. Also a military term for separating the details of an operation between operatives to prevent the entire operation from being compromised if any one operative is captured.\nThis is the philosophy behind Accession.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nAccession not only compartmentalizes your data through hardware means, but also through software. Accession will have the ability to run multiple, separate operating systems within RiseOS. These can either be a transplanted, existing installation or a fresh installation.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nThis means your current computer, programs AND data can be transferred to Accession with NO loss of functionality!\nThis compartmentalization combined with all your data separated between three encrypted physical locations, which are only accessible through the USB \"key\", decreases the chances of any of your data becoming compromised.\n\nThe Project As It Sits Now\nAs of the writing of this project, we currently have two \"working models\" of Accession (NEITHER is an actual prototype, as these \"working models\" are not built using the planned form factor, CPU, RAM or hard drive specifications of the actual proposed prototype system, however, RiseOS is installed on,and working from,a USB flash drive on both \"working models\"). These \"working models\" were built so we could begin the coding and building of the operating system and additional security features, and to start preliminary testing. The images above contain actual screenshots of RiseOS. We added the monitor to make it look fancy. We have secured a vendor, and contacted numerous others, to manufacture the prototype computer (without the operating system) and the finished systems.\nRiseOS is roughly 60% complete as of this writing. It is based on another operating system, SanctumOS, we created, so the basics are already in place, what is remaining to complete is additional in-depth coding to enhance the security software and remediation systems and to tighten up the look and feel of the operating system to make it more familiar and user-friendly.We are also developing a simpler graphical interface for unlocking the encrypted drives.\nThe \"working models\" of Accession have gone through preliminary testing of the primary and secondary remediation systems against ransomware infections; specifically Petya, NotPetya, WannaCry and Ryuk. We believed this was essential to complete as soon as possible as this is a primary feature of Accession. These remediation plans have been used successfully on other solutions offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, but not with this complex of a design. They have performed admirably in all preliminary tests and recovered 100% from each infection. The recovery process took between 45 and 53 minutes depending on the infection and whether it was the primary or secondary remediation system. We project that the actual prototype recovery time will be quicker due to the higher proposed hardware specifications. We will be uploading a screen capture of a ransomware infection on Accession and the recovery process through the primary remediation system once the security coding is more complete, roughly within the second week of April. (this video will be edited ONLY for time constraints. We don't believe ANYONE wants to sit through a 53-minute video of a bar slowly moving across the screen, although we will make the complete, unedited video available to any backer who wishes to see it. [UPDATE: The video actually ended up being 87 minutes, see our UPDATES]). The secondary remediation system does take the computer out of the operating system, so doing a screen capture of this remediation system will be a little difficult. This secondary remediation system is planned only to be used as a last ditch recovery system.\n\nPlans for Funding\nThe funds we are raising will be used for the following:\n-  The materials for, and construction of, an actual prototype system, this includes all the proposed hardware (i.e. form factor shell, CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives and USB drive);\n-  The hiring of one or two additional employees for additional coding, both controlled-environment and \"real world\" testing, and other responsibilities;\n-  The filing of a provisional patent and of the actual patent once Accession is completed;\n-  Expenses associated with testing Accession in a \"real world\" business environment. This includes the cost of commonly used business software such as Quickbooks, MySQL, CRM software, etc. to ensure Accession does not inhibit any such software;\n-  Expenses associated with testing Accession within different business network structures. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual servers, VPNs, networked drives, NAS systems, cloud storage, cloud computing, etc.;\n-  The writing, editing and printing of a \"quick start\" user's manual and the creation of a troubleshooting website;\n-  An additional \"slush\" fund for unexpected expenses. We have tried to take into account any and all expenses associated with this project, but as any creator or developer will tell you, there is always something unexpected that appears.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks:\n We are not new to technology. Our team of two have a combined 57 years working with, building and designing computers, hardware and software. We are fully versed in multiple forms of coding for Windows and Linux. Josh started his own computer repair and service company, Trust Tech Management (www.trusttechmanagement.com), in 2015 geared towards providing honest, inexpensive and quality computer services for small businesses and residential users. Realizing there was a need for innovative cybersecurity solutions for small businesses, he started Archai Solutions, LLC (www.archaisolutions.com) unofficially in 2020 and officially in 2021, with the philosophy that standard cybersecurity techniques were not working and new, revolutionary solutions were needed. If the accepted solutions were enough, hackers and ransomware attacks would not be the threat they are.\n\n We have been working hard to ready Accession for Kickstarter, but life is nothing if not unpredictable. Here are the risks we foresee and our plans for assessing them:\n\nCURRENT SILICON SHORTAGE: With everything that has happened in the world in the past year, every day life has become disrupted. Manufacturing and supply has been no different. Anyone in technology knows that there is currently a shortage of silicon. This is making computer parts, such as motherboards, graphics cards, etc. in short supply. We have identified and contacted numerous vendors to help reduce any shortages or lead times we may come across that could prevent fulfillment of Accession.\n\nCODING AND DESIGN: Even with all our experience, there's no way around it; coding and design takes time. This along with our philosophy to make this system as simple to operate as possible and give it an easy-to-understand, familiar look and feel, sometimes makes this process a little slow. We are designing this system for EVERYONE, not just technology fanatics.\n\nACTS OF GOD: Every day can bring new challenges. Fires, natural disasters, emergency situations can all happen in the blink of an eye. We are using two different locations for R&D to prevent any natural disaster from disrupting the development of Accession.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Josh Van Metre\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI have been in the technology business for over 25 years.

You will be \"leveled up\" by gaining this knowledge.\n\nRegardless if you are a beginner with Python or a seasoned programming rock-star, Michael Driscoll will help you continue to grow in your developer journey. There are hundreds of awesome tutorials on his blog, Mouse Vs Python, that you can read for free! \n\nImage Processing with Python uses the Pillow package. Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library. Pillow originally released in 2010 and has been stable for many years. It is a well known and trusted imaging library for Python. \n\nYou can rest assured that Michael knows Python. He has been programming and writing about it for over a decade. Michael also has EIGHT other Python books.\n\nYou can get a free sample of the book using this link. This contains a PDF version of the first 3 chapters.\n\nPillow: Image Processing with Python will be published in April 2021\n\nIf you miss the campaign, the book can also be purchased on Leanpub: https://leanpub.com/pillow/\n\nThis book will be printed in COLOR.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

All the pages of the book will be printed on special thick 157gsm paper. This is a high-quality mat art paper, which definitely feels well and holds well. The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The first and most important thing was to assemble the team of professionals. We spent some time looking for illustrators whose drawing style would be convenient and could match with others\u2019 styles. It was a big deal to find writers for this project as soon as our expectations were rather high and we had a huge number of unsuccessful attempts before we could find writers who can perfectly complement their texts with the illustrations. We also searched out for many researches who support both our writers and illustrators with all the needed technical information. We managed to find experts in scientific, medical, technical and social fields who constantly advise us on what information the book should include to provide readers precise and workable instructions. All in all, we have 36 people in our team, about 10 side experts and this number is constantly growing. After that came the second step of our work which unfortunately took more time and turned out to be more complicated than we expected. We all had to get used to each other to stabilize and optimize the working process. The problem on the technical side was that we\u2019re an international team of nearly 40 people living in different countries all over the world. Time lag challenged our determination and commitment to work together on this amazing project. Finally, we won this fight but there were many others yet to come. Sometimes it was a hard time for us to learn to hear each other, we could meet every day and argue about many small and insignificant thing for hours. We still meet every day but now we can proudly say that our meetings are more productive than ever before. At last, making process is synchronized and we\u2019re actively working on the book.

To bring this concept to life we\u2019re working hardly and experimenting on both levels of the book \u2013 illustrations and texts.\n\nWe think that the best way to describe our way of working process is to say that we use cut-and-try approach.

It is impossible to spot any pixel on the screen that is projected.\" --Tyriel Wood\nMade by Unbox Fantasy, a professional crew assemblage from the former editors of tech review media. \nStill tethered to the past with an old bulky head-mounted display (HDM) or backpack-sized HD monitor weighing on your mood while working or watching entertainment? You may be feeling dizzy due to the visual \u2018melee attack\u2019 of first-gen displays or bothered by curious prying eyes when watching videos in public, or feeling self-conscious like a time-traveler with a bizarre gadget strapped to your head while trying to relax with some multimedia?\nGet GodView and set yourself free from old technology for an incredibly immersive visual experience for fun and productivity. Whether you are a hardcore gamer, movie fanatic, or busy commuter looking for an entertainment solution, GodView is a revolutionary solution that delivers an extradimensional experience for multimedia. A next-gen wearable with a perfectly balanced super lightweight, affordable, and stylish design suitable for everyday use.\nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\n\nGodView is designed as a standard-setting smart device, to bring user & budget-friendly mixed reality to life. Any content on your mobile phone can be cast wirelessly to the 300-inch virtual display in front of you.  It unveils vivid imagery before your eyes, empowering you with superb vision even more lifelike than what your eyes can show you.  \nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\nHigh Resolution\nGodView serves as a match for a professional monitor with a resolution of 2*2560*2560 (5K) that is sharp enough to eliminate ghosting, graininess, or optical grating, which allows you to experience visual details you can\u2019t see with typical displays.\n 3650 PPI See-Through Demo:\n Large Display Size & FOV \nGodView creates a massive 300\u2019\u2019 virtual display with a binocular 110-degree wide field of view (FOV) that naturally merges virtual details into the real-world viewed through the lens, for an incredibly immersive experience.\nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\n High Refresh Rate & Brightness\n  GodView supports a 90Hz refresh rate so the images you see are always extremely smooth without visible flickering, and with a brightness up to 2000 nits, the display is ultra-clear even in bright daylight.\nMyopia Adaptability\nIf you wear glasses, it\u2019s time to put them aside! GodView can self-tune its clarity for myopia of -8~0D, which means near-sighted users can see clearly and comfortably without wearing their everyday glasses or contacts. (Offered as an optional function in addition to the standard model). By continuously controlling the change of focal length, the eye can be trained to achieve the purpose of adjusting myopia. Holographic optics change and adjust the focal length automatically according to an advanced algorithm.\nNB.

Without the distraction of cords or a bulky headset, you can indulge yourself completely with \u2018God\u2019s view\u2019 and enjoy the best visuals.\n\n  Why Super Waveguide \nGodView utilizes the super waveguide optical solution made of lightweight resin. This innovation transforms the conventional head-mounted display into an everyday fashion item weighing just 55g, less than 1/10 of Microsoft HoloLens\n Wi-Fi Connectivity \nGodView achieves its unique lightweight performance without a heavy battery or processor onboard. It uses a compact Wi-Fi 6 bridge housing a power supply that can work continuously for over 4 hours and any multimedia on your smartphone can be cast wirelessly to the GodView virtual display in front of your eyes.

The Kolude Hub version is designed with an all-in-one docking function that lets you read and transfer data, and charge your keyboard or other devices, all at an extremely fast rate\u2014doing what no other keyboard could do. \nIf you\u2019re a busy traveler who needs a spectacular keyboard to go with you wherever adventure, work or business takes you, we have a special Bluetooth version of the Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard. Along with being extremely compact and portable, the Bluetooth version offers you a truly wireless experience. The built-in 850 mAh lithium battery provides you 10 hours of continuous working time with a backlight and 650 hours without a backlight. In short, with the Bluetooth version, the Kolude KD-K2 allows you to get everything done and going wherever you are, wherever you go!\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with your Mac or iPad, you\u2019ll be thrilled to have an extremely advanced multifunctional keyboard hub that lets you do more\u2014whether it\u2019s work or play\u2014with your Apple Devices. We\u2019re introducing the Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard, designed to let you extract even more value from your Apple devices, having far more gaming fun or working efficiency with a keyboard hub like no other. \nA superb feature of the keyboard that deserves a highlight is the Full Functional Host, a USB 3.1 type-C uplink interface that not only supports iPad 11\u201d/\u201d12.9 and MacBooks with USB-C generations, but also other non-Apple devices, such as Surface Pro7 and other laptops and tablets with a USB-C interface. \nThe Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard is equipped with Hotkey functions that are compatible with iPad OS and Mac OS. At the same time, we\u2019ve added more optimization functionalities for Windows to achieve higher compatibility, and a switching play between Mac and Windows just by pressing several keys combined. \nThe Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard is made from premium aluminum. That makes it an extremely stylish keyboard that\u2019s also robust and made to last. At the same time, the aluminum structure prevents the device from overheating and from feeling too hot when you use it, and it keeps it extremely lightweight and easy to carry.\n\nAn impressive design that kills your productivity doesn\u2019t impress us at all. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built the Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard with round groove buttons with scissor-switch keys. This ensures that you have highly reliable, responsive and quiet keys with short travel times that perform wonderfully when it comes to typing. After all, what\u2019s a keyboard good for if not for typing, right?\n\nNow this is a matter of personal preference, which is why we created three options. You can have your Kolude KD-K2 in silvery, gray, black version. Either way, this is the ultimate keyboard that you\u2019ll definitely enjoy working or playing with!\nThis is not our first Kickstarter campaign. In fact, in March 2020, we completed a successful Kickstarter for the Kolude KD-K1, the previous version of the now launched keyboard. We raised a total of USD $172,000, over 1,000% of our funding goal, and we diligently fulfilled our rewards to our backers. That tells you that we have the experience, technical knowledge and background to create a new Kickstarter success story for the Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard, which can now be yours!\nKolude was founded in Shenzhen, China, where our own established factory with more than 100 professionals who work every day on every stage to get our products excellently manufactured. We also have a team of highly experienced designers who focus on designing and creating state-of-the-art electronic and non-electronic accessories, such as Kolude KD-K2, which we\u2019re now presenting to you.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike all Kickstarter projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the quality we demand of ourselves.

We love Black and many backers have asked for Black for our previous project because Black color is more stain-resistant in the long run. White color chargers are for illustrative purposes and may be offered later at retail after fulfillment for Kickstarter is completed. Please understand that having multiple color choices, especially for different chargers within the same reward will just complicate and delay the entire Kickstarter fulfillment process. For example, we won't be able to ask for your color choices until after the project ends via a survey which means we cannot accurately prepare the rewards beforehand.\nEarly Bird Special (50% off)\n$39    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$49    -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$88    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nKickstarter Special (40% off)\n$48     -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$59     -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$108   -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nExpected Retail Price\n$79.99     -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$99.99     -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$179.98    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nReward Fulfilment\nTo ensure timely reward delivery, we will ship rewards via insured postal service from our fulfillment and distribution centers in:\nCalifornia USA - fulfilling rewards within the United States\nProject Timeline\nSeptember 28, 2020 - Kickstarter begins\nOctober 26, 2020 - Kickstarter ends\nNovember 2020 - Production begins\nDecember 2020 - Shipping of Early Bird rewards\nJanuary 2021 - Shipping of Kickstarter rewards\nFrom the team that brought you the World's First 100W USB-C battery pack and Kickstarter Most Funded power bank project\n(as well as the world's 1st, smallest, and most crowdfunded 100W GaN charger)\nAbout Us\nHYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making award-winning USB-C products since 2015. We also have a long proven track record of delivering Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects. Our most successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo project, HyperDrive USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro, raised over $3.1 million and is currently the most crowdfunded MacBook and USB-C accessory. Our latest Kickstarter and Indiegogo, HyperJuice 100W GaN Charger, which raised over $3.3 million is the most crowdfunded USB-C charger. The HyperJuice 130W USB-C Battery Pack is the most crowdfunded power bank project on Kickstarter ($1.4M). Our HyperDrive USB-C Hub for iPad Pro is the most crowdfunded iPad accessory ($1.2M) and many more. So we do have a lot of experience with USB-C and Apple products. This is our 26th crowdfunding project. Our previous crowdfunding projects have altogether raised over $14 million and we have delivered to over 140,000 backers.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nBig thanks to Team MVP for producing our awesome video and product photos.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is without risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Kickstarter. We are also no strangers to portable power, USB-C, mobile accessories or crowdfunding.\n\nThe HyperJuice charger that you see in the above video/photos are actual full working prototypes.\n\nWith your support, we can bring HyperJuice to users everywhere. We have started mass production and your contribution will help us achieve economies of scale and keep the product cost low.\n\nWe have sufficient materials to manufacture about 5,000 units now. Beyond that, the lead time is about a month. Your strong support will give us the needed affirmation to place a larger raw materials order and start mass production earlier.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "1 x HyperJuice 65W (KS Special)", "descp": "Get one (1) HyperJuice 65W, at 40% off the expected retail price of $79.99!

It establishes the standard for future USB power strips by providing higher speed charges for all your appliances including laptops while eliminating the need for adapters.\nFunctionality doesn\u2019t have to come at a cost of good design. Adopting a tradition-defying look, sleek outline and fireproof glossy coating, PowerCloud transcends into a sophisticated desktop powerhouse to keep a complete workstation and entertainment center fully powered and charged.\nIt is a must-have essential for working from home. If you are busy working to a tight schedule at home in the presence of your family, Powercloud automatically keeps all the cords and devices organized so well and makes clutters and messes disappear for good.\n\nPowerCloud is a power strip equipped with 3 AC outlets, 2 USB-C Power Delivery (PD) ports and 1 USB-A Quick Charge (QC) port.\nIn addition to providing a large amount of power for electrical devices such as computers, TVs, printers and lighting, it also offers blazing-fast, adapter-free, cable-only USB charges to phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nLeading the way is the 65W of USB-C power - the highest of all on the market - able to give your 13\u201d MackBook Pro or MacBook Air a full-speed charge without the need for additional usb power bricks.\nIf you commute daily between your residence and workplace, you can have one PowerCloud at home and one in the office, then you can say goodbye to those heavy, bulky adapters without worrying about your devices running out of power.\nIf you travel a lot, you just need to bring one PowerCloud which fits perfectly in your backpack instead of lugging around several big power adapters to have all of your devices powered up or charged up at maximum speed.\nPowerCloud not only supports PD3.0 fast charge tech through its dual USB-C ports but also QC3.0 through the USB-A port rated at 18W, able to charge compatible devices up to 4 times faster than a conventional USB power strip. For instance, you can charge your smartphone up to 80% in just 30 minutes.\nPowerCloud can quickly charge everything you throw at it. In addition to smartphones, tablets and laptops, it also works with Nintendo switch, Kindle, power banks, keyboard, headphones, smart watches, table fan and light.\n\nPowerCloud packs three AC outlets in its compact footprint which are widely spaced to accommodate even oversized plugs and power adapters without overlapping.\nThe contact points inside the socket are made with absolute precision at a level of 0.1mm and subjected to rigorous tests to ensure secure grips after thousands of times of use. It won\u2019t become loose or wear out over time to cause heat or sparks, nor too tight to budge the prongs.\nPowerCloud puts the safety of you and your expensive electronics above all else by employing an all-around 10-fold protection. It offers safeguards against overheat, overcurrent, overvoltage, overcharge, short circuit, overload, undervoltage and electrical shock, fried components, pokes of fingers or other objects. It also comes with a fire-resistant casing of the highest fireproof standard in the industry.\nDon't work with an office or live with a home tied down by messy wires and tangles of electric cords. Powercloud helps keep your space clutter-free and your mind stress-free for maximum productivity and creativity. The ports on the PowerCloud are strategically arranged in two separate zones: the top zone dedicated to AC outlets and the front zone dedicated to DC usb outputs. The power cables on the front can be routed to the back and hidden from sight. The USB cables on the front are easy to access and quick to plug/unplug. So they won\u2019t end up unruly and bundled up together. And the separation of high- and low-voltage ports eliminates the risk of electric shock and fire hazards.\nPowerCloud is the best 6-port charging station for multiple devices. It connects up to 6 devices simultaneously, meeting the diverse power needs for work and play of the whole family.\n\n\nCombined with smart IC, PowerCloud automatically detects and adjusts the power for connected devices accordingly and ensures rapid, optimal charging while greatly extending the lifespan of the batteries.\n\nPowerCloud packs 65W of USB power, which can either be distributed throughout the three ports or dedicated solely to the USB-C port with a minimum of 45W output even when all the ports are plugged in, giving your laptop or tablet a good amount of juice.\nPowerCloud sports a minimalist design which will blend in nicely sitting next to your iMac, MacBook or iPhone. It is a departure from blocky, tedious power strips that are meant to hide under desks and behind furniture. You can leave it in plain sight on a desk or table top as a decor which adds functional style to a workspace at home or in the office.\n\nThere is a LED light which will illuminate green when your devices are being charged, and a master switch to turn on and off all power.\nSince 2008, Torras has been a brand that never settles for mediocrity and is full of aspirations and dreams.

On each Omen card it outlines how many Room Tiles, How Many Enemies Start, and Boss health cards at the start of the game. \nPlayers will use these tiles to construct the map. There are 4 types of tiles: Enemy Spawn Tiles, Player Spawn Tiles, Regular Tiles, and The VAULT. Players will start by placing The Vault tile, then regular Tiles ending with spawn tiles.  \nOnce all the regular tiles are placed, Players can now choose where to place their spawn tiles and the enemy spawn tiles. \nEach character also has a unique set of actions, such as how far they can move and how many tokens they can use.\nPlayers will have to use their abilities and their tokens to scare enemies away from the Scare Factory. Eventually, you will have to fight off the boss that is leading the attack. Work together and combine your abilities in order to stop the humans from commercializing fear itself! If you want to know more or see the game in action, take a look at the videos on our page. Start defending The Scare Factory from those pesky humans and capitalists! \nSpeaking of which, the enemies in Scare Factory get a turn all to themselves. They each spawn on a unique enemy tile at the start of the game. They roll a dice which dictates where they go. Sometimes, if you\u2019re lucky, you can choose where they go. Most of the time they will search the factory for you, so you have to be careful!\nWhen an enemy is fooled into stepping on a scare token, they will be scared. Players then roll to see which direction they go. Again, like regular enemy movement, there is a chance that players can control where the enemies go. Sometimes the enemy will flee the board immediately. We will discuss that in a moment. If you land on another scare token, this starts a scare chain! After three scares, an enemy flees, removing them from the board. One of the most important parts of the game is these scare chains. \nAnother big aspect of enemy interaction is Ward Tokens. If an enemy walks into a ward token, players become able to move said enemy wherever they choose. As you may be able to tell, this is very helpful in completing a scare chain.\nThe Boss is a very powerful force to be reckoned with, so it\u2019s best to be on your toes. The boss will not be active at the start, letting minions do the dirty work, but inevitably they will come to deal with meddling interlopers (like you) themselves! Bosses have a set of ability cards that give them and the other enemies new powers. There are 32 total, but only 5 are active at a time.  \nThese abilities serve another important purpose: they act as the bosses' life. With each scare you pull off while the boss is active, you can remove an ability from the pile. Once this is done, the ability underneath is revealed and becomes active during the boss phase. Keep fighting through and remove all the cards in order to win! Hopefully, this has given you a bit more insight into the threat you are fighting against! Good luck in your fight to free the Scare Factory!\nDo you want to Test Play 'The Scare Factory' ? If so sign-up to get access to a tabletop simulator version. SIGN UP\nThe game is 100% playable without stretch goals, but we feel these are great incentives to provide to our backers for helping us fund 'The Scare Factory'. Also all stretch goals will be considered KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!!!!   \nMORE TO COME!!!!\n Being a first-time creator on Kickstarter we knew miniature production is a huge aspect of having an immersive player experience. I wanted to share a bit of our story about how we developed our miniatures.\nInitially, we wanted amazing characters in the game, but we also wanted them to look great. Our first step was to concept everything in 2d. From the concepts, we went into 3d development with our Talented art team.  The 3d development was combined with many iterations from the Design team on how the characters should look and feel. Lastly, we purchased 2 3d resin printers to test each 3d model. After each character was 3d printed we made adjustments to height, the scale of objects, details, etc. Just so everyone is aware we did 3d print every single character a minimum of 3-5 times to make sure iterations improved. The Video below showcases the full process of the Man-O-War expansion Boss!!!\n\n As explained earlier we adjusted our character heights via iterations and came up with our own scale that we thought was a great fit. Our heights range between 33mm (humans) and 60mm (Players and Bosses) \nWe really wanted to show off our amazing miniatures and decided to partner with a couple of painters. We reached out to Circle of Nerds and he offered an amazing paint demo (showcased below). We will also be doing a live painting demo with Life of a Board Gamer on October 20,2020 for everyone to check out. \n Some More Showcases \n Social Media\nWe have been doing quite a few posts on Instagram to show real pictures of the game and also have some youtube videos showing testing, art dev, and much more. Here are some links to check out our social media\nInstagram\nYouTube\nBGG \nShipping Details: All shipping prices are estimated in USD and are subject to change. We will also be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics to help with customs and tax friendly shipping. We will also be doing free local pickup for anyone located in The Greater Toronto or Kitchener/Waterloo Area. \nSupAR Games originally created in 2018. We focused our development on Augmented Reality technologies while doing some work for hire projects. We took our years of video game development and poured our efforts into 'The Scare Factory'. We brought on an art team, design team, and multiple testers. Together we have spent over 5000 hours to bring you 'The Scare Factory'\n Special Thanks to the people below to help us showcase 'The Scare Factory'\nLance Hinkel from Learn 2 Play for Learn to Play Video and Overview \nMark Streed from Dice Tower for the Preview \nOMG Nexus for Interview and an Overview \nLouie Martinez from Circle of Nerds for his Miniature painting demo\nDanijel Ljubas from Life of a Board Gamer for his painting livestream on October 20\nStephanie Cassandra from Minimum Player Count for a great video (coming soon)\nBoth Sides of My Table for an awesome written preview\nand the friends and family that help support the development of The Scare Factory\n Our timeline has been carefully planned. With the majority of art already created we will only need some touchups for production and template focused. We have already reached out to multiple manufacturers and they are prepared to take on our project. There is always a chance of delay, but we will make sure to let the backers know about any delays in production. \n Pledge Manager will be Backerkit ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nScare Factory is the first tabletop game that SupAR Games has worked on. Thanks to our experienced staff we have done our best to avoid the classic pitfalls that many first time projects fall into, but we still feel that it\u2019s important for you to know. We have assembled a team with a wide variety of skills to ensure that we are able to not only create the best content we can, but also to get different voices to help keep our goals realistic and our vision achievable. The main game art has mostly been completed already. The only new art that would be needed is for stretch goals and updating for printing components. That will allow us to get into production quite fast. \n\nWe are working hard to ensure that production will go smoothly, but as you may expect, it is possible that there may be COVID-19 related delays.

I have found that while learning how the various widgets work in wxPython is valuable, it is even better to learn by creating a simple application that does something useful.\nThe code in this book will be targeted for Python 3 only using wxPython 4.\nNote: If you missed the campaign, you can still get the book over on Leanpub. It will also be available on Amazon, Gumroad and other retailers in May 2018.\nCreating GUI Applications with wxPython\nThe code in this book will run on all 3 major platforms:\nWindows \nMac \nLinux\nIn this book, we will be creating the following applications:\nA simple image viewer \nA database viewer \nA database editor \nCalculator\nAn archiving application (zip / tar) \nPDF merging application \nXML Editor \nWe will also learn how to turn your applications into executables for Windows.\nAs you learn how to create these applications, you will also learn how wxPython works. We will go over how wxPython's event system works, how to use threads in wxPython, make use of sizers and much, much more!\nStretch Goal #1: $5500 (COMPLETE)\nAdd chapters on the following topics:\nMP3 Tag Editor\nNASA image downloader / search tool\nStretch Goal #2: $8000\nAdd new chapters that cover\nFile search utility ($6500)\nSimple FTP application ($7250) \nGraph creator (or TBA) ($8000)\nRelease Date\nI expect to have this book finished by May 2019\nWriting Style \nThis book will be written using my original conversational style. What this means is that the chapters will probably vary in size more than most programming books. \nI still follow the rule of giving simple examples paired with simple explanations instead of spending an inordinate amount of time re-explaining the same subject over and over.\nIf you've never read anything of mine before, you can download Python 101 for free or read it online. You can also check out my blog for writing examples.\nWho should read this book? \nThis book is for someone who already uses Python and would like to learn how to use Python to create fun cross-platform graphical user interfaces.\nWhat's the money for?\nISBNs cost money, especially if you have multiple formats of the book (paperback, PDF, mobi, etc). The money will also cover the initial print run of the book for the backers. It will also cover copyright registration and the cost of my illustrator. It would be great if I could do some web advertising as well. \nI'm looking forward to working with my backers to make the best Python book possible!\nAbout the Author\nI'm a professional full time Python programmer by day and Python blogger by night. I've been programming almost exclusively in Python for almost 10 years. I co-authored Core Python for DZone.

Places for good.\nSadly, we found ourselves more and more disappointed and frustrated about what existing ones are turning out to be: giant monetisation platforms with very little care and interest for their best asset: people.\n\nWe could probably write a book about everything wrong going on, but chances are if you have an internet or tv connection you have seen it in the news lately. \nSo instead, we'll focus on what makes Openbook different than any other social network.\n\ud83d\udd4a Honesty\nClaiming that you do something is not enough. People should be able to prove it. That's why all of the code for Openbook will be open-source.\nThis means anyone will be able to check on what we are exactly doing and hold us accountable for it.\n\nGoodbye closed walls!\n\ud83d\ude48 Privacy-friendly\nThis was our initial drive to build Openbook.\nWe wanted to create a social network where we could chat and share things with our friends and family with the confidence that our privacy was respected and protected.\n\nOpenbook will have zero tolerance for the tracking and monitoring of people.\nSurf the network with absolute peace of mind! \ud83c\udfd6\n\ud83d\udcb8 A revenue model that supports content creators!\nLet's get it out of the way: Our revenue model is not nor ever will be advertisement. \nInstead, it will be based on a digital currency called Tip \ud83c\udff5.\n\nThis currency will be used for a lot of things. Our priority though?\nSupporting content creators.\n\nThe internet is nothing without content creators and we are committed to finding ways for them to not just make a living but also have a stable income and make profit.\nYou will be able to Tip them at any given moment, but even better, become their angel and commit to donating certain amount of money to them on a flexible or fixed manner.\nIn exchange, they will be able to create exclusive content for you which you will receive directly in your feed.\nThis is just one example of the things possible with Tips \ud83c\udff5 ! Read more here\n\ud83d\ude9a Got another social network? Bring it all with you!\nDue to recent advancements in data-portability pushed by the European Union, if you already have a social network you will be able to import your photos, videos, chats and more into Openbook from existing major social networks!\nMoving away to another social network has never been easier.\nFull disclosure: There's a lot of room to improve on how existing social networks do data portability.\n\ud83d\udd12 Secure by design\nFrom day one, we will take malicious practices for granted and take care to minimise or eliminate their impact.\nDue to the open-source (see Honest point) nature of our code, we will also do our best to encourage info-sec professionals/enthusiasts to hunt for vulnerabilities. \nWhile initially we won't be able to afford fancy rewards or large bounties, if we succeed, we won't be shy about them. \n\nWe acknowledge the worth of finding a security vulnerability goes beyond a free t-shirt.\n\ud83d\udc77 A diverse & experienced team\nOur team consists of globally recognised information-security experts, talented software engineers, hackers, seasoned designers, human rights advocates & award winning privacy activists.\nWe recognise the challenges of building Openbook but most importantly, we are ready to take on them.\n\ud83d\udc83 Fun & social!\nBuilding a secure version of an existing social network will never be enough to compete with existing social networks. If we want to succeed we must build something unique, something better.\nAnd for this we're looking into build a social network that is actually fun to use and most importantly... wait for it... social *ba dum tss* \ud83e\udd41.\nWe have a lot of ideas. For example, a fun and secure way to chat with anyone around the world using animated avatars, new types of content and... oh wait, right, we're not supposed to share these kind of ideas just yet. \n\nYou get the idea, we want to dare to innovate, to break the status quo social networks have been in for the past years.\nEven better? We're open for all ideas! We'll create a place where you will be able to submit your idea, vote on other people's ideas and ultimately see it become a reality!\nTalk about doing things together.\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8 Customisable!\nSocial networks are all about who we are. Our friends, our family, our memories, our conversations. Nowadays we're all confined to the same silly template and colours of the corporation hosting us. \nWe want to change this. We want to make Openbook personal, for it to feel like home, like an extension of yourself.\nThat's why we'll be making every single piece of Openbook customisable.\n\nP.S. Yes, even our logo.\n\ud83c\udf0e And last but most importantly, a project for good.\nTech companies have a huge potential for doing good outside the digital realm.\nWe want Openbook to be beneficial for everyone, not just to the country that hosts us. That's why, if we succeed, we'll be putting 30% of our profits straight into making the world a better place for everyone, forever.\n\nWe're doing this in partnership with FoundersPledge, a non-profit that makes sure every single cent given makes a factual difference.\n\nEducation, cash transfers to those in most need, sanitisation, nutrition and disease prevention to name a few of the causes we will be supporting.\n\ud83c\udfc1 The Kickstarter goal \ud83c\udfc1\nFull-disclosure: This campaign is a re-launch. In our previous campaign we set our goal for 100k and made it to 45k. We reduced our minimum viable product, pitched in some of our personal savings and decided to direct every single cent towards getting us through 6 months of full-time software development. No extra-hands, no dedicated team workspace and definitely not enough servers to handle any significant load, but\u2026 If we succeed at building a great first version, we go from there.\n\ud83d\udcf130,000\u20ac | Openbook mobile version!

We have \"flexible\" offices, also known as cafes and our own apartments.\nWhere are you based?\nWe are based in The Netherlands, Europe! \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\nWhats with the funny job titles?\nWell, if we put things like CEO, CISO, COO and else, people immediately assume we're a settled company that will be just fine without backing. \nWill it be decentralised?\nInitially it will be built on a centralised manner. This will allow us to focus in innovating in regards to the user experience and functionality product rather than coming up with a brand new behind the scenes technology.\nIn the future, we\u2019re looking into decentralisation from very specific angles and for different things. Application wise, resiliency and data ownership.\nA project we\u2019re keeping an eye on and that shares some of our vision on this is Tim Berners Lee\u2019s MIT Solid project. It\u2019s all about decoupling applications from the data they use.\nIf the digital currency is such an important part of Openbook, why are you not offering it as a reward?\nOffering any kind of money equivalent goes against Kickstarters rewards rules.\nDid you re-launch your campaign?\nYes we did. You can read more about this here.\nThe open-book.org domain is annoying! Remove the dash NOW!\nThis annoys us too. Sadly, we don't have enough funds to purchase the openbook.com domain. If we get funded, this will be something will be doing and all of the annoyances will be gone! So please, help us get a proper domain!\nIf I donate and you don't meet your goal, do I get my money back?\nYep! And In fact, the money only leaves your account AFTER the kickstarter campaign ends.\nMeaning no goal reached = no money charged.\nCyber-cyber?\nCyber cyber cyber.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 Openbook Founder Starter Pack!", "descp": "Get early-access to the network, claim your Openbook @username, show off a Founder Badge in your profile and earn a spot in the Openbook's Founder Book! \ud83d\udd7a\nAll of this for 5\u20ac!\nINCLUDES:\nClaim your username\nExclusive Founder Badge in profile\nYour name in the Openbook's Founder Book\nEarly-access", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["934 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac14 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 + \ud83d\udcbb Exclusive Laptop Stickers!", "descp": "The Founder Starter Pack plus 2 exclusive and highest quality laptop stickers! \ud83d\udc4c\nINCLUDES:\nClaim your username\nEarly-access\nExclusive Founder Badge in profile\nYour name in the Openbook's Founder Book\nExclusive Openbook Black Sticker\nExclusive Openbook White Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["281 backers", "Limited (118 left of 399)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac39 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 + \ud83d\udcbb+ \ud83d\udca7 Sustainable Water Bottle", "descp": "We want to do good for the world.

Engineered to be a 4K media center and desktop replacement in one, Panther Alpha is powered by the latest Panther OS (based on Linux) and Android Marshmallow, bringing you endless of possibilities in an affordable, easy to use, tiny package!\nEquipped with a 2GHz Quad Core Cortex A53 and 2GB of DDR3 Memory, the Panther Alpha outperforms popular developments boards such as the Raspberry Pi 3 and aims to be not only the most polished ARM powered Linux desktop experience yet but also the most complete Linux experience by tying hardware and software together.\nPanther OS is a Linux based operating system designed for Panther Alpha, to help you accomplish more on your computer with less. With Panther OS, you get a familiar, reliable desktop experience that gives you access to your cloud-apps through Google Chromium and thousands of desktops apps such as Libre Office or Gimp (a popular Photoshop alternative) through our application\u2019s store.\nFreedom - Our library of thousands of open source applications are completely FREE. You can download and install them easily and they\u2019re yours to keep forever. No registration. No licensing - for home, business, school.\nSecurity - Backdoor viruses, malware, and other exploits are no match for Panther. A 2014 ESET report indicated there to be as many as 400 times the reported threats on Windows as there are on Linux, making the latter the more secure by quite some distance.\nCompatibility - Panther OS seamlessly integrates the apps you know and expect from Mac and Microsoft alike. Things like Office compatibility, Exchange support and Google Apps are no afterthought. They\u2019re built-in, along with all your other favourite programs.\nCustomization - No two Panthers are the same, and your machine is defined by you, just as it should be. You can easily change backgrounds, colors and fonts - even the entire desktop. The way your Alpha looks is entirely up to you. Whether it\u2019s a Windows-inspired taskbar, or a familiar Mac layout, the Linux Desktop is extremely customizable right out of the gate, so you can make it your own from day one. \nEfficiency - Panther OS uses up to 80% less memory than the average desktop computer. What usually takes around 1,000MB RAM after startup, Panther OS does with just 200MB. Even under full load, Panther rocks 17 times less energy compared to the Mac Mini.\nWe\u2019ve designed Panther Alpha to be a reliable companion, wherever you go. With no moving parts, no fans, all-flash storage, a strong aluminum casing and a power consumption of only 2W to 4W, make the Panther Alpha the most efficient, all-in-one (Linux) desktop computer in the world. All that in a package not much bigger than your wallet.\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective: The average desktop uses between 80-260W and runs Windows and other licensed software from at least Microsoft (Office, Antivirus, Photoshop, ..), costing you hundreds, if not thousands in licensing fees and renewal. Panther Alpha on the other hand uses 2W-4W and runs Panther OS, giving you easy access to thousands of free open source applications that rival paid applications such as Microsoft Office and Photoshop, both in quality and usability.\nPanther Alpha is a trusty companion for everyone, with at least two major Panther OS releases planned for our very first device and security fixes for up to 4 \u00bd years after each Panther OS release. Assuming you\u2019re using the device for 5 years, that\u2019s $17.8 per year or around $1.50 per month - less than a coffee.\nWe\u2019ve taken a look at what our users truly need to stay connected and while Apple has since reduced their latest Macbook Pro to Thunderbolt 3 ports only, with adapters costing up to $40, Panther Alpha still features the real \u2018thing\u2019: Gigabit ethernet, HDMI 2.0, 2 x USB, microSD card reader, S/PDIF and the good, old 3.5mm headphone jack. If you\u2019re going wireless, you can rely on 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and even IR, for presentations or to control navigate your media from the couch.\nHook-up your Panther Alpha with a gorgeous TV, modern display or beamer and output up to 4K. Your eyes, friends and family will be breathless. Even if you\u2019re laboured with a two-ton 1990s display unit, an $8 HDMI to VGA adapter from any back alley hardware store will turn it into the perfect output for your Panther Alpha.\nAnd if the 32GB on-board flash storage isn\u2019t doing it for you, you can easily expand via microSD, USB hard disk or NAS (Network Attached Storage), even shared from another Panther Alpha, for even more space to store your favourite music, photos, and videos.\nPanther Alpha might not look like what you\u2019d expect of a desktop computer, but looks can be deceiving. Beneath the gorgeous aluminium casing lies a powerful 2GHz quad-core 64 bit ARM Cortex-A53.\nPanther Alpha packs a serious punch. Compared to the much-revered Raspberry Pi 3, it boasts twice the memory and runs around 48% faster. Not to mention that it\u2019s designed with end users in mind. It\u2019s the complete package.\nThe Alpha also enjoys far more connectivity options than the Intel Compute Stick, including GB LAN and 4K video, giving you considerably more bang for your buck.\nIn addition, we strive to make Panther Alpha the perfect piece of equipment, whatever your needs. Whether you plan to develop with, on or for the system, use another OS (Linux, Android, Unix) or turn your Alpha in a server, head over to our community and share your ideas.  \n If you\u2019re still looking for stocking fillers, the Panther Alpha makes the perfect Christmas gift for that special someone. All our Kickstarter backers are eligible to receive their very own free digital gift certificate to give away when the big day arrives. At the end of the current campaign, you\u2019ll be able to let us know which model you\u2019d prefer to receive, and whether you\u2019d like us to send out a Christmas gift certificate.\n$200,000: If we can hit this goal together, we\u2019ll be able to offer an exclusive aluminium black version of the Panther Alpha. You can select your color preference at the end of this campaign.\nIn June 2016, we had the idea to turn the Raspberry Pi 3 into a stable computer platform. Our chief goals were to: \nMake Linux more accessible to the novice user \nEducate people on the benefits of open source, especially in regards to security \nProvide a complete, affordable platform \nMeet the needs of the everyday majority and allow them to take back control \nThe results were a resounding success, and we began handing out units to friends, family, and business associates to take for a test drive. The Raspberry Pi 3 gave us a good idea of what the platform is capable of, but we needed more power and more memory. We were looking to build a device not only for developers, but also the end-users, and now it was much clearer how to achieve that. \nWe continued working on the Pi 3 but maintained the ambition to take it further. We began reaching out to investors and distributors, and soon raised the $12,000 we needed to get started on a platform of our own, and found a manufacturer that could meet the specs we desired. With a few high-quality samples in hand, we hired Aaron Sowry; an Embedded Software Developer with vast ARM and Linux experience. With his help, we were able to initiate the device and begin work on what later became known as \u2018Panther OS\u2019.\nWith your backing, we can continue working on the computing platform of the future and you will get one of the first - your very own, Panther Alpha - in fact, one of the first in history!\nThe initial release of Panther OS will bring a stable platform to first backers, but allows future updates to be dictated by your feedback. We strive to ensure the continued development of Panther OS, with more meaningful updates designed to enhance your experience.\nOur backers will receive a developer kit along with their hardware. With the Panther OS SDK, you\u2019ll get access to the kernel, most of the framework and more to give you the ability to develop, customize and built the future of Linux with us. For example, you can modify the kernel to support your favorite hardware peripherals, and the framework to customize certain features and look and feel of Panther OS.\nWe have pledges designed to specifically support work on the Amlogic S905: \nWayland Support \nMainline Linux Kernel Support \n\u201cEarly Access to Panther OS\u201d backers get access to Panther OS beta builds, driver packages, and build script. They can use our work on drivers related to the S905 on their own devices with this chipset or to port other Linux OS distributions to Panther Alpha - you have completely control.\nWe\u2019re a diverse group of designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have spent the last year honing the Panther Alpha into what we believe to be a revolution not only for Linux computing, but the rights of every user in the world today. Here\u2019s the team behind this ambitious plan:\nPanther OS, paired with Panther Alpha is our answer to what\u2019s going on in the world: We're giving the power back to the user, with access to thousands of tested, completely free open source applications that don\u2019t compromise on usability but save you real bucks. Powerful tools such as TOR and a built-in VPN client help protect your privacy online and the sensible, pre-configured Firewall and non-logging DNS shield you from hacking and hijacking. The portable design allows you take Panther Alpha everywhere, to use as your desktop, as a server or hooked-up to the TV, to serve your media.\nWe\u2019ve taken away the headaches Linux can cause by providing a unified platform of hardware and software with integrated updates. Panther OS gives the power to choose what you share back to you: no mandatory sign-ups, secure software, and built-in tools to protect your privacy that are often left inaccessible to novices. We make computing much more efficient, with a highly-optimized OS that serves the majority of users. Your PC simply doesn\u2019t need to be any bigger, nor does it need to be more expensive. The complete Panther platform will set you back no more than $100 with zero ongoing costs and even significant reductions to your energy bills.\nThe future looks bright. Following the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign, we plan to launch Panther Alpha on Amazon and make it readily available to distributors worldwide. We\u2019ll continue to perfect Panther OS with new point releases annually and full releases every two years. To subsidize new Panther OS point releases, we\u2019ll manufacture more powerful ARM-based hardware, always with three key points in mind: lower energy use, affordability, and stability.\nOur ultimate goal is to make Panther Alpha the recognized computing platform to meet the needs of the everyday user, and increase our reach which will result in further developer support and community benefits. Your support is not only a vote to make open source software more secure, more private, and more efficient, but also for your own freedom to use your computer however you please.\nLet\u2019s get the message out there! We want to put the Panther Alpha into the hands of ordinary computer users that stand to benefit from increased privacy, smarter energy consumption, and reduced operating costs. Share our campaign on Facebook and help us make Panther the go-to desktop PC for everyday use.

Such beautiful pens out of sight or under piles of papers was certainly not the answer.\nThe Pen Rest brings that order. It takes up no room, really... it stacks vertically.\nI looked high and low for the perfect, most beautiful totem, desk art for pens I could find... there was just nothing out there! I had created the Worlds FIRST vertical stackable modular Pen Rest.\nPens are precision instruments with billions in use worldwide. Most are kept in a drawer, a mug, or under a pile of paper.\nI love pens of quality, Mont Blanc, Cross, Shaeffer and others to name but a few. To many people they are very desirable, as they offer confidence to the user, portray their image, personality, and have a character all of their own.\nThere are certainly pen holders available and even desk accessories, but none that I ever found could do justice by showing off high quality, often high priced fountain pens, roller ball and mechanical pencils that are so carefully made, detailed often with unique features and designs.\nPerhaps I'm a perfectionist!\nThe Pen Rest had to have the following features for me...\nIt must be a solid object with weight that stopped it sliding about It needed a delicate shelf to place my pen horizontal on it. Visually appealing I wanted to be able to admire my pens A Modular Stackable design I have no idea how many pens I might have now or in the future so I wanted to be able to build on my Pen Rest and keep its aesthetic appeal.\nA brief Background to my design idea..\nI believe a writing instrument should be seen ... clearly and not hidden away.\nI wanted a modular stand too ... one that you could add to as and when you felt like it.\nThe design had to be practical and yet smooth, with rounded edges.\nI was particularly keen that the block should give the appearance of floating and so the chamfered edges give that illusion.\nMaking the block vertical meant little footprint was being taken up. The actual area taken up on a desk is just 60mm x 45mm and yet you can stack as many pens as you like.\nA critical part of the design was to create a centre of gravity that did not change even if you stacked a load of pens.\nThis is because, the weight of each block is 227g, plus the weight of the top of 31g creates a paper weight effect ... a dead weight. As the pens added weigh less than the block... and the centre of gravity is about 20mm from the back of the block, the Pen Rest does not find itself tipping over.\nOnce the CAD drawings were completed I set about getting the right manufacturer and creating prototypes.\nHonestly when I tell you they are old school ... think back old films 1920's! But their workshops are so high tech that they receive work from highly sensitive customers.\nThese guys will be machining the Pen Rest to the absolute finest degree and tolerance that I have ever seen. They manufacture parts for atomic plants and the aircraft industry.\nYou'll be so impressed when you get your Pen Rest.\nOnce the parts are made they go through a variety of processes polishing, sand blasting and anodising before they are complete.\nThis is a very time consuming process that cannot be cut short. To get the highest quality finish every time each Pen Rest is individually cut.\nStackable, Modular and Practical - \"The Pen Rest\"\nThe Pen Rest stacked using three blocks and one top (also a great place to display your ink). The Pen Rest is beautifully shaped to reflect the curves of nature and lovingly display your pens.\nThe silver anodised colour matches Apple Macs very well.\nQuotes from a few people that have seen a sneak preview\n\"as a Mechanical Engineer I was thrilled with what you have done. The design and finishing of the pen rest looks fantastic.\" Thomas Tan www.onfountainpens.com\n\"The Pen Rest is a great idea as too many deserving pens end up being tucked away without being appreciated the way they should. I hope David will reach the 'soft cover' stretch goal.\" - Matthias Meckel Bleistift.memm.de\n\"I like it. I think its a neat idea and design\" Coy - Root Designs R&D\n\"The rest itself is certainly quite aesthetically pleasing, and the anodized aluminum would make it quite enticing as desk top art. Stackability is a big plus - after all, who has only one pen inked at a time? :-)\u201d Ken Cavers kcavers.blogspot.ca\n\u201cI love the design and concept. Very minimalistic and creative\u201d Mark Anthony - Creator of the LYPEN\nI can manufacture the blocks in Gold, Silver or any other anodised colour. If there is interest in other colours during the campaign I will add other colour options.\nThe Pen Rest is unique because it is stackable.\nEach Pen Rest has a 45mm sill that gently balances your pen in the middle so that it is easily accessible but most importantly can be seen in all its glory.\nThe unique sill on which the pen rests on is recessed slightly to allow for the various diameters often attributable to different designs.\nThe gap between each pen is sufficient to pick up a pen without knocking off the others from the Pen Rest.\nEach Pen Rest is manufactured from the high grade materials available. Our first run will be in aluminium using the latest milling and CNC machining techniques. However, stretch goals include the Pen Rest in Stainless Steel, Copper, and 24K Gold Plate.\nBecause of the weight of each Pen Rest, it can be used as a paper weight, but unusually can be stacked as high as you like.\nEach block contains a unique tongue and groove allowing the interlocking of the blocks, so that the lines flow smoothly together.\n3D print shows interlocking and feasibility 3D print shows interlocking and feasibility The chamfers on its edges give a floating appearance at the bottom and a gentle smoothness to edges removing any risk of scratches to your precious pens.\nI believe that your favourite pens should not end up in a mug, or just tossed to one side on the desk. They deserve better than this.\nThey need a home, naturally accessible and solid enough to not move.\nEvery order will receive a free pen. It has the weight and feel of a quality pen and stylish looks.\nI have been looking at protecting the shelf as some feedback from Pen Bloggers have suggested that some additional protection may be required to prevent any chance of marks to pens.... even though the surface is exceptional smooth and the pen only rests on the outer edges.\nSo every order will receive a soft felt cover for the sill with every block sold \nTimeline\nKickstarter ends In November 2016.\nOrders will be dispatched by 12th December 2016 latest in time for Christmas.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Pen Rest One Plus - Early Bird", "descp": "Early Bird - Get a Single Pen Rest in Midnight Blue or Silver block and receive one top of your choice from Silver, Gold, Midnight Blue or Oxford Blue, you'll receive felt to add that quality finish too... but that's not all !

We are confident that we can bring the Memory pen to market with your support! We love our supporters and value your feedback. You will be helping us to define the end product appearances and its features.  \nWe will be MFi approved with the memory Pen\n  Simply plug in the Memory Pen and start downloading your images and videos.\nRunning out of Memory, don't you hate that? You have an event to go to and want to shoot some memorable images and your device is full of images so you no longer have room. Wouldn't you like a low cost secure portable device that fits in a pocket, backpack and purse to download these images and clear space? We did too, so we created the memory pen in 64 and 128Gb versions for IOS and micro USB devices.\nSee what others are saying! \n\"It's something that business managers and entrepreneurs are going to want immediately\"\n    Journalists, medical record keepers, and especially creative types like writers and photographers, are going to love this new wrinkle in mobile device technology.\u201d\n      John Nadeau interviews Andreas Haase\n  Packaging sample with IOS and micro USB versions\nRaptor Creative has created the Human Technology Products brand name to bring you cool CE products. We value Kickstarter and the feedback it supplies us. We will be using the funds to move the Memory Pen into production for Holiday delivery. We know that your support is important to us and we are ready to deliver. \nIn iOS & micro USB versions\nMemory Pen was designed to give you the customer the ability to down load your image and video files securely and quickly. This results in freed up space on your iOS or Micro USB device.  Our application software is still undergoing some final tweaks so that your files will be secure on the Memory Pen. the Memory pen is a 3 in one device so you don't need to carry too many things. First you have 64 to 128Gb of space to fill, then there is the stylus for using your tablets and touch screen devices and if you ever need to use a ball pen for writing down messages, you have that too!\nMemory Pen with Micro USB for Android Devices.\nWe will be offering the Memory Pen in 4 color selections and 2 connector types. Once in production we will offer more choices going forward.\nRight now you need your support to get this product to market. The tooling is completed and the boards are created. A couple tweaks to the software and we are ready to ship in 60 days.  \nPocket clip with Human Technology Logo\n  Plastic molded parts sample\n  Preparing the tooling for the plastic parts\nOur team is comprised of seasoned award winning industrial designers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, sourcing experts and marketing sales.

Yet one key aspect has been generally ignored: the art of introducing the new data science paradigm to legacy enterprises. This is something that requires far more than just a shift in technology. It also requires a shift in corporate culture, sensibilities, and priorities.\nWritten by leading industry consultant Lars Nielsen, Change Management for Data Science provides proven tools for successfully transforming legacy enterprises into true data-driven environments, and gives managers the vital information they need to avoid common pitfalls in this transition. The book is in the last stages of development under the editorial supervision of Edward Renehan, Managing Director of New Street Communications and longtime Director of Computer Publishing Programs for Macmillan.\nThe book's INTRODUCTION:\nTeamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. - Andrew Carnegie\nIt's not so much that we're afraid of change or so in love with the old ways, but it's that place in between that we fear. \u2026 It's like being between trapezes. It's Linus when his blanket is in the dryer. There's nothing to hold on to. - Marilyn Ferguson, Futurist\nChange is scary. Change is threatening. Change is annoying. Change is work. But change is also exciting, invigorating, renewing, and refreshing. Change is the evolution, growth, and expansion of horizons. Change is the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d of what has gone before to make way for better, smarter techniques, tools, and technologies. New thinking.\nWhat's the biological alternative to evolution? You guessed it. Extinction. Organizational survival means organizational change. And there's no more important business skill than knowing how to innovate and manage this change.\nI've written Change Management for Data Science with the single intention of arming you with the knowledge and tools necessary to introduce the most draconian changes to hit many a workplace in decades: the parallel revolutions of Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics.\nIn an age when information is everything, or very nearly everything, the flood of the constantly-flowing tsunami of of Big Data has drastically redefined the terrain of countless long-accepted business models and organizational practices.\nIt isn't pretty out there. Anciently established roles are being thrown into states of flux, and traditional chains of authority disrupted. Power is changing hands. Veterans feel demeaned, and some become disgruntled. Experience \u2013 once respected \u2013 has become a suspect thing: an artifact from a prior, antique time; a propeller in the era of the jet engine.\nThe literati among us might be reminded of a line from W.B. Yeats: \u201cThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed ...\u201d\nBut the \u201ccentre\u201d can and must hold. Anarchy is not an option.\nIt is key for us to make sure that uncertainty among veterans is minimized, disorder avoided, and the threat of chaos stopped in its tracks. It is essential for us to make sure that new shoes do not unduly step on old toes. And it is vital for us to take a situation ripe with potential for rivalries and transform it into an opportunity for building a more sustainable, effective, and profitable team.\nWe must enable all players to understand and buy into the vision of a data-driven workplace: a workplace where professionals acquire, interpret, and leverage data in order to maximize efficiencies, iterate and create new products and services, and otherwise successfully navigate the emerging and constantly changing competitive landscape.\nIn this effort, we must come to understand the importance of the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of data. Granular and key metrics data, once defined, should be shared by all decision makers in the organization, not just amongst the data science team. The data science team should artfully propose conclusions, but not impose them. Conclusions should be jointly arrived at, and should be the result of merging data science results with the experiential knowledge of line-managers and other key professionals.\nAs well, all appropriate professionals \u2013 not just data scientists \u2013 should be armed with the tools, training, and permissions to make their own queries into the firm's data store, whether this be Hadoop-based or otherwise configured.\nAs you'll see in the following chapters, the importance of cooperation and coordination between traditional and non-traditional players cannot be overemphasized. The most important task we face is to marshal and orchestrate this cooperation and coordination, and make it blossom into productive results for the entire enterprise.\nVince Lombardi once commented: Individual commitment to a group effort \u2013 that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\nThe \u201cQuants\u201d with all their metrics will hold a key position on your new team, but not the only position. It is important that the players in the field respect the work of the pitcher, but equally important that they know the pitcher respects them and understands their role as being vital - especially since several of the outfielders were once pitchers.\nWith that in mind, let us proceed ...\nAbout the Author\nBased in Amsterdam, Lars Nielsen has more than three decades of experience consulting for such firms as IBM, CBS, Amgen, Intel, and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His books include the bestsellers A Simple Introduction to Data Science, What Every Manager Should Know About Data Science, and Computing: A Business History, of which none other than the late Andy Grove (co-founder and longtime Chairman of Intel) said: \"Nielsen provides a most excellent and understandable narrative of a complex history.

This is the YouTube generation, and it's important that communication be clear, concise, and generate a real connection with the viewer. So many blogs are shot and loosely edited together, and they don't have to be. With a prompter that is voice activated (for iOS), or speed controlled (android), video creators can now create more dynamic video with a true eye-to-eye experience.\nAlso, actors often have to do commercial shoots involving a prompter script, as do politicians, priests, and political pundits. It's important to have a device that can record the speaker, while also allowing for prompting. Plus, by sliding the prompter off-center, actors can read left or right of cam, doing video based auditions of lengthy roles.\nWhat if there was a soldier, Sgt. GoodDad, and he wanted to read bedtime stories for his/her child without having the books to carry? He could get the script emailed, and RECORD bedtime stores for his child to watch on Youtube privately. And make that eye-to-eye connection with the camera, when he can't be face to face.\nAn interrotron is a device where two people have a discussion and it is recorded for emotional and psychiatric discussion. Here, you can do a 'facetime' between two mobile devices, while recording the emotional expressions on the laptop. \nShare now please!\n Benefits & Features:\n\u2022 Optical teleprompter glass ensures clarity for the best video quality\n\u2022 Heavy duty weatherproof case protects your Micro 750 during transport\n\u2022 Lighting can be rotated in/out for a dimming effect\n\u2022 Modification ability allows for shooting with DSLR's\n\u2022 Actors can open the rear panel, slide off-center, and shoot web based auditoins.\n\u2022 YouTuber's can create better videos with the same tech from expensive broadcast prompters.\n\u2022 Ports for chargers and/or microphones\n\u2022 Compact size\n\u2022 Works best with iPhone\u00ae/iPad\u00ae but also works with android software.\nWho this is for:\nIf you EVER are going to create an online video, you should back this project. According to YouTube, 1 out of 3 people connected to the internet have uploaded a video to YouTube. Not to mention all the CEO Messages, HR Videos, Acoustic Jams, Priest Sermons, College Entrance Videos, Video Game Blogs, and even Political Candidates.\nFor the Troops:\nWe were hoping that soldiers overseas would read bedtime stories right into the camera, and upload those videos to YouTube so their children back home can have video bedtime stories with eye-to-eye contact. Just drop the story onto a Google Drive, or DropBox, and the script uploads with ease to most mobile prompting software. (Featured here is PromptSmart for iPhone)\nStretch Goal:\nIf we break $60,000 we will include a lens cleaning cloth for the glass. We will also include an additional laser cut 16:9 rear matte-board that can be swapped out for DSLR's. This way you won't have to cover the rear with a black cloth on the DSLR modification, you can just slide the camera up against the cut matte-board in the down position. We will also put some Tompter stickers in the package too, because everyone loves stickers.\nAbout the lighting:\nWe have included two USB 2.0 light sticks that are hooked to a 'Y' cable so you can plug them into most laptops. Some laptops don't have a USB, but that's ok, there is those USB wall plugs, and USB batteries that can power the lights. They are for you to experiment. One idea is to rotate the light inward, effectively blocking some of it (dimming on the fly). So, we encourage you to make your own videos, and share them with Tompter. we would love to see what you created with the Tompter Micro 750! Show us your videos, auditions and more!\nNon-US shipping:\nNon-US shipping is about $90. I wish I could get it lower because I know so many of my fans of my other custom teleprompter products reside in other countries. If I get emails here for a particular country, I don't mind opening it up here for you to back this project! Just understand it's about $90 to ship it. I get a break on two. If I ship two, it's $115... so it's much better to back in pairs.\nNew side design with charging hole:\nNew charging/mic cable hole added to the design!\n  Here is a sample of laser engraving for large orders!\n  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nDisclaimer:\nHardware only.

The only problem is that no-one wants do that.\nThere\u2019s too much money in consulting and selling books about the veneer without ever giving up the actual secret sauce.\n\u201cThis book and video course won\u2019t be like that. In fact, they\u2019ll be very different from that, and probably nothing like what you\u2019re used to. Here\u2019s why: Secret Sauce is not so much a book as it is a tutorial.\nSecret Sauce is a step-by-step, systematic dismantling and dissection of every channel and practice that actually works, laid out one after another. It\u2019s a guide that will handhold you all the way to getting traffic, users, and revenue.\nOur goal with this book and course is that someone who knows absolutely nothing about marketing could sit down, follow the instructions, and make what they\u2019re doing blow up. We\u2019ve done this before - a lot.\nOur combined efforts account for millions of monthly pageviews, millions of social followers, millions of emails, millions of dollars in revenue -- no matter how you slice it, this stuff just works. We\u2019ve tried hundreds of growth hacks in order to give you only the methods we know will work.\nMost everything you\u2019ll read is something anyone can do with a little bit of effort, and which requires very little (or zero) marketing budget.\nBy the time you finish this book, you will not only have a dozen ideas about different strategies that can help your idea succeed, but you\u2019ll know exactly what it takes to implement each one of them.\nAfter you read this book you will be able to sell units of and get users signed up for literally anything.\nWhat you\u2019ll find in the growth hacking playbook works.\nI was on welfare/benefits 3 years ago, and used growth hacking techniques to get millions of visitors to websites I created and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment, and got into the Techstars accelerator. I then launched a growth hacking agency and have used these techniques to move hundreds of thousands of people to websites, and acquire tonnes of users and followers for startups.\nSpeaking in London, England, Winter 2015\nA key change in my life happened a year ago. An accelerator had heard I was a \u201cgrowth hacker\u201d and asked me to give a talk to their current teams. I put together a slide deck of what I considered the basics, and gave a presentation. Halfway through my talk I realised half of the room was taking pages of notes, while the others stared at me in disbelief. The minute my talk finished, founders ran up to me asking for my slides and if I did consulting. I was surprised- I hadn\u2019t seen many people in marketing give talks and presumed you were meant to give practical advice and show people how to do things, pieces of software you can use to automate things, etc. this was not the case. I gave more talks and it\u2019s an incredible feeling how much people find my talks useful. That\u2019s where the idea for this book came from. Give as many people practical, actionable advice and strategies as possible. My growth hacking talk was eventually voted best workshop of SXSW V2V 2015. Earlier this year I gave a 30-date speaking tour of America, and am so excited to get this knowledge out there in full for the first time.\nThis is the first time I\u2019m pulling back the curtain and unveiling my secrets, along with my co-author Austen Allred, who has moved millions of visitors and dollars through growth hacking across every channel from SEO to Pinterest and everything inbetween.\nWhat you\u2019ll discover in Secret Sauce can be used for good or evil. It is very powerful stuff. Right now, only a few people know how to do these things. We\u2019re blowing the whistle on the tactics other people are using, and handing you the tools to do them yourself, and find your secret sauce.\nAnd with that substantial word of warning, we launch our kickstarter. If this book gets funded, it will be available very soon after the Kickstarter ends (like, by the end of June or mid-July at the very latest). We\u2019re not sure what the blowback is going to be as no-one has done a book like this before. If you\u2019ve ever read a marketing book and found it didn\u2019t contain enough specific strategies to try, the growth hacking playbook is for you. If you work in marketing and want to use new techniques to boost your companies brand and get promoted, this book is for you. And if you run your own company, you are going to adore this book.\nSecret Sauce will give you the tools you need to execute growth hacking strategies in a wide range of environments\u2014but I have another goal in sharing it with you. \nAs many have pointed out to me, I could keep this information to myself and make more money from clients- but I truly believe we\u2019re all better off if we share the knowledge and grow our companies together. As such, everyone who donates anything will be invited into a private growth hacking group on Facebook, where we\u2019ll create an ongoing community to help each other with our digital marketing and startup growth problems. I wish there had been a group like this when I was on welfare and starting out on my company three years ago, rather than having to learn it all by trial and error. There\u2019ll be no links or spam in the group, just questions, answers, and discussions from and to the community around this area which has so little useful information. This will make sure that the learning will continue after the campaign ends.\nThose of you who have followed me for a while know that when give a talk, I love to go big\u2014ridiculously big\u2014in offering as much value as possible.\nWe\u2019ve created several different backer reward levels with lots of rewards for each bracket.\nTier 1 \u201cGROWTH HACKER\u201d will receive:\nA digital copy of the seven-part growth hacking book.\n- Entrance to the secret growth hackers\u2019 club on Facebook\n- Thank you page in the book.

The slim, padded carry case makes transporting Pillarhub easy and safe while the simple, sleek design means you can use it with any style of computer and it can fit right alongside your laptop in your carry bag.\nIntroducing Pillarhub\nPillarhub comes with USB 3 and USB C compatibility\nOur Story\nThe Pillarhub team got together over the common frustration of find a truly portable monitor that was slim enough to not add too much extra bulk over the laptop. We were all fed up with fiddling with software or working with half hearted solutions. There was no one product or solution that we could take with us while traveling. After the frustrations cleared, we got our heads together and came up with the following checklist that would make the perfect solution for us:\nIt needs to be light and portable\nIt needed a good screen\nIt needed to run with no power cables (or ability to charge)\nIt needed to fit into my laptop bag\nWith that in mind we got to work and went through a few iterations before settling on a 2 screen system. There was always a fear that the second screen would add too much bulk and would make the product non-viable. We worked with our manufactures to chip away at the weight and slim down the panel until we are now confident that the added bulk is no longer a compromise.\nWe\u2019ve since worked with a dozen manufactures to ensure the high quality of our panels and spend countless hours on the 3D printer prototyping parts to finalize Pillarhub. We believe that the powerless setup was a big leap and we are proud to share the Pillarhub product with the world. Help us spread the word so we can showcase our product to the world.

For those of you who are familiar with large-scale electronic manufacturing(molds, wiring, inputs, etc); there are often overlaps from facilities which produce for multiple brands (e.g. Ho Hai Precision industry (trading as FoxConn) manufacturing for Apple at facilities that are not wholly owned by Apple; thus Ho Hai makes devices for multiple Chinese brands beyond Apple and often phones are using similar if not identical technologies.) This is similar to our case, as we do not have the resources to setup a screen manufacturing facility in China, so contacted many facilities in an effort to find a solution that met our needs; often which have overlap such as using similar tapered design, brightness controls, etc. that will work with our custom 3D stands.)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Product Sketches & Images", "update_content": "WOW!!!

It records their tremors and provides detailed insights about how their activities and diet affect their tremors. \nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram | Website | Press Kit | support@trequant.com\nShare us on Facebook & Twitter\nTrequant helps you to be more confident and aware of your situation, by letting you know how your tremors work. \n Tremors are completely unpredictable, even the slightest change in your mood can cause huge changes in your tremor intensities and you have no control over it. With Trequant you can observe and identify what activities affect your tremors positively or the diet that helps you to reduce your tremors. You can also connect with a community of tremor patients and share your problems, or solutions with the community. You are able to share your tremor intensities and collaborate in friendly challenges that motivate you to perform daily exercises that are beneficial to you as a tremor patient.\nThe graphs visualize how with changed activity i.e increased morning walk and a nap during the work stress John was able to reduce the intensity of his tremors. He has a better understanding of how his activities affect his tremors, now he can choose what helps him. This will help him control his tremors better and be more confident.\n Trequant is collaborating with thehopenet.org to get the donations into the hands of rightful patients so they can benefit from it the most and help align their activities to handle their tremors better.\nTremors are unintentional shaking or trembling of muscles. It is the most common neurological movement disorder and hands are the most commonly affected parts. Other parts of the body include head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. It isn't a life threatening disease but makes life difficult, even the simplest daily tasks become really hard\n Its as simple as it gets, once the watch is paired with the companion application, you're a tap away from recording your tremors.\nTrequant allows tremor patients to easily record the values of their tremor intensities accurately without even thinking about it. It allows you to go about your daily routine doing the tasks you do and records your tremors silently. All you have to do is wear it on your wrist and start recording, and it gathers your tremor intensity based on kinetic vibrations of your tremors. It uses 6 sensors to monitor the movement of your arm. Our proprietary algorithm records the accurate value of the tremor intensity by filtering out normal hand movements. Not just that, the device comes equipped with vibration motor to remind you of your medications.\nTrequant companion application (which can be used both on a mobile or a computer) is an extension of the wearable. The application allows you to record your tremors, or set up medication reminders, and the type of recording you want to do. The application creates detailed insights of your tremors and lets you see for yourself what activities or diets affect your tremors positively. It can let you know if your tremors have been intense throughout the day or not.\nThe design of the wearable has been carefully chosen after numerous iterations along with your feedback. Minimal and strong to make you feel in control, and it saves you from all the weird looks.   \n The mobile application is built keeping you in mind, simple, extremely easy to navigate and great readable design for non-technical people. The application is completely self explanatory, and completely friendly.\nTrequant houses 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscopes, which allows the wearable to accurately determine the vibrations in the body caused by tremors. Isolating the tremor vibration, Trequant determines the detailed amplitude and frequency values which helps define the tremor in numbers to be understood in a more rational way. \nTrequant has been in the works for 2 years now. Let us give you an insight into the different stages:\n We have been working for two years, and in two years we have developed 4 different prototypes of our product. We now have our final prototype and all we need is your support to finish this product and get this into the hands of people.\nTrequant watch was designed to keep it classic so people feel comfortable wearing it in public. Reaching to the final stage required a lot of changes and feedback from product design & manufacturing experts. These are the dimensions of the watch:\nThe watch is is just about the size of a normal watch with double the intelligence. It is suited for both the genders.\n Trequant makes use of the latest technologies available in the market, including:\n6-axis motion sensor to accurately record tremor movements\nVibration motor for medication reminders\nSwiss watch movement to show time\nUltra low power processor and bluetooth low energy for long battery life\nExtra memory to save data for a month \nLithium polymer battery to power for 7 days \nLeather straps for comfortable wear\nAfter discussing the manufacturing with various famous names in the manufacturing sector we have choses PanAsia Solutions http://panasia-inc.com as our partner. They have finalized the dates along with the feasibility reports that certify the manufacturing of Trequant in the given time frame and costs. \nPanAsia specializes in the manufacturing and distribution of the hardware products and the company is behind some of the biggest names in the industry. Panasia Solutions provides us on the ground presence in China. They have 15 years of experience in designing, refining, and producing branded consumer products for sale and distribution in markets throughout the United States, Canada, and the EU.\nAs we anticipated some patients who cant really make use of a watch requested for a bracelet/band that fulfilled the basic purpose. After numerous iterations we present the Trequant Band. We haven't built a prototype for the band yet but based on our previous designs and the technology equipped in the final prototype of the watch we are 110% confident that this would be the final shape, size, battery life and technology of the Band.\nThis band comes in multiple sizes and you'd be able to put it on different body parts, such as your head, thighs etc. We will be introducing multiple attachments for ease of use on any part of your body as a stretch goal. And if we are able to cross the stretch goal the attachments will be given to all the people who have pledged for the band.\nThe technology used in the band is same as the watch, but to avoid  any confusion here is the breakdown: \n-6-axis motion sensor to accurately record tremor movements.\n-Vibration motor for medication reminders.\n-Ultra low power processor and bluetooth low energy for long battery life.\n-Extra memory to save data for a month.\n-Lithium polymer battery to power for 7 days.\nTrequant companion application is a multiple platform application, which means it can be run on your mobile phone, or personal computer both.\nWe understand not everyone has a smartphone and or is able to use one, especially those who suffer from extreme tremors. Trequant can easily be connected with your computer using our usb. \n*Some Laptops come with built-in Bluetooth BLE. You might not need the USB at all, however we are sending out free USBs to everyone who pledges to buy our wearable.\nTrequant Circle, be a part of something bigger the best way to stay connected with the people you love.\nTrequant Circle is an exclusive idea being introduced by Trequant. The purpose of the Trequant circle is to link the people with tremors via a unique chain. Because we believe you are who know the best about you because we believe that in order to find a solution for this problem people need to be encouraged to talk to each other, indulge in collaborative discussions and find answers to their problems including tremor anomalies. With Trequant Circle, people can add their friends, share their tremor stories in complete confidence with each other for discussion or collaborative analysis and motivate with each other with the help of positive competition.\nWith detailed discussions and deals with the manufacturer we have been able to workout our goal and where it has to go.\nBy supporting this project, you are also contributing to the future of Trequant. These funds will help Trequant progress from prototype stage to a power system that is ready for the global market. Your sponsorship will help us to finalize the mechanical design, build the electrical content inside each module, get the requisite certifications to meet the international safety standards, and deliver you your own Trequant.\n                    DISCLAIMER\nwww.trequant.com is strictly for your own self-assessment.
