Animation is everywhere.\nAnd although most people who enjoy animated content can quickly list their favorite characters, movies, shows or video game, those very same people are unable to name a single individual who worked on or helped create the very thing they love to watch.\nOver the last two decades, animation has grown at an astounding rate, and is now inhabited by thousands of unique and bizarre characters.\nBut I\u2019m not talking about the unique and bizarre characters you see on the screen. I\u2019m talking about the wonderful, unique and bizarre characters behind the scenes, who have devoted their lives to follow a crazy dream, and enter the world of animation, with its infinite creative possibilities.\nUnfortunately, most of the time, the only proof that these people actually worked on a project is their name zipping by, way too fast, on the credit scroll at the end of a movie, show or game.\n\u201cAn Animated Conversation\u201d hopes to change that by introducing to the public some of the incredibly creative and talented people that have chosen animation as their profession, and have enriched the world because of it.\nThis show will give the public a glimpse into a world where the public knows more about the animated characters on screen then about the people who create them.\nEach episode will feature at least five talented and creative animation industry professionals. Some will be new to the industry and other will be seasoned-veterans. The one thing that they will all have in common is an original and personal opinion or point of view about animation and the animation industry.\nThe intimate setting of a round table will create a mood where all the guests can share personal thoughts, feelings and experiences both good and bad about the industry that they've chosen to be apart of. The audience will view the show through five cameras that will surround the guests and the table, giving the viewer a \u201cfly on the wall\u201d perspective of the conversation.\nThis show will give unprecedented insight into the animation industry through each guest stories and experiences.\nThe public has never had access or insight into the minds of these talented animation professionals.\nDuring each episode, the guests will be encouraged to share stories about their experiences at art school, their first jobs in animation, and obstacles that they've had to overcome during their climb to the top of this fields. This show will give these professionals an opportunity to share their stories and hopefully inspire the next generation of animators, creators, directors and designers. And the public will be introduced to the people behind some of the best known and most influential animated programs, movies and video games. For the most part the people that work in animation are only know by a fast moving name on an end credit scroll. This show will give a much deserved opportunity to put a face and voice to those names to the millions of animation fans.\nThe show will include Academy award winners, Emmy winners as well as Golden Globe, Annie, Peabody, BAFTA, People\u2019s Choice award winners, and more.\nEach guest will receive bios on the other guests that they\u2019ll by dinning with. This will provide some background on the guests to help provide a springboard for questions and conversations.\nA wide range of skills and positions will be represented, including but not limited to:\nShow creators\nDirectors\nShow runners\nAnimators\nAnimation Directors\nArt directors\nCharacter designers\nStory artists\nVoice actors\nCasting Directors\nProducers\nWriters\n\nTopics will include but are not limited to:\nWoman in the animation industry with an all female cast\nAll African American cast\n2D vs 3D\nThe future of VR and AR\nAll Latin cast\nAll Asian cast\nAn all Animation Legends Table\nThe power on India in animation\nTV vs Feature animation\nCrossing over from animation to live action\nAnime\nThe Internet and new media's effect on the animation industry\nThe good old days\nStarting out in the industry and how it's changed\nAnimation Enigmas \nThe future of animation\nPay, the dollars and cents of animation. (what people make & the cost of  TV shows & Movies)\nIs talent the most important thing?\nYouTubers\nNew York animation\nDealing with outside studios\nAnimation training and schools\nWriting for animation\nPrime Time Animation\nAnimation Studios\nAnimation in Video Games\nHow to get a job in animation\nPortfolios/Websites\nComic books to cartoons\nCartoons that we grew up watching\nArtists that run a studio\nOutrageous Animation\nArtists as Managers/Supervisors\nStop Motion\nThe four goals that I have for each episode:\nINTRODUCE\nEDUCATE\nINSPIRE\n ENTERTAIN\nIntroduce-The public to some of the amazing people that work behind the scenes in the animation industry.\nEducate-As many people as possible about what it really takes to make an animated Movie, TV show, or video game.\nInspire-Young, creative, talented people all around the world and show them that it\u2019s possible for them to have a carrier in animation. My hope is that viewers will hear stories that they can relate too and it will encourage them to consider a carrier in animation.\nEntertain-The bottom line is that I want every episode to be entertaining.\nWhy this show is needed:\nAs soon as most of us are able to turn on a TV, Computer, an iPad, or go to an animated movie, we find ourselves addicted to those brightly colored characters moving around on screen. And you never question weather or not those characters are real. But the truth is that those amazing, entertaining characters only seem that way because of the thousands of real people that write, draw, color, voice and edit those characters and the shows that they appear in.\nEach and every one of those people that work behind the scenes on an animated project have an amazing story of their own. This show will provide a platform for them to share their stories with the rest of the world.\nAnimation is a special and magical art form, that has the ability to connect, inspire, influence and effect people of all ages in a wondrous way.\nProducer/Director/Animator Randy Myers is an industry veteran with over 27 years experience in feature animation, television animation, commercials, and video game productions.\nRandy attended California Institute of the Arts (Cal Arts) in Valencia California. He started his animation career in the early 90\u2019s doing in-betweens and clean-up for Don Bluth Studios, where he worked on such films as \u201cA Troll In Central Park\u201d and \u201cThumbelina\u201d.\nRandy then jumped to Warner Bros Television Animation, where he worked on Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cTiny Toon Adventures\u201d.\nAfter leaving Cal Arts in 1992, he was accepted into an internship at the newly formed Turner Feature Animation. There he worked his way up from intern on \u201cThe Pagemaster\u201d to an animator on \u201cCat\u2019s Don\u2019t Dance\u201d.\nHe then transitioned to Warner Feature Animation, where he had the good fortune to work with Academy Award winning Director Brad Bird, on the critically acclaimed film \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d. In the late 90\u2019s Randy then went to work with a couple of his Cal Arts classmates, Craig McCracken and Genndy Tartakovsky at Cartoon Network. Randy stepped right in and started directing episodes of the trend-setting \u201cThe Powerpuff Girls\u201d, \u201cSamurai Jack\u201d, \u201cFosters Home For Imaginary Friends\u201d, \u201cDexter\u2019s Lab\u201d, \u201cCode Name Kids Next Door\u201d, \u201cMy Gym Partner\u2019s A Monkey\u201d just to name a few.\nIn his time at Cartoon Network Randy was nominated six times for an Emmy, and he won twice. He has also won an Annie award for his work on Cartoon Networks \u201cWe Bare Bears\u201d. During his time at Cartoon Network, Randy also found time to go back to Cal Arts and teach first year character animation. Several of his students have gone on to create and run their own shows, direct, and a few have even won Emmy\u2019s and Annie\u2019s.\nAfter being at Cartoon Network for nearly 10 years, he left to do story at Dreamworks, where he worked on \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d, \u201cMegamind\u201d and \u201cShrek Forever After\u201d. Then once again he moved back to TV, and became the Supervising Timing Director on Nickelodeons \u201cThe Mighty B\u201d.\nRandy left Nickelodeon after accepting a job offer from the newly formed Hasbro Studios to be the Supervising Director on their newest version of \u201cGI JOE\u201d, \u201cGI JOE-RENEGADES\u201d. The series was critically acclaimed and thrilled old and new fans that saw the show on The Hub.\nRandy then went on to be the Supervising Timing Director at Disney TV Animation season one of \u201cGravity Falls\u201d.\nRandy headed back to Nickelodeon where his friend and show creator Butch Hartman asked him to be a director on \u201cFairly Odd Parents\u201d season 9.\nRandy returned to Cartoon Network once again to be the Supervising Director on \u201cBen 10: Omnivers\u201d, and then the Supervising Producer on \u201cWe Bare Bears\u201d.\nCurrently Randy is working with Cartoon Networks, Talent Development Department in the role of Supervising Creative Producer, and is responsible for talent recruitment, talent training and talent relations.\nHe also consults with current productions on pipeline and process, to help them run more efficiently and to be more productive.\n In most cases, the company providing funding want a voice in how a show is made. We've decided seeking funding through Kickstarter will allow us to produce the show that we want to produce, with the guests that we think the public will enjoy hearing from, in a way that we think the public would like to see and preserve the creator's artistic vision. \nWe'll also be able to produce the shows faster and get them to the public sooner then going through the traditional funding streams. This is also am opportunity for everyone to be a part of this production.\nAn audience is the only group of people that truly decides if a project is a success or not. So I'm putting this project out there for the public to decide if this is something that they'd like to see.\nSo here we are.

Immediately, he knew that he wanted to make a documentary short about George, whose charisma, work and storytelling are all-enveloping.  Nathan began production on the project in 2017 with the working title \"Drawing Life\".\nGeorge Booth with drawings.\nMEET GEORGE BOOTH!\nAt 92 years old, George is among the oldest living New Yorker Cartoonists, and continues to publish regularly in the magazine. Born in Cainsville Missouri (population 200), George launched his cartooning career while serving in the US Marines during World War II, when he was recruited to draw for the Marines publication Leatherneck Magazine.  While George will gladly tell you of any number of humorous misadventures along the way (blowing up outhouses,  being screamed at by officer managers), he would ascend to become a celebrated artist in the golden era of magazines, influencing a younger generation of cartoonists with his wit and imagination. Today George is a proud Brooklynite, working out of  a studio in his daughter Sarah's apartment on a vibrant block in Crown Heights.\nGeorge at work.\n\nTHE ANIMATION\nOne of the elements of Drawing Life that we are very excited about is the use of animation in the project, which is being done working with the animation artist Emily Collins (Emily is also a Producer on the film).  Rather than solely animating George\u2019s existing work, the stop motion animations for the film will be done in collaboration with George, creating unique moments that highlight George's personality, humor and history.  \nGeorge and Emily\nPLAY\n\nTHE MONEY\nThe truth is that filmmaking is expensive work. We've been putting in countless unpaid hours of producing, shooting, editing and animating over the last year. However, in order to really finish Drawing Life the way the film deserves we need resources. We also want to make the final film look and sounds as good as possible, so we need funds to cover those costs. Lastly, we want to be able to pay George for his participation and artistic contributions to our project. Below is a pie chart that shows the breakdown of how we will be spending these funds if we are successful. \n\nSample rewards\n\n\n\n\nHELP US GET THERE!\nWith approximately 80% of Principal photography completed, we are currently in the process of scheduling animation production that will be a significant part of the film. Our plan is to complete the film in the next year, having the film festival premiere in NYC with George in attendance before his 93rd Birthday. \nPlease help us make this happen!\nNew Yorker Magazine 2018 Holiday party.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are deeply committed to making Drawing Life a reality, but that will only be possible with your help!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Animated GIF", "descp": "Animated GIF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["34 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Hi-Res Download of George\u2019s Drawing", "descp": "Hi-Res Download of one of George\u2019s drawings - could be used as desktop backdrop or printed and framed!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["40 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "George Booth stickers!", "descp": "Sheet of stickers of George\u2019s drawings.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Digital Download of the film", "descp": "Digital Download of the film when it\u2019s complete, all updates and sneak peeks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Tote bag", "descp": "Tote bag, Digital Download, all updates and sneak peeks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["93 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Hi quality print | Booth drawing", "descp": "Hi quality print of one of George\u2019s drawings delivered to you, all updates and sneak peeks.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Vintage New Yorker | Signed by George", "descp": "George Booth signed vintage New Yorker.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "Original piece of artwork from animation", "descp": "Original piece of artwork from the animation.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Invitation to screening of the premiere", "descp": "Invitation to screening of the premiere or a private preview screening (no travel costs covered).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Dinner with George Booth", "descp": "Enjoy a dinner with George Booth (Only 8 spots available, travel costs not covered).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (7 left of 8)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5,000 or more", "title": "Producer credit", "descp": "Producer credit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (10 left of 10)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10,000", "title": "Executive Producer Credit", "descp": "Executive Producer Credit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "3 signed & framed Booth prints", "descp": "3 signed and framed prints of George's drawings.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "10 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays!", "update_content": "Dear all,\nHappy Holidays, we truly hope everyone is healthy, and doing well!\nBelow is a classic Booth cover to impart some holiday spirit.

So just like your life... only not.\nHere's a few of our favorites.\nThe comic has, and always will, remain FREE to read online at pvponline.com. \nThis Kickstarter will help us collect the first 20 years of PvP comics in their entirety plus an additional tome of never-before-seen content. Designed by famed illustrator and designer Rob Armbrister, with over 2,500 pages collected into 9 full-color, oversized 12\"x10\" hardcover volumes, these will truly be the Definitive Editions of PvP Online. \nThere are lots of different ways you can support this Kickstarter! Grab the 20th Anniversary Retrospective, pickup all 9 Volumes of PvP Definitive Editions, go \u00c0 La Carte and choose just the years you like the most, or go All Digital and get 20 years of PvP delivered directly to your cyberzone.\nHAVE A FAVORITE YEAR OF PvP OR ONLY WANT A COUPLE BOOKS? ADD-ONS ARE FOR YOU!\nChose any reward tier you'd like, then add the amount listed in the chart below for any books you'd like to \"add-on\" to your pledge. Once the campaign is over, we'll ask you which add-on items you wanted and you'll get exactly the combination of rewards you desire!\nWHAT ARE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE EXTRAS? \nOnce the Kickstarter is fully funded we will start unlocking Stretch Goals! Some will be upgrades to the books that are for all Backers, but many will be exclusive to Backers who choose reward tiers with +EXTRAS in the description. The more we fund the more +EXTRAS you get! \nSHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN ENDS!\nBooks are heavy and nine books coming in at over 2,500 pages is a lot of book. This Kickstarter may even require multiple shipments for each Backer! All shipping fees will be charged AFTER the campaign ends, just before we ship the books. By doing it this way we can ensure you are paying the lowest possible cost for shipping. \nWe will ship the books in bulk to a series of warehouses around the globe. Final surveys will then be sent to each Backer requesting their address and calculating an accurate shipping charge. We're going to do everything we can to keep these rates as low as possible.\nBOOK RELEASE PARTY AND REWARD PICKUP!\nFor those located in the greater Seattle area, you will have the option to pick up your books in person at the PvP 20th Anniversary Book Release Party (time and location to be scheduled in 2019). Here you'll be able to pickup your rewards, meet Scott Kurtz, spend some time with fellow comic lovers, and enjoy some delicious snacks. Surely, a good time to be had by all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe face three major challenges with this Kickstarter:\n\nFirstly, much of the art from 1998 - 2002 was never properly digitized. Finding and scanning or digitally remastering these strips is going to be time-consuming and could affect our print schedule.\n\nSecondly, there's a LOT of content to be designed, edited, and prepped for print. Currently there are two designers, two editors, and three proof-readers working to get these books ready to print. Again, this is a time-consuming process.\n\nLastly, shipping 50+ lbs (22+ kg) of books to each Backer in a cost-effective manner is a huge task. Fortunately, we've got dedicated staff and partners at various printers, manufacturers, and fulfillment centers ready to help us reduce the shipping costs to the bare minimum.\n\nThese are all manageable risks and we're confident we can overcome them with little or no delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PvP 20th Anniversary PDF", "descp": "PvP 20th ANNIVERSARY RETROSPECTIVE PDF featuring over 200 pages of content in a DRM Free PDF including: Scott's first two comic strips 'Wedlock' and 'Elementary', the PvP 'Sunday Funnies', guest strips, original PvP character designs, sketches, and tons of never-before-seen bonus content from the last 20 years of PvP.\nINCLUDES:\nPvP 20th Anniversary Retrospective PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "PvP Definitive Edition PDF Collection", "descp": "8 volumes of PvP DEFINITIVE EDITION PDFs collecting every strip from 1998-2018 plus the 20th ANNIVERSARY RETROSPECTIVE.

I love creating \u201cfloppies\u201d, in other words, saddle-stitched or stapled periodical comic books. There is an informal quality to the process which I find interesting. It was great fun to put this comic together! \nWORN TUFF ELBOW #2 will be an 8\u201d x 10.5\u201d, 36 page comic book with colour covers and an eight page colour section. It also marks the official return of my characters Shrimpy and Paul. Previously, in 2004, Shrimpy and Paul appeared in a trade paperback all their own, Shrimpy and Paul and Friends (Highwater Books). They resurfaced in 2011 for a short story in the collection Pure Pajamas (Drawn & Quarterly) and Shrimpy appeared on his own (living with a group of green people) in Stroppy in 2015.\nAlso: one needs not to have read WORN TUFF ELBOW #1 to enjoy this issue, these are all new stories~!\nStories included in this issue\nAs you'd expect, especially if you have seen my publications before, WORN TUFF ELBOW #2 is jam-packed with a bunch of goofy stuff. These comic stories are all stand-alone yarns but the situations they set up will spill over into subsequent issues. \"Monsieur Moustache and the Tale of the Baloney\" is an extra special re-printing of a series of comics that appeared in my long lost weekly newspaper strip, Big Pile Presents (Wilder Hobson's Theater Absurd-o) but is new to the book format.\nThe back cover features a diorama created by Nathan Campagnaro\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, there is also a preemptive letters column (some letters I wrote to others), a bonus chapter from EW GAWD brought to us by the lovable Sedberg & Lilycups and an absolutely fabulous back cover: a diorama of Shrimpy and Paul fashioned by Nathan Campagnaro (above). \nI am looking to raise $4,000 Canadian dollars to have this comic printed and in return I'm offering unique rewards to whoever would like to climb on board.\nIf we manage to reach the goal very quickly, by mid-November, it is quite possible that the awards will arrive for Santa-time, otherwise, it will be January 2019. And if this all goes well I would like to consider reprinting WORN TUFF ELBOW issue #1.\nShrimpy awakes and heads to the change-room in his underpants.\nWORN TUFF REWARDS\nHave a look at these nice rewards for all of your Elbow needs:\n(If you look to the right, you'll see a list of rewards and reward configurations. We tried to come up with every possible combination of rewards, so check it out closely for the exact tier that best suits your needs.  Below are the various pieces of the puzzle.)\nREMOTE VILLAGER WOVEN PATCH\nA very nice woven patch with one of your favourite yellow cylindrical characters on it!

This reward will go out to the buyer pretty quickly as it is a standalone, just in time for Christmas.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION\nWe at NO WORLD BOOKS would like to thank you for your kind consideration towards this project! \nFrom the one page strip \"Seemingly Random Street Views (An Aside) A Transition to Full Colour\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks are minor and few. The comic book is complete and ready to be printed. I have proofed the book several times so it's ready to print. I will be using a Canadian printer, one I'm very familiar with, so I have no concerns. I have also used the patch manufacturer in the past and they're very reliable.

Along with our friends Gabriel Mayorga and Lea Jean Badelles, we are artists who love to tell fun stories that inspire the imagination for all ages. Adam has been working as a professional illustrator for over 20 years and this is Makana\u2019s 2nd book.\nAdam and Makana at Alternate Universe in Milford CT for an in-store book signing.\nWho is Punk Taco?\nPunk Taco is a lovable alien taco who rocks out across the universe with his band of misfits, fighting evil and helping those in need. Punk Taco believes in peace and love but has no tolerance for bullies and tyrants, so when he sees an injustice, he can't resist helping and joining in the fight.\nHe loves his friends and considers them family, and will do anything for them. His empathy and compassion for others and his willingness to sacrifice himself to help the downtrodden is legendary.\nDespite his intergalactic celebrity, Punk Taco's origins still remains a mystery. What's his real name? Where does he come from? Is he the only one of his kind? All of these questions will be answered in time, but for now- enjoy the adventure.\nVolume 2: The Story\nPunk Taco and the band were on their way to a gig when we last saw them in the Volume 1 Epilogue, when a giant hand reached through a mysterious portal and whisked them away. Volume 2 picks up immediately after that and thrusts our hero and his friends into a dangerous new adventure to save a planet endangered by a greedy syndicate that is mining not just the resources, but also the very life essence of the planet itself. Punk Taco must join forces with a coalition of tribes to prevent an environmental disaster, but the problem is, they are all ready to give up and run for their lives. What\u2019s a taco to do?\nThe Art\nCheck out these sample pages of PUNK TACO Volume 2!\nPunk Taco Volume 2 Page 1. Uh Oh!\nPunk Taco Volume 2 Page 2. Giant taco eating robots can be pretty scary.\nPunk Taco Volume 2 Page 3. Punk Taco refuses to be anyone's food!\nThe Mission\nPunk Taco Volume 2 is a continuation of Volume 1, and picks up where we left off in the epilogue. The book is penciled and we are inking and coloring each page now.\nWe need to raise a minimum of $15,000.00 to bring this to life. This will cover the cost of printing an 8x12 hardcover with spot varnish and full-color interior pages, as well as production (inking, coloring editing) and shipping costs. Stretch Goals will be added on if we go beyond our initial funding.\nThe art will be completed by the end of December, after which we will ship the book to the printer once it is edited. We are looking to have it back from the printer by May 2019.\nInternational customers - The cost of shipping PUNK TACO Volume 1 from the previous campaign cost me between $28-$40 for a single book. I apologize for the high cost of shipping but it is not something I control. When I originally shipped Volume 1, I had to come out of pocket for a lot of the cost. Because of these high shipping costs I will be including some extra rewards exclusive for international customers.\nMakana and his little brother showing off their copy of Punk Taco Volume 1\nLarger than most large format comics. PUNK TACO Volume 1 is a beautiful, oversized 8x12 Hardcover on 105lb paperstock. Volume 2 will be the same.\nKids LOVE the large hardcover format of PUNK TACO. It just feels GREAT holding this book in your hands when you read it.\nRewards\nI try and keep the rewards simple because I want to focus all my energy on making this the best book possible. Rewards will consist of copies of Punk Taco Volume 1 for those who missed out, sketches, original art, commissions, older books and comics I worked on, as well as stickers and a digital download of the official PUNK TACO theme song. If we can reach our stretch goals I can possibly produce some shirts or maybe even put together custom PUNK TACO Lego sets. For now, I just want to create the best comic book possible and I hope you will join in the adventure.\nIf you don't own PUNK TACO Volume 1, the deal for you is the BOOK LOVER SUPREME for $50. This will get you copies of both PUNK TACO Volume 1 and 2 plus a lot of great extras.\nSample Menu:\nJust a little taste of all of our rewards!\nPunk Taco Sticker #1\nPUNK TACO Button #1\nCustom PUNK TACO LEGO.

The Creators Adam and Makana Wallenta The Fans We\u2019ve been travelling all over the country and are so grateful to everyone that has supported PUNK TACO Volume 1.\nQuotes from Professionals Endorsing PUNK TACO Volume 1\n\u201cPunk Taco is childlike fun at its best! Full of tacos, nachos, aliens and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll!\u201d\n- Franco\nEisner and Harvey Award-Winning Writer/Artist of Tiny Titans, Itty Bitty Hellboy, Superman Family Adventures\n\u201cPunk Taco is like the dream you\u2019d have after passing out from a great Mexican feast while bumping 90\u2019s Hip-Hop through your headphones. Its psychedelic weirdness and social activism could only come from the combined minds of a kid and his dad, cracking up at a joke and then turning it into an entire galaxy. From radio station WKRS to the junk food villain\u2019s plan to \u201cMake the Galaxy Great Again,\u201d its hidden gems sparkle bright. Throughout all the juvenile, hyper-colored fun, you can dig the central theme that love, art and being cool to one another make up the infinite power that runs this mothership we all happen to be traveling on, and that greed, selfishness and fear are all headed for self-destruction. Long live Punk Taco and his secret nachos!!!\u201d\n- Secret Agent 23 Skidoo\nGrammy Award-Winning Hip-Hop Artist for Best Children\u2019s Album and Author of Weirdo Calhoun and the Odd Men Out\n\u201cPunk Taco is a fun, intergalactic action-adventure story full of the kind of love and optimism you\u2019ll definitely want to upload into the brain of any kid you care about.\u201d\n- Chris Giarrusso\nHarvey Award-Nominated Artist/Writer of G-Man, Mini Marvels, Encounter\n\u201cAdam and Makana Wallenta\u2019s Punk Taco is a lush, sumptuous spectacle for both adult and children\u2019s eyes, coupled with a crazy-fun story that wraps itself around important social issues... and nachos. It\u2019s delicious!\u201d\n- Mark McKenna\n2012 Inkwell Awards Hall of Fame. Writer, Penciller, Inker of Banana Tales, Combat Jacks, Batman\n\u201cTruth, justice and the quest for perfect nachos! Punk Taco is a fun-filled comic book burrito... an important tale of optimism wrapped in candy-colored art. Adam Wallenta created Punk Taco with his son, Makana. The result is a rockin\u2019 all-ages book that can be enjoyed by parents and kids alike. All that\u2019s missing is a side of guacamole!\n- Bill Walko\nWriter/Artist of The Hero Business\n\u201cAt the same time it\u2019s a kind of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure meets Axe Cop, Punk Taco is also a book that validates childrens\u2019 emotions in these turbulent times. It's okay to be upset and angry over the injustices of the world, and channeling those feelings into something active is a good way to manage them\u201d.\n- Kelly Sue DeConnick\n2014 Eisner-Award Nominated Writer of Pretty Deadly and Captain Marvel\n\u201cThis Taco goes Hard (shell)! Here\u2019s an intergalactic space adventure that feels foreign and familiar simultaneously. Punk Taco walks that same hero path I grew up admiring in my youth. With some incredibly beautiful colors, very unique character designs and an unpredictably building storyline, Punk Taco is an all-ages Sci-Fi comedy adventure that has a little something for everyone.\"\n- Marquee Mark,  Markellus Ragans\nHost of So Wizard Podcast\nReviews for PUNK TACO Volume 1\nReviews for PUNK TACO Volume 1 on Amazon\n Everyone LOVES Punk Taco!\nKids LOVE Punk Taco!\nParents and Kids LOVE PUNK TACO!\nCouples Love PUNK TACO!\nTeenagers Love PUNK TACO!\nPUNK TACO is for everyone!\nIf you love to read- PUNK TACO is for YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks.

A Hardcover Graphic Novel for All-Ages"}}, {"backer": "Mike Kunkel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Puc the Artist is set in a world where everything that exists, is drawn into existence. If you want a birthday cake, just master your pencil work, and draw yourself a birthday cake. Some are skilled at watercolor, some with charcoal or etchings. Each has their own unique ability to create...or destroy. But in this world of ink and artists something important and vibrant has been lost and forgotten - Color. Our story is about the happenstances of discovering it, and the problems three youths must deal with to return it to the world.  \nPuc the Artist is a story about friendship, learning one's place in the grand scheme of things, and adventure. The story is planned with a complete beginning, middle, and end. This book will be the begging of the adventure. Just like how Star Wars: A New Hope, stand on it's own as a film. So too will the first Puc The Artist book. If we are so lucky to have the support, the story has room to expand into the other two arcs in the future.  \nGarret and I are co-creating this story, so the same art team and writer will be on it the whole way threw. It's a labor of love for the both of us, with Garret being the originator of the character designs and look of this world. And Miles Greb plotting out the story and fleshing out the characters. \nThe main book will be 66 pages, a hearty start to the story, and half of the first arch. However if you look below we have a REALLY great stretch goal in mind. \nIf we reach the goal of $12,000 everyone getting a Puc The Artist comic will get an upgraded copy. Instead of printing the 66 page large size \"Floppy\" comic, we will instead be printing a graphic novel that is the full first arch of the story. I hope we can do this, as it gives everyone more for their money, and we get to tell the whole first arch with just one Kickstarter and with one book! So please be sure to share it around to help us reach this goal!   \nJay, Miles, Garret, Milsea, and Jamie.\nMiles Greb - Writer, Co-creator - Former Bob Dylan impersonator who's obsession with Star Trek is annoying to everyone.  \nGarrett Richer -  Illustrator - Co,Creator - The actual artist for the fictional Artist, non-fictionally. \nJay Bendt - Illustrator- Fantasy loving hoarder of color pencils and coffee mugs. Draws pictures for a living.\nMilsae Kim - Females. Strong females.\" I just love female characters so much :) \nAndrew Pierce -  Editor - Lovable goof. Escaped Kipling protagonist.\n An Orphan from the nomadic tribes of the Cold North. Separated from her family at a very young age Asta has had to learn to fend for herself. She has a quick temper, and picks fights with about everyone. Although some people in town think she is a bit cold, her close friends Tolo and Puc know she would do anything to protect them. She secretly wants to be a start her own Strawberry farm...but she won't ever tell anyone cause she has to keep up appearances.   \n Tolo is a son of a famous explorer and a famous artist. He grew up with stories of far off places from his mother, and watching his father paint images of them. His dream though, was to help others explore the world like his mother so Tolo became a Cartographer. Well, he is training to be one at-least. He carries with him a giant compass that can read the land, but also in a pinch move the ground before him.   \nWell read, and more formally educated then his two friends, Tolo is normally the plan maker of the gang. \n Puc spends his day at his drawing desk in his granddads basement. Introverted by nature, Puc has a good heart and often gets dragged outside by his friends. Even when they do get him to leave his drawing desk, he normally finds something to draw while out and about.  \n He is a Rat Burglar, pun intended. He makes his coin by bounty hunting, in turning in people for petite crimes. He travels with his ally Fink, a husky Mouse who is't the most sophiscated - but he is loyal.   \nRead the first issue for free!\n       Or if you just want a quick look at the art, here are two pages from the first story arch. Note some of the book will be in Black and White and some in color - it all depends on the story line and what powers Puc can learn!  \nThe Book!  \nA beautiful printed comic book! This is actual a sample of a very small print run I did to show the first arch of the story off at C2E2. The actual book will be longer, and have a different cover. It will be printed by Print Ninja, who is one of the best is the bussiness.   \nThe book is designed to be 66 pages, and if we hit out strech goal it will increase to 122! \nThe Actual Cover below.\nArt Prints!  \nArt by Milsae Kim\nArt by Jay Bendt\nThese are the two awesome Art Prints available. They will be printed on high quality stock, and 8 1/2 x 11 inches in size.  \n Enamel Pins!\nPins of Pit the mouse & Puc!\nSketch Cover  \n We are making a story about artists after all so what better reward then a sketch cover? These covers will be coated with a nice paper suited for inking. We wanted to make something of an event of them so, everyone who gets one and does a sketch will have their work shown off! We will be tweeting them out, sharing them on Instagram, and Kickstarter updates. Anyone who wants to their art to be linked back to their account, we will be happy to do that.   \nOr you can buy it and keep your sketch all to yourself, that is totally fine too! \nThere is even an option to have Garret draw a custom sketch for you! \nThese covers will be Kickstarter exclusive. \nArt Commission! \nExamples of The Full Color Commission in the \"Box of crayons\" level\n Any Kickstarter project is ultimately only as good as it's budget and planning.

The pockets are over 7\" wide and .75\" deep\nSturdy & Strong - The 12\" base makes for a small profile but a strong base that supports the weight of the comics, and won't tip over\nClassic Sign Topper - The innovative 4-sleeve topper includes retro inspired signs designed by JG Roshell of Comicraft\nColor Choice - The rack is available in either black or white so you can choose what works best for your space\nSmooth Spinning\nThe Classic Spinner Rack is the perfect way to show off your collection, and it is a natural fit in any environment. \nTo move from prototype to full manufacturing, we need YOUR support to Bring Back the Spinner Rack!

A technical glitch forced us to relaunch this campaign, BUT - please don't be swayed by the lofty % shown - we TRULY need to get as close to $100K as possible. Thanks for your support! - Ron\nThe Animation Show of Shows is an annual event which curates the world\u2019s best animated short films and presents them as a single family-friendly feature-length film to audiences worldwide. By bringing animated short films to the big screen, and showing them in theaters around the world, we hope to shine a spotlight on the brilliance of independent animators, while providing a moving cinematic experience to global audiences of all ages.\nWith proceeds from this campaign, we\u2019ll further raise the profile of animated short films by screening our 19th Annual Animation Show of Shows in more locations - especially schools. We will expose an ever-widening audience to these wonderful masterpieces.\nThis is our 19th annual show. Over the years, we have curated so many remarkable films! It gives us pleasure to bring unknown films of great merit to the general public. And, in fact, thirty-six of the films we presented were nominated for Oscars.\nBut we can only continue to do what we do by obtaining financial support. \nWe are a non-profit and pledges are tax-deductible. Please - pick a Reward that suits you best, and help us preserve and present this wonderful and important art form. Thanks! \n===\n In 1999, animation producer Ron Diamond started the Animation Show of Shows. He wanted to share the brilliant films he was discovering with the wider animation industry.\nFor 16 years, Ron built relationships with animation festivals and leading college programs that enabled him to scout out talent to include in the show. He would then show the final product to the top animation studios, game and technology companies and schools, helping to create greater awareness of budding animators.\nThen, in 2015, he felt it was time to take the show public. As a 501(c)(3) non profit, The Animation Show of Shows has raised over $227,000 on Kickstarter, thanks to the generous support of well over 1,000 industry professionals, students and fans of animation. This allowed The Annual Animation Show of Shows to premiere in more than 70 cities with more than 570 showings\n The Animation Show of Shows is the first of its kind, specifically curated for a wide audience and tailored to appeal to all ages.

That's enough to make a designer out of anybody.\nI tried a variety of mugs, even those giant double-wall tumblers, but that left stains too!\nIt was clear, I wanted to design something beautiful, useful and unique. While the solution was not apparent to me right away, inspiration struck one day as I reached for a tasty banana.\nThe banana hook-holder had an interesting shape that got me wondering. Somehow, the hanger kinda, sorta, looked like a handle. I guess that was the moment. Needless to say, the ensuing prototypes left a lot to be desired.\nIt wasn't pretty, and it was far from what I envisioned as \"the most beautiful mug in the world\"\n573 strangers pledged their support faithfully, with the promise that I would deliver.\nAlthough it was my first crowdfunding effort, a group of individuals trusted me enough to provide me the funding necessary to bring my concept to life.\nToday, I'm excited to tell you about the Floating Mug\u00ae Clear.\nIt's made of glass and now 50% larger than the original. Dare I say, beauti-fuller?\n12ounces (350ml) of hot goodness; it's just what you need to get any day going.\n    Does the coaster work? I say \"YES!\", but...\nyou should definitely keep a napkin handy. There are moments when you'll cause spills that result in too much moisture dripping onto the base.\nSome people like to say condensation causes the coffee stains on furniture. That's inaccurate, specifically if you're describing hot tea or coffee.\nOne reason you might see liquid rolling down the side of your cup is because we sometimes \"dribble\". \nThis is not a scientific fact, but I believe the repetitive sipping from a single point on the mouth of the mug, accumulates to a point where it ultimately has to roll down the side of your cup, it's not a lot of moisture.\nYou may inadvertently spill some coffee over the side of the mug by stirring heavily, or by stumbling while you walk to your seat or desk.\nIn any event, these scenarios will likely see moisture drip down the side of your mug. \nSo, won't the excess moisture spill into your lap as you drink?\nFor the typical use case, the amount of moisture that does make it to the bottom of the Floating Mug, usually evaporates away, or simply clings to the bottom of the mug. \nExcessive moisture accumulation caused by an actual spill can simply be 'dabbed' dry using a small napkin.\nThousands of Floating Mugs (original porcelain version) have sold on online. An overwhelming majority of positive reviews provide feedback addressing this one concern. The mug and coaster is truly functional. \n    So! You may not need a new mug today, but this one is designed with love, and so I hope you'll want it.\n PRESS\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI successfully launched and shipped my first Kickstarter project in 2012. While I'm confident I will be able to deliver the first 4,000 mugs on time. The remainder will be shipped as quickly as possible beyond that initial deadline with the goal of delivering before April 2018. I plan to be diligent and cautious through the various stages of this project.\n\n\nAt the start of this project, the Floating Mug is a prototype. Your pledges will enable me to get me through a few more rounds of sampling before we're ready to start production.\n\nThere are risks and challenges that could impact this project negatively. These include an extended sampling process due to quality and/or logistical concerns. Poor tooling or raw materials can also impact timelines. \n\nQuality control will be an integral part of this process, but that too can identify issues that delay production.\n\nShipping globally is also challenging both for us and off course the backers. \nYour reward may be subject to local and/or international fees or charges assessed in you country.\nIt's possible you would have to pay additional fees and/or charges to get final delivery of your mugs. \nPlease try to research this concern before you back this project.\nThere are a variety of shipping methods at our disposal, so it's conceivable that our strategy to ship will change in order to scale up distribution.\nThis could see your order delayed as well.\n\nI promise to keep you informed with regular updates. While I'll make an effort to answer your queries by email or through comments, I may not be able to respond consistently to every single question that's directed at me.

I chose the bison because, when I started my research, I felt like I had opened a can of worms. This animal\u2019s life is fascinating, dramatic, political, and misunderstood. The Bison today is still struggling to hold on to the two things that they represent to us. That is, Freedom and the true spirit of Adventure. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be equally fascinated by what I've dug up. Sounds all very serious I hear you say? I promise, it will be very entertaining! Writing a story that had to be factually accurate without overshadowing the artistic license was part of the challenge.  \n   Although Roamin\u2019 is a standalone film, it\u2019s also a pilot episode for a possible series of short films about different animals. My goal is to create short films that will inform and rid destructive ignorance.  Also to uncover myths and prejudice that surround many of our animal friends by exposing the truth. But more importantly, to present it with humor. I want viewers to identify with the animal in order to empathize.  And the way to identify with an animal that doesn't necessarily have human emotions, is to admire his abilities to overcome the same obstacles that we do.  Acceptance, food, water, shelter, the need for a companion, and perseverance to survive.The social and emotional threats that we now face in today\u2019s society can easily relate to the physical threats that animals face in the wild. And of course it\u2019s always fun to observe the absurdities caused by our fellow beings.\nThe biggest challenge for any artist that has a story worth telling to the tribe, is giving up creative control in order to get it made.  With your support, this film will have creative direction without the compromise and challenges that come from a large studio system.  You will be supporting the production of a film as it was intended by the creator.  That makes you AWESOME!\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 funding platform.  That means if we don\u2019t reach our goal within 28 days, we get nothing. So if you love independent animation, you love wildlife and conservation, and you have a quirky sense of humor, then please come aboard this journey with me and get this film up and Roamin\u2019.\nI've invested a lot of time researching and developing this story until I felt it was worth sharing with you all.  At this point the film structure is pretty much locked down, the characters are designed, and the visual style is looking good. It\u2019s now time to bring it to life!\nRoamin\u2019 is a 2D, hand drawn animation using digital techniques. It\u2019s a very labour intensive process, but anything made by hand has the advantage of looking and being organic.The backgrounds and textures will be a mixture or acrylic, watercolour and pencil. All the components will then be scanned and composited together digitally. Once all the visuals are in place, we move into post production.This is where the composer and sound designer do their magic.\nSharon Colman Director/Story/Animation   \nMichael Graham campaign manager                                        \nPeter Gosling Composer                                                                 \nRupert Degas Voice Actor\nMore to come...\n I've put together a selection of rewards that I think will appeal to everyone.  These include water resistant stickers made from biostone for spreading good vibes with an eco-conscience, and the limited edition gicl\u00e9e print, signed and numbered for the serious art collector. \n       Here is where your hard earned support actually goes. It will not be paying for new equipment or software licenses, nor will it be used for studio space or trips to the grocery store. It all goes towards the production of the film you want to see made and it's campaign.\n   If this campaign is successful and we meet our goal, then a BIG THANK YOU to all of you! Because of you, the film will exist! Our stretch goal is to help the film migrate around the world.  The festival submissions budget doesn't cover every single festival. As it becomes quite expensive we simply prioritize certain festivals based on prestige, location and past relationships.

Morning. Ever. Mug. is an innovative mug that keeps coffee hotter longer and offers a fun surprise function... doughnut warmer!  For thousands of years the mug has remained relatively unchanged. The problem is that it leaks heat and flavor (less warmth = less flavor) at an alarming rate.  Within 20 seconds a regular mug loses 10-15 degrees F of temperature!  Thermal/travel mugs provide superior insulation, however they're not nearly as comforting as drinking from a warm ceramic mug.  \nWe've provided a solution by integrating a built-in lid/warming plate.  The plate uses the heat from your coffee or tea to provide better insulation than any other ceramic mug on the planet.  It was also designed specifically to hold and warm a doughnut, cookie, muffin, scone, or other treat!  It's fun and delicious! \nFor those of you that have never had a fresh doughnut that's still warm, you need to try it!  This mug is your own personal mini warming oven.  Like cookies that are still warm right out of the oven?  Yep, you got it any time you want.  \nOnly a small part of the pastry is exposed over the sipping holes. After one bite, the entire pastry is warmed by the hot plate and NOT the steam.  You can enjoy a perfectly warmed treat in all of it's glory every time!\nFirst of all, no, the Best. Morning. Ever. Mug does not compete with a thermal/travel mug.  Those are great... for travel.  When at home or in the office, however, there is nothing that compares to the comfort of sipping from a warm ceramic mug.  This is where the Best. Morning. Ever. Mug shines!  Our mug presents a significant improvement in longer lasting warmth and FLAVOR!  On average the mug retains more heat by 9-12 degrees F!  That might not sound like a lot, but crank up the heat in your room right now by 10 degrees and see how it feels.  You'll feel it in your mug too and it's delicious!  \nThe mug is made from porcelain which we chose mostly because of it's beautiful finish.  They say the more attractive a serving piece is the better it's contents taste.  That sounds good to us so we went with this material which offers a truly lovely luster.  Porcelain is also anti-microbial which resists germs and guarantees a nice clean cup every time.  The mug also meets or exceeds FDA and CA 65 standards.  It is also microwave and dishwasher safe.\nHOW ABOUT CLEANING?! That's one we've heard a lot.  We can tell you that the large opening was designed specifically with cleaning in mind.  It allows easy access for a sponge or washcloth with no problem.  It is also large enough for the spray from a dishwasher to clean thoroughly.\nOur mission is to deliver a delightful experience that gives you something to look forward to every morning.  We want to help make the world a better place, and so we're donating $1 from the sale of every mug sold through this Kickstarter (and our website in the future) to the non-profit TO WRITE LOVE ON HER ARMS. TWLOHA is giving people hope to look forward to another day too.  They're a movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, and suicide.  We're not employees in any way, simply supporters.  You are too when you make a pledge!  \nFirst, here's what we've accomplished so far.  We've invested in the prototyping and patenting process (we're \"patent pending\").  We've developed engineered drawings and designs and vetted several manufacturers.  We've landed on a manufacturer that believes in this project and is dedicated to providing a quality finished product.  We have a fulfillment company that will help distribute and ship the mugs efficiently (same business day for most orders!).  \nWhat we need is the investment to have our first run of production completed.  We have to order a rather large quantity in order to keep the prices affordable.  So the funds will be used to fund the production.  Everything else has been done and is ready to go!  \nWe're both thrilled and humbled at the response we've gotten in the media!  As exciting as all of that is, we can tell you that nothing delights our heart more than having YOU, our backers that believe in us, believe in this product, and are supporting this campaign.  Your pledge and help spreading the word out there makes all the difference!  With all of our heart we say, THANK YOU!!!  If you haven't yet joined our fledgling community we hope you do that today.  We need you too! \nBest Regards,\nTom & Alicia Medwin", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge is getting the mugs out to you ASAP.

Clap your hands, snap yours fingers or bang the table, and they will start to Boogie:\n100% smile guarantee: having the dice magically roll on your command makes everyone who sees it smile, and that's what we're here for!\nDesigned to be a universal gaming accessory, Boogie Dice can replace any standard \u2018static\u2019 dice in any and all of your favorite games. But Boogie Dice are jam-packed with unique features and abilities that transform them from simple dice into the coolest gaming accessory.\nBots Battleground is a fast-paced, real-time card game that was designed specifically to utilize the novel properties of Boogie Dice. In the game (3-6 players, ages 8 and up), players battle each other with bot cards, while the Boogie Dice dictate the duration and special rules of each round, and power tokens keep track of the score.\nEach game includes 1 specially designed Boogie Dice, 1 charger/arena, a deck of 60 unique bot cards, 40 power tokens and a rulebook. See below for more details.\nFor this campaign, we are offering additional special Boogie Dice and the first Bots Battleground expansion. You can play the game with any number of expansions and up to 4 different special Boogie Dice at a time!\nBoogie Dice can be programmed to utilize the following features:\nBoogie Dice are packed with features that add layers of fun, excitement, chaos, strategy and interactivity to gaming, and this is just the beginning...\nInside each Boogie Dice there is a vibration motor, a tiny microphone, a microprocessor, a rechargeable battery and 3 LED lights. When the microphone detects a short and loud sound, such as a hand clap or a finger snap, the motor starts rotating, causing the dice bounce and roll.\nDifferent behaviors can be programmed into the dice, such as to \"stop listening\" during random periods of time, or activating the red LED while a turn is in progress, so countless new games can be designed for it. One such game is Bots Battleground...\n  Bots Battleground is a quick and slick player vs. player match game with tons of intense tactics and tenuous treaties. Each of your bots has special specs and you must know when to deploy it for maximum effect. You should also be aware of other players' bots in order to know who to attack and who to solicit for cooperation.\nThe game can be played with one or more special \"iconized\" and pre-programmed Boogie Dice, which \u201cdecide\u201d whether a player attacks or not, and determines special rules for each round. It also sets up, randomly, how long a round lasts. So players must always pay attention to the dice in order to choose the right tactic of the moment, who to ally with, and how much risk they should take.\nAre you fast, cunning and daring enough to win? Click, snap or clap your way to victory!\n          Check out the rules here:\nPLAY\n\nOn a full charge, Boogie Dice can roll up to 30 minutes continuously. That\u2019s about 500 activations!\nEach die is equipped with a powerful 100 mAh rechargeable lithium battery. To charge the dice, place them on the 3 metal charging pins on the charging station. The dice glow red throughout the charging period (approx. 40 min).\nBy default, a Boogie Dice rolls for 2-4 seconds, displaying a blue light, then stops and glows purple for 1 second. After 1 minute without being activated, the dice goes to sleep.\nChanging these settings is super easy. Boogie Dice are programmable with sound, so you can pick from a list of different settings on our app or website and use them to communicate with the dice and reprogram it to suit any game you want.\nWhen programming the dice, they start to blink with red and blue lights, then a blue steady light will indicate that the programming succeeded.\n  Select the reward that's right for you:\nAnd add-on any extra item you'd like:\n  Nimrod (CEO) is an inventor, app developer and crowd-funding rock-star. His first creation, Pressy, was a breakthrough success, and Nimrod has plenty more great ideas up his sleeve.\nSaar (Game Designer) is an inventor, game designer (The Agents, King Down), product developer and patent writer. Saar not only comes up with great ideas, but has the energy, imagination and enthusiasm to make them happen.\nAlicia (Marketing) is a London-raised, international communications expert. She loves writing, story-telling, building brands and communities and making great ideas grab you by the nose.\nNir (CTO) is an expert in all things tech, with a specialism in sound recognition. As a seasoned CEO and CTO of Verbal Machines, he knows how to power both people and computers.\nDuring the last six months we have designed and created more than 100 (!) different models and prototypes.\nWhile the concept of Boogie Dice is simple, bouncing the dice using strong vibration and finding the right power-speed-size-weight ratio was really challenging, but we were determined to make it work.\nLuckily, we were able to fully develop Boogie Dice, ready for manufacturing. But this is only the beginning... Boogie Dice offers enormous potential to build new, innovative games based on the dice\u2019s unique features and abilities. We already have a couple more games in the pipeline, and the ideas are endless. Feel free to take part in the comments section during the campaign to share your own ideas of how Boogie Dice can add flavor and fun to both existing games as well as brand new games!\nBalance\nWe have taken several steps to make sure Boogie Dice will be perfectly balanced: the components are spread equally (weight distribution is even) and the motor is positioned diagonally (maximizing bounce).\nPLAY\n\nFormal optimization will be conducted during final production but we have extensively tested our prototypes and the results have been very encouraging, coming extremely close to perfect balance.\nHelp us roll\nBoogie Dice is definitely the most fun product we have ever worked on and we are excited to share the magic with you.

Let's see if we can reach \u00a328,000 (edited because I REALLY want to do this now!) and I will add extra excitement and Adventure to the game in the form of a sidequest featuring everyone's favourite news-sleuth Emmelina Snoopsworth! She is already going to be involved in helping Bertram extract himself from his predicklement, but if we can reach this goal then she can do some top-notch adventuring of her own! What do you say? Can we do it?\nBertram Fiddle, leading Victorian Explorator needs your help to fund his next adventure and finally discover the true identity of Geoff the Murderer. A comedy 2D Point and Click Adventure Game for PC, Mac, iOS and Android. \nContinuing the adventure from Episode 1: A Dreadly Business, Bertram and Gavin are back!\nA Dreadly Business was the first game we at Rumpus Animation ever made. It was inspired from our collective love of Victorian fiction, Hammer Horror, Lovecraft, Doug McClure, Point and Click games like Monkey Island and Machinarium and terrible, terrible jokes.\nEpisode 1 was released on iOS and Steam earlier this year and got some great reviews. It was featured as a best new game on the US, UK, German, Austrian and Russian app stores and has been published in China and Japan, where it won the Best Narrative Award at Tokyo Indie Fest. \nEpisode 1 on Steam \nDespite our best efforts we haven't quite made enough sales to pay for the full production of the next Episode. We've been toiling away on other projects and have managed to save up some of the money we need, but time waits for no man and we NEED to finish this story soon!\nSeb, the writer, illustrator and creator of Bertram Fiddle, has spent many sleepless nights writing Episode 2 by the light of the moon and is literally itching to get this new game underway. This game has a much more intriguing story which sees Bertram framed for a murdering he did not commit. As he struggles to clear his name he discovers that the mystery goes much deeper than he expected and he really does find himself in a Bleaker Predicklement. We've started building the new puzzles, scenes and characters but need YOUR help to go into full production.\nWe want Episode 2 to be bigger and better and more puzzlier than the first. The mysteries, the intrigue, the dark humour...it's all back and betterer than ever. We're partnering with German game developer Deck13 from the start this time. They made the award-winning Lords of the Fallen and were voted Best German Games company last year. They are lending us their incredible experience and are helping us make the gameplay as strong as possible. They will also be translating the game into German from the outset for all the point and click fans in Germany.\nWe learnt so much from making Episode 1 and have taken on board the comments from you, the players. This game will complete the Geoff the Murderer storyline and is going to be much more involved, with more story, more choice and even more punbelievably bad jokes.\nWe know \u00a325,000 isn't enough to make a 4 hour fully animated, fully voice-acted adventure game from scratch. But luckily we don't have to.\nEpisode 1 cost us \u00a350,000 and took a year to make. Fortunately we are in a much better position this time around. We have already written the story, designed many of the scenes and puzzles and have started building new characters.\nAlso, because of the way Episode 1 was built, we have an event sequencer and timeline system which means adding content is much faster. Good old Alexander Birke, our lead programmer from Episode 1, explains more in this talk at GDC2015. This means Episode 2 will be much easier to make than our first game.\nWe've saved up enough money from the sales of A Dreadly Business to cover the costs of Voice Actors, Recording Studio and a new soundtrack by our talented composer/jazz meister friend Cam Reynolds. So the money raised by this campaign will pay for our trusty animators, Dan Emmerson and Leah Panigada, to work full-time on bringing Bertram and his world to life, background art by myself and Emily Kimbell and additional puzzle programming by Rex Hancox.\nObviously, the more money we raise the bigger and better we can make this game. Help us make this adventure the most fantastic it can be! And if we really capture your imagination and we reach our stretch goals we have loads more Adventures for Bertram planned. Trips to the Centre of the Earth, Voyages to the Moon, Discovering Lost Worlds. He can literally go anywhere!\nWe've got some really splendid rewards to thank you for backing us. Obviously the game is first and foremost and all backers from the \u00a35 tier will receive this. But then we have some exclusive and very lovely other rewards that only the bravest Adventurers will be able to own. Have a little peek at some of them here.\nStickers\nBertram Fiddle Sticker Pack\nWho doesn't love stickers? \nOriginal Drawings\nAll backers of the GOODNESS ME tier and above will receive a signed, original ink drawing of a strange Victorian character from Seb Burnett, the creator of Bertram Fiddle.\nVariety of original ink drawings by Seb Burnett\nT-shirts\nT-shirt mock-up\nExclusive backer only T-shirts featuring Marvo the Hypno-Cat\nArtbook\nArt of Bertram Fiddle book mock-up\nA beautiful, limited edition, 96 page art book, full of sketches, characters and backgrounds from Episode 1 and 2. It will give an insight behind the scenes at Rumpus and show how we developed Bertram's world from rough ideas to final product.\nThere will also be some very special guest artwork from artists that we will be announcing throughout the campaign.\nAdventuring Tin\nTop Secret Book Tin mock-up\n As part of the MEMBERSHIP TO THE ADVENTURER'S CLUB reward you will get this fantastic 8 inch, book-shaped tin, printed to look like a, er, book, so you can hide all your secret Adventuring bits and bobs away. \nThis reward also includes a plush moustache, lovingly sewn by my wife, a letter from Bertram and printed copies of Episode 1 and 2 scripts.\nGavin Figurine\nGavin figurine work in progress\nI'm so excited about this reward! Our good friend David Kirkby, aka CastingsofCthulhu has started making an 8 inch replica of Gavin, Bertram's trusty manservant. Cast in resin, the final model will be hand-painted and limited to only 20. One of which I am totally keeping for myself.\nAll in all we have over 20 individual rewards to help you be the most well-equipped Adventurer ever. These all come with extra love from everyone at Rumpus!\nRumpus is a small Games and Animation studio based in the lovely city of Bristol, UK. Set up in 2011 by Seb Burnett and Joe Wood as a place to make fun, silly stories. They have worked on Children's TV series, music videos, commercials and their own short films and now want to bring their love of character and story to the world of games.\nSeb Burnett is the writer and creator of Bertram and they share many traits. He also illustrates sticker books and is the proud owner of a stuffed otter.\nJoe Wood is the creative director and lead animator at Rumpus. He met Seb while they were working at Aardman Animation and can often be seen wondering what would have happened if they hadn't.\nDan Emmerson is a very strange young man. One peek inside his sketchbook is enough to turn anyone's stomach. However, he is a very talented animator and gifted Unity dev so we put up with him.\nLeah Panigada is our other talented animator. She's not as weird as Dan and is blessed with a keen eye for detail. But don't make her angry, because she will rip you to shreds.\nRex Hancox runs Jetstone Studios and provides us with additional programming expertise. He worked with us on Bertram Fiddle Episode 1 and also with Kitty Powers Matchmaker, but won't say who has the best legs.\nElise Townsend is our production assistant. She is perfectly organised and runs a tight ship, but she doesn't drink tea. Which I find very suspicious.\nCam Reynolds is a Composer and Musician extraordinaire. With over 20 years experience playing in bands, composing and being cool. And he sports the finest Jazz Moustache you will ever see.\nWe want to make Episode 2 the best Adventure Game ever. Any money we receive over our goal will help us to add more content and more puzzles.\nWe are just concentrating on reaching our goal so that we can finish Episode 2 as soon as possible. But, if enough people get behind us we do have some other targets that we'd love to hit.\n\u00a330,000 - What's that you say?\nIf we reach \u00a330,000 we can afford to localise Episode 2's subtitles into French, Russian, and Spanish. We may also be able to translate them into other languages so if you have a preference, please let us know.\n\u00a335,000 - Massive Clock\n\u00a335,000 will enable us to add more scenes and more characters which means more Adventuring for YOU! \nWe will be able to employ more animators, designers and developers to make Episode 2 simply stunning in all it's grandeur.\n\u00a355,000 - Fantastical Journey!\nIf we can reach \u00a355,000 we will make a fantastical new Episode of Bertram Fiddle. The beauty of having the World's Leading Victorian Explorator as your main character is that he can have Adventures anywhere.\nEpisode 3 will be a brand new story, set in a brand new location, with a brand new mystery to solve that all backers from the \u00a35 tier and above will receive with their other rewards. Although delivery on this won't be until sometime in 2017.\nContact Details\nIf you would like to learn more about Bertram Fiddle and his adventures in Episode 1: A Dreadly Business or to poke around at some of our other films created here at Rumpus then have a ganders at\nwww.twitter.com/BertramFiddle\nwww.bertramfiddle.com\nwww.rumpusanimation.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking an Adventure Game is always an Adventure!

To hear more about the people behind this project, check out this video:\nLast year, your support made the initial print run of SILVER Volume 1 possible--remember this video?\nLast year's campaign--no pun intended--kickstarted an incredible chain of events, which included a huge convention presence, an exploding fan base, amazing reviews across the board, distribution on the direct Market through Diamond (which now perennially keeps Silver in stock),  and to a general audience through Amazon Prime, with international licenses on the way and more. To round it up, SILVER Vol 1 was nominated to the 2014 Russ Manning Award at San Diego Comic Con, it is currently in play for a 2015 Geekie Award for Best Comic/Graphic Novel, and it made ComiXology Submit's Essential Reads list.\nBut for all this, the most rewarding aspect has been to meet thousands of fans, and to feel their passion for this story and these characters.\nAND NOW, THE STORY CONTINUES WITH SILVER VOL. 2!\nIn a nutshell: Set in Bram Stoker\u2019s original Dracula universe, 50 years hence into the pulp era of the 1930\u2019s, SILVER Vol. 2 continues the adventures of master thief James Finnigan, Rosalyn \u201cSledge\u201d Van Helsing, and their team of talented but troubled individuals, as they endeavor to steal an ancient treasure hidden in Dracula\u2019s castle. Suspense, humor, intense character moments and enthralling world-building ensue as the team reaches the castle, and the veil continues to lift on SILVER\u2019s rich and unique mythology.\n\nAS SILVER VOLUME 2 BEGINS, the team boards the Orient Express, which is filled with Vampires travelling to Dracula\u2019s castle. Romantic tension builds between Finn and Sledge, but she may have an ulterior motif for being on the team. We also learn more about Finn\u2019s broken past, as it quickly becomes clear that Tao needs a role-\u00admodel in Finn...something that Finn is not equipped to provide. Nonetheless, the team succeeds in pulling off the first steps of the plan in spite of Hamilton having a panic attack at the worst possible time. The team reaches the castle, and we find a powerful, but broken Drac, who never got over the loss of Mina Harker. What happens next.... well, I'm just not going to spoil that for you!\nCHECK OUT THESE ENDORSEMENTS!\nAs with the first volume, some of my comic book heroes came out to support this new volume:\n\"Silver is so big, bold, and juicy! I absolutely love this book!\" \u2014 BILL SIENKIEWICZ (Stray Toasters, Elektra: Assassin)\n\u201cWith SILVER, Stephan Franck cuts right to the bone of the story and masterfully drives his narrative home. A breath of fresh air in the world of comics!\u201d \u2014 TOMMY LEE EDWARDS (Marvel 1985, The Question, Turf)\n\u201cWhy was I not reading this before? Why? Why? Why? It\u2019s everything I love about comics. And everything I miss about a lot of comics these days. Hey Stephan Franck, I want more.\u201d \u2014 JIM KRUEGER (Earth X, Justice, The Runner)\nThe press too, which has reviewed the release of some of the single issues compiled in SILVER volume 2 was also top notch!\n\u201cStunning. Excellence in comic book storytelling.\u201d\u2014 NEWSARAMA\nAnd weaved into the \"world-building\", are some fun little Easter eggs and cameos for the pulp fanatic, so go look for them, it's fun...\nSO WHY  KICKSTARTER?\nWith all the Volume 1 success under our belt, you might wonder why we are Kickstarting volume 2, and not just continuing on the series' own momentum. Well, that's because Dark Planet is 100% independently funded, and while we make our money selling books, ALL OUR COSTS ARE UP-FRONT, and they fall into 3 categories:\n-PRINTING: that's the price of success--the print runs keep getting bigger, and before we can sell, we need to pay for printing.\n-MARKETING: publishing is marketing. We market to the retailers, and to the readers, who range from super fan to casual reader--which mean all separate campaigns.\n-CONVENTIONS: The conventions are tremendous opportunities to connect with old and new fans, and a great retail outlet for Dark Planet. However those need to be booked and paid for sometimes up to a year in advance.\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT--We need your support to stay ahead of the game!\nREWARDS--WE HAVE THEM!\nFirst and foremost, THE BOOKS: Silver Vol 1 & 2. These trade paperbacks are 112 pages, rated teen +. Note that this edition of volume 1 is the STORE EDITION (which debuted at SDCC 14). It has been upgraded since last year's campaign (Feb 14), to include MAKING-OF pages that people have been raving about, a fancy cover with flaps, a stunning vinyl finish, and more. Get these books before everybody else!\nSILVER Vol. 1 & 2\n We debuted our shirts at SDCC this years, so we know from experience that they are a hit (the tanks sold out on the first day). They are back by popular request. The Tees are available in S, M, L, XL, and XXL, and the tanks in XS, S, and M. These shirts are printed with love in a small boutique shop right here in California, and they are beautiful!\nSledge Shirts\nSledge tanktops\nOur digital rewards aren't mere PDF versions of the books! They ALSO include the integrality of the books' layouts! These pages are all about composition, clear acting and drawing shorthands, and are a great companion for anyone interested in the mechanics and craft of visual storytelling.\nSilver Vol. 2 layout\nCHECK OUT THESE PRINTS\nSince SILVER volume 1, readers and art fans have been enjoying our limited edition prints based on some of SILVER's most striking pages! Their vintage pop-artsy look makes these pieces of sequential-art a total conversation starter in your living room, and will make your office wall cool and inspiring.\nLimited edition page-prints from SILVER Vol. 1\n We are now continuing the tradition with new limited-edition prints from SILVER Vol. 2's splashiest pages!\nNeed a touch of color? Check these out, just as vintage and cool as the other ones, \nThese are only a few. The full gallery of print will be posted before reward time, and backers who picked a print package will have A TON TO CHOOSE FROM!\nPart of the selection will include images from other corners of the soon-to-be disclosed Dark Planet universe!  \nAll our prints are presented on the highest quality art paper, giving them warm, organic feel you want in an art piece!\nCHECK OUT THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY: CTN EXPO 3-DAY VIP PASSES!\nFor any animation fan,  student or a pro, CTN is the most important event of the year! This is the place to find incredible art, get inspired, get your portfolio reviewed by top pros, attend incredible seminars, meet studio recruiters... This event help every November in Burbank, CA is just absolutely UNIQUE and AWESOME, and these tickets are A HUGE DEAL! People fly in from as far as Japan and Australia to attend!\nSTORY TELLING MASTERCLASSES!\n We have been working closely with the amazing folks at the amazing CTN animation Expo, and the affiliated  Center Stage Gallery, to set up 2 masterclasses on storytelling that Stephan Franck will teach at the Center Stage Gallery in January 2016:\n-Class #1: \"Structure and esthetic of story\" (this one is about writing and 'story with a capital S').\n-Class #2: \"Visual storytelling\", (which is more about 'drawing', and equally applies to comics, storyboarding, and filmmaking in general).\nTickets for these events are included in our reward packages -- check in the reward section on the right for details!\nUPDATE: NEW REWARDS ADDED -- LARGE SIZE ORIGINAL ART\nHi all,\nOver the weekend, I had the good fortune to visit the JACK KIRBY exhibit at CSUN, and I was extremely inspired by seeing all those original pages from the King Of Comics. I had know most of those images for most of my life, but seeing the originals was a transformative experience, and really motivated me to do more ink and paper originals.\nSo since I'm very excited to see that most of the original commissions and cameo rewards are already gone I have decided to add two more LARGE SIZE ORIGINAL ART rewards:\n-The JUMBO SIZE FAN-ART SPECIAL: (original ink, 17X22). Not only will I draw your favorite characters, but two more characters from that universe, and their environment.\n-the JUMBO SIZE SILVER UNIVERSE SPECIAL: (original ink, 17X22), which will feature the SILVER full cast of main characters (the team, the main vampires, fan fave secondary characters like Myrick, Anna Olson, etc...)\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT!

Join today!\nFounded in 1903 *wink*, the Crow Scouts pledge to Believe, and Study, and Protect Our Monster Friends. We're a movement, a social club, and a place to imagine a world where monsters are among us.\nJoin the Steam Crow Monster Scouts!\nThey (the \"Crows\") also conveniently love, support, and help our little company, Steam Crow.\nWatch our Orientation Video from 1903:\nEssentially the Steam Crow Scouts is our unique Community - something more fun, more weird, and more engaging than a generic Facebook group. We want you to be a part of it.\nWe offer Spirit Badges for being an active Crow Scout, like being a great Patron, Activist, or Helper.\nThis Kickstarter is a way for us to grow our community, offer more Spirit Badges, and do more with the Crow Scouts.\nWHO WE ARE\nDawna and Daniel Davis are the folks behind \"Steam Crow\", an indie brand of illustrated weirdness begun in 1995 as a way to live a more creative life.\nPhoto by Michael Woodall\nOver the years we've exhibited at a bunch of shows like San Diego Comic-Con, Phoenix Comicon, WonderCon, Emerald City Comicon, Denver Comic-Con, Tucson Comicon, Alamo City Comicon, LA Times Festival of Books and, well, you get the picture; we do a lot of events.\nWe've had the honor of being featured Artisan Artists at Disney's WonderGround gallery since 2012, we've spoken at ASU's school of Design, the Phoenix Art Institute, and other fancy shindigs.\nThe Reason for this Kickstarter\nWe've been trying to create Spirit Patches on our own, and the response has been great! People seem to love them, and they're fun to collect and to register on our website.\nBut the trouble has been that our prototypes in leather just aren't sustainable. They're not cheap, they take a lot of time to \"pick\" the scorch coating off, and it's been difficult to find a reliable source. (A quality laser etcher costs tens of thousands of dollars.)\nBasically, we can't keep up with demand.\nWe need to convert 35+ designs to fabric woven patches, which will look great, not requiring hand-labor to prep them, and allow for color variations. The Cost: About $7000.\nSupport of this Kickstarter will allow us to convert our badges to cloth, create a bunch of new patches, create new products, and find a bunch of new Scouts!\nHeck, we believe in this, so we're willing to put in $1000 of our own money.\nWe Believe; We need YOU to Believe, too!\nCult of the Crow\nA few Crow Scouts from our first Rally\nOkay, so we're not a \"real\" cult at all, but some have said that Steam Crow has a cult following. We like that, since our Crows are really cool, creative, and ultimately generous folks.\nEXCLUSIVE PATCH\nThis Crow & Crown double patch is exclusive to the Kickstarter; Pledging at the Starter Scout on up, well get you this patch. A $14 retail value.\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nCUSTOM KAIJU HAIKU\nWe'll write you a unique Haiku about Kaiju (giant Japanese monsters like Godzilla), and email it to you as a graphic.

The hat comes with a virtual \"Hatter\" badge which you can register on our site.\nThis level INCLUDES all Stretch Goals.

You can expect:\n* Rare photos of such Golden/Silver Age creators as Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Vin Sullivan, Paul Norris, Martin Nodell, Chad Grothkopf, Al Williamson, Sheldon Moldoff, Bob Kane, Gene Colan, Marie Severin, Irwin Hasen, Harry Lampert, Ric Estrada, Bill Ward, Ramona Fradon, Bob Haney, Nick Cardy, Paul S. Newman, Dan Barry, Carmine Infantino, John Buscema, and Frank Frazetta.\nCarrie and Marty Nodell 1991\n* Pix of the big names in mainstream comics of the period, from Neil Gaiman, George Perez, Grant Morrison, Garth Ennis, Peter David, John Byrne, Chris Claremont, Kevin Eastman, Mark Waid, Alex Ross, Dave McKean, and Frank Miller to Todd McFarlane and Rob Liefeld.\nFrank Miller, Neil Gaiman, Bill Sienkiewicz, Bernie Wrightson, Dave Gibbons 1991\n* Lots of photos of writer/artists who were movers and shakers in the self-publishing/indie comics movement, including Dave Sim, Jeff Smith, Terry Moore, Linda Medley, Billy Tucci, Colleen Doran, David Lapham, Carla Speed McNeil, James Kochalka, Dan Clowes, Chris Ware, Dean Haspiel, Evan Dorkin, Sarah Dyer, Donna Barr, Shannon Wheeler, Scott McCloud, Paul Pope, Roberta Gregory, and lots more.\nJeff Smith at APE, 1998\n*Photos of key people in comics publishing and retailing, as well as shots from behind-the-scenes industry events, such as the very first organizing meeting for Friends of Lulu in San Diego in 1993.\nSome of the women in attendance at the first meeting to discuss the formation of Friends of Lulu: Cat Yronwode, Lee Marrs, (unidentified), Kim Yale, Martha Thomases, Maggie Thompson.\n*Photos of authors such as Clive Barker, Harlan Ellison, Ron Goulart, Raymond Feist, and Nancy Collins, as well as a smattering of celebrities such as Mr. T and Julie Newmar.\nAlong with all the usual favorites who were fixtures at Comic-Con year after year, including Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Stan Sakai, the Hernandez Brothers, Trina Robbins, Steve Leialoha, Bill Sienkiewicz, Bernie Wrightson, Steve Rude, Bob Burden, Bob Schreck, Diana Schutz, Mary Fleener, Michael Kaluta, Dave Stevens, Charles Vess, Jill Thompson, Denys Cowan, Eddie Campbell, Len Wein, Matt Wagner, Jimmy Palmiotti, Rick Geary, Art Adams, Karen Berger, Michael Davis, Neal Adams, Bil Stout, Howard Chaykin, Jim Valentino, Lea Hernandez, Larry Marder, Walt Simonson, Kyle Baker, Bill Mumy, Paul Levitz, Batton Lash, and lots more!\nStan Sakai in 1991\nAs in the first book, every photo will be accompanied by a caption with personal anecdotes about my experiences with these folks and events.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTo make this book a reality, I will need to raise funds to cover the design, production, printing, distribution, shipping, and storage of a high-quality hardcover publication, as well as the cost of producing the \"Extra\" booklet, the postcards, and other perks. If the goal is surpassed, money will go toward increasing the number of pages (and photos!), upping the print run, and possibly going back to press on the first book.\nBacker Rewards\nIn addition to the book, you have a choice of a number of backer rewards. They include:\n\u2022 A set of 10 postcards of images from the book\n\u2022 A pdf of the first book, Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n\u2022 A 2016 calendar with images from the book\n\u2022 An exclusive wraparound dustjacket\n\u2022 A signed copy of the first book, Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n\u2022 The exclusive Comic Book People 2 Extra, a 32-page 8 1/2\" x 11\" booklet filled with \"out-take\" photos from the 1990s\u2014shots from parties, panels, the exhibit hall, the art auction, and other aspects of comic conventions of the era\n\u2022 Postcards and the \"Extra\" booklet for the first book, Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n\u2022 A signed copy of Renegade Romance #2 (1983), which contains one of the only two stories I ever wrote for comics: \"Daydreams,\" with fabulous art by the late Barb Rausch. Also in the issue (with cover by Jaime Hernandez): stories by Colleen Doran, Trina Robbins, Steve Leialoha/Deni Loubert, and Bob Rozakis/Stephen DeStephano. A real collector's item!\nJust Added!\n\u2022 Custom 11 x 14 frameable prints of your favorite images from either of the two Comic Book People books, color or black and white. I have arranged with Chrome Digital, San Diego's premier photo lab, to make high-quality matte-finish prints from digital scans of the original negatives. If you pledge at the $250 level, you get five prints of your choice. You can also choose single prints as an Add-On to other levels\u2014see $30 in \"Add-Ons\" below.\n The plan is for backers who attend the San Diego Comic-Con in July to be able to pick up their book at the Exhibit A Press booth (#1909). That worked out well with the first book last year, as backers were able to take their book around and get it signed by folks whose photos appeared in the book.The official publication date for the book is September 10, so most backers will get their books well before it is available via bookstores and Amazon, for instance.\nAdd-Ons\nIf none of the levels quite fits your needs, you can also take advantage of add-ons. Just increase your backer amount to include any of the following items:\n$10\u2014Set of 10 postcards from CBP2\n$12\u2014Set of 10 postcards from CBP1 (limited to 35 sets: I will remove this item from the list if/when we reach that level)\n$15\u2014PDF of the first book: Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s\n$20\u2014Exclusive wraparound dustjacket\n$25\u20142016 CBP2 calendar\n$30\u2014The exclusive \"Comic Book People 2 Extra\"\n$30\u2014A custom 11 x 14 frameable matte print of your favorite image from either of the two Comic Book People books, color or black and white. Each additional print is $25, and you can add as many as you'd like.\n$40\u2014A signed copy of Comic Book People: Photographs from the 1970s and 1980s (additional shipping costs will be required for international backers)\nYou can mix and match items; just keep track of which add-ons you are paying for.\nNote that just for fun, the backer levels are named after photographers from comic books and comic strips. Which one would you like to be?\nI am open to suggestions for additional levels or perks\u2014please let me know what would you like to see or get.\nHere are a few more samples of photos you can expect to see in the book:\nJill Thompson at the 1990 San Diego Comic-Con.\nChris Ware and Kim Thompson at the 1998 San Diego Comic-Con\nRory Root, Chuck Rozanski, and Jim Hanley, ProCon 1993\nThe burgeoning self-publishing movement: Jimmy Palmiotti, James Owen, Scott McCloud, Don Simpson, Larry Marder, Martin Wagner, and Dave Sim at the 1993 San Diego Comic-Con.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving done the first book, I'm in better shape to make sure that the production and fulfillment stages run smoothly. The biggest challenges are handling all the packaging and shipping (for which I will probably seek assistance), processing international packages, and producing the \"Extra\" booklet (which took more time than I thought it would for the first book).\n\nThe first big challenge will be getting the book done and off to the printers by early May in order to have books available for the San Diego Comic-Con in early July. I am already in the process of sorting through the hundreds of photo files to choose the images that will be included.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "The Calendars Are Here!", "update_content": "At last, the 2016 Comic Book People calendars have arrived.

See updates section for details.\n WELCOME TO THE BOOK 3 KICKSTARTER!\nMy name is Paul Roman Martinez, and I am the creator of The Adventures of the 19XX. In this case, that means I am the writer, artist, designer, and everything else! Some of you may know me well and have been waiting patiently for this book. Thank you for your kind words and your encouragement over the last few months! I couldn't have finished it without you. For those of you who are new to the series, hopefully I've provided all the information you need to get caught up. Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform to help creative projects get made. My goal is for the printing costs of the graphic novel and companion book. Any extra funds will go toward producing the other items on this page. \nABOUT THE SERIES\nThe Adventures of the 19XX series takes place in the 1930s and is about a group trying to prevent World War II. After seeing terrible glimpses of the future, they know the war is coming. Along the way, they gather machines, magical ancient relics, and powerful people to help them in their cause. Another group, the Order of the Black Faun, battles the 19XX at every turn to further their own goal of ushering in a dark new world order with the beginning of a second Great War. The series begins with a young boy, known only as the Kid, being taken in by the Captain of the 19XX. Along the way, the Kid learns more and more about his father, who was once a member of the organization. The agents of the 19XX each take part in training and teaching him the ways of the group so that one day he can become the kind of hero his father was. Each book in the series takes place in a different year, and we get to explore the effect this unique family has on the Kid. Join us here for the last book in the first 19XX trilogy, 1933-1936. With your help, the next trilogy will stretch from 1937-1939! Each book is a completely self-contained adventure, but they all build toward an epic conclusion that will leave an indelible mark on self-publishing. You can start with the third book and experience a great 19XX story, or pick up the whole series and see what it's all about!\nClick here to get a look at some of the characters from the series!\nClick here to look at some of the characters from the series!\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\nThe series has been available as a webcomic since 2009. As I finish each storyline, I get feedback from readers and use that information to finalize each book. Book Three is finally done and ready to go to print. Every illustration is complete; every page is written; all I need is your help to get it made! \nSECRET FILES\nEach book in the 19XX series also has a companion book called the Secret Files.\nArt Book 1.5 Revision and Reprint\nAll pledge levels will receive access to download a digital file of the revised Art Book!\nSCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE FOR MORE ITEM DETAILS AND ADD ON INFORMATION TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR PLEDGE LEVELS.\nTo the left of each pledge level is the cost.

One way to contribute is by pledging for a book. Another way you can help is by sharing the project with your friends.

What do I want to create?\nThe book will be a 176 page story, plus extras. I always like adding surprises at the end of each book. It will have a soft cover and have the same look and feel as the previous books in the series. \nEveryone that backs my book will automatically have their name placed in it's back section because I know we could not have done this without you.\nThe Bean is an epic story, when I am done with it, it will cover 9 volumes. That's a lot of story but I am determined guy with a strong desire to make my dream happen.\nSo please take a look and find the reward that fits for you. There are a lot of cool rewards this time, including some cameo rewards for book 5. It is a popular reward and those that are in book 4 will be pleased when they get their copy to find themselves within The Bean.\nThere are two $100 rewards. The first version is a very limited special reward for those that have never been introduced to the Bean. You will get all 4 books with this version of the reward. \nThe other $100 reward does not include all 4 books, as some fans have asked. It contains extra trading cards, a print, book marks and other goodies.\n This is a very special reward- it is a nice color penciled illustration of the character of your choice in the front cover. (It's not a quick sketch). I am also upgrading all the other rewards of $150 or more to have this same option.\nThe Cameo reward is for your own character to show up in the world of the Bean. It is a small role, yet there is interaction. We had a lot of fun with the cameo's that showed up in book 4 and each one will be getting their own book. Cameos will be for book 5 and it will take two years to finish off the book. When your cameos post online, you will be notified. Some of the cameos for book 4 are making it into book 5 as well. The goal is to let you become part of the world. The only requirement is the character must follow within the realm of the Broken Moon, and cannot be from any other series. Some requests are literally not possible.\nI am also giving away pages of the original books vol 1, 2 and 3 with this Kickstarter.\nWE HIT OUR GOAL IN 14 HOURS! WOW! WHAT'S NEXT? STRETCH GOALS!\nFirst off I am very very humbled by the out-pouring of support. I am floored and very excited about where the Bean is going and I know that I could not have done this without you. Thank you very much.\nThose that are familiar with kickstarter know that once a goal is met, many creators create Stretch Goals. These goals are basically very special rewards that everyone will get. If you have been a part of my past projects you will know that my stretch goal rewards are always unique and very special. I believe in that the way to add value to a project, is to make sure all the goodies are of equal caliber as well.\nWhat I am doing different this time, is I am only going to release one Stretch Goal at a time. Once we hit that goal, I will add the next one.\n  Shipping-\nDue to international shipping costs, which in my opinion are out of control, I am forced to have to add that to my reward levels. I am willing to cover a portion of it. I am so sorry that it has to be this way. That is why I am working really hard on adding some very awesome stretch goals. I want to make it worth it for my incredible friends across the sea.\nThank you again for your support and keep creating.\ntrav", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges from running Kickstarters. The nice thing is that I am experienced in making sure that my Kickstarters run smoothly. To me it is all about creating realistic deadlines, goals and expectations. I have run 5 successful Kickstarters in the last few years. We have always delivered on time. That is important to me. \n\nYet, it does not always mean that projects go smoothly. The most important thing to me in dealing with delays, issues and other problems is communication. That is very important and I hope you take the time to ask questions, voice your concerns, and let me find ways to help smooth the process out. \n\nSome risks and challenges that always seem to happen though, is the lack of communication when we send out forms seeking information on filling out your rewards. Especially with custom art. So one way to fix this is to make sure you check your email from kickstarter or backerkit. Read what is being asked and if you don't understand send me an email and we will get back to you. I want you to be happy and get your rewards. \n\nThe the other aspect is rising shipping costs. I love my international backers, but there is always a risk in shipping overseas and the costs can be pretty expensive, so we ask that be added in. I am grateful for your support and I want to make sure you get your rewards as well. We have done really well in passing on tracking numbers, but sometimes things happen like a Canadian package taking a detour to Brazil. This does not happen often but it still can happen. So we hope you take a moment if you find a problem or feel you have not gotten your reward to send us a note and we will look into that as well. \n\nThe main thing is though is communication. It is crucial to solving these issues. Like I have said, we have run 5 very successful projects and we have learned how to deal with issues and for the most part make it better for you and for us. \n\nThank you again for supporting our great adventure. \ntrav-\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "BackerKit is Set up", "update_content": "Hello everyone!

My daughter Marley's favorite color!\nPopcorn! It's the world's #1 snack food! Americans eat enough popcorn every year to fill the Empire State Building, TWICE. It is the go-to favorite for family movie nights or watching the latest blockbuster at the movies. The problem is how do you quickly and easily mix up popcorn, especially at the movie theater. Never easy and always a mess. The answer is the PopcornBall. It is the world's only portable, reusable, mixing container for popcorn and other foods too! I guarantee once you use the PopcornBall, you'll never go back to a bowl, bag, or bucket. Buy one now and be the first person in your family and at your local movie theater to have a PopcornBall!\nJoin the PopcornBall Club. See rewards and below.\nThe PopcornBall is a 7.5inch sphere container for mixing It can hold up to 120oz or 15 cups of popcorn, a little less if used for mixing purposes. A typical bag of microwave popcorn is 10 cups. Most small movie popcorns are between 6 to 11 cups.  \nThe digital 4x6 Christmas card that comes with every reward level can be used as a $5 off coupon on our website when that launches after the Kickstarter. Valid one coupon per Backer. It will never expire. So, if it's a dollar or $100 you get the Christmas card.\nPopcorn can be a very healthy snack full of fiber, whole grains, and antioxidants but recent studies have shown microwave popcorn is not what you think it is. Try air poppers or stove top popcorn.  Mix  in all natural toppings and use less because of better distrbution with the PopcornBall.\n5 PopcornBalls for $50.  The BEST DEAL.  Fun for the whole family. \nFree Seasonings with every reward level. First 1,000 Backers Only\nThis first 1,000 Backers will get FREE Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasonings with any reward level of $15 or more. I am doubling the offer from 3 half ounce packets to 6 half ounce packets.  That's two packets of Kettle Corn, Ranch, and White Cheddar. You will be ready to get the Ball rolling when your PopcornBall arrives!\n International Shipping\nI understand shipping cost can get expensive. Your best deal is to buy more. For instance, the 5 for $50 plus $30 shipping is a total of $80.  That's only $16 per PopcornBall.  Go in with a friend or a couple of friends and save money when you buy more.\nAS SEEN ON:\nFox17 Morning News Grand Rapids, MI.

Join us at writeremergency.com to learn more about what's happening with Writer Emergency Pack.\n---\nWriting is hard. You're constantly trying to figure out what word comes next. \nCreative writing is even harder. When you're working on a story, you're not just trying to decide what word comes next, but what idea comes next.\nIt's easy to get stuck.\nI know what that's like because I'm a screenwriter. I'm lucky to have had ten movies produced, from GO to BIG FISH to FRANKENWEENIE. I also host a popular podcast about film and television called Scriptnotes.\nOver the years, I've had conversations with hundreds of writers, both on the podcast and around the lunch table. No matter what genre or medium, all writers face story problems. Plots that plod. Characters that don't connect.\nEvery writer has her own techniques for pushing past these problems -- little nudges and prompts to help get the story clicking. \nWriter Emergency Pack is a curated collection of some of the most useful suggestions I've encountered. It's by writers, for writers.\nThe Cards\nWriter Emergency Pack contains 26 illustrated cards, each featuring a different idea for getting unstuck.\nThe notion of using cards to help you write isn't new. Writers have long used tarot cards, looking for meaning in the illustrations, or decks like Oblique Strategies, with its koan-like prompts (\"Repetition is a form of change\").\nThe ideas in Writer Emergency Pack are designed to be less abstract, and more immediately useful. They're specifically tailored to people writing fiction, from novels to scripts, poems to plays. \nThe cards focus on story, character, and conflict.\nFor each illustrated Idea card, there's a matching Detail card with more specific suggestions. And on the back, you'll find tips to try.\nDetail cards (front)\nDetail cards (back)\nGive One, Get One\nOur goal is to get these packs into the hands of as many writers as possible \u2014 both the backers of the project and young writers just learning their craft. That's why we are committing to donate one deck for each backer deck we send out.\nWe're based in Los Angeles, so our initial outreach will be with programs we can visit to see what works. Ultimately, we want to send these packs all over the world. We've identified several youth writing programs we'd like to work with -- but we want your suggestions as well.\nIf you know of a creative writing program you'd like to recommend, tell us about it in the Comments section. Links and instructor names are especially helpful. Most important is your personal experience about why this particular program is so good.\nAs we learn more about how the Writer Emergency Packs are working for students, we'll be updating the Education page on writeremergency.com with tips and suggestions for using these decks with classes and after school programs.\nWhy Kickstarter\nI mostly make digital things, like apps and podcasts and websites. In the digital world, it essentially costs the same to make ten or 10,000 copies of something. It's just bits. \nWith physical goods, each unit has a real cost. When we printed demo versions of Writer Emergency Pack, each deck cost a lot. Some of that was for the paper and ink and cutting, but a lot of it was setup fees.\nThose setup fees are largely fixed. If we printed 100 rather than 10, each deck would cost less. If we could print 500, they'd suddenly be affordable. \nYou'll find lots of excellent playing card projects on Kickstarter, and this chart explains why -- making cards scales really well. As long as you can print enough at once, it's viable.\nAbout the design\nRyan Nelson designed Writer Emergency Pack, drawing inspiration from publications of the 1950s -- handbooks, manuals and field guides with strong, bold typography. (In our case, Univers.)\nWe asked David Friesen to illustrate the cards. Each one is clever and packed with details. You'll be looking at these cards a lot, so we wanted them to be fun.\nWe also have some Kickstarter exclusives, including:\nYou can read about these two special perks in our update.\nHow This All Works\nFor many of you, this may be the first Kickstarter project you've backed. So here's a quick explanation of the process.\nKickstarter isn't a store, but you can think of it as a way to pre-order something that doesn't yet exist. \nWhen you pledge money, you pick which reward you want. For example, when you pledge $19, you get one Writer Emergency Pack.\nIf you pledge higher amounts, you can choose to get additional packs and other bonus stuff.\nOnce you've chosen, Kickstarter will send you to Amazon Payments, where they'll record your pledge. They don't bill you yet. They only charge you money at the end of the campaign, and only if we reach our funding goal ($9,000).\nYou can modify or cancel your pledge at any time until very close to the end of the campaign.\nOn the podcast, I've described Kickstarter as a way of bending the universe slightly. It's a way to make something happen that otherwise wouldn't. \nBy backing Writer Emergency Pack, you're causing these cards to exist. Thank you.\nKeep coming back for updates. You can also follow the project on Twitter @writeremergency and reach me @johnaugust", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPRODUCTION\n\nAll of the artwork and text is finished. We printed two runs of demo decks, which turned out great. We tested them with professional writers, students and teachers. The feedback has been terrific.\n\nDespite our best planning, problems may arise: printing delays, earthquakes, gamma ray bursts that knock civilization back to the Stone Age. But short of global catastrophe, we should be okay. We've built in contingencies for budget and schedule that should get us through.\n\nThere's a chance we won't reach our funding goal. That would be a bummer. We would reevaluate and figure out how to do this better.\n\nThere's the chance the response could be so large that we are overwhelmed with orders. If that happens, we'll figure out how to add staff or work with a fulfillment service to get these shipments out. (There's actually a card in WEP named \"Stack of Needles\" which is about exactly this curse of success.)\n\nBottom line: If stuff comes up, we'll fix it, and we will tell you. You're backing this project because you want to bend the universe in a slightly better way. You deserve to know the highlights and hiccups along the journey.\n\nSHIPPING\n\nOur company (Quote-Unquote Films) has shipped thousands of shirts and USB drives for the Scriptnotes podcast. We're good at it. \n\nWe've studied lots of other card-based Kickstarter projects to gather tips on fulfillment. Here are some things we've learned:\n\n-> We need good addresses.\n\nWhen funding concludes, we will be sending out a survey to get your mailing address. We plan to ship these in March, but it could be as early as mid-December. So PICK AN ADDRESS THAT WON'T CHANGE. If you're in college or moving a lot, that might mean sending it to your parents or a work address.\n\n-> International shipping is expensive.\n\nFor deck-based projects, current consensus seems to be that USPS is the best value, even overseas. But we wish it were cheaper. One suggestion: Buy in bulk. If you know several people who want decks, pool your money and buy at a higher tier (i.e. Elite Dolphin Squad or Ocean Rescue Task Force). That way, you'll only pay shipping once.\n\n-> Mistakes will happen.\n\nPackages will get lost or stolen or held in customs. One good thing about these decks is that we're making a lot of them.

The initial premise was What would Santa do for fun throughout the whole year with his legendary beard? I had plenty of sketches and situations, but in the end I chose to depict the more iconic celebrations throughout the year. In addition to Christmas Eve, I figured Santa would like to take part in those events as well.\nAfter a few people who saw the art commented: \"That would make a great poster. I want one!\" \nI thought Eureka! I could turn this into a poster! Unfortunately, the original art was only suitable for a 5\" x 7\" card, so I decided to recreate the whole design from scratch, this time in vector format and experimenting with some vintage-inspired techniques, like halftone patterns and old-school red/cyan anaglyph 3D.\nThis is the early version of \"Year of Beards\". While it was suitable for a postcard, it had to be recreated for a poster size print.\nThe NEW art has been completed for both the full color 18\" x 24\" (45cm x 61cm) version, as well as the 11\" x 17\"(28cm x 43cm)3D Kickstarter Backer Limited Edition. \nMy goal is to print both posters in a high quality thick, matte finish cover stock, but if we reach our backer stretch goal, I will be able to afford upgrading to an even better, more elegant paper.\nYear of Beards Poster, full size prototype details.\nThe same goes for the anaglyph 3D edition. Keep in mind, however, that I will only be able to afford printing and shipping the Anaglyph 3D Kickstarter Backer Limited Edition if we achieve the 200 Backers stretch goal. Every pledge over $25 ($40 for international backers) will receive both posters, with red/cyan anaglyph 3D glasses included!\nHere's where you all come in. I'm ready to send the files to the printer, and if you help me make this campaign a success, all I would have to do is upload the art and click the send button!\nOK, there's a little more than that. High quality printing \u2014and shipping, in particular\u2014 is not cheap. The process involves gathering shipping materials, packaging, organizing Kickstarter surveys, printing labels, adding extras, and above all, making sure each and every one of you correctly receives your rewards.\nFinally, there will be five special Patron of the Arts slots, who will receive a special 16\" x 20\" full color, wrapped canvas edition in addition to FIVE COPIES of all other rewards. \nStretch Goals\nWhile most campaigns have stretch goals based on reaching a specific monetary goal, I really want to get this poster to as many people as possible. On the other hand, I also don't want to send out a low quality product to a large amount of people, which would be the opposite of my intention.\nWith that said, here's the deal: I want to focus my stretch goals on the number of backers, rather than how much money has been raised. This will give me a clear idea of the demand and perhaps encourage you to share with friends and family.\nOnce we reach our initial goal, which will ensure basic high quality digital printing and shipping of the full color 18\" x 24\" Year of Beards poster, these will be my initial Stretch Goals:\n100 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Every backer will receive a Kickstarter Limited Edition Have Yourselfie a Merry Little Christmas bookmark (see image below).\n150 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Year of Beards will be printed on a thicker, nicer, more elegant paper using offset printing instead of digital.\n200 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Every backer will get Year of Beards 3D Kickstarter Backer Limited Edition with red/cyan 3D glasses included (see image below). \n250 Backers reached stretch goal:\n- Every backer gets my Swedish-inspired KRYSTM\u00c4S \u00c5ssembly Instrukti\u00f6ns poster (see image below).\nIf we succeed in passing that number of backers, who knows? Maybe we'll get even more awesome stretch goals ;-)\nThe Goodies\nPrototype art for new and refined version of Year of Beards poster, 18\" x 24\"(45 cm x 61cm).\nPrototype art for Year of Beards 3D Kickstarter Backers Limited Edition poster, 11\" x 17\" (28 cm x 43 cm).\nSwedish-inspired KRYSTM\u00c4S \u00c5ssembly Instrukti\u00f6ns poster, 17\" x 11\" (43 cm x 28 cm).\nHave Yourselfie A Merry Little Christmas card\nHave Yourselfie A Merry Little Christmas bookmark.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have done my fair share of printing both for personal as well as professional projects, and for the last four years I have worked with the same high quality, fully reliable print shop to ensure a consistent level of quality. Their turnarounds are quite expeditious, and for a small fee, which I'm more than willing to pay, I'm confident I can get both posters done relatively quickly. HOWEVER, if the right amount of posters isn't reached, the cost of offset printing might be excessive, and I may have no choice but to do a digital print instead. Rest assured, I'll still relentlessly aim for the highest possible paper quality, color accuracy and delivery time.\n\nFor this project, shipping on time would be the heart of the matter. I would love to get everyone your posters by Christmas or before the end of the year. However, due to the high volume of shipping during the holiday season, some of you, in particular international backers, may get your prints in January.\n\nPackage handling is another issue I've encountered, so I've chosen to use a hard cardboard tube with plastic caps. Your posters will be carefully rolled, wrapped, and placed in the tubes along with your potential goodies, like the 3D paper glasses, bookmarks or additional posters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Last one this year...", "update_content": "Dear backers, I believe this is it, at least for now.

Have you tried changing behind a flimsy towel, in a dirty public restroom, the backseat of a car, or worse?  Perhaps before or after a workout? We have the perfect solution for you. \nWith The Undress, you no longer have to resort to these potentially embarrassing and inconvenient methods of changing your clothes in public.\nThe Undress is more than just a dress, it's a SYSTEM that has many proprietary features to help you change clothes without ever getting naked.\n                      The Undress has a variety of features & benefits such as:\nHelping you change from one outfit to another without getting naked!\nIs self-packable so you can bring it anywhere, easily!\nYou can shorten the length of The Undress for wading in the water or walking in the sand!\nUse it as a car seat cover in seconds!\nWear as a dress - It's cute!\nIt's reversible! One side looks like a one-piece and the reverse side looks like a two-piece!\n                      The Undress is versatile and can serve the needs of many women, but most especially active women that train week to week, and change clothes in odd places.\nWomen on-the-go- You're busy.  And like Superman (or Superwoman), sometimes you just need to do a quick costume change. (Where did all the telephone booths go?!) \nRunners-  You run.  You run a lot.  You sweat a lot AND you still have to get back in your car after the workout.  If you're like most runners, you might need to drop by the grocery store on the way back home, or grab a drink with friends after the run.  Change out of your workout clothes easily with The Undress.\nTriathletes- You train 4-5 times a week.  And chances are, you train outdoors and are a master at the Dreaded \"Towel Tango.\"  Put The Undress in your gear bag and keep it there at all times.  It's especially handy after a Triathlon!\nBeach / Surfers - Why hike a mile back to the car or to the crusty public restroom when you can easily change clothes ON THE BEACH?  With The Undress- you can swap in and out of your bikini in a quick minute without any embarrassing slips. \nYogis-  Yoga in the park = divine.  Getting out of your $150 yoga pants in a hot parking lot with only a towel to cover you?  NOT so divine.  The Undress helps your day flow, flow, flow smoothly even after your workout\u2026\nCross Trainers-  If you're going to do 5 things in a day, do 5 workouts- not the 5 \"Dreaded Public No No's.\"  And when you're done smashing your workouts and need to swap outfits, The Undress has got you covered!  (Get it?)\nSports Teams - Your team can do a uniform swap \"on the field\" in minutes.  As a bonus, you could totally confuse the other team if you decided to do a uniform swap in the middle of the game.  Worth it.\nUse in Locker Rooms to stay discreet-  Just because you're in a locker room doesn't mean you HAVE to show everyone your \"good side\", does it?\nModels, Performers, and Actors- You are sometimes forced to change clothes without adequate facilities.  So take matters into your own hands and protect your assets by bringing The Undress to every gig around town and around the country. \nPhotographers / Videographers - You can have The Undress on stand-by as a courtesy to your models and actors.  Oh, we bet that the models are going to love The Undress so much, they might steal it. Don't say we didn't warn you!\nTravelers - You're backpacking through the country or over-seas and staying in hostels. You live for adventure but that's doesn't mean you have to change in front of complete strangers or on a crowded tour bus. Use The Undress to easily change outfits in seconds! \n   \nA fitted, soft & comfortable cotton Kickstarter exclusve t-shirt available in Women's XS-XL. Be a part of The Undress Founders Family, and wear it loud and proud!\n                      The Super Shawl is a perfect compliment to The Undress.

She continues to build ridiculously huge models out of little bricks. \nHogwart's Castle\nAt BrickCon 2012, Alice\u2019s Hogwarts took home both \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d and \u201cBest in Show\u201d \u2013 a rare combination that demonstrates not only how massive Hogwarts is (\u201cPeople\u2019s Choice,\u201d voted on by visitors during the public exhibition, invariably goes to the single biggest LEGO model in the exhibition hall) but also just how well-built and detailed it is (\u201cBest in Show\u201d is voted by all convention attendees).\nRIVENDELL\nAlice teamed up with David Frank to recreate Rivendell, one of the iconic locations in Middle-earth,\u201cthe last homely house west of the mountains,\u201d where Elrond hosts both Bilbo and his dwarven companions in The Hobbit and Frodo and the Fellowship in The Lord of the Rings.\nThe World of Mouse Guard - Emerald City ComicCon - Seattle 2015\n  ArchLUG is a LEGO User Group based out of Western Washington, whose members share a love for LEGO, especially as it pertains to creating MOCs (\"My Own Creations\") focused on landscapes and world architecture, historic, modern, or futuristic. Their goal is to foster relationships with other AFOLs (\"Adult Fans of LEGO\") who share their same passion for building, and also to inspire those around them to appreciate the endless possibilities that LEGO provides as a medium to create and replicate both original and existing structures from around the world. After a successful group display of Laketown from the Hobbit, ArchLUG will be building a collaborative display for Emerald City Comic Con in March 2015 of the World of Mouse Guard. \nArchLUG is excited about the many interesting settings, stories and adventures that they will be able to create using the heads, accessories and capes developed for Bricks of the Mouse Guard!\nHOW DO YOU MAKE AWESOME STUFF LIKE THIS?\nThese high-quality injection-molded collectibles are fully licensed from the author-illustrator David Petersen and are ready to add fun to your favorite brick characters.   They fit your favorite miniature figures like LEGO\u00ae, Kre-O\u00ae, Kubrick\u00ae, Character Building\u00ae, Si-Dan\u00ae and Friends\u00ae.\nA long process of digital sculpture in various CAD and art programs is done to create the initial art. Many weeks of refining and direction are used to find the perfect balance of aesthetics and engineering. Real-world prototypes are created from these digital art files and these are then evaluated to make sure they are going to fit the proportions and style of the figure. It takes a long time but it is well worth the wait!\nWhat remains is to finance the expensive process of machining the steel injection-mold tooling followed by the tuning of the production process to create the actual parts via injection-molded plastic. This is the same high-quality ABS material and colors used by LEGO\u00ae and other popular brick products.\n THE CRATE OF THE MATRIARCH!\n BrickArms ( www.brickarms.com ) is the #1 provider of custom weapons and parts for your favorite brick figures.\nThey have created these amazing minifig-scaled crates and, as part of your pledge offering, you can get one of these special custom-printed Crates of the Matriarch only available through Kickstarter. The Munchkin Bricks, Pigs VS Cows and SKULLS Crates have already become sought-after collectibles. The final design for the Mouse Guard crate is still an ongoing work-in-progress with David Petersen.\n At CrazyBricks, we love Kickstarter!\nWhat better way to reach the fans of our favorite Graphic Novels and custom brick accessories and bring them all together!\nBricks of the Mouse Guard will be featured in the Emerald City ComicCon display in March but we want YOU to have a set too!

You can still make a pledge now, even if it's just a $1, to get all the updates. The re-launch is pending approval from the Kickstarter managers. With this new lower goal we should make our goal so jump on board now to take advantage of the new offers. There will be new rewards and the first 1000 backers get 6 packets of Free Seasonings.\nWelcome to the PopcornBall Kickstarter page. If you are not familiar with how Kickstarter works, it is an \"all or nothing\" fundraising campaign. If the pledges do NOT exceed the funding goal, you will NOT be charged. If the goal is reached you will be charged when the campaign ends.\nMy name is Mike Baxter and I am the inventor of the PopcornBall. The PopcornBall idea originated when I was rolling a ball with my daughter (see \"gift for kids\" photo below) when she was just 18 months old.  In order to make the PopcornBall a real product we need your donations and your help sharing our Kickstarter with your friends and family. I appreciate you looking at my Kickstarter and my family and I greatly thank YOU for your donations!\nJoin the PopcornBall Club. See details at bottom of page.\nThe PopcornBall is a 7.5inch sphere container for mixing\nIt can hold up to 120oz or 15 cups of popcorn, a little less if used for mixing purposes. A typical bag of microwave popcorn is 10 cups. Most small movie popcorns are between 6 to 11 cups.\nWhy do we need $50,000? The money will go towards the expensive plastic injection mold tooling for manufacturing.\nUPDATE: The digital 4x6 Christmas card that comes with every reward level can be used as a $5 off coupon on our website when that launches after the Kickstarter. Valid one coupon per Backer. It will never expire. So, if it's a dollar or $100 you get the Christmas card.\nFEATURED ON:\nFox17 Morning News Grand Rapids, MI.

Current ice cream scoops are designed in a way that forces you to use weak wrist joints to scoop ice cream. When you are scooping ice cream with standard ice cream scoops, you are doing a prying motion. This prying motion puts tremendous amounts of stress on your weak wrist joints. Your brain then tries to save your wrists by not letting you pry very hard--thus making scooping ice cream very difficult.\nThe Design\nThrough an engineer's understanding of ergonomic design and mechanical force, I came up with a design that protects the wrist when the Midnight Scoop is held. If you're using the Midnight Scoop properly, you're not using the small weak muscles located inside the wrist. Instead, you hold the curved end with the palm of your hand and \"push\" into the ice cream. This allows you to keep your wrists straight and protected while you use large muscles like your arms and chest \u2013 which are significantly stronger than your wrist. This \u2013 to me \u2013 is how to scoop ice cream properly.\nThe Midnight Scoop protecting your wrist from strain\nThe Facts\nHot-Forged From Solid 6061 Aluminum\nMultiple Industrial-Strength Coatings\nErgonomic Design\nLaser Engraved Logo\nPatent Pending!\nSolid Aluminum - This is Bomb-Proof!\nThe Handle\nThe magic is in the handle. The ergonomically shaped curved of the handle lets you push the Midnight Scoop with your palms. Your wrist are kept straight and protected. The handle is also long enough to help you reach all parts of a giant container of ice cream yet narrow enough to fit inside small pint size containers just as well. The Midnight Scoop works exceptionally well with hard-frozen ice cream. No more waiting to thaw \u2013 no more bending spoons \u2013 and no more hurting yourself. \nThe Scoop\nThe front scoop section is thin enough to cut through ice cream like butter, and thick enough to last. The base of the scoop design forces ice cream to curl into that appealing ice-cream-advertisement look, every time. \nThe Midnight Scoop's Advantage\nSure, there are heated ice cream scoops out there. However, who wants melted ice cream? The Midnight Scoop allows you to serve the coldest/hardness ice cream. Don't let your brain tell you not to scoop harder because it is afraid to hurt your wrists. Scoop through hard ice cream easily and correctly by using the beautiful, Midnight Scoop!\nAbout Midnight Scoop, Inc.\nOur company is built on the same principles as the Midnight Scoop \u2013 start with the right components, and build something to last. We are a close, tight-knit group that all share the same dream. We are based in South Lyon, MI \u2013 about an hour west of Detroit. At no point was this handed to a world-class design firm with thousands of products that look slightly different. It's a homegrown grass-roots dream.\nLook Who's Been Talking About Us.. \nCall to Action\nKickstarter, between our video and the description above, you should have a pretty good idea on what we have to offer, and where we are with our project. This Kickstarter campaign will allow us to move forward with production tooling and packaging, with expected delivery (barring significant hiccups) slated for the end of December 2014 (before Christmas!--great gift idea!)\nAll we need now is you. If you want to see this purpose-driven and quality-focused project and company get off the ground, become a backer of Midnight Scoop! \nProduction Colors - Natural, Ebony, Graphite, Moonstone\nColors Shown: Natural, Ebony (black), Graphite, Moonstone (white)\n  The Pledges\nOur pledges are fairly self-explanatory. The early adopter specials have the best prices \u2013 and limited quantities. We have complete packages (all four colors) available in both early adopter special and standard Kickstarter pricing. No-one will ever get a Midnight Scoop for the price we are offering right now! Once our backers have all had their Midnight Scoops delivered, we will open our e-commerce store, selling each scoop for $50. We have plans for expanding our product line, but right now the Midnight Scoop is the one and only thing on our radar!\nAnd that one and only thing is GORGEOUS!\nPushes through any container of ice cream easily\nWhen something is designed right, it just looks right\nLimited Edition - Gold\nLimited Edition - Pink\nLimited Edition color - This is the color of the exclusive Kickstarter-Green Edition\nPlease share this project with your friends and families \u2013 anyone who may be interested in a better way to scoop ice cream.
