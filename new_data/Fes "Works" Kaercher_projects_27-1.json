Featuring 100% new questions never seen on the show before!\nUm, Actually presents you with statements about the fictional worlds of popular movies, TV shows and books. They all sound right... but listen carefully, because each one has a mistake hidden in it somewhere! It's your job to figure out what's wrong and announce it before anyone else, starting, of course, with the magic phrase: \"Um, actually...\" \nBut even if you know nothing about Sailor Moon or Star Wars, you'll find yourself making wild guesses, stumbling into answers, and having laughs along the way!\nCheck out this episode to see how a game goes down:\n\nWe\u2019ve got lots of exciting stuff planned for this campaign! \nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019re going to be building a custom deck of questions with input from you, the backers, so don't forget to GET IN THE COMMENTS! We\u2019re calling it the Community Deck, and it will be included in every copy of the Community and Deluxe Editions of the game.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can look forward to in the coming weeks:\nThese weekly polls will pit card ideas against each other and call on you to vote on which one you would rather see in the Community Deck. Would you rather have John Woo or John Wick? Cloverfield or Garfield? Each week we'll do an update with a link to a poll where you can make your voice heard. Sweet democracy in action!\nEach week, we\u2019ll issue challenges that will allow you to offer your support for one of two categories you\u2019d like to see in the Community Deck. You might be asked to act something out, take a crazy photo, or even cobble together a quick cosplay outfit. Check in each Wednesday to learn about that week\u2019s challenge, then get creative and post your efforts on social media!\nWe\u2019ll be announcing a new engagement piece every Friday, each one designed to test your knowledge of all things nerdy! From getting in the game, to scoring some swag, engage with your fellow nerds and get rewarded for it. \nWe can\u2019t wait to see what you guys come up with!\nNot convinced by our fancy graphics and flashy video? Well, we asked our friends to say nice things about the game... so let's hear what they think!\nPLAY\n\nNot familiar with the show? Watch some clips and full episodes below!\nYou can watch every episode of Um, Actually - along with exclusive series like Dimension 20 and Game Changer on CollegeHumor's streaming service, Dropout.tv. You can also watch a number of classic free episodes on the Um, Actually YouTube channel.\n\n\nIf you're one of the awesome folks who backed a previous Wiggles 3D Kickstarter project, such as 5-Minute Dungeon or 5-Minute Mystery, we'd like to express our heartfelt thanks.\nThanks. No, really. Thanks so much for supporting us!\nAnd as another way of expressing our gratitude, we'd like to offer each and every one of you a free 2-month subscription to Dropout and a CA$ 5 credit, which can be applied against shipping charges or add-ons in the pledge manager after the campaign!\nDropout is College Humor\u2019s premier content streaming service, with lots of great shows like Dimension 20, Game Changer, and of course, Um, Actually!\nYou'll be able to claim this gift at the end of the campaign, when you complete your backer survey.\nLimit one per returning backer.\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over as part of your backer survey in BackerKit. \nWe will be shipping from depots in the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, China, and Australia. We'll choose the nearest depot to you to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes. Shipping to countries other than the ones where we have depots may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before placing an order. \nEuropean and UK VAT and Canadian HST are included in the shipping charges given below. \nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address. We cannot split pledges to ship to multiple addresses.\nActual shipping costs are higher than our charged rates. We subsidize shipping to keep rates affordable for backers.\n\nCurrency Conversions\nRemember that your pledge is in Canadian Dollars, and your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars when the campaign ends. Currency exchange rates change regularly. Look at your local currency exchange rate toward the end of the campaign for the most current price.\nOnce again, we'll be partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information.\nAfter the campaign ends, we'll send you a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. You'll have the opportunity to add more copies of the game... at the same price as during the Kickstarter.\nIf you operate a game store and think that your customers would love Um, Actually, we'd love to hear from you!

Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

There is a better alternative, however: DoubleSix Dice, which are 12-sided dice numbered 1-6 twice. They feel better in your hand, and provide a more satisfying roll.    \n ---\nWhat is new for this campaign? For this Generation Two Kickstarter campaign, it is time to make them in brand new materials and effects.\nWhat are the new materials/effects? Glitter, Translucent, Smoke, Double-Smoke, and Frosted.\nWhat specific colors and materials/effects are planned? Like with the original Kickstarter for Generation One, you backers are helping me decide which new colors and materials/effects will ultimately be produced during the campaign, and this page will be updated regularly with the dice slated to be produced.  \nSo far, below are the DoubleSix varieties intended for production, and will be available as 4-packs, and some will be included in mixed 4-packs (TBD).  Everything in Bold Type is final. \nRemember, you can cancel your pledge at any time after the campaign for a full refund if you are not satisfied (no questions asked) with the all the final choices and production samples.   \nWhat are the Stretch Goals? A new stretch goal will be unlocked every $10K (update: and then every $5K after $100K).  We can also unlock dice in Gen One materials (glossy, flat, and marble), depending on interest and demand. \nWhy the TBDs (to be determined)?  As we want to work together to make the most thoughtful decisions on what to actually produce, it will take some time. This is potentially frustrating, I know, but we need to see how some of the samples actually look (they are currently being made), and explore and curate all the possibilities.\nWhat Designs? We will be producing these in the classic DoublesSix pipped design, as well as three TripleFour design (The Jazzy Bear, The Monty, and The Otaku).  No new designs (ie. molds) nor DoubleFudges are planned for this campaign, but will be considered for Generation Three. \nAdd-ons: All dice produced (and pictured), including unlocked stretch goal varieties and mixed-packs (TBD), will be available in 4-packs for $4 each pack in the pledge manager. \nWhy so expensive? As with Generation One, these dice will be made with resin, and are hand-poured into silicone molds in small batches, making them cost about twice as much to produce as the standard acrylic dice out on the market.  This method is to allow for more pronounced pip-depth and contrast, and is why they have been selling at a cost of about $1.50-$1.75 per die at the online store, www.Doublesixdice.com (and most have since sold out over the past couple of years, with zero marketing).\nWhat kind of deal can I get with this campaign? The upcoming Gen Two dice and their new materials/effects will cost up to about 40% more to produce than Gen One, but I still plan to offer these new ones to you backers at about half off the MSRP of the Gen One dice. \nThe average sale price of Gen One on the online store was about $1.60 per die. Here is what you will get for the various reward tiers:\nSmall Bag O' DoubleSix Dice: Black dice bag, 12 dice, at $0.92 per die\nLarge Bag O' DoubleSix Dice: Black dice bag, and 20 dice, at $0.85 per die.\nThe 1723: Black dice bag, and 28 dice, at $0.82 per die.\nBulk: Black dice bag, white dice bag, and 52 Dice, at $0.79 per die (Note: bags aren't mentioned in the margin reward tiers as Kickstarter does not allow those to be edited). \nSize and weight: As with Generation One, each die is approximately 17 mm face-to-face, and weighs 0.15 oz.\nBags will also be available as $1 add-ons in the pledge-manager.\n---\nHistory: \nFor the Generation One Kickstarter campaign, 6,916 backers pledged $133,495, and posted over 8,000 comments (not including those in the 78 updates) to help develop all the various types of dice: 5 designs and a total of 23 color combinations, in 3 different effects (glossy, flat, and marble).\nOf those 5 designs, three were different TripleFours designs (backers wanted to stop rolling pyramidal d4s, so they fought for the production of 12-sided dice numbered 1-4 thrice, and I finally agreed).  Backers also lobbied for us to make 12-sided Fudge/Fate, as well.\n ---\nReception: The final products were met with overwhelmingly positive reviews, including Tom Vasel (The Dice Tower) saying \"...they're amazing.\" \n ---\nProduction: We will continue to use Longbright, and they are ready to go. We will also improve upon the quality of Gen One by:\n1) Drastically limiting the number of times a silicone mold is reused (about 50 times maximum).  This will eliminate the slight warping found with some of the Gen One dice. \n2) Standardizing the polishing time, so dice shape and edges will be more consistent across the board.\nProduction time: Longbright is quoting 30-40 days for production (for a max of 200K dice), and adding 10 more days per 100,000 additional dice produced. \nHere is some video of the production process (the first stage is filmed with the dreaded cube, but the rest are of DoubleSix Dice):  \n---\nSatisfaction guaranteed (full refund given for any unsatisfactory dice). \n---\nShipping costs: For most tiers, shipping will be +$4 for the US, +$10 for Canada, and +$14 for the Rest of the World (this is based on current US Postal Service rates).  If you order add-ons, once you hit 9 oz (about 50 dice), the rates go to +$5 US, +$17 Canada, and +$23 Rest of the World.\nFor the Bulk tier, shipping will be +$5 US, +$17 Canada, and +$23 Rest of the World (with unlimited add-ons for no additional shipping costs).\nSince I am not warehousing in, or shipping out of, the EU (too many different dice), this campaign is not considered EU-friendly.  However, I do plan to declare the package content's value at what it costs to produce, not what you pledged.  \n---\nAnd finally, if you are on the fence, I leave you with a wildly entertaining review of Generation One by The Component Proponent.\nLet's roll,\nMatt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks: \n\n1) Importing from China: we have done it before, but I don't know how new tariffs or trade complications might impact things (slow things down a bit, eat into my profits).\n\n2) Collaboration: might lead to frustrations. I crowdsource a lot of the development from you guys, so your choices and suggestions might be voted down by others or even myself. I will do my best to balance being fair and considering what might be best for the brand and the business. \n\n3) Addiction: obtaining and owning these dice can be habit forming, and the urge to collect and hoard them might negatively impact your financial health and friendships. We can look into organizing and promoting support groups in your area. \n\n4) Paradigm shifting: using this product might promote a more revolutionary mindset, encouraging you to rethink all old habits and outdated programming. Though this might benefit your personal and spiritual growth, your friends and family might become concerned and annoyed. If this occurs, the recommendation is to buy them a bunch of Doublesixes, and then wait patiently for them to come around.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Patron", "descp": "Support the movement, get updates, and join in the conversation.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 11 or more", "title": "Small Bag O' DoubleSix Dice", "descp": "A DoubleSix Dice bag filled with 12 dice.\nINCLUDES:\nOne Black Satin DoubleSix Dice Bag\nThree 4-packs of your choice\nShipping costs to be added (+$4 US, +$10 Canada, +$14 Rest)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["970 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "Large Bag O' DoubleSix Dice", "descp": "A DoubleSix Dice bag filled with 20 dice.\nINCLUDES:\nOne Black Satin DoubleSix Dice Bag\nFive 4-packs of your choice.\nShipping costs to be added (+$4 US, +$10 Canada, +$14 Rest)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["742 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 23 or more", "title": "The 1723", "descp": "Limited: A DoubleSix Dice bag filled with 28 dice.\nINCLUDES:\nOne Black Satin DoubleSix Dice Bag\nSeven 4-packs of your choice\nShipping costs to be added (+$4 US, +$10 Canada, +$14 Rest)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,691 backers", "Limited (32 left of 1723)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 41 or more", "title": "Bulk", "descp": "52 dice.

While fans of the comic will love seeing these characters brought to life, we're hoping to reach a new, wider audience, as well. Fans of Community, The Office, and Clerks will all find something to love in the Multiplex 10 Cinemas.\nBecky and Melissa (not final art)\nMultiplex 10 will appeal to movie lovers, anyone who's ever worked a retail job, and anyone who's had an annoying friend who just can't shut up about why the things you like are terrible. While the short will stand on its own, we're hoping it can also serve as a pilot for full series.\nBut we can\u2019t make this first episode without YOU!\nEven long-time Multiplex fans may not know that \u2014 way before the comic strip began in 2005 \u2014 it was originally conceived as an animated short. But at that time, Gordon didn't have the resources to make it happen, so instead it evolved into a comic strip.\nNow, with thanks to crowdfunding and a few years of 2D animation experience (storyboarding, designing, as well as final animation), he's thrilled with the idea of bringing the concept (and the characters) full-circle in Multiplex 10.\nWatch \u201cMultiplex: The Chosen One,\u201d a student film by Gordon, to get a (very) rough feel for the tone of the Multiplex 10 project.\nWe\u2019re also creating all-new Multiplex 10 comic strips leading up to events in the first episode, which will be featured on the Multiplex 10 website and the Kickstarter project updates.\n The team (so far) for the Multiplex 10 pilot includes:\nGordon McAlpin is the Executive Producer, director, lead animator, and co-writer on Multiplex 10. He\u2019ll also be voicing Jason. He wrote and illustrated Multiplex from July 2005 through April 2017 and has produced three Kickstarter-funded Multiplex collections. Beyond comics, he is a freelance writer, designer, illustrator, and animator; you can see some of his earlier video and animation work on his portfolio site. \nDana Luery Shaw is a Producer for Multiplex 10 and co-wrote the script. She has dreamed of making animation since she was a kid, and she has successfully tricked Gordon into making her dream a reality. She is currently the co-executive producer of digital series Personal Space; she also created the indie ARG The Wall Will Fall, and wrote for the webseries Echo Chamber and Classic Alice.\nJoe Dunn is a Co-Producer on Multiplex 10 and will be voicing Curtis from Flickhead Video. He is a graphic artist living and working in the New York City area. He loves watching movies and drawing. He tries to do both non-stop. You may know his work from Joe Loves Crappy Movies or some other terribly-titled webcomic. Check out @joerules on Instagram and @joedunn721 on Twitter to keep up to date with his current nonsense.\nTom Brazelton is a Co-Producer for Multiplex 10 and will lend his voice to Kurt. He is the former artist/writer of the movie-themed comic Theater Hopper. He still enjoys writing and drawing, and he still likes movies (although, these days, it\u2019s a lot more Pixar and a lot less Jim Jarmusch). Eventually, he\u2019s going to get back in the game and publish some journal comics. Until then, follow @tombrazelton on Twitter, where he obnoxiously live-tweets SNL, and @tombrazelton on Instagram, where he uploads pictures of sunsets.\nChris Rager is a professional voice actor, perhaps best known for his roles as Hercule/Mr. Satan on Dragonball Z and Mr. Torgue in Borderlands 2. He\u2019ll be lending his mahogany tones to The Blogger.\nAiyanna Wade will be voicing Becky, the shy science nerd at the Multiplex 10. Her more recent work includes YouTube Channel Awesome's Nostalgia Critic and cohost of the Awesome Comics podcast. She currently works on stage in Chicago and lives with her other half Jake and kitten Gideon.\nJavier Prusky was born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay. After relocating to Atlanta, he trained at The Company Acting Studio in Atlanta for three years. He graduated from Syracuse University with a BFA in Acting in 2016. He has also attended master clown Philippe Gaulier\u2019s  at school in \u00c9tampes, France; studied Shakespeare at The Globe Theatre in London, UK; and studied On-Camera Technique at The Actor\u2019s Space in Barcelona, Spain. He splits his time between Atlanta, New York City, and LA. Beyond acting, Javier enjoys anything involving nature and family. Whether it be hiking, SCUBA Diving, or rappelling, he feels at home with nature. His family, especially his mom, mean everything to him. In Multiplex 10, Javier Prusky will play Neil, a young manager at the theater.\nTangelene Bolton is a film composer in Los Angeles known for her powerful and distinctive melodies.  Upon moving to Los Angeles, she had the amazing opportunity to work for Remote Control Productions (Hans Zimmer) and now continues to work on projects in the realm of film, TV, and video games. She most recently worked on Rise of the Tomb Raider (Crystal Dynamics), Girlfriend\u2019s Day (Netflix), and Jem and the Holograms (Universal). Tangelene's goal as a composer is to create an experience that lingers in the subconscious of the viewer, impacting and shaping their experience. You can listen to some of her work at Tangelene\u2019s professional website and on SoundCloud.\nIan Vargo\u2019s sound design has been heard on nationally-televised ad campaigns, award-winning short films, and viral web content. Most recently, he has worked with the Los Angeles directing team \u201cCousins,\u201d whose videos have amassed over 30 million views on the internet. He\u2019s also a music producer, mix and mastering engineer, and a multi-intrumentalist musician. Ian also teaches Audio Production at The Art Institute of California. He enjoys binge watching television while sitting on the couch with his wife Erin, Italian Greyhound Luigi, and fluffy cat Babycita. You can see some of his work on Ian\u2019s professional website.\nAdditional cast will be announced in the coming weeks! Depending on the final budget, we\u2019ll be able to hire additional animators, visual development artists, voice actors, and more. We will put out a casting call to fill some of the remaining roles shortly after the project is successfully funded.\nAnimation is an expensive and time consuming process.\nThe $15,000 goal we're asking for, minus approximately $2,750 for payment processing and Kickstarter fees \u2014 amounts to a little over $1,200 per minute for design, animation, voice acting, sound, music and distribution, which is extremely low-budget for animation.\nBut of course we want it to look and sound as good as it can!\nAt $20,000, we\u2019ll be able to do a few extra things:\nSmoother, 4K animation\n5.1 Surround Sound mix\nTheatrical premiere at the Somerville Theatre here in Somerville, MA. (All backers at the Special Thanks level and up will have free admission, though you will need to RSVP\u2026 and, of course, transportation is not provided.)\nA Multiplex 10 comic book collecting the Multiplex 10 story comics (including as-yet-unpublished material) PLUS new material, reformatted into a single, continuous comic book \u2014 free to all $25+ backers.\nAnd we'll have a bigger distribution and promotion budget to submit the film to film festivals and/or digital distribution platforms like Amazon Prime, iTunes, etc.\nThe screenplay is already written (aside from a few movie references we\u2019ll update as close as possible to release, to keep them timely), and most of the characters have already been designed (as you can see in the project video). Pre-production can begin in earnest as soon as the project passes its goal.\nStoryboarding, visual development, and the rest of the design work will take two to three weeks. (The backgrounds seen here and in the pitch video are from the comic strip.) Once the storyboards are complete, we'll make an animatic, editing together the boards (with some rough animation) and adding temp sound and dialogue.\nKurt and Jason get philosophical (not final art)\nOver the course of six to eight weeks (approximately), we'll slowly replace the storyboards with finished artwork, sound, and dialogue, fine-tuning the edit along the way, before doing the final, polished animation in sync with the dialogue. Depending on the final budget, we'll be able to bring in other animators to help make the animation more fluid.\nNext, we'll lock down the edit, let the composer work her magic, and do a final mix. This step will take a few weeks.\nFinally, we'll master the final video files and release the short to the backers here on Kickstarter! With a projected release of September 2017, the four month production schedule should be plenty of time to complete the project.\nWe'll be exploring various distribution channels for the completed short and avenues for funding a full season, so it will NOT be immediately available for free streaming.\nBackers can support the short and get \u2014 of course \u2014 desktop and mobile wallpapers, PDFs of the \"shooting script\" and the storyboards, DRM-free digital files of the rough animatics and the finished short, hand-drawn sketches, appearances as background characters or other non-speaking roles, and even producer credits!\nAt the $100 level, The Art of Multiplex 10 ebooklet will include concept sketches, promotional art, and all of the Multiplex 10 comics leading up to the first episode in a high res, vector-friendly (where possible) PDF format.\nThree vector portraits (your appearance in the short will likely be slightly simplified to fit the design of the animation)\n  Some sketches by Gordon McAlpin\nYou can see the various reward levels along the right side of this page, but here's a handy breakdown of the various rewards:\nBe sure to read our project updates for more information!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGordon has previousy run and fulfilled two successful Kickstarter projects, and I'm in the process of fulfilling a third, for the third Multiplex print collection. That print run is currently in transit from the printer and should be arriving in (approximately) mid-May, so shipping the rewards may overlap with the production of the short (assuming this project is successfully funded).\n\nCreatively speaking, this will be Gordon's longest, animated narrative short \u2014 so that will undoubtedy present some challenges. But, based on his experience with writing, designing, storyboarding, and animating several animation projects (not to mention the last twelve years of working on the Multiplex comic strip), he is up for that challenge.\n\nWe have a very strong script already written, and a generous time frame to produce the animation in order to meet the projected September release. That said, filmmaking is an organic process, and hiccups will undoubtedly arise.\n\nAs with all of the Multiplex book Kickstarter projects, backers will be kept informed about our progress with frequent updates, so you'll know if and when there are any unforeseen problems \u2014 and how we\u2019ll solve them. But the funds raised by this Kickstarter project will give us the resources to complete this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "EARLY ACCESS", "descp": "Access to three digital and mobile wallpapers, access to a private online stream of the finished film (at least) one week before its digital release, and access to the behind-the-scenes updates here on Kickstarter!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "DIGITAL DOWNLOAD", "descp": "Get a DRM-free 1080p MP4 of the finished short \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["181 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "SPECIAL THANKS", "descp": "See your name in the credits under a \"Special Thanks\" section \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["128 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "SCREENPLAY", "descp": "Get a PDF of the script once the short is complete (no spoilers!) \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "STORYBOARDS", "descp": "Get a PDF of the storyboards after the short is complete \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "DIGITAL POSTER + SOUNDTRACK", "descp": "Get a digital poster (PDF) featuring the Multiplex 10 gang AND soundtrack MP3(s?) of Tangelene Bolton\u2019s original score \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "THE ART OF MULTIPLEX 10", "descp": "Get a PDF booklet (with exclusive commentary!) of concept drawings, character designs, promotional art, and more from/for the short \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "DIGITAL PRODUCER", "descp": "You will be credited as an Digital Producer in the end credits for the short \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "THE TRIPLE FEATURE (SKETCHES)", "descp": "Get an original 6\"x8\" drawing from Gordon McAlpin, Tom Brazelton, OR Joe Dunn (your choice!) \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "(NOT QUITE A) MOVIE POSTER", "descp": "A 24\"x36\" printed copy of the Multiplex 10 poster (shipped folded) \u2014 PLUS all the lower level rewards!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 600 or more", "title": "BACKGROUND EXTRAS", "descp": "Look for yourself in the background as an extra.
