Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur unfulfilled projects are moving along according to schedule.

Each player picks an element and the Town is formed from the combination of those elements.\nDraft rules for Town creation (Click for larger version).\nThen, two maps of the Town are drawn: the Town Then and the Town Now. These represent the Town  during different time periods, as the characters remember them.\nEach player creates a character, choosing to either be one who Returned or Remained. Each character provides a different lens to explore the Town and their own relationship to change.\n Returned characters left the Town Then and have just recently returned to the Town. They are slightly more focused on their own concerns and how the Town's changes reflect on their own feelings and growth.\n Remained characters have stayed in Town throughout that time. They are slightly more focused on community concerns and how their actions and experiences are reflected in the Town's changes.\nDraft rules for character creation (Click for larger version).\nPlayers then use prompts to expand the Town and fill it with locations, residents, traditions and events. Players can then explore the connections between their characters to the Town and to each other and how that has changed over time.\nDraft rules for play actions (Click for larger version).\nAs players explore the Town and the relationships between the characters, you will update the maps of the Town Then and the Town Now as you go. \nYou also create and update a Relationship Map between the characters and the different aspects of the Town, as well as write down your asked and answered questions on the map as part of the River. At the end of every game, your map will become an artifact of the game you just played.\nExample Town maps from playtests (Click to learn more about the playtest games).\nYou can also pick up a  demo of the game on itch.io here and by clicking the banner below:\nLink to the demo available on itch.io.\n\nWhy do I want to make this?\nI made a first draft of An Altogether Different River in June 2020 as part of my Game a Month 2020 project. However, it had its start way earlier back in 2019. \nI originally conceived of An Altogether Different River as a part of Homebound, an anthology zine that I produced in 2019 with the help of Vee Hendro and Cecile Richard. Homebound was a significant personal project that collected games about home and going away made in the context of my move back to Malaysia after 14 years living in Melbourne, Australia. I gave copies away as a farewell gift to some friends, and also made a version of it available online on itch.io.\nHomebound anthology zine.\nI didn't end up including An Altogether Different River in the zine as I couldn't finish designing the game before I had to move, but I've always considered it as a sort of coda or successor to Homebound. If Homebound was about grappling with my feelings about moving away from a home I had made, An Altogether Different River is about grappling with my uncertainties of returning to a home that I know would be much changed.\nI thought I would be able to finish the game quickly and it would be a poetic first game to complete after moving back. Things don't always go the way you think they will.\nAnyway, it's almost done now. I've been doing a bunch of playtests in the lead up to this campaign and I am happy with how the game is coming along. I am proud to have this game be my first foray into crowdfunding, because I think it's a pretty good representation of what I want to and can make. I hope it might bring you some enjoyment too.\n\nWhat can you get?\nReward tiers for An Altogether Different River.\nAll tiers will get you access to the draft rules as they stand right now so you can get playing straight away. \nThe Digital Zine tier (AUD8/about USD6.20) will get you the final PDF delivered via itch.io. \nThe Physical Zine tier (AUD15/about USD11.60) will get you an A5 staple-bound black and white booklet. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nI have also included the option to get digital PDFs of the Homebound zine at a discounted price. As mentioned above, Homebound is a zine I made in 2019 that collects three games on the theme of \"home\" and \"going away\":\n How to Say Goodbye - A microgame about collectively visiting important places and people to say farewell to them and leave pieces of your heart behind.\n Ithaca in the Cards - A blackjack-driven GM-less/GM-lite storytelling game about doomed travelers on a perilous journey home.\n Far From Home - A belonging outside belonging game about immigrants exploring what it means to live and thrive in a culture that is not fully your own.\nHomebound games.\nThe Digital Homebound Combo tier (AUD16/about USD12.40) will get you the final PDF delivered via itch.io, plus the PDF of Homebound.\nThe Physical and Digital Homebound Combo tier (AUD23/about USD17.80) will get you an A5 staple-bound black and white booklet, plus the PDF of Homebound. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nReward tiers for An Altogether Different River and Homebound.\nUPDATE:\nYou can now also get physical versions of both zines and just pay the same shipping!\nThe Physical Zines Homebound Combo tier (AUD30/about USD23.70) will get you both An Altogether Different River and Homebound as A5 staple-bound black and white booklets, plus PDF versions of both. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nNew pledge tier to get physical copies of both An Altogether Different River and Homebound zines.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to pay for additional illustrations to fill out the zine and also to finalize the layout for digital and print.  The rules are close to final, but I will continue playtesting and refining the game at least until the end of March (backers are very welcome to come join me in playtests). I am also planning to flesh out the introduction, safety and expectations, play advice and some game seeds to get players started quickly. The expected page count for the final zine is about 24-32 pages.\nIllustrations in progress.\nThe digital PDF version will be in full-colour and grayscale. The layout is already being drafted and additional illustrations are underway. I am aiming for release of the final digital version at the end of May 2021:\nFebruary - March 2021: Playtesting and revisions/writing, illustrations underway\nApril 2021: Complete editing and finalise fully illustrated layout\nMay 2021: Review final document for digital release + Contingency\nOnce the digital files are completed, the physical zine will be printed in black and white in A5 staple-bound format. I've allowed for significant time to finalise the document for print and for international shipping.\nMay 2021: Review final document for print + Send to print \nJune 2021: Printing and proofing, commence shipping\nJuly - September 2021: Allow 3 months for shipping + Contingency\nTimeline to produce Kickstarter rewards.\nWho's involved?\nAaron Lim is a designer of tabletop games currently based in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, and previously in Melbourne, Australia. His work ranges from board and card games to story games and tabletop RPGs. Most of his work is self-published at ehronlime.itch.io.\n\nVenessa Tang is an illustrator and concept artist based in Malaysia., creating visual developments and storyboard illustrations.

I've tried to build in sufficient time and cost contingencies, but this is the factor that is hardest for me to control. Depending on the scale of the project, I've bookmarked several options that might help to alleviate some of that risk (partnering with other zine stores etc for distribution) but it really depends on the final breakdown of project backers.\n\nMost of the layout and artwork is already underway, so I don't foresee significant delays there. I am continuing to playtest and refine the game, which may result in changes down the line. However I don't foresee any issues hitting the digital version deadline though it may impact the delivery of the physical zines.

The winner's spell goes through, and the losers is cancelled out.\nThere are 30 unique signature spells which players use to customize their hand.\nSignature spells provide a multitude of ways to play mind games on your foes, or strategize with friends.\nYour signature spells are unique to you, and you may only have 3.

Goblin Hunters is a fast paced push-your-luck style card game combined with set collection and a betting mechanic for 2 to 4 players and is played within 10 to 15 minutes. The Goblin Hunters base game comes with 4 different character cards to choose from, and more will be added as stretch goals are reached.

The aim of the game is to collect as many goblins as possible without taking too many wounds, while also trying to collect sets of goblins to gain extra bonuses.\n\nThis is not the only way to score bonus points, you can also bet on the results of the other adventurers, risking your hard earned goblin points for more bonus goblin points. It's a high risk with high rewards. So the next time you're in the tavern healing from your wounds and mouthing off about who is best Goblin Hunter, make sure you can put your money where your mouth is and bet on your fellow adventurers.\n\nThis is the perfect game to play while having a few laughs with some friends, between other games or while waiting for the rest of your party of adventurers to arrive for a big night of gaming.\nPlayer Board\nShipping should be added automatically during the pledging process depending on your location, however below is a breakdown of shipping costs for the core game (Hunter level) unless specified differently on the pledge level.\nUSA / Canadian backers, Kickstarter should ask for $6 AUD shipping = ($5 USD)\n\nAustralian Backers, Kickstarter should ask for $8 AUD\nRest of the world, Kickstarter should ask for $10 AUD  shipping = ($8.00 USD)\nPlease note there is a special Australians only reward level to which includes free shipping for this level only for all other levels Australian shipping will be added as normal.\nGoblin Hunters has been in development for a little over a year.

Every dollar this project can raise will go towards increasing the print run and production quality of the game through stretch goals, while keeping the price of each game as low as possible.

We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited number of the special edition as based on the final pledge totals.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more stretch goals we reach, the more enhanced and beautiful the game will be! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--we truly value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game, and we promptly address all questions and ideas.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nBackers Come First: You'll get your copy of Between Two Cities well before it enters traditional distribution channels. Remember that retailers can be backers too!\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and development for Between Two Cities, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nA few of the 250+ playtesters who helped us along the way.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional copies, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nBetween Two Cities is played in three rounds. In each round, you'll start with a fresh hand of tiles. Select two of those tiles, passing the rest to the player on your left or right (depends on the round). Place one of those tiles in the city on your left and one in the city on your right, then pick up the hand that was passed to you and repeat the process.\nThe middle round actually involves drawing 3 rectangular \"duplex\" tiles (two building tiles side by side in a vertical or horizontal configuration) and selecting 2 of them--there is no drafting in this round.\nAfter all three rounds, you will have built a 4x4 city on your left and a 4x4 city on your right. Add up the scores for all cities, but only compare your lowest scoring city to each other player's lowest-scoring city to determine the winner.\nEach of the tiles (art shown below) scores in the following way. The final tiles have scoring reminders below the art:\nShop (yellow): The more shops you have in a row or column, the higher the score.\nPark (green): Each group of adjacent parks score an ascending amount of points based on the number park tiles in the group.\nHouse (brown): Each house scores a point for each other tile type in the city (they want variety).\nOffice (blue): The more offices, the better. If they're next to at least 1 Tavern, they score a bonus point.\nTavern (red): There are 4 types of taverns (different icons)--you want to get as many sets of different tavern types as possible.\nFactory (gray): The cities with the most factories score more points per factory than other cities.\nThe game includes a head-to-head 2-player variant that removes the partnership mechanism but increases the impact of the tiles you choose to pass (or not pass) to your opponent. \nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe special edition of Between Two Cities features a limited-run version of the game. The game itself is the same, but the box will be embossed in gold foil highlights and will be stamped with a number unique to your copy of the game (e.g., \"1287 / 4000\"). The special edition also includes rules in French and German (in addition to English rules).\nThe special edition will also include 7 additional pairs of city tokens. When we were designing the city tokens, we designed 14 of them and had e-newsletter subscribers vote on their favorites. The top 7 were selected for the retail game, but we liked the other 7 so much that we decided to include them in the special edition for extra flavor. They do not expand the game past 7 players or impact the gameplay in any way.\nIn addition to the standard city tokens, the special edition also includes the Arc de Triomphe, US Capitol, Brandenburg Gate, St. Basil's, Big Ben, the White House, and the Forbidden City. Each token in the final version will be a unique color.\nOne of the exciting aspects of designing a complete core game is you generate a lot of ideas for expansions. We look forward to discussing these possibilities with backers during and after the Kickstarter campaign to see the types of expansions they're the most excited about. These are the two styles of expansions we're considering:\nVertical: These would expand upon the base game, allowing players to develop their cities through the ages by adding more rounds and new tile types.\nHorizontal: These would take the core mechanisms of the game and translate them to other themes, like Between Two Castles, Planets, Dystopias, etc.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign.

Thanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween Two Cities is a first for us in that it's the first game published by Stonemaier Games that wasn't designed by Jamey Stegmaier--rather, it's from designers Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley. Jamey served as the game's developer, honing it, balancing it, and trying to make sure that every decision is fun and interesting. This process was made easy by the designers' willingness to hear and test new ideas.\n\nDuring the evolution of Stonemaier Games, we've learned the importance of blind playtesting (having people learn the game from the rulebook and test the game away from the designers). We've been fortunate to have hundreds of Stonemaier Ambassadors and their friends volunteer to playtest our games so as to make them as good as possible for the first print run. We've also learned the value of having checks and balances at every step in the production process, but when we do mess up, we go above and beyond to remedy the error.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisers to point us in the right direction. We also work with Panda Game Manufacturing to produce the game, a company with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all of our Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the games arrive in perfect condition. We've learned that shipments sent from China to Australia need fumigation certificates for wooden components and that products shipped anywhere need \"Made in China\" clearly listed on the exterior of every product for them to clear customs. In short, we've made mistakes, and not only have we learned from them, we've shared them transparently with backers and on our blog to help other creators.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Between Two Cities: Capitals Release Day!", "update_content": "Today is a special day.

That time is long past. On what was once a partially terraformed outpost world, the descendants of the long-dead colony struggle to eke out an existence on a planet that is growing ever more inhospitable.\nYou are Princess Tahira of Avestan, a small kingdom to the west of humanity\u2019s last great city, Babylon. The death of your brother has left you as the sole, unwilling heir to the Throne. After your anxiety over this burden sparked an argument with your father, you left Avestan to explore the lands that lie to the south.\nA year later, a message arrives warning of a vast army intent on returning to the stars, crushing all who stand in its way, and begging you to return home.\nIt is here that your real journey begins.\nIn Tahira the story and combat are intrinsically tied together. Every battle you fight has different objectives, which are informed by the story. In one, you fight desperately to hold a town long enough for its citizens to flee. In another you ambush an enemy squadron, trying to rout them before they can make use of their superior numbers.\nWhen you\u2019re not fighting you\u2019ll have the chance to walk around your surrounds, engage with your travelling companions, and learn more about the different cultures you\u2019ll encounter as you travel on the road.\nWe're writing Tahira's story episodically, and this campaign will cover the remaining costs of the first episode. We\u2019ve chosen this format so we can execute the scope of what we feel Tahira should be.\nEpisode One will feature a dense and thrilling plot with fleshed out characters who develop over the course of the game. Taking cues from studios like Bioware and Telltale Games, decisions and progression you make in Episode One will continue to influence your journey through later episodes. We estimate Episode One will run for 4-5 hours and are designing it to have the density of an episodic Telltale game.\nTrekking through the Himalayas and exploring the Middle East were the dual inspirations for Tahira. Beyond anything else, we want to transport you to another world and to take you on a journey that will stay with you well after you have finished playing.\nA character-driven story centred upon Tahira, an unwilling princess forced into a leadership role she never expected.\nA rich cast of colourful characters, from a bitter, drunk merchant to a swaggering mercenary power-couple.\nPainstakingly rotoscoped animations, with the frame-by-frame technique creating a realistic, hand-drawn appearance.\nA journey across hand-painted environments, which showcase the bittersweet beauty of a dying world.\nChallenging strategic combat, which demands that the player both plan ahead and adapt to a changing battlefield.\nA modern twist on classic turn-based tactics where units tire and grow more vulnerable throughout the fight, and your units can skip the turn queue and act instantly.\nA wide range of scenarios, ranging from scrappy fights between a couple of soldiers to epic sieges where the player must manage multiple fronts.\nUpgrade your forces, choosing from a range of improvements to suit a variety of play-styles.\nLearn the history of both the current denizens of a former frontier world, and the ancient space-faring people who first explored it.\nAn atmospheric soundtrack composed by Max LL that incorporates the sounds and textures of Central Asia and the Middle East.\nTahira's combat is inspired by childhoods spent secretly playing Gameboy games such as Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and Final Fantasy Tactics under the covers. As well as more modern titles like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga.\nActing through Tahira, the player leads their forces into battle by taking control of several groups of units, each with their own distinct stats and abilities. Leveraging the unique skills of your diverse team is the key to victory.\nAny leader needs allies, and Tahira is no exception. She is joined in combat by several great warriors, each leading a cadre of troops who share their leader's strengths. As the game progresses, you'll unlock opportunities to upgrade each of these heroes. When you do so, you upgrade their personal stats, skills and abilities as well as those of their followers. The system takes inspiration from XCOM and Starcraft 2: these aren\u2019t just little skill point buffs, they\u2019re distinct choices that will change the way you play the game.\nThe combat system in Tahira is designed to simulate the flow of a real battle. Rather than relying on the traditional \"we all move, then you all move\" system, turn order is assigned dynamically, based on the speed of each of the fighters.The game's heroes can skip this queue and act immediately - at a cost - creating opportunities for skilled tacticians to turn the tide of a losing fight, or punish an enemy in a weak position before it has a chance to rally. Additionally, as fights progress, your troops grow fatigued. Each attack suffered by a unit reduces its defence, meaning that your force becomes exponentially more vulnerable as the battle wears on.\nTo further create a sense of realism in combat, no two combat scenarios are alike. Battles in Episode One will range from scrappy skirmishes between a handful of soldiers, to epic sieges involving dozens of units and multiple fronts. In these larger fights, players will need to act on a solid strategy, distributing their forces between two or three areas, and prioritizing certain objectives at the expense of others.\nIn Tahira you\u2019ll encounter dozens of characters, ranging from a depressed alcoholic wine merchant, to a swaggering mercenary power couple. Some will ask for your help, others will travel with you and a special few will fight alongside you.\nConversation is an important part of Tahira. You\u2019ll be given opportunities to talk to your travelling companions as you progress through Episode One and your interactions with them will have consequences within the story and the battles you fight.\nThe sounds you\u2019ll hear in Tahira are an integral part of the experience we are building. We want to transport you to another world, a world that is familiar enough to feel real but alien enough to excite your imagination.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with the talented Max LL to score Tahira\u2019s soundtrack. Max has just returned from many months spent traveling through Central Asia, capturing the sounds and textures of the region.\nHere's an alternative version of the music he wrote for the trailer:\nFrom the moment we heard his music, we knew we wanted to work with him. We can't wait to hear him bring the emotion and cultures of Tahira's world to life.\nThe other integral part of the audio is the sound design. Each of our environments will have its own detailed soundscape. We want you to feel as if you\u2019re really journeying across the world as you play. We\u2019re working with Sound Designer Brendan Holyland to achieve this. \nHere's a little sneak peek of some of his early work for The Southern Waypoint.\nLaunch \u2013 Tahira will launch on PC, Mac and Linux. We hope to release on Steam (see our Greenlight campaign) and we will also release a DRM-free copy of the game.\nBeta \u2013 We will be running a beta later in the year. If our Greenlight Campaign is successful we will conduct it using Steam. All backers who pledge $35 or above will receive Beta Access.\nWe\u2019re a three person team and we don\u2019t want to promise new features that will delay the game by months, or worse be dropped when we realise we can\u2019t execute them.\nInstead we\u2019ve picked two goals that we think would make very positive additions to the experience of playing Tahira, and budgeted them to exactly what we need to make them a reality.\nBackers at this tier will get exclusive, Kickstarter-only access to an alternative version of Episode One: Super Fresh Ultimate Tahira X! This version of the game will be a loving parody of the decade which gave us some of gaming's most iconic characters, and will be embellished with all things '80s:\nOver-the-top neon colours.\nGarish visual effects.\nIncredibly questionable style decisions.\nIt will also have a talking horse.\nWhile Super Fresh Ultimate Tahira X! will be fundamentally the same game as Echoes of the Astral Empire, it will amount to a completely different playing experience. All of the game's art will be lovingly (heinously) re-coloured  and Tahira will get a stylin' new pair of shades. Further, the script will be partially re-written, as Tahira's equine companion Iba has mystically gained the power of speech.\nThese mugs have frames from the most action-y parts of our favourite character animations printed on them.\nChoose from one of the following designs:\nThe Hammer's earth-shattering strike\nA Footsoldier's attacking lunge\nThe Claw's vicious swing\nTahira channelling her staff's energy\nWe'll ask for your preference when we send out the backer surveys.\nCommissioned from Iranian born Disney Artist, Merhdad Isvandi, this beautiful piece will be printed on 23.4\" x 33.1\" (A1) high quality glossy stock.\nThe image we've uploaded of this really doesn't do it justice. It's a gorgeous, incredibly detailed piece of art. For example, you can clearly see both The Hammer and The Claw among the people walking through the valley.\nCommissioned from Italian artist Simone D\u2019armini, the T-shirt features Tahira in action across the chest and the Tahira logo on the back of the neck.\nThe T-Shirt will be printed on a 100% cotton white tee. It will be available in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles. We will ask for your size and gender preference when we send out the backer surveys.\n(Artist's impression of what it'll look like. We haven't made the book yet.)\nThe Art of Tahira will be equal parts art book and development journal. It'll contain heaps of otherwise-unreleased concept art, stories from Tahira\u2019s development, and details about our creative process. The book will have approximately 80 full-colour pages printed on high quality glossy paper. It will be a soft cover book, with the cover printed onto 320 GSM.\nPlease note that we won't be finalising the book until we've shipped the game as we want to include all the finished art work from Episode One.\nWant to be a part of the game? We've got you covered. Pledge to this tier, and we'll transform your likeness into one of the game's characters.\nWe'll ask you to take photographs of yourself and then the transformation will begin! You'll likely have a few different portraits done, with different expressions and emotions.\nThis pledge tier is limited to three people, as we've only got so many persistent roles in the game, and we want to guarantee that those who pledge to this tier don't see themselves become nameless henchmen who get mown down after speaking a single line.\nAvestan wasn\u2019t always the city it is now. Hundreds of years ago, before the people of Babylon spread west across the mountains, the people of Avestan were tribal villagers whose belief system was rooted in a shamanic reverence of the earth and sky.\nSome still follow the old ways.\nTahira will meet one of these mystics on the road and - through him - will learn of her nation's ancestral roots.\nThe backer of this tier will work one-on-one with our writer, Peter Castle, to help create a folk tale for the mystic to tell Tahira. If you're the kind of person who enjoys mythology, fairy tales, or teaching through elaborate metaphors, this may be the reward for you.\nWe have a real treat for art lovers with this limited edition run of ten framed fine art prints of the poster design.\nCommissioned from Iranian born Disney Artist, Merhdad Isvandi, this beautiful piece will be printed on 23.4\" x 33.1\" fine art watercolour paper:\nMuseum quality,\nAcid free\nArchival with guarantee for 75 years.\nWe've framed these beautiful prints in a 30.43\" x 39.84\" rusted gold frame. We've already got one on our office wall. Believe us when we say the pictures don't do this piece justice.\nIn a word, independence. So far, we've been working to create the game we want to make, without having to compromise with anyone. The price we've paid for this is that we don't have investors or a publisher. We've survived financially by all working part-time jobs, but this can't be sustained.\nOur artist Peter S, gets up each morning at 3am and spends five hours baking muffins before he comes into the office. He then draws for a solid 8 hours before going home, going to bed, and starting all over again. With your support we can remove the distraction and stress of having a second job, and focus entirely on making Tahira as good as it can be.\nThough it is mainly a means of restoring our team's sanity, Kickstarter also lets us add features that we otherwise couldn't afford. One of those features is contracting the immensely talented Max LL, who created the music for our trailer, to write the whole soundtrack for Episode One\nWe've been working on Episode One of Tahira for 18 months. In that time we\u2019ve built functioning versions of all the gameplay systems, created half of the game\u2019s art, written a comprehensive draft of Episode One\u2019s story and developed a world with a history that stretches back hundreds of years.\nStill-to-do remains the other half of the art and a ton of iteration and polish on the gameplay. The bulk of the remaining art work that still needs to be done are the animations. The frame-by-frame, hand-drawn style we've chosen meaning that each character takes roughly a month and a half to animate from start-to-finish. \nRelease\nWe expect to have the full game playable by July 2015 and to have it ready for release by January 2016. We\u2019ve given ourselves those six months between July and January to polish the game and to conduct a Beta Test as it\u2019s very important to us that we take the time we need to do the game justice. \nWhen we sat down and imagined what Tahira could be, we knew we wanted to show players a vast world with a rich history. We wanted our characters to develop and grow realistically and we wanted to design epic battles in which you defend fortresses and cities. In short, we wanted Tahira to have the scope of an epic fantasy series. Then we remembered we\u2019re only three people.\nTo create a game with the visual fidelity and scope that we\u2019re aiming for would take the three of us a very long time. We talked to some of our peers and they suggested we could make the game episodic. The more we thought about it, the more we liked the idea.\nMaking Tahira episodically allows us to design each episode with a beginning, middle and climactic end. It gives us the means to do justice to our vision. As we move through the series, each game will add new playable characters, which we simply couldn\u2019t spend the time making if we were trying to create all of Tahira in one go. You\u2019ll see so much more of the world in this format and have many more opportunities to talk to your travel companions. It also lets us take feedback on board from you, the players, and gives us the opportunity to iterate on all of our systems. We think it will be a better experience for you and for us, win-win.\nHow many episodes?\nWe envision two seasons of Tahira games. Season One of Tahira will have two episodes. At this stage we have written a draft for the entire series, but other than that, all of our work over the last 18 months has gone into Episode One. This is how we will continue to work. We will work on Episode One until we are happy it\u2019s met the quality bar we\u2019ve set ourselves and then we\u2019ll move onto Episode Two. \nHow long?\nWe're shooting for 4-5 hours for Episode One. We're not adding any filler, it'll just be you playing through the best story we can write, fighting battles in unique scenarios and having lots of conversations with your traveling companions. We're making Episode One as dense as we can without adding fluff for the sake of padding it out.\nWhale Hammer Games is a three person independent developer based out of Canberra, Australia.

Starting out with just a simple trick and a handful of helpers, you will embark on a journey to become the greatest illusionist alive.\nInspired by movies like the Prestige, Now You See Me and the Houdini mini-series, we created a world where magic and illusion are part of people\u2019s everyday lives. Most of the magic tricks in the game are part of the repertoires of real world illusionists, past and present, but a pinch of supernatural was also added to the mix \u2013 just so you can never be sure whether those Spiritual tricks are really merely illusions...\nEach turn, you will visit Magoria\u2019s various Locations \u2013 the Downtown, the Market Row, the Dark Alley and the Theater \u2013 to expand your team, learn more and more intricate magic tricks, get components for them, and prepare them in your Workshop. Each turn concludes with a Performance phase in the Theater, when players may perform a breathtaking magic show for Fame points and money. After the sixth Performance phase, the player with the most Fame points wins the game, and becomes the next Legend of Illusion.\nThe four starting characters are all inspired by great illusionists of the golden age of magic. You can read their story at trickerionboardgame.com.\nThanks to you helping us fund in less than 24 hours, we will add four more Magicians to the game! \nBoth the Illusionist and the Legend Box will ship with 8 Magicians to choose from instead of the original four, with four additional double-sided Magician cards and four additional Magician Poster Cards.\nThe four new Magicians will be revealed in this section as the project moves forward, so check back often!\nMore Coming Soon!\nTrickerion is a massive game, but its length and complexity is yours to decide!\nThe base game is very easy to grasp and takes 60-90 minutes, but for a truly epic battle of wits, feel free to enhance the game with the Dark Alley and the Magician Powers built-in expansions.\nThe Dark Alley expansion is included in both the Illusionist and the Legend Box.\nThis expansion adds a whole new Location to the game. It also comes with 60 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 20 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\nThe Magician Powers expansion is included only in the Legend Box.\nYour Trickerion Shards gain a whole new gameplay significance with this expansion: They will unlock Power Card slots that allow you to customize your Magician by learning diverse abilities to enhance your game. As there are 90 different Power cards available, it will open up a multitude of new strategies and adds even more replayability to the game!\n\u201cThis is a rock-solid worker placement with a bunch of really, really cool evolutions.\u201d\n- Rahdo Runs Through\nTrickerion is a worker placement game at its heart, but we've added many new elements to spice up the formula and create a fresh gaming experience for even the most seasoned tabletop game fans out there.\nBefore placing their characters, players secretly and simultaneously plan their turns using Assignment cards, reducing player downtime during the placement phase, and letting you adjust your strategy according to your opponents\u2019 plans \u2013 if you can see through them!\nLocations in Trickerion have several Actions to choose from, each costing a number of Action Points. You are unlikely to get fully blocked out of a Location, but the number of Action Points you\u2019ll get to spend on Actions strongly depends on when you get to a Location and who you\u2019re getting there with.\nEach turn concludes with the grandiose Performance Phase, when the shows prepared during the turn are presented to the awestruck audience. The way these performances shape up is entirely up to the players: from a single trick gig to 6-trick blockbusters, Thursday to Sunday, you can even co-perform with others for greater rewards \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\nEnglish Rules\nFrench Rules (translated image captions here)\nCzech Rules\nCheck out our latest, formatted rule book for detailed rules of the game.
