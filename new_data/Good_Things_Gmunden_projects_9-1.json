All in all we come about 17 songs including 2-3 bonus songs. Many songs are very long for a soundtrack production and ranging between 3 to nearly 6 minutes! Including magic psychedelic, cosmic disco, instrumental beats, ambient, crazy Jazz drums (always a nice source for sampling), afro drums...\n\nAn outstanding highlight is a psychedelic instrumental version of the title track which is popping up for only a second in the movie and is really fresh and unheard (one of the nearly 6 minutes songs). And also the vocal version of the movie theme sung by Austrian singer Pippa Armstrong (member of famous Austrian band \u201eDie Schmetterlinge\u201c) is a very very dope Disco song.\n\nFirst 50 pink/white split color vinyl copies including an electronic vibrator as special feature for free!\n\nRequest a full stream of the album by sending a message to: info@priv4te.com\nAudio snippets following soon!\nAbout the movie: Extremely rare porn/erotic movie about a pop star and her erotic adventures.

We've spent the last two years writing and performing, but with our first full-length album titled 'Hale' coming out, and the opportunity to support Slim Cessna's Auto Club on their upcoming tour, it's time to take our show on the road.\n\nWith your help we'll be able to play thirteen shows in the Midwest and Northeast (three of them in Canada), opening for Slim Cessna's Auto Club. All proceeds go directly to the van rental payment and for fuel for the first leg of the trip. We've got all sorts of rewards if you can help us out, not to mention a kick ass rock show if we're playing in your area.\nEvery donation, no matter what size, gets a thank-you on our website. We can't wait to see you all, and thanks for checking out the page!\n\nHere's some nice things people have said about us:\n\n\"The Sterling Sisters are, comparatively, a new band in Baltimore that are quickly becoming one of the most recognizable sounds on the live music scene here. Their dark blend of Americana, neo-folk, country and post-punk is complex, vital and has teeth and tears for all. Without a doubt this is my favorite new band around, and they just released their first LP called 'Hale', which is an absolute triumph. Vocalists and song-writers George Cessna and Scout Pare-Phillips eschew the easy love song for the complicated ballad about loss, and turn family complexities into searingly-honest songs.\" -Guy Werner, Push Record Play\n\"\u2026Baltimore's The Sterling Sisters, a group that makes some obvious nods to 16 Horsepower and other Old-Testament invoking goth-country bands. [With their] fiddle, guitar, banjo, drums, and a bassist endowed with a rafter-shaking operatic voice, the sound is full and commanding\u2026 They have a knack for the crescendo, taking plaintive country melodies and building them up into full on orchestrated barn-burners. I will admit that the lead singer's string bow-tie really brings it all full circle for me; he's like a singing cowboy that comes to you while you're trippin' balls.\" -Kevin Wesser, What Weekly 2012\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur goal is to cover the upfront costs of renting a van (no air conditioner needed) and gas expenses for the first leg of the tour.\nThe five of us have worked tirelessly on creating the ten best songs an album could have and touring the east coast perfecting our sound. \nTour Itinerary\n7/29 Minneapolis MN \u2013 7th Street Entry\n7/30 Chicago IL \u2013 Schubas Tavern\n7/31 Detroit MI \u2013 Magic Stick\n8/1 London ON \u2013 Call the Office\n8/2 Toronto ON \u2013 Horseshoe Tavern\n8/3 Ottawa ON \u2013 Babylon\n8/4 Burlington VT \u2013 Signal Kitchen\n8/5 Allston MA \u2013 Great Scott\n8/6 New York NY \u2013 Santos Party House\n8/7 Providence RI \u2013 The Met Cafe\n8/8 Baltimore MD \u2013 Otto Bar\n8/9 Philadelphia PA \u2013 North Star Bar\n8/10 Pittsburgh PA \u2013 Rex Theater\nRewards\nWe've got a bunch of rewards for people kind enough to back our record and tour, including handwritten truck-stop postcards (while the tour), previous released tape sets, a Kickstarter only album, a Baltimore photo-book, guest passes, live acoustic show opportunities, and a wedding show!\nHale album cover\nPictured above: George performing with the guitar up for grabs!\nPreview the first three tracks of Songs for the Donors\nWho's releasing this?\nHale will be released on Pesanta Urfolk, a small independent record label specializing in ultra-limited, high-quality vinyl releases.

And you have always supported us with this endeavor. Thank you!  Now, some people might think vinyl records are an outdated technology but we feel very strongly, and we think you do too that vinyl not only delivers the highest quality sound experience, but can also be a thing of beauty. Presenting the art in glorious large format makes each record a keepsake and a treasure. OK, I'll get to the point. We want to continue to manufacture the best and most beautiful vinyl records out there and that ain't cheap. We have... a few years under our belts, so we have a lot of releases to keep in production. $$$$!  We are particularly proud of our latest recorded album \"Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon\" (Produced by John \"Faberg\u00e9 Eggs\" Congleton) and we are teaming up with the fine folks at Bloodshot Records to release the CD and Digital THIS SEPTEMBER 25th... but we are still putting out the vinyl ourselves. And this time, we want to do it BIG!!!  We really can't wait for you to hear it, and we really want you to check out the vinyl. Lets not forget the art. The art is freaking great. You're going to want this beauty in your hands.\nWe understand that music itself is becoming less of a commodity. We don't feel like getting upset about this, we feel like making music that we think is missing from the world and we want to share it with people who give a care. We still need to make enough money to support 5 musicians (\"We've got five mouths to feed!\"-Total Recall) so we decided to get creative. What is and will always be a commodity is EXPERIENCES. Real, live memories. A show. A trip. An adventure. We are often asked to play weddings, parties, funerals. We would love to - really. Let's try to make it work. Often we are asked \"why don't you cover this or that song?\" OK, dare us. Want to head out with us on an adventure? Yep. So this is it! We found (we think) the perfect outlet to address this need we all have to EXPERIENCE each other and MUSIC, right here.  LET'S DO THIS!!!!\nOh look. It's us.\nWHAT DO YOU GET FROM SUPPORTING THIS KICKSTARTER?\nIn addition to our intense gratitude and your new-found superior feeling of godliness ANY contributions will receive a DL SENT TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS FROM THE NEW ALBUM. You will get an email with a link to download. You'll also get free downloads of any of the \"MBD WILL COVER ANY SONG YOU WANT\" covers assuming people buy those. Every physical order will come with a knick-knack from the band: a poster, a thank you letter, a comic book, stickers, whatever. Lastly, you will also have the knowledge that you are a superior person who supports the arts and saved the world. Oh, and if you donate over $100 you get this bitchin' patch!\nPatch image coming soon!\nWANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHO WE ARE?\nKnown for their uniquely brooding sound that frequently conjures desolate imagery, on Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon Murder By Death capture a familiar tone but also explore new territory, adding a further refined sophistication and even richer, full-bodied sound. The varied album ranges musically from the spooky and spare opener \u201cMy Hill\u201d, to the rough, rousing sing-along \u201cHard World\u201d, to the booming, aching waltz of \u201cGhost Fields.\u201d Songs like the cinematic \u201cLost River\u201d start hushed before rising to a lush crescendo, while \u201cNo Oath, No Spell\u201d maintains a dramatic, bluesy swing, and first single \u201cI Came Around\u201d rumbles and rollicks with a hard-charging, barroom flair. Singer Adam Turla\u2019s cavernous baritone tells shadowy small-town stories throughout, the songs\u2019 oftentimes-upbeat veneer belying a sordid undercurrent. Across Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon Sarah Balliet\u2019s sonorous cello and Scott Brackett\u2019s multiple instruments (backing vocals, piano, trumpet, and accordion, to name a few) weave irreplaceable accents, and Dagan Thogerson\u2019s robust drums and Matt Armstrong\u2019s inventive bass lines create a resounding low end.\n\nMurder By Death wrote Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon \u2013 their first album featuring contributions from Brackett (formerly of Okkervil River and Shearwater)\u2013 throughout most of 2011, testing and reworking the songs in Turla\u2019s basement-turned-practice-space. In January, they traveled to Dallas, TX to record with producer John Congleton (Explosions In The Sky, St. Vincent, Black Mountain) over three weeks. \nDAYTROTTER puts it \"The stories that Turla writes and that the group brings to life - with a ruckus and the sound of a rambling train - are loaded with times and people that are the makings for the things that you get tattooed on your arms and shoulders, knowing that they're going to be the ones that stick with you until they are pale green and barely legible, as old age creeps onto the weathered skin. They are the fights that you lost that still taste salty at the corners of your mouth. They are the divorces and the foreclosures. They are the times when you feel like the only thing that's going to make anything feel better is to finish off that 12-pack yourself. They are the times that are your dark meanings, your true meanings.\"\nWHAT COMES WITH THE NEW SPECIAL EDITION OF THE VINYL?\nWait til you see the final. We will add a picture of the exact product later...\nDIE-CUT COVER, SO YOU CAN SEE THROUGH TO THE TRANSLUCENT VELLUM INTERIOR SLEEVE. THE RECORD ITSELF IS 180 GRAM AND COLORED TO LOOK LIKE A MOON.

You will get it a few days before it comes out in the store. You'll get the download of any covers people choose for us to do in January.\nOK WHAT ABOUT MY FREE DOWNLOAD OF THE SINGLE FROM THE NEW ALBUM? OR WHAT ABOUT MY DOWNLOAD OF \"LIKE THE EXORCIST...\"?\nThat will show up a few days after you pledge. Its a lot of emails to send, but we will get to it, just give us a sec! \nWHAT'S EXCLUSIVE?\nThis is your only chance to join the MBD Whiskey Crew and patch up. Your only chance to get these rad posters, the golden ticket, the Forever Club, The MBD Book Club, The MBD covers, Buy Dagan a Tattoo, the full version of the special edition vinyl of Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon with all the trimmings, and of course these ridiculous trips with the band.\nDOES THE NEW RECORD COME WITH DOWNLOAD CODES?\nYES!!!!\n\nWTF IS A TEST PRESSING?\nA test pressing is a sample vinyl record the band listens to and approves so that the records that you lovely folks buy can go into production. We usually get 2-3 copies of these. We are offering you the only copy of each of our test pressings we will ever offer anyone. This is the limited of the limited.\nWHAT THE HECK IS A ZOETROPE? Here it is! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD11qsSezgQ&feature=youtu.be\nIt's basically an old school GIF. This one will sit and play on your record player. So sit and drink a whiskey and curl your mustache while you amuse yourself with this fun little knick-knack.Oh, and ours is reversible for twice the fun! Its like a starter jacket, but for music nerds!\nWHAT DOES THE POSTER LOOK LIKE?\nOh, here!\nOH look a vulture\n\nWHAT COMES IN THE BOXED SET OF ALBUMS?\nLike The Exorcist, But More Breakdancing 200 gram colored vinyl w/ color insert\nWho Will Survive and What Will Be Left of Them? 200 gram colored vinyl w/ gatefold jacket w/ copper foil name\nIn Bocca Al Lupo 200 gram colored vinyl w/ color insert\nRed Of Tooth and Claw 200 gram colored vinyl w/ gatefold jacket\nGood Morning, Magpie 200 gram colored vinyl w/ embossed gatefold jacket & 12 page booklet\nBitter Drink, Bitter Moon 200 gram colored vinyl w/ zoetrope and globe lantern + cord kit\nAll in a copper foil covered box\nOOH PRETTY!\nBOOK CLUB? TELL ME MORE..\nPretty simple. We send you a book (that we love) once a month for a year. We inscribe it to you and tell you why we love it. We don't really make money on this one, but we think it's fun and getting stuff in the mail rules. \nIS SHIPPING INCLUDED?\nYES. For everything.\nMORE ON THE GOLDEN TICKET?\nYou email us at mbdband@gmail.com (hopefully with a few days notice) before one of our events you want to attend and we buy you tickets...however many times you wanna go! If we are opening a show we will do our damndest to make sure we still get you in. We can't guarantee festival entrance though. But any club dates and you're in! Plus you get a cool golden ticket.\n\nWHAT IS GONNA BE ON THE FREE COVERS EP AND WHEN WILL I GET IT AND HOW?\nYou're gonna get any recordings of the covers people pay for us to do. We will record it at our local studio Farm Fresh Studios. Its free to all youse. It will come out in January and you will get an email with a link to download.\nWILL DAGAN REALLY GET A TATTOO OF ANYTHING I WANT?\nYes. Just don't be a jerk. Be funny, be thoughtful, be crazy. Whatever.\nJUST LOOK AT THIS GUY...\nREMIND ME WHAT COMES WITH THE FOREVER CLUB?\nIt starts with a boxed set. Then, any time we put something out (vinyl, cds, tour posters, pint glasses, belt buckles, etc etc etc) we send you one. No fuss. We would send shirts but we make so many your closets would overflow. Plus you get a cool patch.\nWILL YOU REALLY RECORD A COVER OF ANY SONG I WANT? EVEN STUFF YOU HATE?\nYes. And we hate a lot of stuff. But that could be interesting and cool. Sometimes the songs you don't expect to work turn out even better. OK ONE ADDENDUM- IT SHOULD BE A SONG THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED, PLEASE DON\"T ASK US TO RECORD YOUR SONG, AS THAT KIND OF GOES AGAINST THE IDEA WE ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS HERE.\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE HOUSE SHOWS YOU WILL PLAY...\nOk. We think this one is gonna rule. Some basic answers.\nWHAT AM I BUYING WITH ALL THIS BIG MONIES? Well, you kinda choose. Adam and Sarah can come and do a show just the two of them. Or maybe you want all 5 band members. We play for an hour or so, a set list you choose in advance (you pick 12 songs, and we will pick the rest). It will most likely be an acoustic show to avoid police/ noise complaints. But if you have a spot that we aren't concerned about that, maybe it's a full electric rock show. We will hang out and party, but obviously, depending on the day, we eventually gotta take off at some point to get to the next show etc etc etc. It's probably regular show length. Like 3-4 hours. \nYES YOU CAN POOL YOUR MONEY TOGETHER WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS/ FAMILY. But please don't charge for the show. Ok, maybe you can pass around the hat or take donations or whatever. Maybe this is a gift for a couple. Or maybe the timing works out that we could play your wedding. Worth a shot. \nWHY SO EXPENSIVE? First of all, lets not forget kickstarter fees, transportation, accommodations, travel costs, crew, etc etc etc. We know a lot of you have asked us to play your events, and ask how much. We also know this is a lot of money, but this is what it will take to make a general price that includes anywhere in North America. If you are from somewhere other than North America, feel free to contact us, as we are totally open to playing your fine city in a far off land. YOU DON'T AUTOMATICALLY HAVE TO PAY MORE IF YOU ARE FROM FAR AWAY. IN FACT, WE LOVE TRAVELLING TO DISTANT LANDS. It just might take a moment to get us all there. Maybe you wanna do a destination show. That could be awesome. Email us at mbdband@gmail.com to discuss any serious inquiries. \nWE WILL ROCK YOU. PROBABLY ACOUSTICALLY.\nI WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE CEDAR POINT TRIP...\nWe will arrange a time that works for both you and us. It will happen either this fall or next spring depending on what we can work out together. We book you and a friend flights/transportation to arrive in Cleveland/Sandusky, Ohio. The band picks you up in our tour van \"The Pork Chop Express 5\". We check you into your hotel in Cleveland. Then we sally forth to Cedar Point. Don't bother bringing cash- that's what your donation covers. We take you around the best roller coaster park in the world http://www.cedarpoint.com/ like kids in a candy shop. Play your heart out at silly games, ski ball, ring toss, video games, whatever! We dish out the cash and tokens. Ride 20 roller coasters. Eat junk food 'till you get sick, then ride 20 more roller coasters and get sick again. Gonna rule. A photographer will come along and document the whole day and will print up a hardcover book for you. 1 of a kind (OK, maybe we will get one too). Grab some dinner at a nice joint, and then we drop you off at your hotel, all tuckered out from your big day. Contact mbdband@gmail.com if you have any concerns/serious inquiries.\nHEAR OUR PLEA! WE MUST RIDE ROLLER-COASTERS WITH YOU!\nRIDE ROLLER COASTERS WITH US!\nI WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE KENTUCKY BOURBON TRAIL BLOWOUT TRIP...\nFirst of all, you and your companion need to be 21+. We fly/ arrange transport for you and a friend to Louisville, KY. You'll be picked up in a limo with MBD inside and will do a tour of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail http://kybourbontrail.com/index.php . Basically you visit distilleries with us all day and get wasted and hang. We check you into your fancy-ass hotel at http://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/louisville/ and then eat at their amazing restaurant. We'll try not to stink up the joint, but hey, I said we'll TRY. Let's see where the night takes us. Like the Cedar Point trip, we arrange the date of this trip with you and your companion- something that works for all of us. But we feel sooner is better than later, as you might die of anticipation, and we don't want that. This would be a rad gift for a wedding couple or something. Email mbdband@gmail.com with any serious inquiries/concerns.\nAND YEA, WE SHALL DRINK BOURBON\nEAT A FANCY DINNER WITH US AND THIS WALRUS\nLASTLY, WE PICKED SOME ODD ADVENTURES THAT SOUNDED FUN TO US. IF YOU HAVE SOME OTHER CRAZY ADVENTURE IN MIND THAT'S MORE YOUR SPEED, AND WANT TO DROP THE DOUGH, FEEL FREE TO RUN IT BY US. EMAIL US AT mbdband@gmail.com . WE WILL CONSIDER IT.

We had 15 songs we needed to cover and learned, reworked, recorded and mixed them in a sleepy whiskey-fueled 13 days. Some were silly songs, some classics. It was a riot to learn and record them.

Walk into a pop-up book or a Natural History Museum's diorama or your dreams just by walking through a door?\nThen come with me and picture this:\nTurn back the page of any book and let the book become bigger in your mind's eye, bigger than you, as big as houses. Now step behind the page as it opens. Enter the story, stepping under the tent-like embrace of the lifted page and enter a place made in 2 and 3 dimensions like a pop-up book. Like a book, this place allows travel outside the day-to-day and holds stains of time like a ghost town. \nManifest Destiny exists at the intersection of personal and public memory. It is an artist designed room-sized installation, transforming a 2,500 sq. ft empty building into an immersive dream-like landscape. Inside a 14' tall forest are sculptural vignettes addressing American History, the Midwest as frontier and story-telling as the means to create personal and cultural identity. Featuring many live performances during its run, this multi-media sensory experience debuts September 7th, and runs through September 30th, 2012 at La Esquina. \nI am not looking to pay myself as I am used to funding my own studio practice. All proceeds from Kickstarter go directly toward acquisition of materials and talent to create this installation. I need theater curtains, scrim, lighting and sound equipment for the duration of the exhibit. There are printing and graphic design costs, performers, sound and lighting engineers, all who need to be compensated for their skills and time. In short, I need to underwrite the costs of creating a theater-like environment usually undertaken by a team of people working with a producer. I want to cut out this false need for a middle-man in our cultural exchanges; I need you.\nPlease consider that this $5,000 goal represents the bare minimum to make this project a reality; all funds raised over this goal still go directly toward production costs. The more money I am able to raise, the more this experience will be truly amazing for all of us...\nThis Kickstarter represents direct advance sales of the artwork. Each piece is hand-made by the artist in limited editions, each is an original. Consider this the official early-sneak-peek-patron-level-VIP-first-dibs on this work, brought to you straight from the artist herself. We don't need a middle-man to tell us what is worthy, I'm leaving that up to each of you to decide for yourselves.\nIf you aren't already aware, a traditional gallery arrangement with artists is a 50/50% split of the retail price of any artwork sold at an exhibition. This means that for artists not to screw themselves financially they typically have to price average potential collectors like you and I out of the market. This is a rare opportunity to purchase original art without the gallery mark-up.\nI want you to have a piece of this storybook installation in sculpture. Whether you simply come to walk awhile in the space I am creating, letting the installation fill you to the brim with things you will never see anywhere else, or donate by buying one of my porcelain artifacts: Live with my art and let it become part of you. Put these precious objects on your nightstand. In your medicine cabinet. In your kitchen window. Anywhere you look every day and let me infuse a little more beauty into your mundane moments that otherwise go unnoticed and wash away into nothing. And I'll keep making them. Until everyone gets exactly what they were promised, artifacts of a once-in-a-lifetime experience, a piece of history. My work will become the future's archeology, your family heirlooms. \nSo let's redefine how art reaches every one of us, and who gets to choose what art gets seen. Let's collectively re-write the stories we are telling as a culture. Let's take over where the news and politics leave us voiceless about the things that we really should be talking about. We write history together, we write tomorrow's memories. This is our story, we tell it any way we choose, as we see it rather than how the world sees us. \nwww.manifestdestiny2012.wordpress.com\nHow to get what you want:\nALL PATRONS get mentioned by name on the Manifest Destiny website and access to advance ticket sales for Denver Broncos UK shows!

Using many hours of interviews, archival footage and more, this documentary hopes to provide a perspective of Denver's unique music scene, as heard through the ears of Bob Ferbrache.\nUnlike most music documentaries, I plan on interviewing the bands, music journalists, promoters, etc. in groups rather than via a long series of one-on-one interviews. My hope is that this will create a much more organic and conversational tone (and be more insightful to the bands), rather than a staid group of talking heads.
