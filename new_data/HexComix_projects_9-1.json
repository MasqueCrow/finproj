All pledges without reward, at any amount, will get exclusive early access to the first issue! \n\nZero Waste Comics presents: The Zero Waste Comic - a comic-magazine that aims to inspire and empower individuals from all walks of life with the agency to take charge of their individual impact \u267b\ufe0f and the future of our home \ud83c\udf0e. We believe that the reduction of individual impact has everything to do with having a consciousness of the waste we produce regularly through activities of daily living. Through the establishment of partnerships and sponsorships, we hope to be able to offer the The Zero Waste Comic free of cost to all.  It is out mission to provide a monthly, comprehensive how-to guide with resources related to each issue\u2019s topic that will help individuals feel it\u2019s within their capacity and resources to make an impact\u2026 or less of one.  Using the art of comics and prose, our comic-magazine aims to connect readers to resources, discounts, DIY tips, and alternatives to activities of daily living to inspire the exploration of every opportunity to reduce daily waste impact and to make the process of adapting a waste free lifestyle convenient, affordable and fun!\n\nSomeday soon, Zero Waste Comics hopes to expand various different audiences in various regions where a Zero Waste lifestyle can be the most effective in defeating the need for a sustainability movement at all, making things like awareness and environmental consciousness sound fun, inspiring, and exciting. Through the establishment of partnerships and sponsorships, we hope to be able to offer the The Zero Waste Comic free of cost to all. \n\nThe creators hope that Zero Waste Comics will find sustainability and longevity, opening up opportunities for expansion into green-publishing, retail, education, and philanthropy. Along with offering issues of the comic free of cost, we hope to be able to explore offering symposiums and eco-products to underserved communities. Wherever future opportunities take us, Zero Waste Comics hopes to set an example by empowering women, championing equality, demonstrating green-business practices, and fighting for eco-justice. We will strive to continue searching for ways to reduce the overall carbon footprint while inspiring others to do the same.\n\nWe don't want to give too much away now, but here's a little sneak peak at some of the character creation and editorials we've been working on....\n\n\nThe budget for this project includes the bare-bones number of considerations such as the creative team, development, production, distribution, and incorporation of The Zero Waste Comic and Issue #1. Anything we raise above our goal will be used in the marketing of Issue #1 and the production and marketing of future issues. Your contribution to this project will ensure that the creative team and all contributors are compensated fairly and that the comic will be successful in reaching as many readers as possible. \n\nAll pledges without reward, at any amount, will get exclusive early access to the first issue!

Plus: catch up with Issues 1-3.\nOVERVIEW\nDUPLICANT is an on-going comic book series written by Karla Nappi, illustrated by Marianna Strychowska, with letters by Carlos Mangual, and covers by Leila del Duca and Owen Gieni.\nWe recently ran successful Kickstarters for the first three issues in the series, and are thrilled to bring Issue 4 to the Kickstarter community. If you\u2019re a returning fan, THANK YOU for your support. Kickstarter backers are the reason this series is able to continue, and we are eternally grateful.\nThis campaign will raise funds to pay for the production, printing, and shipping of Issue 4. Anything we raise over our goal, will help pay for production on Issue 5.\n*We signed with publisher Second Sight Publishing for the publishing and distribution of our comic book to comic book stores, but all items offered via Kickstarter are exclusive and will only be offered from us via Kickstarter rewards.  All fulfillment of Kickstarter rewards is done directly by Karla Nappi.*\nDuplicant came from my love of dystopian future movies like Minority Report, Blade Runner, and a little known movie called Repo: The Genetic Opera. The idea of repo men for organs struck a creative chord in me, and I decided to do my own unique twist on it.\nAt its heart, Duplicant is a thriller about the forces conspiring against the one man who offers hope during a pandemic. That one man is Matt Travers, a scientist who creates duplicate organs that saves humanity from the organ failure contagion - only their high cost forces people into indentured servitude.  In answer to this, a dangerous black market arises which is run by a religious fanatic and Matt's former mentor.\nFollowing Matt\u2019s deadly encounter with a \u201cDuplicant,\u201d a recipient of his technology, Matt\u2019s life blows up. He comes to question everything he knows as he strives to learn the truth behind his encounter, and along the way uncovers an even bigger mystery about the fate of mankind.\nIssue 4 finds Matt with an unexpected ally, and a bombshell revelation could upend everything he once knew to be true.  Meanwhile Robert has a crisis of faith; Sean tries to connect with his family; and Ava continues the hunt for the mole.\n In addition to the book, backers get: \nCredit inside the book\nOriginal scripts and behind-the-scenes material\nFREE U.S. SHIPPING!\n\nWANT TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY?\nHere's a sample from our previous issues, plus a spoiler-free look at issue 4:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIMITED EDITION!\n\"Inks Only\" variant by Leila del Duca\nFor $30, snag the extremely limited-edition, Kickstarter exclusive variant cover, featuring Leila del Duca's naked inks.

STRETCH GOAL 2 UNLOCKS AT $3,750!\nFabio Alves Cover\nSet in a near future where monsters appeared suddenly and without warning, bringing death and destruction. Ramon Alejandro Est\u00e9vez-Guerrero roams the earth fighting these monsters in memory of his late wife and to make a better world for his daughter \u2013 he is the MONSTER MATADOR!\nFirst, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to check out this project and considering helping to fund it. Given all that's going on in the world today, all of us on the team appreciate it.\nThis campaign is to raise funds to print the 32 page comic, Monster Matador: Tango of the Matadors #1 and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way. \nKyle Roberts Kickstarter Exclusive Cover\n I\u2019ve always been drawn to the iconography of the Matador. One day I began to sketch out a character. A Matador. But I knew there needed to be more to it and suddenly it came to me in a flash. He would fight monsters\u2026 a Monster Matador.\n Of course it needed something more. Fighting to save the world from monsters is great, but I wanted something more intimate and relatable. And that's where the idea for him to fight the monsters to make a better future for his daughter. I wasn't a parent when I started the book, but I am now and it's added a whole new layer to the storytelling. And with the current pandemic it couldn't hit closer to home. Whether you're a parent or not, our world is filled with \"monsters\" of all kinds - some so seemingly large that they feel unconquerable. Writing these adventures of a man with nothing more than a sword, cape, and the courage to face them has given me hope that these monsters, no matter what form they come in, are conquerable. I hope they'll make you feel the same.\nMONSTER MATADOR: TANGO OF THE MATADORS #1 (of 3) is an action-packed thrill ride set in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. The monstrous VOLAGANTE and her children have terrorized the people of this colorful seaport for years. Now the Monster Matador has taken up the challenge of defeating them. Fighting alongside a rag-tag group of locals and joined by a familiar face from his past, will their combined forces be enough to end the TERROR OF THE VOLAGANTE?! The main story is 26 pages and the book will also include additional pin-ups and art.\n In 2015 I digitally published my first early versions of Monster Matador. Now, with your help, I can finally produce the printed comic for the first issue of this new mini-series. This is the perfect starting point for new readers. TANGO, is the next phase of the story, but acts as a beginning. This is the story I always wanted to tell. And, to be honest, how I\u2019ve always wanted it to look. Fabio Alves and Alex Zief are my creative dream team. You can see why in the preview below... \nBONUS: There's one question that I get asked a lot, and that's \"How can a Matador with only a sword and cape take on giant monsters?\" Well, to answer that, we commissioned an animated trailer that'll show you just that.

So, essentially, you're now getting about 15 different comic issues for this one pledge.\nAND...\nPopCultHQ will be giving a signed graphic novel to ten very lucky backers. \nCheck out all of the details HERE.\nAfter a series of crippling personal tragedies, Thomas Northrope retreats from his everyday life and finds comfort in an online community dedicated to the art of astral projection. When he demonstrates a unique aptitude for the practice, Thomas becomes the target of a mysterious corporate/political machine \u2013 known as AJAX \u2013 bent on using promising young practitioners to win a centuries-old war on the astral plane. \nAstral projection is the process of willfully separating one's consciousness from his or her physical body and moving it freely through the universe/the astral plane. A key philosophical concept in many Eastern cultures and religions, astral projection is regularly practiced by yogis and by devotees of certain Hindu & Buddhist sects.\nAstral projection can happen spontaneously \u2013 like in near-death experiences \u2013 or it can be made to occur with practiced conscious effort. During projection, people have reported flying, passing through solid objects, seeing into the past and future, communicating with the deceased, and visiting far away planets.\nThe astral plane is a division of existence postulated by classical (particularly neo-Platonic), medieval, oriental, and esoteric philosophies and mystery religions. It is a dimension beyond the physical\u2026 the realm of dreams, spirits, and psychic phenomena, the substance and vehicle for contact between the material and the mystical. Some writers/philosophers conflate this realm with heaven and/or hell, with union with God itself.\nIn the world of The Jump, the astral plane amounts to psychic real estate\u2026 another proverbial mound of dirt to be carved up, claimed, and fought over by politicians, influential businessmen, and the cultural & religious elite.\nFROM RYLEND: I\u2019m a screenwriter by trade. For over a decade, I\u2019ve made my living writing smart psychological thrillers for directors like JJ Abrams, Ridley Scott, Justin Lin, John Woo, Luc Besson, and F. Gary Gray, so I can\u2019t help but think of things in cinematic terms. The Jump is a smart, high-concept sci-fi thriller full of meaty twists and turns. It is Inception meets The Bourne Identity\u2026 if it were dripping with macabre and directed by David Fincher. Now tell me that doesn\u2019t sound cool?\nNot ready to make THE JUMP with us just yet? Well, then check out this free preview: \nI know what you're all thinking now. \"That was BADASS, but what do we get if we pledge?\" Well, I'm glad you asked. First, there's--\nHere is the regular/\"Kickstarter Exclusive\" cover by Fabio Alves and Edson Ferreira: \nFYI - We're looking to print THE JUMP on a heavy 85 lb glossy paper stock with a 105 lb glossy cover. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the difference.  A heavier stock also makes the comic less likely to be damaged in transit. \nWe're also offering three UBER limted variant covers you'll only be able to procure here on Kickstarter. Feast your eyes on these:\nWILDEST DREAMS VARIANT - Alves & Ferreira\nFor those who're in the mood for something a bit risqu\u00e9. \n\nTODAY WAS A GOOD DAY VARIANT - Alves & Ferreira\nFor those looking for something funny/a bit pop-cultrey. Trust us, you won't hesitate to call this cover the \"top gun.\" \nWHO YOU GONNA CALL? VARIANT - Alves & Ferreira\nDid you honestly think you'd get out of here without being subjected to a movie reference? This cover is most definitely too hot to handle and too cold to hold.\nGREAT covers, right? Having trouble choosing just one? Well, why not GRAB THEM ALL?!  \nNOTE: Special \"Early Bird\" tiers are available for ONLY the first 48 HOURS of the campaign. Get in early and SAVE!\nWe're offering all sorts of other fun stuff to backers. Take a look below for the short and skinny, and please feel free to message with any specific questions. \nPDFs of Banjax #1 and the Ringo Award-Winning Aberrant #1 \nWhat better way to get to know us than by taking a long look at the work we've done before? ALL backers of this kickstarter will essentially receive THREE badass Issue 1 comic books for the price of ONE.\nRYLEND GRANT'S SCRIPT FOR THE JUMP #1\nLove to see how the sausage gets made?

Fabio will still do it, but why not go the extra mile and have your piece rendered in full, beautiful color?

If you want an extra copy of the comic, want to add another reward (like a piece of original art), if you want to add some signed copies/rare variants of ABERRANT or BANJAX, you will be able to select add those items for purchase after you confirm your shipping information. If you have a specific question about an add-on, please don't hesitate to message us directly.\nWe LOVE stretch goals!  And if we're lucky enough to reach our initial funding goal, we'll unlock a slew of really cool extra rewards for our backers.\n-STRECH GOAL #1 - $7,000 - BONUS DIGITAL EXTRAVAGNZA!\nIf we can reach our $7,000 goal, we'll be giving our backers A TON of extra digital books from some of the hottest creators in comics!\n-STRETCH GOAL #2 - $10,000 - Exclusive Print (to be revealedl)\nIf we can reach $10,000, we'll be giving a stunning 6x9 print to all of our backers.\n-STRETCH GOAL #2 - $13,000 - (to be revealed when the preceding goal is unlocked)\n-STRETCH GOAL #2 - $16,000 - (to be revealed when the preceding goal is unlocked)\nTHE JUMP has sprung from the wicked minds of Hollywood screenwriter/Ringo Award-winning comic creator Rylend Grant, artist Fabio Alves, colorist Edson Ferreira, and letterer HdE... the very same team that brought you the dark and decidedly wicked superhero noir BANJAX (published Action Lab: Danger Zone). \nBANJAX made over a dozen ten-best lists in 2019 and the critics raved:\n\u201cThis is the most amazingly well done first issue of a series I have ever seen. Point blank. Period\u2026 You cannot read this and come out if the same way you went into it\u2026 So effin\u2019 good.\u201d (Steven Leitman, Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\u201cBanjax has all the action, violence, grit, and heart of a classic.\u201d (David Pepose, Creator of Spencer & Locke)\n\u201cQuality, engrossing material embedded with a cinematic feel. Gifted storytelling and breathtaking artwork. Banjax will instantly have you screaming for more!\u201d (Jason Bennett, PopCultHQ)\n\u201cBanjax hits incredibly hard. Intense, thought-provoking, wildly entertaining. It\u2019s near perfect. For those looking for something unique, Issue #1 is a must-read.\u201d (Charlie Chipman, The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cRiveting. Refreshing. Heart-breaking. Ultra-violent. Honestly, a bit unsettling. The artwork of F\u00e1bio Alves is everything a dark and gritty comic should embody. Edson Ferreira\u2019s color work adds an extra punch to really emotional panels. Don\u2019t miss out on this bloody good time! A+\u201d (Andrew Huard, You Don\u2019t Read Comics)\n\u201cHoly crap this is good. This book hits all the right notes. It\u2019s marvelously done, such a compelling story. It\u2019s the best comic I\u2019ve read in a long time. Honestly? Bendis could take some notes here.\u201d (ComicCast Podcast)\nAnd Rylend's previous book - ABERRANT - won a prestigious Mike Wieringo Comic Book Award (\"Ringo Award\") in 2019 for BEST VILLAIN and was nominated for two others... BEST SINGLE ISSUE and BEST WRITER (alongside Jeff Lemire, Scott Snyder, Brian K. Vaughn, and Brian Michael Bendis).\nAnd here's what the critics had to say about ABERRANT:\n\u201cGo home, other comics people. Rylend Grant and Zsombor Huszka just killed the game\u2026\u201d (Charles Pulliam-Moore \u2013 i09)\n\u201cABERRANT offers an intense, near-cinematic reading experience that incites excitement and inspires interest for issues to come.\u201d (The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cAberrant flat-out works. You have visceral action scenes. Personalities practically ooze out of the page. Honestly, this is the kind of storytelling that the big publishers are missing.\u201d (Big Comic Page)\n\u201c\u2026a bleak, dangerous and serious story with a lot at stake\u2026. If you like revenge tales, military thrillers, and superheroes, \u2018Aberrant\u2019 has it all.\u201d (Spartantown)\n\u201cABERRANT #1 is a game-changer at Action Lab: Danger Zone. You\u2019ll become captivated almost immediately\u2026 The creative team put together one of the most seamless, cohesive, and dynamic collaborations I\u2019ve seen this year on the indie scene.\u201d (PopCultHQ)\n And ABERRANT was quickly optioned for television by 24 & FELICITY Executive Producer Tony Krantz! \nMUCH MORE LOVE TO COME ON THE JUMP!\nAs you can see THE JUMP was put together by one hell of a team, guys whom have already been around the block a few times together... joining us this go round, though, is an army of astral projectionist gurus \u2013 shepherds of the real-life communities upon which the one in our book is modeled. While we work to make sure The Jump appeals to a hungry American action thriller audience, these folks will be making sure we keep things authentic, grounded, and true to the astral traveler\u2019s experience.

All we have to do it get the thing printed and get it to you.\n\nOur printer is considered an essential business, so it is up and running and we aim to fulfill this project fast.

Plus: catch up with Issues 1-2.\nOVERVIEW\nDUPLICANT is an on-going comic book series written by Karla Nappi, illustrated by Marianna Strychowska, with letters by Carlos Mangual, and covers by Leila del Duca and Owen Gieni.\nWe recently ran a successful Kickstarter for the first two issues in the series, and are thrilled to bring Issue 3 to the Kickstarter community. If you\u2019re a returning fan, THANK YOU for your support. Kickstarter backers are the reason this series is able to continue, and we are eternally grateful.\nThis campaign will raise funds to pay for the production, printing, and shipping of Issue 3. Anything we raise over our goal, will help pay for production on Issue 4.\n*We have recently signed with publisher Second Sight Publishing for the publishing and distribution of our comic book, but all items offered via Kickstarter are exclusive and will only be offered from us via Kickstarter rewards.* \nDuplicant came from my love of dystopian future movies like Minority Report, Blade Runner, and a little known movie called Repo: The Genetic Opera. The idea of repo men for organs struck a creative chord in me, and I decided to do my own unique twist on it.\nAt its heart, Duplicant is a thriller about the forces conspiring against the one man who offers hope during a pandemic. That one man is Matt Travers, a scientist who creates duplicate organs that saves humanity from the organ failure contagion - only their high cost forces people into indentured servitude.  In answer to this, a dangerous black market arises which is run by a religious fanatic and Matt's former mentor.\nFollowing Matt\u2019s deadly encounter with a \u201cDuplicant,\u201d a recipient of his technology, Matt\u2019s life blows up. He comes to question everything he knows as he strives to learn the truth behind his encounter, and along the way uncovers an even bigger mystery about the fate of mankind.\nIssue 3 finds Matt besieged by memories of his pre-pandemic life as he battles to stay alive. His employer is investigating the possibility of a mole in their midst, and the black market seizes on the chance Matt\u2019s duplicate organs may have been compromised.\n In addition to the book, backers get: \nCredit inside the book\nOriginal scripts and behind-the-scenes material\nFREE U.S. SHIPPING!\nWANT TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY?\nHere's a sample from our previous issue, plus a spoiler-free look at issue 3:  \nJUST ADDED!\nFor $25, snag the extremely limited-edition, Kickstarter exclusive variant cover, featuring Leila del Duca's naked inks.

ALL BACKERS PLEDGING $35 OR MORE WILL RECEIVE IT AUTOMATICALLY! Just select Antic Face for the reward!\nPrint Version to be handled by Print Ninja.\nAdapting Shakespeare. It\u2019s something every community theater and big time Hollywood producer does. \u201cKing Lear, but during the Tokugawa era\u201d or \u201cHamlet, but this time he\u2019s a lion.\u201d Not entirely bold moves, but ever since freshman English, we\u2019ve had it drilled into us that these stories are timeless. You can set Twelfth Night or Taming of the Shrew in high school until the cows come home, but it might leave you feeling like it\u2019s missing some of that Real Shakespeare Flavor \u00ae. \nThat\u2019s why I thought it\u2019s time for Ol\u2019 Billy Shakes himself to get adapted. Now I know what you\u2019re saying, \u201cShakespeare in Love won best picture in 1999, that was about Shakespeare.\u201d Yeah, but was he a superhero? I didn\u2019t think so. Shakespeare is timeless, but better than that, the man\u2019s been dead for 400 years, he\u2019s totally in the public domain. I can make him a silly masked detective for all he cares\u2026 \nNo Holds Bard is a 5-Act comic about Shakespeare fighting crime in Elizabethan England, written (mostly) in iambic pentameter. Featuring some of the hottest artists working in comics today, including Erica Henderson, Logan Faerber, Cara McGee, James Callahan, and Aaron Conley, with a cover by Dave Kloc and pin-ups from Sina Grace, Bobby Rubio and Ashlyn Anstee. No Holds Bard will feed your eyes and get all four humors moving. It won\u2019t make you dumber, but you will fail your literature test. \nThe Story\nNice queen you got there. Shame if something were to happen to her.\nWhile writing yet another one of his masterpieces, Shakespeare receives a call from his trusty page, Page, with most disturbing news\u2014The Queen has been stolen! From there, the Dramatic Duo of The Bard and Page set off in a series of rollicking misadventures that lead to the highest echelons of Renaissance power. He'll cross paths with weirdos of all shapes and sizes. You might even recognize a few of them from someone's most famous plays (but then, I don't want to spoil all the fun).\nWho is the shadowy figure responsible for the Queen\u2019s disappearance? Will Will ever get rid of his pesky writer\u2019s block? Why can nobody tell The Bard is Shakespeare? I mean clearly\u2026 \nFind out the answers to these questions and to more you didn\u2019t even know you had when you read No Holds Bard SOON! \nArtists\nNo Holds Bard features illustrations from some of the top new artists working in comics today. Check it:\nErica Henderson - Act I\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead?!\nOne of comics' rising stars, her credits include Marvel's Unbeatable Squirrel Girl with Ryan North and Archie Comics' Jughead with Chip Zdarsky. A graduate of Rhode Island School of Design, she currently lives in Boston.\nLogan Faerber - Act II\nAnd that's for Gnomeo & Juliet!\nLogan was always a quiet child: one who kept to himself and played outside as frequently as he could. He could relate to cartoons and animals more than most people. On his 7th birthday, Logan\u2019s brother passed down his long boxes of comics, granting access to Marvel and DC stories from the 70s onward. This imaginary landscape helped to fuel Logan\u2019s desire to become an artist and drove him to pursue illustration and design at Montserrat College of Art. Now, as an adult, Logan still finds joy in playing games, reading books and drawing pictures, keeping himself young at heart forever.\nCara McGee - Act III\nWhat the hell am I going to eat for lunch?\nCara McGee is an Atlanta-based comic book artist and tea connoisseur. You can find her covers on Lumberjanes and follow her wildly popular tumblr at http://areyoutryingtodeduceme.tumblr.com/.\nJames Callahan - Act IV\nRemember when I said Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead? Well not yet they're not.\nJames Callahan is a writer and illustrator, working on the east coast of the U.S., often under the less innocuous moniker, Barf Comics. He has illustrated hundreds of comic pages, and worked on scores record covers, skate decks, and t-shirt designs with clients ranging from Marvel, Oni, and Image Comics to Creature Skateboards and Thrasher Magazine, to bands like Municipal Waste, Mastodon, the Hold Steady, the Black Dahlia Murder, and many more.\nAaron Conley - Act V\nIf it be a sin to kick lots of butts, I am the most offending soul alive.\nAaron Conley is the co-creator and artist of Sabertooth Swordsman. He has worked for Marvel, Dark Horse, Image, Boom Studios and Ghost Face Killah. He is also the winner of the 2014 Russ Manning Award for Most Outstanding Newcomer. His favorite kind of dog is a Boston terrier.\nDave Kloc - Cover\nDave Kloc is an illustrator and printmaker living in Los Angeles. He has designed and hand printed a weekly poster for The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail (now in its 3rd season on Comedy Central.) Kloc has also illustrated and printed posters for comedians such as John Mulaney and Jim Gaffigan and bands like Passion Pit, La Dispute, Childish Gambino and more!\nBobby Rubio - Pin-up\nBobby Rubio worked nine years with Walt Disney Feature Animation as a traditional animator and storyboard artist on several films including \u201cTarzan\u201d and \u201cTreasure Planet.\u201d After Disney, he worked as an assitant director/storyboard artist for Nickelodeon Animation Studios on the series \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender\u201d.

On all relevant social media @SinaGrace\nAshlyn Anstee - Pin-up\nAshlyn Anstee grew up in a rainy city, moved to a snowy city, and then settled in a sunny city, where she writes and draws for animation and children's books. You can find her art and other fun stuff at www.ashlyna.com\nFrank Cvetkovic - Letterer\nWait til you see this in context.\nFrank Cvetkovic is a comic book letterer whose work has appeared in ARTFUL DAGGERS, DRIVE, Jamal Igle\u2019s MOLLY DANGER, and THE BIGGER BANG. He currently lives in Cleveland, OH, where the home teams never win and the rivers occasionally catch fire.\nWhy Shakespeare?\nI love Shakespeare (the pomp of it all!), and I know for a fact STAN LEE co-creator of Spider-Man, does too. So there has to be a fair amount of overlap between Shakespeare fandom and comic fandom, right? Also, he seemed perfect for the style of campy, not-so-serious stories that you'd see in an episode of Batman '66, but with very well illustrated violence. It covers a whole Venn diagram of tastes, and hopefully it appeals to more than just me.\nYou don't want to know how long it took me to come up with these captions.\nWhat is iambic pentameter?\nBill Shakespeare used this style of verse a lot.\nEach line contains ten syllables, no more.\nThen further split in stressed and unstressed parts.\nIt makes things sound much smarter than they are.\nNow I'm no Shakespeare, but just like Shakespeare, I didn't use it everywhere, so that's why we're saying it's mostly in iambic pentameter. Sorry English nerds, I'm getting out in front of you. \nThe Dramatic Duo Companion EP\nTo celebrate the launch of No Holds Bard, I've commissioned a digital-only companion EP with an original extra-jazzy theme song from Spencer Owen (Dude Bro Party Massacre III) and a super-sweet love song from Allie Goertz (Rick and Morty Concept Album), available to all backers who pledge $3 or more. It's a hell of a deal, and perfect bed music for when you're getting your thespi-on.\nWhy donate?\nThis is something I've been knocking around in my head for a long time, and I'm really passionate about it, so I'm going to need you to lend me your ears (and your wallets, har har). If this thing is ever going to get off the ground, it needs your support. I've been incredibly lucky to work with such talented artists to help realize a story I thought was worth telling. Without you, it's just a stack of \"maybe someday\" crowding my brainspace, but with you, it could just be your next favorite comic.\nAlso, there are some pretty tantalizing rewards. Just sayin'.\nThe Rewards\nWe've put together a bunch of exciting rewards for No Holds Bard, including stickers, lithographs, domino masks, t-shirts, a companion EP and even a fancy box with a REAL HUMAN SKULL inside.\nNot bad for a dollar.\nDouble your dollar and get sweet prizes.\nThree dollars?! What a bargain!\nProbably the one you want, unless you're REALLY COOL.\nShow the world you care.\nStickers for everything!\nIf I see you in one of these at a convention, you get a free high five.\nYou choose which lithograph you get!\nWear a face on your chest\nAll Four Lithos and a T-Shirt, and all the other stuff. A $190 value for a measly $116\nCustomized for each individual backer.\nI choose which one you get, but they're all awesome.\nREAL HUMAN SKULL IN A REAL WOODEN BOX\nWhere is the money going?\nLike many people, artists need food to live, so most of the money goes to paying our artists a professional page rate so that they may live in a modern capitalistic society. Other dollars are going toward Kickstarter for use of their infrastructure and reward fulfillment such as poster printing costs, manufacturing masks, and building that fancy skull box. Even if we reach the initial $10,000 goal, I'll be taking a hit. That's how much I want this to get made.\nArtist Fees: $7750 (77.5%)\nKickstater Fees: $800 (8%)\nRewards and Shipping: $2890 (28.9%)\nBackerKit ~$200 (2%)\nShould I have set the goal to $11,640? Probably, but I suffer for my art.\nStretch Goals \nThe more we make, the more we can make. I have 6 issues planned out already, and a lot more ideas to come. If there's interest, there's more content for you, so I hope you're feeling generous.\nAt $22,000, we're funding a SECOND ISSUE with more great artists and everything. \nAbout the Creator\nEric Gladstone is a writer and native-born son of Los Angeles. He is the Senior Dialogue Writer for Marvel Heroes 2016 and he works as a researcher, video editor and writer at Stan Lee's POW! Entertainment offices. POW! in no way endorses the comic. \nNo Holds Bard marks his first public foray into the world of published narrative comics, he put a lot of work into it and thinks it\u2019s going to be good, so you\u2019d better like it. \nHe also likes dogs, cats, rats, pigs, bad puns, professional wrestling, and riddles.\nFind him on twitter @realgladstone\nWHO ARE YOU?!

At this stage, much of the groundwork for the project has already been laid, and all of the artists have signed on.\n\nI will communicate clearly throughout the funding and post-funding stages and backers will be notified in the event of any shipping delays.
