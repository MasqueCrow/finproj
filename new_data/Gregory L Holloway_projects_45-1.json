Make sure you check out the rest of our Kickstarter page to see what we wish to deliver with our final product.\nNB! This is just a prototype, there is music but there are no sound effects, also one might encounter some performance issues. So please just keep in mind that we are still in early stages of development and the demo or trailer do not represent the final quality of the game. \nIf you find any bugs or have suggestions on how to better the game, we are more than happy to take a look, you can post about it to our official forum on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/ljis17/) or let us know in the comments section :)\nWe have also uploaded a Developer Commentary video about the demo to Youtube, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkA8XkIjBHo\nThem thumbs, we sure need'em! Can we have yours?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=169956505\nLast Jungle In Sector 17 is a top-down view 2D action strategy game being developed for PC and Mac on the Flash platform. It can run in a browser using the Flash plug-in or as independent entity (.exe file).\nThe game is planned to release in 3 parts, each part adding new gameplay elements and continue the story.\nOur first goal is creating the single player campaign, though we'd love to add multiplayer co-op and competitive modes (see stretch goals).\nControls: The game is played using the keyboard and the mouse. The player starts out with the hero craft which he controls throughout the game and the first goal is to learn to control that craft in zero gravity environment. To be effective in dogfights the player needs to also master the deflective shooting technique.\nGUI: There is a lot of information the player needs to see at any one moment, we have tried to make all of it as easily readable as possible.\nObjectives: The primary objective of the game is to defend the home space station from hostile enemy activity. At the beginning the player must use the hero craft to do so, but as the game progresses he also gains access to defense turrets, upgrades (which won't just make the stats better, but also deliver special abilities), tactical structures and allied crafts.\nEconomy: Upgrades and assets can be purchased for credits which are earned by eliminating the enemy crafts. In the current demo version the credit is given by simply destroying the enemy craft, but for the final version a more intricate system is planned - after destroying the enemy craft, it's debris would be left floating in the space, to earn the credits one of the pieces would have to be scanned close by for verification. The player has to act fast though before the debris float too far and are lost forever. The pieces can be scanned by the hero craft or the allied crafts, so the allied crafts would also act as kind of \"harvesters\".\nEnemies: The game would feature many different kinds of hostile vessels all with different abilities and characteristics. Some crafts rely more on numbers while others on their special abilities. To be successful the player has to learn, adapt and react to each unit differently. Some of the enemies are what we call \"puzzle crafts\" which the player has to figure out how to defeat (e.g. Teleporter in the current demo). Few enemy crafts examples (copy/paste from drafts file): \nKamikaze - Fast moving low health craft, doesn't maneuver, only tries to get close to the closest target(allied ship or the spacestation), locks on a target. Shoots the cannon when something is straight on sight. Makes a sound which grows louder when it comes closer. When exploded do damage to both allied and enemy crafts. Think of something like those guys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpY-cfTqzsI&feature=related \nTeleporter - Doesn\u2019t use boids, shoots rapidly like 5-6 shots at once, doesn\u2019t teleport away until is shot at. Uses shields. Medium-Hard enemy. Attacks firstly the crafts secondarily the space station. Does not teleport on top of the space station.\nEMP generator - Has very strong shields which are down only when it is charging up for next pulse. When getting hit by EMP all electronics go down, player can\u2019t move the ship, the radar screen goes black, the buying menu disappears, no dialogue can happen, even music stops. There is a sound of engine powering down - D\u017dIJUUuUuUuuuu. When the EMP power is restored the engine powering up sound is played.\n\nAllies: Like mentioned above the player can purchase defense turrets and allied crafts to help defend the space station. Unlike traditional RTS games in ljis17 the allied units aren't really controlled by the player, they act on their own, leaving the player free to fight with it's own craft. As with enemy units there are a variety of allied units, all with different characteristics and abilities. Some turrets are good for taking down enemies from afar while some are good against stronger enemies which get closer to the base. Same with allied crafts some are good for offensive maneuvers while others stay back and defend the base.\nSummary: We want to put the player into situations where he first feels helplessness and desperation, but after figuring things out he'd feel rewarded.To get there he would have to use his reflexes, strategic planning abilities and observation skills. \nSoon after leaving Earth in the 26th century, mankind encountered an intelligent space-faring species much like themselves. Through the technology exchange programs between the two races many new breakthroughs in science were made, most notable being the discovery of quantum teleportation. Born from the cooperation of the most brilliant minds from both sides it was as if filling the gaps one couldn't alone. Soon after the discovery, the speed of space colonization took to another level. \nThe teleportation devices could teleport matter to anywhere in the universe, but the procedure had a mystery no-one could solve or even explain. A cruel teleportation law applied to all living beings, for anyone alive going in from one end arrived brain-dead the other. Even sending insects or plants resulted in failure because the process corrupted the DNA sequences beyond repair. This limited the possible colonization distance since everything living would still have to use classical means of transportation. Even so, soon all nearest habitable planets were colonized by both races.\nThe increasing live matter trade between the colonies eventually lead to the rise of interstellar rocket fuel prices. Latter being a limited resource only found and mined on handful of planets. The at first subtle political fights for control over those planets coupled with greed, corruption and race pride eventually lead to an all out galactic war between the two races.\nFor a decade a short period of peace was established, but the ever decreasing fuel supplies eventually lead to the break out of the Second Fuel War, this time without remorse, both sides going for complete control of another.\n100 years into that war, after a large scale attack on humanities greatest war ships, fighter craft pilot Ryder finds himself stranded alone, without communications, on an abandoned space station from the last peace period. However, soon after the arrival he discovers that he isn't as alone as he thought - the station is controlled and regulated by an advanced neural network AI 'Johnny'. \nRyder finds out that Johnny was created to simulate and control the integrate climate system of the rainforest on board the space station, he also learns that Johnny has been cut off from civilization since the war started again 100 years ago. Together they try to work out ways to contact the outside galaxy. Months after Ryder's arrival the station is found by the enemy fleet, they then have only each other to rely on in order to survive the hostile assault.\nThe story is told trough in-game dialogue and graphic novel style story scenes.\nPrimary goal of $5000 adds to the pot of finances we have already put aside ourselves and buys us time to create the base game and do the following before this year ends:\nAdd sound effects (This is one of the few things we don't have the skill for and we'll need to hire someone for that).\nLicense music.\nCreate an animated and interactive tutorial system.\nOptimize our current game engine for better performance.\nIntroduce a more intricate economy system.\nCreate upgrade system for hero craft, turrets and allied units.\nCreate smarter AI with fight-or-flight response.\nAdd a variety of different special ability enemy units.\nAdd more types of turrets and allied crafts.\nCreate multiple difficulty levels.\nAdd more boss units.\nFinish drawing the story.\nAdd more and nicer particle effects.\n$6000 - Bullet time function - this function will allow the player to slow down time to dodge projectiles and aim shots. The bullet time ability has a trade-off though, it uses the same energy resource as the hero craft's shield, so the more player uses bullet time the less shield he has at that moment.\n$8000 - Colossal enemy ships - right now only smaller fighter crafts are planned for the game, with this extra support we will be able to introduce larger enemy motherships and dreadnoughts, which will have their own turrets and different abilities like the ability to repair damaged fighter crafts or attack at a really long distance.\n$10 000 - Special in-game missions - right now the core gameplay is concentrated on defending the base space station, adding different missions for the player to take part of would surely enrich the overall experience. \n$35 000 - Multiplayer with co-op and competitive modes - co-op would enable up to 4 people to play the main campaign. We haven't thought very deeply on what the competitive side would bring, but we certainly won't want to just add a DM mode and be done with it. It would be something more along the lines of Left 4 Dead and Natural Selection with base building and defensive vs offensive sides.\n1$ HONOR - Your name (or company) will be added to the honorary list on our website.

I go like \"I do design and animation, some advertisement and programming...\" and they are like \"Oh you are an IT person\" and I'm like \"Umm, what? ...Am I?\". \n\nThing is, I have a wide range of fields I specialize in and it's hard to put a finger on one specific thing. But I think my unofficial work title would be: \"Engineer of dynamic, static and interactive media\" \n\nAround 1999 I did my first steps in digital art with Corel Photo-Paint, later came animation, web design, 3D, flash, advertisement, infographics, GUI design and programming. \n\nI'm from Estonia and for the last 5 years I've been working in Estonias biggest news agency doing things described above, before that I worked at an ad agency and before that I actually did some IT related stuff, being a cable and HUB deployer and doing network maintenance. \n\nBut my real passion has always been games. I remember the first video game I ever played was Tetris, I must've been like 3 or 4 years old and I didn't understand how to play it, I thought I had to build a house and I have to leave windows in it. Later on, me and my older brother bought the ZX Spectrum, we had lots of games and the games had to be loaded from cassette tapes. I'll never forget the screeching sound it made when loading a game.\nYou can read more about me and and my rant on video games on ljis17 webpage under the \"team\" section: http://ljis17.com/team/\nI can best be described as a person with many passions and interests, but one of my first passions in life was programming. Throughout my many years of programming, I have created simulations, games, websites and databases. My hobbies and interests include, but are not limited to, gardening, economics, the environment, and engineering projects. \n\nI am a recent graduate of Computer Science, and feel that my education in college has helped me to improve my skills.

Perfect for when you have had an unexpected delay, or haven't been able to fully charge your phone, and you need to make a few calls, send a work email or use your GPS and maps function to find your way home.\nTiny Tiny Tiny \nSo we believe the Fuel Micro charger is the world\u2019s smallest cell phone recharging device. And it is absolutely tiny- just 1.3 by 0.9 by half an inch. It\u2019s so small that it can sit easily on your keyring, you can slip it into the 5th pocket of your jeans, or even have it hanging off your cellphone.\nThe Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is an emergency back-up solution. The Micro Charger is fully rechargeable, and is able to keep it\u2019s charge for at least 1 month before needing to be recharged (our calculations suggest closer to 3 months, so we are being conservative!)\nHow it works \nCharge up the Fuel Micro Charger from the supplied cable or any AC micro-usb wall plug. Then just put it in your pocket, on your key chain or in your car and forget about it. \nTo Use: Turn the power switch on and plug into your phone, the same as you would your charger. Your phone will start to recharge straight away.\nA more in depth look at the Fuel Micro Charger \nComponent selection\n Part of our background is in component sourcing. So we spent months searching, testing and evaluating the smallest and most efficient parts to use with the Fuel Micro Charger. The components we use are the smallest available, and we have used innovative features like flexible-PCBs to shrink component size, in order to make Fuel as small as possible, and to have as big an internal battery as we can.\nHowever, the electronics are controlled by a premium Texas Instruments platform, and we have included multiple safety redundancy features, such as a PCM on the battery and a battery management IC on the PCB to make no compromises on the safety of Fuel.\nHousing \nThe body of the product is pure die-cast aluminium. This means it is incredibly strong but still light weight. The aluminium is painted, lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish. The housing weighs around half an ounce.\nInternal\nBattery\n The majority of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by an energy dense lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This battery is a 5C battery, rated at 220 milliamp hours. This should provide around 20\u201330 minutes extra talk time, or a few hours on standby, although that is dependent on what type of phone you have and how you use it.\nBattery safety \nThe battery itself has an integrated PCM and there is a battery management IC on the PCB, so the fuel micro charger is extra safe.\nPCB\n The PCB itself is very small, using specially sourced low-profile components, to keep its volume down to an absolute minimum, allowing us more space for a bigger battery inside the Fuel Micro Charger. However, it is a fully functioning PCB, with regulated inputs and outputs by micro-usb. We also use a Flex-PCB, which is even smaller than a regular PCB to connect the micro-usb male to the main board, again to cut down on internal space, so we have more room for the biggest battery we can use.\nLEDs and Switch \nOn the outside of the case, you will see three LEDs. These help tell you if the Fuel is turned on, fully charged, or charging. Each of the Three LEDs will Light up to tell you different information about your Micro Charger:\nRed: Charging\nGreen: Fully Charged\nBlue: Power On\n\nThere is a switch to turn the Fuel Micro Charger on and off, keeping the battery from needlessly discharging when not in use. \nMicro-USB\n Micro-USB is the standard charging connector for all phones apart from iPhone. We use specially sourced low profile components, which while being the smallest on the market, are also certified to work with any existing micro-usb connector- so you can charge almost any Android, Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, Nokia or Blackberry phone.\nCharging the Fuel \nThe Devotec Fuel Micro Charger has a rechargeable battery inside that is recharged via its female micro-usb port at the bottom of the device. Any standard micro-usb cable, or AC wall charger you have at home can recharge the Fuel Micro Charger, and the battery inside is rated for a minimum of 500 cycles.\nLet us tell you about who we are \nWe are a dedicated team of entrepreneurs and industry professionals, including Phd scientists, MIT graduates, Harvard MBAs and ex Motorola employees. We work at Devotec Industries, where our day jobs are to design Solar Powered Bluetooth speakers and Solar Chargers for cell phones.\nSo we have plenty of experience in designing charging circuits, and have shipped thousands of units over the last 7 years. The Fuel Micro Charger is an off shoot of our main work, and we are looking to launch it into the market pretty soon after our Kickstarter funding ends, if we are successful.\nWhere are we? \nAs you can see from the working sample, we have all the PCB design finished, with schematics and Gerber files ready. The CAD drawings are fully finished and we are ready to go into production. Through our other work, we have strong links with manufacturing in China, and have agreed pricing and lead times with an aluminium molder for the housing tooling who we have previously worked with.\nWe have been testing the samples for several months now, and it is based on a mature design we have been using for some time with our existing products.\nWhy do we need Funding?\n Where we need you to come in is to help us raise funds to put the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger into production. We need to buy the aluminium toolings, pay for the first production run, and pay for all the certification like CE, RoHS, and WEEE.\nAction! \nWe think this is an awesome product and we are really excited about it, but we need your help to turn it into a reality. We have lots of exciting discounts and offers available to our early backers, and we hope that we can turn this product into a something special that you are going to love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny technology project will carry certain risks, and surprises can occur at any point in a project.\nWe have done our best to mitigate and minimize the risks associated to bringing the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger to market in several ways:\n\n- We have well tested and working prototypes. We started work on the Fuel Micro Charger project in November 2011, and had our first housing in August 2012, and our first working PCBs in September 2012.\n\n- We are experienced. Many projects fail not because of lack of enthusiasm, but due to lack of knowledge by the entrepreneur outside their core-competency. Part of our team is based in China and has worked in the country with multiple factories for many years, and has developed lasting relationships over the last 7 years with many of the manufacturing partners we intend to use for the Fuel Micro Charger. We are therefore much less likely to fall prey to the \u2018teething problems\u2019 that many other American companies have when first approaching China for manufacturing.\n\n- We use high quality components. We are using a standardized and high-quality American Texas Instruments platform as the basis of our design. We chose this design over using lower cost Chinese alternatives, even though they were multiple times cheaper. Quality first.\n\n- We know how to ship product. We have sold and shipped our previous Chargers and Speakers to the US, Europe, Japan and globally for seven years. We understand issues like shipping and logistics, merchant payment terms, insurance, safety certificates and the many other issues that can delay or harm a new entrepreneur\u2019s business.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Holiday Present - Fuel is the perfect stocking stuffer!", "update_content": "Hi Guys, this is a preview of our next project.

We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images.

Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!
