[{"backer": "Chris X", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " WELCOME BACK TO THE VILLAGE \nIn 1967 the cult classic TV series, THE PRISONER, came bursting onto the screen. The series, about an unnamed British intelligence agent who awakes to find himself trapped in an idyllic seaside village, was not only an instant hit with viewers at the time, it went on to be watched and re-watched obsessively by fans, quickly gaining cult status.\nWhile there have been several collectables released over the decades, THE PRISONER has never received a line of OFFICIALLY LICENSED ACTION FIGURES\u2026 and Wandering Planet Toys is working with our licensing partners at ITV Studios to bring to life 4-inch RETRO STYLE ACTION FIGURES that celebrate Patrick McGoohan\u2019s brilliant series. But we need the crowdfunding support of PRISONER and ACTION FIGURE fans to make these figures a reality!\nWant to get information about these figures? Good, because by hook or by crook you will!\nNUMBER 6 - FIRST EDITION\n\u201cI am not a number! I'm an action figure of a free man!\u201d We're launching Wave 1 with \"NUMBER 6\" himself, as played by series creator, writer and director Patrick McGoohan. This figure in McGoohan's likeness, features the iconic black jacket with white piping, and the 6 badge.\n\nNUMBER 6 - KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE \"ARRIVAL\" EDITION \nThis NUMBER 6 variation features an all-black outfit, representing McGoohan's character as seen in the episode \"The Arrival\" and also in the opening credit sequence of each episode. It is an exclusive to this Kickstarter Campaign and will not be released anywhere else.\n\nNUMBER 6 - BEACH ESCAPE EDITION (No badge on lapel)\nThis version of Number 6 is a variant of the First Edition figure, but WITHOUT the #6 badge, because he has defiantly refused to put it on. This edition features a special cardback featuring the icon moment of Number 6 attempts escape on the Village's beachfront. \nNUMBER 6 - \"CHECKMATE\"  EDITION \nThis edition of NUMBER 6 figure sports the multi-colored cloak worn in during the living chess game in the episode \"Checkmate\" complete with the chess staff, as seen in the series. \nNUMBER 6 - CARDED 4 FIGURE BUNDLE \nThis reward tier includes all four carded versions of NUMBER 6 including the \"Arrival\" variant only available on Kickstarter. \n\nNUMBER 6 - LIMITED EDITION ROVER PACKAGE   \nNo discussion of THE PRISONER is complete without mention of the Village's spherical guardian and menace, ROVER. In order to evoke the iconic moment of NUMBER 6 pushed up against the gelatinous side of the guardian, we've created a Limited Edition plastic packaging unit depicting our hero in the belly of the beast. This package is a resealable clamshell so the figure can be removed for display, then reinserted. \n\nEPISODE SETS\nIn addition to the single carded figures, we're excited to offer two figure episode sets themed after particular fan favorite episodes, complete with accessories specific to the episodes.\n \"FREE FOR ALL\" TWO-PACK SET \nThis 2-figure set features both NUMBER 6 and NUMBER 2 (as played by Eric Portman, \"Everest, I presume...\"). The accessories include NUMBER 6's hat, bullhorn and election poster from the episode, as well as phones from NUMBER 2's office.\n\n\"SCHIZOID MAN\" TWO-PACK SET  \nThis 2-figure set features both NUMBER 6 as well as his doppelganger NUMBER 12 (also played by Patrick McGoohan, but with a color-reverse white jacket with black piping). The accessories include two fencing foils, two fencing helmets, and two marksman pistols, as well as miniature versions of NUMBER 24's psychic testing \"Zener cards\", so that you can hold your own contest to determine which figure is the real NUMBER 6.\n\n2 TWO-PACK BUNDLE + ARRIVAL EXCLUSIVE   \nThis bundle includes BOTH \"SCHIZOID MAN\" and \"FREE FOR ALL\" TWO-PACKS plus the  KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE \"ARRIVAL\" NUMBER 6 and any STRETCH GOALS unlocked!\n\nDEGREE ABSOLUTE - The \"ALL IN\" PLEDGE including an EXCLUSIVE Wandering Planet designed THE PRISONER T-Shirt. \n The \"ALL IN\" pledge for this Prisoner Action Figure campaign. Show your love of The Prisoner and your support for this unique product line by going on in... DEGREE ABSOLUTE. In addition to the full wave one product range you'll also receive this exclusive THE PRISONER T-SHIRT designed by Wandering Planet Toys and only available at this reward tier. Help us celebrate the long-awaited launch of the first official line of THE PRISONER action figures, the Arrival figure and T-Shirt will not be available anywhere else!\n\nUPDATE: STRETCH GOAL #1 - UNLOCKED!!!\nWho is Number 1? ...That would be telling... We can, however, let you know at the FIRST STRETCH GOAL of the campaign has been announced. It's a PENNYFARTHING FIGURE STAND. The stand will be pegged to match pegholes in the bottom of the figure.  It will UNLOCK AT $60,000 and will be added FREE to any pledge at the $40 \"Rover\" level or above! \nUPDATE: STRETCH GOAL #2 - UNLOCKED!!!\nORANGE ALERT!  Warn Number 6 and the rest of your action figures, our inflatable ROVER has been unlocked and unleashed! No action figure is safe. You shall not escape the toy shelf (or Village). \nUPDATE #3 - FINAL STRETCH GOAL - UNLOCKED!!!\nThe multi-figure diorama display stand has been unlocked and will come free with every pledge at the Degree Absolute level. It is also now available for purchase as an add-on!\nThe Painted Prototypes\nHand painted prototypes of Number 6 and Number 2 from \"Free For All\"\nTIMELINE\nAs you can see from the above images, Wave 1 of THE PRISONER action figures are far along in development. The figures have been sculpted, the packaging has been designed, and approvals have already been granted by our partners at ITV. Once our Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign successfully completes we will be able to ship all specifications to our factory partners in China, in order to commence tooling and molding.\nIn total we expect the manufacturing process to take approximately TEN MONTHS, with product ready to ship as of Mid-March 2022. \nAN IMPORTANT NOTE ON SHIPPING\nPRISONER fans are a global community with fans in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Japan, and all across the world, which is WONDERFUL! But which also makes calculating potential shipping costs very difficult. As such, please note that ALL REWARD TIERS DO NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING. Once the toys are in hand and ready to ship, you'll receive a backerkit notification that will allow you to designate where you want your toys shipped and YOU WILL PAY FOR SHIPPING SEPARATELY AT THAT TIME.\nHONORING THE LANDMARK TV SERIES\nTHE PRISONER is quintessential cult TV. Depending on the viewer it can be seen as a stylish spy drama, a allegorical social commentary, a paranoid conspiracy thriller, or even a piece of avant-garde filmmaking. Our Wave 1 toys, as well as any future releases in this line, are dedicated the idea of honoring the series and contributing to its fandom. We hope that all our fellow fans will join with us to make this line a reality!\n\nBE SEEING YOU\u2026\nCa-chung!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThanks to this global pandemic that we're still collectively dragging ourselves out of, we all realize that unforeseen circumstances could alter expectations, slow the completion of the project, delay shipping, etc...

So let your favorite retailer know that they can get JON SABLE, FREELANCE Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus Volume 1 before anyone else!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nRETURN OF A CLASSIC FOR A NEW GENERATION\nMike Grell's JON SABLE, FREELANCE was a trailblazing comic book in the 1980s. \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE, the story of a former African hunter in the concrete jungle, was one of the earliest successes among independent comics of the 1980s.  A top seller, SABLE often saw higher sales and critical praise than Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Avengers, and many other mainstay titles. It was one of the comics of the era that helped redefine what the medium could achieve.\nAfter successful Kickstarter campaigns to revive Mike Grell\u2019s MAGGIE THE CAT and his collaboration with actor/writer Mark Ryan on THE PILGRIM, Grell\u2019s Masterstroke Studios imprint is giving one of his most popular creations a massive new release: JON SABLE, FREELANCE.\nIt is notable that SABLE has never gotten the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus treatment it deserves. IDW released a series of trade paperbacks in the early 2000s, and Comicmix published smaller sized paperback omnibus editions in the last decade. Masterstroke is upping the game by going for over-sized editions that will be definitive versions of the legendary series.\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nHERE'S THE PLAN:\nOver the next couple of years, Masterstroke Studios will be releasing JON SABLE, FREELANCE, the definitive omnibus collection in 5 volumes, with the final volume being launched in time for Mike Grell's 75th birthday in September of 2022.\n\nEach volume will consist of approximately 400 pages of content, including all of the issues, all of the covers, and heaps of bonus materials (some never before seen). These editions will be over-sized (think DC Absolute Editions), showing the pages bigger than they have ever been seen before. Each volume will have a dustjacket with new art by Mike Grell. Key issues will have commentary from Grell about the story and behind the scenes insights. And there will be lots of other goodies thrown in as well (including a companion book of original letters column pages, old house ads, and other rare bits and pieces from the history of JON SABLE, FREELANCE!)\n\nVOLUME 1 covers issues #1 - #13, completing the first major story arc of Sable, from his origins as an Olympic athlete, to his life and lose living with his family in Africa, to his personal death wish as a gun-for-hire upon his return to America. The first volume concludes with Sable's return to Vietnam to find a man missing in action.\n\nGrell's gritty, yet emotionally grounded tales are a slice of mid-1980s current events, politics and intrigue, blended with action and adventure. The entire series is a unique time capsule of an era, while also remaining relevant and fresh for a new generation. \n\nTHIS KICKSTARTER\nThis is where it all begins. This Kickstarter is to fund the creation and production of Volume 1 (and possibly Volume 2 if we cross $100K on this campaign) of the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus series.\nWe've spent months planning every detail of this campaign to make it as efficient and straightforward as possible.\n\nWe've set the price point at a comparable retail market price for other similar volumes rather than elevate the price point on Kickstarter, as so many projects do.  It is not uncommon to pay upwards of $30 for a single issue of a comic on Kickstarter (which is based on the cost of creation for writers and artists. Comics are not cheap to create and publish, no doubt about it). But since this material already exists, the costs are a bit lower for us. This means we can focus on making the presentation of the material the best it can be. We can also begin advance work on the next volumes, as we prepare to launch them in the coming months.\n\nWe see fans who contribute to projects get frustrated when they see the same books available months later for a fraction of what they pledged. And while these editions will be made widely available later on down the line, you will pay the same price to support it here that you would to buy it next year in your local comic shops and other retailers. AND... these editions will contain Kickstarter exclusive aspects that those others won't. These will be the first, and rarest versions of the omnibus set, guaranteed. \nA unique page of art in the front of the book will be exclusive to this Kickstarter, and some copies of this Kickstarter backed volume will come with an exclusive bookplate that will be signed and numbered. As well, the names of backers of this project will be listed in the back of the book, thanking them for their frontline support of Mike Grell's work. As well, some fans can get special recognition, including sketches of their likenesses being used for an exclusive trading card set! \nThere are many perks beyond just getting the book. You can get a limited number of original Grell commissioned sketches (some of them inside the book itself, making your copy all the more unique).\n\nThis is a massive project that we're breaking up over two years and five volumes, that, when complete, will be the final word on the original JON SABLE adventures.\nEarly bird pricing saves you even more. If you pledge in the first 48 hours, you end up saving an additional $25 on the book, which will retail for $100 down the road when offered for Local Comic Shops.\n\nWhat you get: \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE Masterstroke Edition Volume 1.\nThere are many other pledge levels that include sketches, other Masterstroke publications you may have missed, and a whole host of other unique opportunities to be backers at higher levels and get even more out of this amazing project!\nAs we surpass our funding goal, and unlock Stretch Goals, there are even more great surprises in store, from trading cards, a Sable poster, a feature length Mike Grell video interview, trading cards, art portfolio prints, and even a chance to get Volume 2 of the omnibus set at a discounted rate after we pass a certain funding goal.\nLots of cool things await! And this is just the beginning.\n\nEARLY BIRD BACKER BONUS!\nThe first 100 Backers will get an exclusive Sable art print by Mike Grell that will be exclusive to this campaign! A one of a kind (well, one of one hundred) piece, this will be a great bonus for fans!\n\n DID YOU MISS THE OTHER MASTERSTROKE KICKSTARTERS?\nFear not! You can catch up on everything Grell right here with this campaign.\nThat's right. You will be able to get Maggie The Cat, The Pilgrim, Jon Sable black and white bonus comic, Rules of The Hunt, The Mike Grell Sketchbook, The Legion of Super Heroes Sketchbook and Sketch Cards, and more!\nThere's a pledge level that catches you up, but we will also be announcing ways to add on individual items you may have missed along the way!\n\nSOME OTHER SURPRISES AWAIT\nWorking from original plates of the page art, Mike Grell will be able to go back into select issues and pages, and clean up some of the art, making it sharper, clearer, and better looking than ever before.\nWe're mindful of not altering the original art, but rather we are planning to lovingly improve the art, colors and pages where needed to make this the best looking, and most definitive version of Sable.\nIn future volumes of the set, there will new color added to some issues, as well as new artwork. (Keep reading...)\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nEach of the planned five volumes will clock in at around 400 pages. They will be larger than we\u2019ve ever seen SABLE, measuring approximately 8.5 by 12.25 inches (the same size as the DC Comics Absolute Edition releases) with glossy interior pages, rare materials (including never before seen artwork), all new covers, and dust jackets that will line up to form a complete image when placed in order on a shelf. Each volume will retail for $100.\n\nJON SABLE'S Back!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nThat's right! Mike Grell's classic is making a triumphant return in a deluxe hardcover format for the first time!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nThe original cover to JSF #1 from First Comics back in 1982!\nA gallery of original covers for the issues that will be contained within Volume 1\n This two page spread from Jon Sable, Freelance #1 has been lovingly preserved, while also increasing the quality from the original newsprint pages to a bright glossy finish! This is the best Sable has ever looked!\n The original cover to the SABEL novel from 2000. It has been revised and re-edited for an all new release, and you can get it digitally though this campaign!\n\n But it shouldn't scare you, the fans! It should excite you! Jon Sable's triumphant return will be a FAN driven publication! By the fans, for the fans! This is the ultimate presentation of JON SABLE!\nThis is how the original series stacks up. Now, imagine it bigger, bolder, brighter, and more badass than ever before! \n\n THE FUTURE\nWith 5 total volumes needed to collect the entire run of 56 original issues, 12 additional issues, and other bonus appearances (anyone remember Mike Grell's 5 page in \"Word Warriors\" literacy awareness comic in 1987? How about that 5 page Hero Initiative benefit comic in 2014? The black and white \"Rules Of The Hunt\" bonus comic from the \"Maggie The Cat\" Kickstarter? Yes, we will have it ALL!) of Jon Sable, each volume will be approximately 400 pages in length, with extensive bonuses.\n\nAstute fans will recall that late in the original run of JSF, Mike Grell left the art chores behind, bringing in a host of talented artists to draw the issues. They were all great artists in their own right, but it just wasn't the same without Grell at the pencil.\n\nWell, we're about to make an announcement that will blow the minds of fans:\nVolumes 4 and 5 of this omnibus series will feature issues of JSF, redrawn by Mike Grell himself!\nWe've got Stephen B Scott along to assist with finishes to Mike's pencils for some of the backgrounds and some of the issues. Mike will be fully drawing several of the key issues, and providing pencils for the rest. This will be like seeing 13 issues worth of JSF the way that they were meant to be, for the first time in over 30 years! This is a unique opportunity for Mike to go back and do those issues the way he envisioned them from the start!\nI'm excited just typing that. Honestly, as a fan (and editor for the project) I feel like we're going to discover a lost treasure of Mike Grell art! And I don't know of any other instances of artists reaching that far back and redrawing whole issues of comics.\n\nBut it all starts here, with Volume 1. We need to fund this project, and get the printing presses rolling on this set of omnibus editions. In many ways, this campaign will be the foundation upon which all future Mike Grell Masterstroke Studios projects will be built. So, we need you, the fans, now more than ever! The more successful this initial campaign is, the more poised for bringing you the absolute, ultimate, best SABLE possible.\nThis is the moment all Grell fans have been waiting for!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $56,000! When we hit this goal, we will include an exclusive JON SABLE Omnibus collection bookmark, and an exclusive Kickstarter JON SABLE sketch card from Mike Grell!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $58,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a digital video file of a nearly 2 hour live filmed docu-interview with Mike Grell, filmed in 2018!

This \"Inside The Actors Studio\" type interview is a perfect companion to the Eisner Award nominated \"Life Is Drawing WIthout An Eraser\" book from TwoMorrows Publishing! A must for Grell fans. (If we cross $100K, look for this film to go from downloadable, to a full DVD!)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3: $60,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a JON SABLE Companion, volume 1. This will include reprints of all the original letters pages from the issues within this volume, as well as a Who's Who style section of characters, and a guide to guns as seen and used in the pages of this volume, plus more bonus content like rare in-house ads from the original run, etc. A unique companion to the omnibus collection! 24 pages of color and black and white images!\nSTRETCH GOAL #4: $65,000!  When we hit this goal, we will include the first set (in 5 total sets) of JON SABLE FREELANCE trading cards! Unique collectibles, with characters from the series. By the time we produce all 5 volumes, you'll have a full set of  25 cards, but it all starts with this initial set of cards.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5: $70,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a brand new Mike Grell Jon Sable art print that will have a classic cinema poster look to it akin to classic James Bond film posters!

Once all 5 volumes of the omnibus are finished, there will be a full portfolio (in a unique slipcase) of 10 art prints. \nAND WE HAVE EVEN MORE STRETCH GOALS PLANNED, SO KEEP AN EYE OUT....\nWe have some MAJOR plans for Stretch Goals that go up to $100,000, and include some amazing items! So help us get funded, and we will reveal a new Stretch Goal each day over the next 5 days following hitting our funding goal!\n* Note: Stretch Goal rewards are only available to backers who pledge on physical levels, not digital.\n\nMILESTONE GOALS:\nBe sure and keep an eye out for bonus items being offered when we hit certain milestones along the way!

Ever since then we have been great friends and worked on many projects over the the years. When I approached Stuart about working on a satanic pack of cards he was immediately interested. The satanic symbolism is very subtle in its workings and Stuart understands this nuance on an artistic level and as a mentalist. When I saw the first draft of the King of Clubs I was blown away. His first deck \"Gnostic Playing Cards'  came out out perfect and was a success. After I had a few more cards were done we got the endorsement from The Church of Satan. This pack is an acknowledgment of the cards being \"The Devils Picturebook\" and also as a celebration of the Satanic Bible's 50th anniversary! I hope you enjoy them and the process we will be sharing as we create this deck of cards with your help!\n\nStretch Goals!\n5K- Three extra cards for performing \"Three Card Monte\"\n15K - Limited Edition Red Backs\n30k - Rainbow Limited Edition Deck.\n\nFIND OUR WEBSITE HERE", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe take risks and challenges everyday in our lives and we have gone far!

Full color art, pencils AND inks in one oversized edition!\nTo the Exceptional People who continue to support NEXUS\nFive years ago, Rude Dude Productions reintroduced something that the world of publishing had thought virtually extinct; the full-page Sunday newspaper adventure strip. For a while, I\u2019ve been asking, \u201cWhat happened to the American comic strip?\u201d Reduced almost microscopically by the 1970\u2019s, I\u2019ve wondered the same. So, with no one limiting us but ourselves, we began adapting the award-winning Nexus comic book into a Sunday newspaper strip. With over 100 individual strips drawn on 13\u201d x 19\u201d bristol, we printed these new Nexus adventures, four strips at a time, to the exact size of an actual newspaper. For subscribers, we mailed them directly to your front doors.\nThough the strips have been finished before we even began printing, the paper itself lasted only 7 issues. With the many strips that never saw print, we\u2019re happy to finally announce that the entirety of these Nexus strips will now be published in one massive collection, which we\u2019re offering in two ways:\n 1. As an oversized Deluxe Hardcover \n 2. And in the traditional-sized Trade Paperback \nThose of you who subscribed to the Nexus comic strip when they were released in 2016, hopefully saw something more than just an exciting read and old-style service. It was the return to something that people hadn\u2019t seen since the 1950\u2019s. For 60 years, everyone from Wall-Streeters to Dust-Bowlers looked forward to the Sunday comics section, and every newspaper stand in America and around the world carried it.\nWHY THE COMIC STRIP FORMAT?\nMike Allred's granddaughter reading the full size Nexus Comic Strip Newspaper!\nHow many of you miss the simple excitement from these bygone years, and wished it would return? As two creators that entered the comic field in 1981, publisher and artist Steve Rude, along with partner and Nexus creator Mike Baron, wanted to move our industry forward by returning to something that made the popularity of comics what it was. It was time for someone to revive the excitement of the Adventure strips, and we\u2019d begin by adapting it to our longtime creation Nexus. \nOther than a few tried and true strips of yesteryear, such as Prince Valiant and the Phantom, the full page format that comic strips once enjoyed doesn\u2019t exist. The syndicates that still own them have little interest in promoting anything old or new.\nFar Side creator, Gary Larson, when asked about the enjoyment people got from reading his zany strip, once told us, \"Well, it's not like the people who draw comic strips are curing cancer or anything.\"\nFor a long time, I thought about what Larson had said. Here\u2019s my conclusion:\nWhile everyone goes through their daily paces, dealing with everything life throws at us, there are still things, often during the briefest passing moments, that might still considered miraculous. Anything that might temporarily lift our spirits, help us forget life\u2019s trials, and give us a chance to dream again.  Along with that might be having something to look forward to.\nThe weekly comic strip adventures of Nexus is our humble offering to that belief. For those subscribers who wanted to know how the story finally ends, or to the many who have been reading it online at Patreon.com/steverude, these strips are now available.\nLook for the Nexus adventure strips now in deluxe hardcover and those always popular TPB\u2019s.\nInto the light and forward to the future,\nSteve Rude\nArtist and publisher\n=================================================================\nTo streamline the design process and give more interest to both versions, we have 2 different designers working on the Hardcover and Trade Paperback versions!  \nThey also have different contents with the Deluxe Hardcover being more of an ARTISTS EDITION and the Trade Paperback featuring extra stories.\n=================================================================\nWHAT'S INSIDE:\n DIGITAL AND PRINTED COPIES WILL HAVE THE SAME CONTENT\n\nNexus Origin and the Fully Painted Sundra Story are extras included for the TPB only.  We do not have them in the Deluxe as we were trying to keep the page count down.\n\n\n SHIPPING\nShipping will be calculated during checkout so we can better deal with added on items and customized packages.  See table below for estimated shipping costs.  You may choose to increase your pledge by the estimated amount if you do not wish to pay via BackerKit during checkout.

Signatures are PER ITEM.  $5 Baron, $5 Rude, $10 Personalized.  Limited and Art edition books have the signed plate includes so they would just pay the $10 Personalized fee for us to unwrap the book and have it personalized.\n          When you pre-purchase a signature, it will show up as a CREDIT when you check out once the campaign ends.  During checkout we will ask for each item...\n$0 Unsigned\n$5 Signed by Rude\n$10 Signed by Baron & Rude\n$15 Signed & Personalized by Rude\n$20 Signed & Personalized by Baron & Rude\nWe will be adding art daily.

For this 90 page comic that was a whopping $54,000 that we've already paid out of pocket!\nWe break even at $150,000 before fees.  \nWHAT DOES FUNDING SUCCESS MEAN?\nIf we can successfully reach $150,000 in funding we can recoup our costs AND fund the next book! \nTHUNEWORLD - COMING 2021 WITH YOUR HELP\nPRINTING TIMELINE\nKickstarter pays 2 weeks after end date and that is when we are able to submit files to the printer.  From there we anticipate 10-12 weeks for approvals, printing, and shipping.  That puts us with a ship date of March.\nWANT EXTRA ITEMS FOR CHRISTMAS?\n-You will receive a printed 5x7 certificate for each book you ordered\n-You will also receive a digital version\n-You will receive a set of 10 cards with envelopes\n-You will receive your order (without Gourmando books) shipped to arrive before Christmas\n-The books will ship when they arrive in house, anticipated March 2021\n5x7\" Certificate when you choose \"I Want it for Christmas\"\nSet of ten (10) 5x7 greeting cards when you choose \"I Want it for Christmas\".

We skipped the past 5 years due to a death in the family and our son, Brandon, spent over a year in and out of the hospital.  We're finally back and creating a sketchbook to span the missing 5 years.\nTo keep costs down and still bring in the high quality, we are starting with a page count of 128 pages.  For each $5,000 raised over our goal we will add 8 pages so the final page count is up to our supporters!\nAFFORDABLE QUALITY\nAnyone who has ever ordered from us knows we care about the quality.  This is not a \"kinkos\" handmade sketchbook.  All our books (and everything we do) is top quality, professionally printed, thick stock, archival safe and we spend thousands on sturdy shipping containers, mailers, tubes, and packing to get those items to you safely.  If something arrives damaged we will replace it on request.  Back us and support quality and high standards.  We also don't want to overprice anything.  Sure, we could price basic levels at $100, but we like to keep things affordable.\nGET IN EARLY, SAVE MORE\nIn an effort to minimize cost we are rewarding our earliest backers with \"at cost\" pricing.  We don't scrimp on quality or packaging so you are paying for thicker stock, professionally printed items and sturdy packing to get your items to you safely.\n CURRENT CHALLENGES\n $40,000 for the Challenge Coin which is currently being designed.  \n1,000 Backers - We will include a set of 10 5x7 postcards plus a large sticker FOR THE FIRST 1,000 BACKERS ONLY.  Steve will draw 10 sketches on a postcard that looks like the blank cover and they will randomly go out in postcard sets\nEXTRA BIRTHDAY BONUS\nWe were asked to include the Nexus Family Portrait in a goal that's reachable!\nSO....Everyone who backed by 11:59pm PST May 19th will receive a Nexus Family Portrait bonus print!

I created Nexus with Steve Rude in 1981.\nNexus, the Cosmic Avenger, faces Gourmando, a vast, alien entity that consumes civilizations. Its herald Gnosis swoops the cosmos on a silver board seeding worlds to make them edible. While Gourmando threatens Nexus' home planet Ylum, Nexus is on Earth executing mass murderers. This is his job. Torn between his duties and the survival of his planet, Nexus must reach deep within himself to save Ylum. The novel is loosely based on a storyline I worked out with Steve Rude, which will be published next year by Dark Horse. The novel is different from the graphic novel, and covers Ylum and its colorful cast of characters in much greater depth. Years ago, Rude asked me what Nexus story I would most like to pursue. Nexus versus Galactus, I said. Marvel owns Galactus, so we created our own planet-devouring monster.\nI am a two-time Eisner and Inkpot winner, creator of Nexus and Badger. I have written Punisher, Flash, and Star Wars. Ten years ago I began writing novels. Kevin J.

His love of tattoos, especially traditional American flash, is apparent in his 3 sets of sold-out tattoo flash, \"Stewed Screwed and Tattooed,\" \"Done While Drunk,\" and \"From the Bottom of the Barrel.\" Many of the designs were collected in the bestselling Last Gasp book, \"Mitch O'Connell Tattoos,\" now in it's 5th printing. Those designs were also brought to life by thousands of talented tattooists on thousands of satisfied customers. He curated shows at Chicago's \"Tattoo Factory Gallery\" for two years, including the famous \"Tura! Tura! Tura!\" exhibit, a tribute to Tura Satana. Most recently he curated \"Ghoul Power!\" a huge artistic tribute to Detroit's very own beloved tv horror host, The Ghoul.

CONTINUE OUR LEGACY BY HELPING TO FINANCE OUR SPRING-SUMMER SEASON, AND BE A PART OF THE COMPANY THAT HAS PUBLISHED MORE GREAT CARTOONISTS THAN ANY PUBLISHER IN THE HISTORY OF COMICS.\n2013 has been a particularly hard year for all of us at Fantagraphics Books. Earlier in the year, one of our founding partners, Kim Thompson, was diagnosed with lung cancer and died four and a half months later, on June 19. Because Kim was such an active part of our company, his death has had repercussions \u2014 emotionally, of course, but financially as well. Kim edited our European graphic novel line and as a result of his illness, 13 of his books scheduled for the Spring-Summer season had to be cancelled or postponed, representing the loss of nearly a third of that season. Our fixed costs stayed the same \u2014because they\u2019re fixed\u2014 but the income 13 books would\u2019ve generated was lost, disrupting our cash flow, and leaving us in a tight spot. Many, if not most of them, will be re-scheduled (Jacques Tardi\u2019s Run Like Crazy, Run Like Hell is scheduled for July 2014, for example) but in the meantime, we\u2019ve suffered a severe shortfall that will impede our ability to produce next season\u2019s books. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking our faithful readers and new converts alike to help us recoup \u2014 and help finance our next season\u2019s books. The money you contribute will go toward production, design, marketing, and printing our books.\nOUR NEXT SEASON: April-August 2014\nOur Spring-Summer season comprises 39 books by a stellar line-up of cartoonists. We\u2019re biased, but we think it\u2019s possibly our best ever. There are a number of books from names familiar to longtime Fantagraphics readers \u2014 do Peter Bagge, Dan Clowes, Joe Sacco, Drew Friedman, Michael Kupperman, Jim Woodring, Don Rosa, Tony Millionaire, or Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez ring a bell? \u2014not to mention any number of other names that could anchor a comics Hall of Fame: Charles Schulz, Steve Ditko, Simon & Kirby, Hal Foster, Carl Barks, Floyd Gottfredson, L.B. Cole, Jacques Tardi, Joihn Severin, S. Clay Wilson, Wally Wood, and more. We also have one of our strongest seasons of original graphic novels ever, including new greaphic novels from Olivier Schrauwen, Simon Hanselmann, Esther Pearl Watson, Conor Stechschulte, Carol Swain, Lane Milburn, Eleanor Davis, and Ed Piskor.\nFrom The Complete witzend to The Complete Eightball, Buddy Bradley to Megg & Mogg, and Don Rosa\u2019s ducks to S. Clay Wilson\u2019s pirates, not to mention new Peanuts, Disney, EC and Love and Rockets books, our 2014 lineup truly features The World\u2019s Greatest Cartoonists.\nAnd that's merely one publishing season of five months; we publish a virtual pantheon of cartoonists every season. This isn\u2019t about a single cartoonist or book, but a critical mass of work by a group of utterly amazing intergenerational cartoonists. Help us keep this flag flying.\nOUR BONAFIDES:\nWe don\u2019t want to bore you with a list of what we\u2019ve accomplished over the nearly four decades that we have been publishing. Many of you know who we are, but for those of you who don\u2019t and those of you who have forgotten:\nGary Groth started co-publishing The Comics Journal, now the longest running print magazine about comics, in 1976. It was the beginning of a quixotic venture: Our immediate goals were to publish advocacy journalism and serious criticism, elevate the artistry of comics, and fight for creator rights. In short, to declare war on the creative mediocrity that dominated mainstream comics at the time as well as on the greedy corporate policies of the major companies. This was a time when artists had virtually no alternatives to Marvel and DC, when the underground comix distribution system had effectively collapsed, and when there were no alternative publishers.\nAfter four or five years of encouraging independent and alternative cartoonists (and chastising mainstream comics companies), we took a big risk by putting our meager money where our enormous mouths were and published a number of emerging, then-unknown cartoonists in rapid succession throughout the 1980s: Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, Peter Bagge, Dan Clowes, and Joe Sacco, among others. We wanted to complement our criticism of the status quo by publishing comics that reflected our commitment to the art form. We also began publishing collections reprinting newspaper strips like Popeye and Prince Valiant, and collections of work by such artists as R. Crumb, Jules Feiffer, Ralph Steadman, Spain Rodriguez, Vaughn Bode, and many others in the underground counter-cultural tradition. We have been unwavering in our devotion to honoring the history of cartooning and championing the next generation(s) of cartoonists.\nOUR MISSION:\nIn a world of throw-away art, filled to overflowing with comics that are trite, jejune, juvenile, and thoughtless, we\u2019ve always wanted to publish comics that will endure, and have consistently published cartoonists who pushed the boundaries of the expressive possibilities of the form.\nWe have been waving the banner of cartooning for almost 40 years now, and our always believed in its artistic potential\u2014 in its power and subtlety, its vast capaciousness and intimate smallness, its ability to transport us to different worlds or express the human heart in conflict with itself, its ability to vivify political and historical events or reveal intimate autobiographical truths, its hilariously vulgar humor or its moving urban dramas.\nTHE PERENNIAL STRUGGLE\nWe are not going to bullshit you. If we were a big corporate publisher (or perhaps an avaricious smaller one), we\u2019d have plenty of money to weather this temporary crisis. But, we\u2019re not. Ours is and always has been an intrinsically difficult commercial enterprise, and we have survived due to a combination of good taste, sheer will, good luck, and reasonable business acumen. Still, it has never been easy. Fantagraphics has always been a guerilla publisher \u2014 lean and mean. In order to do what we do, we\u2019ve always kept our overhead low and our lifestyle modest. No fancy offices, no limousines, no frills. We publish 100 books a year with a staff of 20 \u2014 a level of efficiency unheard of in corporate publishing. We work hard! We would never be mistaken for a bottom-line oriented, bean-counting commercial publisher with their blockbuster mentality, bloated budgets, and eagerness to pander to the lowest common denominator of consumers. We pride ourselves on taking risks, publishing work based on merit, and a commitment to serious artistic standards.\nAnd we take pride in our professionalism; we are a publisher with a highly skilled, dedicated, and passionate staff, who shares our values and the values of our authors, believes deeply in what they do, and who edits, designs, and markets our author\u2019s books with great love and care. We have created an infrastructure that is specifically tailored to sell the kinds of books we publish \u2014 great works of comics, art, and literature. But, this infrastructure costs money and it\u2019s not always commensurate with the fluctuations of income from selling books.  Our fixed costs stay the same throughout the year: rent, payroll, health care premiums (over $1 million paid over the last 15 years!), utilities, etc.  But, the postponement or cancellation of so many books in a single season causes a precipitous drop in income.\nWe have always managed to weather the lean times. Sometimes wealthy patrons have loaned us money and on one or two occasions we have campaigned directly to you, our readers, pre-Kickstarter, and asked you to buy books when we were on the edge. We have throughout our history flirted with the idea of looking for an investor, but rejected it on principle: unless someone invested in us in the spirit of being a patron of the arts \u2014highly unlikely\u2014 that way leads not only to madness but to the slow erosion of the core principles the company was founded on. (Does everyone remember what happened to Kitchen Sink Press when investors got their claws into them?).\nWe\u2019ve has never existed comfortably within the traditional capitalist model\u2014 ruthlessly competitive, obsessed with growth and the endless accumulation of surplus money.  Our artistic values have always tempered our profitability. Fantagraphics has always managed to scrape by, but we realized that with the advent of crowd sourcing, we are in a position to make an end-run around the most brutish strictures of the marketplace and appeal directly to our readers. We now live in a world where artists as diverse as Spike Lee and Amanda Palmer can ask their fans to help finance their art and, in that same spirit, we are asking you to help us continue this quixotic enterprise. \nPlease visit the catalog over at the Fantagraphics website for a more in-depth description of each book!\nNewest premiums added at the top!\nCOMPLETE CRUMB COMICS SIGNED BY R.

This is going to be a lot of fun.\n   I am self-publishing a hardback, limited art book, THRILLING VISIONS Vol. 2, that will collect years worth of unseen sketches, unused covers, erratic doodles and a host of experimental drawings from my wonderfully ridiculous career. \n   From the New Wave surrealist FLAMING CARROT COMICS, to the MYSTERYMEN comics and movie, to the award winning GUMBY COMICS series, you will get behind the scenes and see whats been swept under the carpet and lost in the files until now. \n   Also we'll feature art from new projects, revolutionary new characters concepts, and \"new hope for a nation suffocating in the swill of its own mediocrity\". \n   This is a once in a lifetime compendium of the detritus, flotsam and surreal cacophonies from the fringes and borderlands of a mind in the furthest orbit. (Mine.)\n   Also I'll be including, here and there, 1 & 2 page text pieces of recollections, lessons, anecdotes, insights into the drawings, and surreal tirades, all placed interstitially between the art. \n   Compiling this book has been a labor of love over the last few years and a greater and greater obsession as the work progressed. It is a visual memoir of my journey as an artist and writer across the last half of the 20th century and into this one. It is an expedition of discovery and nostalgia - beauty and horror - charm and impudence - and while perhaps deeply personal, you will find it universal in appeal and, I hope, something to share with those, the most special in your life. \n   From the book's introduction: \"My story is that of a simple laborer, a craftsman, often idle, who wandered off the trail. I was a curious pilgrim, who dabbled in the unknown for a living and played with fire. I was a journeyman, who conjured spells and fantasms, with a pencil and a brush, without regard for the judgments and consequences that came to follow me. \n   \"All these years I have worked in the shadows... I have haunted the nightmare junkyards and creative ghost towns and I have rejoiced in the deepest curls of night with my \"craft and sullen art\". \n   \"You shall come with me now and feast on the mysteries and roll in the ecstasies... for it is written, spelled out in dead bumble bees on the sidewalk, or on Twitter or Facebook or something... Go tell the Spartans: operators are standing by.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is about self publishing, confronting American literature's boring, corporatized mainstream and having a lot of fun doing it.\n\nWhile age, time and responsibilities have limited my comic work in recent years, I feel I must keep the lifeline open to my loyal readers who have followed me over the years, and Kickstarter will help solve that challenge right now. The comic book marketplace has suffered from the recession more than many other businesses, but it always was a cottage industry - like jazz or beekeeping -and, you know, everyone always needs a good laugh. \n\nMuch of this book is already scanned and done, and the drawings are done, of course, but there will be a lot of work compiling the layouts, writing all the words and producing it. For me, the greatest challenge is printing and distribution, getting the book out to people. Kickstarter makes it possible in the most efficient and personal ways.

On the other page, over Monument Valley was written 'The Dream', over Manhattan was written: 'The Reality'. And I saw right away that this was completely backwards. So my purpose as an artist is to soothe these people who turn our world up-side down for profit? These people who feel spiritually bereft after a hard day of raping and pillaging? F*ck that.

Dubbed that by modern customizers this new all plastic body would become the standard for years to come and added to all of MEGO's properties, from Action Jackson to Happy Days, Planet of the Apes to the Walton's\nnew body for the ages! (type 1 L, type 2 R)\nSince the introduction of the type 2 customizers then and now have been using this core action figure body to customize figures never made by the MEGO Corporation. These innovators have made a cottage industry out of the customization of this 8 inch format. Early visionaries like Charlee Flatt used variations of the Type 2 body to make incredible versions of 8 inch MEGO-like figures.\nCharlee Flatt's incredible MEGO like action figures\nThe 8 inch (1/9th) scale of action figure has as much, if not more, talent and as many resources as any other scale on the market today. Customizers around the world have embraced this format and taken the humble type 2 body to incredible heights!\nIf this wasn't enough, companies started reproducing these figures with modern and retro properties. Classic T.V. Toys and EMCE Toys, followed closely by my company Cast-a-Way Toys brought these back to life with a variation of the type 2 body in the modern era, and gave the community a true re-birth of classic MEGO like figures. For more information on RE-MEGO figures check out our friends at the MEGO Museum.\nCast-a-Way Toys Phantom\nCast-a-Way Type 2 bodies\nTragically as we were entering a new phase of production our molds were stolen in China. This ended our ability to provide customizers with a body and many other 1/9th scale accessories...\nNot being one to quit  I have teamed up with another incredible  company working in the 1/9th scale in ZICA toys.\nZICA toys 1/9th scale Buck Rogers\nZICA humanoid 8.0\nCraig Owen the mastermind behind the retro Buck Rogers Line and the all new super articulated Yvonne body and I have come together to collaborate on an all-new 8 inch type 2 body. Just in time for the 40th anniversary of the body that we all know and love!\nWhat better way then to celebrate that than to have a truly new 8 inch body that captures the iconic look but also brings it into the future?!\nall new type \"S' body\nWe have put our expertise together for the first time to create an all new retro body! Two trusted names in 8 inch figures united to bring you the Type \"S\" body!\n\u2022 The Mego Aesthetic: Since 1974 no other 8 inch body has had the staying power of this classic design. When you think retro 8 inch scale figures, you think the type 2 Mego body. The success of the re-mego movement has been tied closely to this design, because it captures the charm of the 70\u2019s and yet it\u2019s still timeless and as versatile as any modern action-figure. We knew we wanted to capture the classic look of the Type 2, so there was no doubt for the look of this new body.\n\u2022 Superior Construction: If the Mego type 2 has any faults it\u2019s its rubber band construction. What was cutting edge in 1974 isn\u2019t really up to today\u2019s standards. The tension that holds the body together is also its own worst enemy. The arms can\u2019t rise past 45 degrees to the side, the tension can cause for a cross legged look if too tight, articulation tends to spring back, and rubber bands don\u2019t last forever\u2026 With this in mind we decided to opt for a modern solid construction (Type \"S\" for Solid). This allows for independent articulation on the arms legs and waist. This independent articulation means no tension on the joints, no spring-back and overall superior pose-ability.\nSolid Body Construction\n\u2022 Increased Articulation: The greatest opportunity in re-designing this classic body comes in adding some extra articulation. Without taking away from the look we carefully added some extra articulation points to make this classic body even better! The original 16 points of articulation was boosted to 22! Including better shoulder articulation, swivels at the elbow and removable feet. Now your classic figure can hold more modern poses!\n\u2022 Ease of Customization: The reason this body has been around for 40 years is because anyone can make his own action figure! Swap the head and costume and you have whole new hero! What\u2019s better than taking something and making it your own? Nothing\u2026 this is what keeps a 40 year old toy line alive to this day. With this in mind we didn\u2019t want to change a thing, except to make it easier! This new design utilizes a screw a part chest for ease of customization. Rotocast, resin, injection molded? All heads fit on this new body. No more working that head in, no more neck plug sanding, just unscrew the chest and put in any compatible head. Looking to the future, we plan to take this body to the next level of customization. With newer, bigger chests, bigger arms, different hands and feet customizers will be able to make this body into just about any character they can imagine!\n\u2022 100 percent compatibility: In the 70\u2019s there were no less than 5 major companies making 8 inch action-figures: AHI, Tomland, Lincoln, LJN and our Beloved MEGO. They made Action Jackson, WGSH, SWAT, EMERGENCY, and every kind of Monster imaginable! This legacy left us with a wealth of compatible parts and pieces. In the Modern era things absolutely exploded! Pioneers like Doc Mego, Figures Toy Company and new comers like, Classic T.V. Toys, EMCE/Bif Bang Pow, Cast-a-Way Toys, and ZICA, have produced resources available to the customizer that rivals any other action-figure format on the market! When you add talented tailors, sculptors, packagers, and \u201cresin slingers\u201d working in this scale, you have almost anything your heart can desire to customize with. So with all these parts available, why wouldn\u2019t you want a body that \u201cworks and plays well\u201d with all these resources? Of course you would! That\u2019s why we made this body capable of using nearly everything on the market! Heads, boots, gloves, costumes, and hands, nearly everything works on this new body.\nWe are utilizing Kick Starter to give you the opportunity to help us make this body a reality! If you want this body, here is your chance to make it happen! What will you get? How about product? plain and simple, you are pre-ordering this body, the more you buy the cheaper they get! You can get them at darn near cost! The Proto-type is done! Craig and I have a proven track record of producing. Are you ready for a better body? The only thing left is YOU!\nWhat you are funding is the \"tooling\" or steel molds used to produce these bodies. This funding will also off-set the  initial production run of bodies.\nWhat you are looking at is the prototype of the very first type \"S\" body. This prototype was made in China and represents the exact production piece to be manufactured by our factory there.\nThese parts will be molded and readied for injection molding. The parts will then be compiled into complete functioning action-figure bodies in China.\nThese completed \"blanks\"will be packaged and shipped here for final distribution. Our plan is to offer these at a retail of $10 or under to the general public via our e-commerce website. We may distribute these to other on-line and bricks and mortar stores, but will start with on-line sales. As an initial backer you can receive not only incentives in price but also limited edition t-shirts commemorating the 40th anniversary of this classic design and mini t-shirts for the figure as well. We are also including high quality vinyl stickers for you to show your support of the iconic design.\n If you love these iconic figures, customizing them, or are looking to upgrade existing re-megos then by all means join us so we can make it a reality!\n                  *STRETCH GOALS*\nThese goals represent what will reward our backers if we are fortunate enough to be funded beyond our initial goal. We know we can\u2019t do this without you, so we really want to make this a reward\u2026 Simply put; the better we do the more you get.\n\u00b7Stretch Goal #1: If we achieve funding $3000 over our goal amount, everyone who backed at a level receiving a Type \u201cS\u201d body will receive a 3 pack of injection molded (solid) heads. These fully painted heads will be compatible with the Type \u201cS\u201d body as well as other 8 inch scale bodies on the market.\n\u00b7Stretch Goal #2: If we achieve funding $6000 over our goal amount, everyone who backed at a level receiving a Type \u201cS\u201d body will receive a set (5 pair) of Original Castaway Style hero boots in 5 different colors. (plus Stretch goal #1)\n\u00b7Stretch Goal #3: If we achieve funding $10000 over our goal amount, everyone who backed at a level receiving a Type \u201cS\u201d body will receive a muscular chest and muscular shoulders for every figure they received. These add-ons make your bodies into more muscular characters and are the first of many enhancements we plan to bring to market. (plus Stretch goal #1 and #2)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we get funded you get the best retro body ever made, all the love and none of the problems!

Each of the four monsters comes with an eyewitness account right on the package! Each monster features 10-12 points of articulation and stands 5-7\" tall. \nThese creatures have been with us always. they manifest themselves in our myths, folklore and urban legends. Our fears and emotions give rise to creatures such as the Jersey Devil, Mothman, the Missouri monster and Chupacabra.\nI have been drawn to these stories my entire life. These experiences have been told by people who believed in what they saw, what they experienced. Their emotions were very raw and very real, whether or not it was a dark human form covered in fur, darting in front of their car on a moonlit night, or a pair of glowing red eyes peering at them from the shadows on the side of the road. These experiences with the unknown live on, and are still a part of the curiosity and wonder that exist within us today. It is my pleasure to share these stories with you in the form of these action figures.\nMothman:\nNovember 15, 1966 Point Pleasant, West Virginia\nWhile driving through an abandoned munitions dump \"locally known as the TNT area,\" Linda Scarberry, her husband Roger and another couple spotted a pair of glowing red eyes, two inches wide and six inches apart attached to something that was \"shaped like a man, but bigger...maybe six or seven feet tall, and it had big wings folded against its back.\" Roger accelerated their vehicle trying to escape from the creature. Much to the couples' horror, \"Mothman\" gave case, squeaking audibly as it reached speeds over 100mph. The flying monster ended pursuit only as the car neared town.\nThe Jersey Devil:\nDecember 1993 Pine Barrens, New Jersey\nForest Ranger John Irwin was driving alongside the Mullica River in southern New Jersey when he found the road blocked by a creature. Irwin describes the monster as a six foot tall bipedal animal with horns and dark fur. The ranger and \"The Jersey Devil\" stared at each other for several minutes before the creature fled into the woods.\nOrigin: Pine Barrens 1730\nThe mistress of a British soldier known as \"Mother Leeds\" went into labor with her 13th child. During the delivery she suffered agonizing pain and cursed the child, wishing it out of her body. As the hateful words faded from her lips the Jersey Devil slithered out of her womb and into the world.\nChupacabra:\nAugust 1995 Cano' Vanas, Puerto Rico\nAt 4pm Madelyne Tolentino noticed that the driver of a vehicle parked in front of her house appeared frightened. As she approached the large front window she saw a creature walking upright in front of her house with its arms outstretched. At that point she screamed, sending her mother outside of the house to chase the creature. The monster took off in a hopping motion toward the nearby woods.\nA typical Chupacabra is described as four to six feet in height covered in short fine grey hair with dark spots on the creature's back. Its powerful legs and long arms end in hands containing three to four long narrow fingers ending in claws. A series of protruding spikes run along the creature\u2019s spine.\nThe Missouri Monster:\nJuly 11, 1972 Louisiana, Missouri\nEight year old Terry Harrison was playing in the backyard when a creature appeared, splatted with blood, carrying a dog under its arm. The creature was luckily driven away by the screams of his eight year old sister Doris, who had just stepped out into the yard.\n\"Momo\" is typically described as a creature six to seven feet tall, its body covered entirely in black hair. Manlike in appearance and stance, the creature is often referred to as the \"Eastern Bigfoot.\"\nEACH MONSTER IS AVAILABLE IN 3 DIFFERENT STYLES:\nNON-GLOW: Limited to 150 per monster\nGLOW: Limited to 100 per monster\nRETRO: Limited to 50 per monster (Kickstarter only variant!)\nNON-GLOW, GLOW AND RETRO VERSIONS OF THE JERSEY DEVIL\nNON-GLOW, GLOW AND RETRO VERSIONS OF MOTHMAN\nNON-GLOW, GLOW AND RETRO VERSIONS OF CHUPACABRA\nNON-GLOW, GLOW AND RETRO VERSIONS OF MISSOURI MONSTER\nFor those of you that have already pledged: In order to add on \"sepia\" or \"glow\" versions to your existing pledge, just add $20.00 (plus shipping) per monster to your total amount.

The more we add to the base stretch goal, the better the documentary can be!\nTOY DESIGN\nI have been fortunate to work in industries that I've been passion about my entire life. The first 5 of my 15 years were spent working for the toy industry as a designer. Those were great years for me, spent with some truly talented artists working on what I loved; action figure toy lines. Over those 5 years I was able to work on many different toy lines including Spiderman, Batman, X-Men, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Star Trek, Godzilla, Small Soldiers, GI Joe and many others product lines.\nGAME DESIGN\nI believe it was fate that that lead me to my first game studio, Bethesda Softworks. While at Bethesda Softworks, I worked both as an Lead Artist and Designer on a number of games for them which included Morrowind, Oblivion, The Shivering Isles and Fallout 3. Since then I've moved to another studio and just released a game called \"XCOM: Enemy Unknown,\" where I spent the last 4 years as Lead Level Designer. I am still there as an artist and designer and my free moments are spent with my family and working on action figure toy lines like the one you see here.\nCredit: every pledge of $ 5.00 or more earns you a credit on the website \nExclusive Digital Wallpaper: Concept art created solely for Kickstarter and one of ways of thanking you for your support.\n1 Monster Action Figure: Choose 1 of the following: Mothman, The Jersey Devil, Chupacabra or The Missouri Monster\n2 Monster Action Figure: Choose 2 of the following: Mothman, The Jersey Devil, Chupacabra or The Missouri Monster\nAll 4 Monster and Victim Sets: you will receive all 4 figures: Mothman, The Jersey Devil, Chupacabra and The Missouri Monster\n1 Signed and Number Illustration: Chose 1 of the following: Mothman, The Jersey Devil, Chupacabra or The Missouri Monster.

So just what exactly is Coffin Cuties and Playnerd Magazine?\nA: Coffin Cuties and PlayNerd Magazine is a new joint project from Baltimore artists and photographers Mike Hearse and Zachary \"TuffNerd\" Morehouse.\n\nQ: Which is what kind of magazine, exactly?\nA: The short answer is a new artistic photography periodical showcasing the work of 2 beautifully twisted minds that share a love of horror, science fiction, and gorgeous women!\n\nQ: And the long answer?\nA: The magazine will be a high quality two-sided 32 page glossy photographic print publication, featuring the Horror themed pin-ups of Mike Hearse on one side, and the sexy Sci-Fi sirens of TuffNerd on the other.\n\n   The publication itself will contain content exclusive to the print version only, while future advertisements, blog articles, and promotional/event and behind the scenes videos will be available on our website, coffincuties-playnerd.com.\n   Instead of a typical magazine bloated with advertising and articles you probably don't care about, think of it as a periodical format art book, with online multimedia support. We have already begun to shoot content for the publication itself, and behind the scenes videos to make available on our website and help promote the campaign!\n\n   We decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to cover printing and distribution costs of the first issue, and any additional funds generated will be used for sets, props, and the host of other costs associated with an undertaking such as this one.

This publication contains only tasteful artistic photography with obviously staged scenes that complies with all Kickstarter rules and regulations!\n   It is a Horror and Sci-Fi concept magazine that pays homage to and is inspired by the many talented actors, directors, and artists of both genres over the years, with an overall satirical theme that gives a big wink and a nod to the \"B\" movies (B is for Best!) that helped spawn \"cult\" followings! Take our word for it, the blood is all fake, and so are (most of) the lasers and electricity!\n\nQ: Darn- oops I mean, Well I should hope so! So who the heck are these Mike Hearse and TuffNerd characters anyway?\nA: I should be shocked and/or offended by your tone, but this is actually TuffNerd writing as both 'Q' and 'A', so whatever dude, I'll pretend you don't already know.\nThis is Mike Hearse\n\nMike Hearse is Classic Horror personified. A walking encyclopedia of the macabre history of Baltimore City and avid collector of Horror memorabilia, he drives a custom hearse limousine named the Corpse Dragger which he rebuilt and modified with his own 2 graveyard dirt encrusted hands. Rumor has it he is over 300 years old.\nThe Corpse Dragger\nAs former staff photographer for a nationally known horror magazine, he has gained national notoriety and worked with some of the top horror and alternative models in the industry.\nCamera Jedi\nZach \"TuffNerd\" Morehouse is a Baltimore multimedia artist who has also been published in The Magazine That Cannot be Named, and whose credits include director and editor for RollerCon films, official videographer for the Charm City Rollergirls, Gutter Magazine, SEN Baltimore Magazine, and Baltimore City Paper. He is extremely uncomfortable talking about himself in the 3rd person, so please read what Magic Octopus Magazine had to say about him and his work! (Cover photo of Scarlett Storm and Feature article by Earl Crown)\nMagic Octopus Issue #1\nQ: So how did they come up with this crazy \"dual magazine\" idea anyway?\nA: It was destined to happen. They had known each other since, well, a long time ago, but not hung out much until a few months ago when they reconnected and realized their interests were overlapping and that joining forces might be a good idea.\n   Mike had been shooting for another publication, but also developing his own original Horror Pinup imagery, while Zach had been kicking around the idea of doing some more Sci-Fi themed shoots (his very first sale was a Sci-Fi/alter ego piece titled Zap!).\nZap!\n\n   The two had originally teamed up many years ago when Zach drew the original logo for Mike's punk scene 'zine, Devastation, and are working together again on some next level type <censored>!\nThat's right kids, we used to cut and paste pen and ink illustrations and publish with Xerox! (Without giving the exact date, I can tell you it was before Photoshop had layers.)\nQ: So who do you expect to buy this thing?\nA: People that like Horror, Sci-Fi, and babes of course! People with a sense of humor! People with a pulse! Will celebrity endorsements convince you? Cuz we got 'em!\n   Mike and Zach recently attended the Monster Mania convention in Hunt Valley along with their friend and Coffin Cutie/PlayNerd Bunnybot\u2122 Scarlett Storm to start some buzz, and met with an amazing response! \nJohn Kassir, voice of the Crypt Keeper\nJamie Kennedy loves it! (We did have to pry him off of Scarlett though)\nActor Jeremy London digs it, but for some reason wouldn't take a ride in the Hearse...\nLori Dodson, Kristina Kreep, and Cori Dials of the Zombie Pinup Calendar are all about it!\nOur new friends from the movie Hogmaul, and the creator of Werepups are on board!!\nSam J. Jones ('80's Flash Gordon) really wanted nothing to with do us, but Scarlett paid for his autograph and she's zapping him with one one of TuffNerd's ray guns so we're using his picture.\nA quick promo shoot in the parking lot with Zombie Pinup girls Kristina Kreep and Cori Dials!!\nUpdate! Natasha Sriracha is officially on the team, here's a shot of her on the way to the DC Fetish Ball in the back of the Corpse Dragger!\nQ: So what have you guys done so far?\nA: Lots of leg work, planning, networking, and we've already begun shooting!\n\nWe have been busy recruiting models, actors, artists, designers, and venues with similar interests and goals, to help create content for and help launch our project, as well as stage awesome performance and party events in Baltimore, Philly, DC, NY... This is already becoming way more than a magazine, we plan on having a whole traveling show one day that could very well bring all sorts of oddites and performers to your hometown!\nHearse promo poster featuring Dixie Whistler, Natasha Sriracha, and Kristina Kreep\nBehind the scenes with up and coming model and burlesque performer, Dixie Whistler\nThe lovely Natasha Sriracha getting together with an old friend...\nTuffNerd, hard at work... Wait, that's not what I meant!\n\nQ: That's what's up, son! So what can I do to help?\nA: The best thing you can do is pre-order the magazine at cover price, or dig a little deeper and get more value for your money with a personalized autographed copy or more! Check out the rewards in the right-hand column! Share this on Facebook and Twitter! Anything you can do to spread the word would be greatly, greatly appreciated, we can't do this without your help!\n\n   If you would like to meet us in person before you hand over your hard-earned cash, we will be appearing with some of our model minions and the Corpse Dragger at the Metro Gallery, for \"Party With Poe!\" A Film Premier & Costume Bash hosted by our friend, actor Mark Sanders!\n   And if that wasn't enough, we'll be stepping it up a notch and showing all new scintillating Horror & Sci-Fi images (available for purchase) on 11/1/12 at Gallery 788's 3rd Annual Erotic Art Show, along with work by other amazing artists and photographers, as well as hosting spectacular performances of the Hearse and Nerd variety by various performer and sideshow friends! This event will be the official kickoff of our Kickstarter campaign, which will end with an event at the end of November and we will hopefully announce that we have made our goal!\nKeep it Creepy and Geeky baby,\nMike Hearse and TuffNerd", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince we already have begun shooting content for the magazine, the main challenge so far has been time management. Everyone is so excited to work with us on this that we sometimes bite off more than we can chew as far as scheduling shoots in the studio and on location at various events, and most shoots invariably start at least an hour later than scheduled (because apparently models live in a different time/space continuum than the rest of us).\n\nAlthough we have between us already the skills, knowledge, equipment, and talent necessary to make ready for print a high quality photographic publication (and the knowledge base of people smarter than us if needed), there will definitely be times when we bump heads on things. That's to be expected though, and our friendship is strong enough that we can compromise when necessary. \n\nMike's connections to the East Coast horror scene as well as established industry (modeling and publishing) insiders, combined with Zach's media experience (TV/film, graphic design) in addition to their photographic legerdemain, make them the ideal dynamic duo to see a project such as this come to fruition.\n\nWe are however still working out the details as far as format and how the content will be presented within the magazine, i.e. whether or not each page will be a complete set of photos, an individual photo, or a set and then a final shot. While our styles are complimentary yet vastly different, there has to be a consistency in layout to make the magazine a cohesive whole. One idea we are kicking around (keeping in mind that the magazine has two front covers and each half is upside down relative to the other) is to have the last (technically the middle) pages of each side meet in one large shot, combining elements from both Coffin Cuties and PlayNerd in some sort of Horror/Sci-Fi mashup that blurs the lines between the genres! Of course little things like deciding who takes the final shot, or trying to do 2 separate shots that meet up without looking ridiculously cheesy is another matter...\n\nDespite these questions about the aesthetics of the final product, we truly feel we are prepared to meet any challenges that arise during the completion of this project by sheer force of will, determination, resourcefulness, charm, and some good old fashioned Voodoo if all else fails. Just checking to see if you were paying attention, we don't really believe in any of that stuff... or do we?\nMUAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA!\n\nKeep it Creepy and Geeky baby!\n\nSincerely,\n\nHearse &\nNerd\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "PLAYNERD MAGAZINE #2 NOW AVAILABLE!", "update_content": "We are now 2 separate publications, but if you want more sexy Sci-Fi, new cosplay themes, and more from Playnerd magazine, you got it!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Collector Level Ships Today!", "update_content": "Mike is personalizing the last of the Collector Level Rewards, and we will be sending out T-Shirts as early as next week!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Issue #1 is Here!", "update_content": "We just received issue #1 back from the printer's and it looks effing AWESOME!\nHEAVY gloss paper and cover, excellent image reproduction, we could not be more pleased.

Looking good. This is an wonderful and fantastic step in a career that has bounced from fortune to disaster to boredom to magic, all with the greatest of ease, and sometimes in just one day or week!\nI walk outside and feel the fall's very first brisk wash of autumn air, as the first real cold front of the season blows in. It is almost 2:30. The night is all around me.\nI think that what I do - these strange and preposterous stories that I write and draw - that they are not meant for everyone. They are meant for a very special and eclectic audience. And a wonderful, cool, fun-loving, well humored lot, as you will find anywhere. The best part is, that I enjoy all these little, almost meaningless dribbles of thought that make up a comic book as much as you all do. And we share this. I love that.\nOff in the distance I hear two train cars coupling. The sound really carries so at night.\nI love making people happy. I love being popular enough to do (pull off) something like this. At the same time, I love being so obscure that I can go to a convention and meet the real people and walk the street like any ordinary person, and have people tell me what they actually think. I love rubbing elbows with all the great creators and real artists in this art form/cottage industry/hobby that is our thing. This is the best.\nThe night is so deep, so endless - in every direction: a thousand miles, a million things. A thousand miles of night.\nWe made it! I can't imagine all this happening in any other time in history. Not just Kickstarter, but this whole comic book thing.! I can't imagine a greater bunch of people: the readers, the other artists, the shop owners etc.- and all the complete strangers I've met, spent time with, given rides to, taken advice from, ate breakfast with, created daydreams for and got into interesting, all-night-long conversations with.\nI probably don't know how lucky I am. Maybe never will. That's fine. But I have a better idea now, don't ya know.\nAt the Disney Studios in Burbank a few years back.

I won\u2019t argue with them. \nFlaming Carrot was the world\u2019s first surrealist super hero. Also the first blue-collar, rust-belt, mill-town super hero. And the first super hero to take a girl out on a dinner date to a Toyotathon tent-sale with free hot dogs and root beer. \nIn it\u2019s day, it spawned a spin-off major motion picture: MYSTERY MEN, a 60 million dollar Ben Stiller movie from Universal with one of the greatest ensemble cast ever put together for a super hero movie. \nThe comic attained a legendary cult status and fans and reviewers usually classed it with the works of such creative auteurs and outsider artists as David Lynch, Windsor McKay, Alfred Jarry, Frank Zappa, W.S. Burroughs, and Evil Knievel. Collector\u2019s back issue prices outstripped some of the most popular titles of the era. And one month Flaming Carrot even outsold Superman comics. \nThen it disappeared as mysteriously as it came...\nThe comic has been more or less out of print since the 90s. We\u2019re bringing it back into the digital world and the 21st Century with touch-screen versions of the first two Flaming Carrot Graphic Novels: FLAMING CARROT: MAN OF MYSTERY and FLAMING CARROT: THE WILD SHALL WILD REMAIN. Right at four hundred pages of \u201crabid, mind melting, nail driving, Megafun\u201d. We are also crafting a deluxe 250 page, limited, signed, numbered, deluxe Hard-Back of issues #4-11, THE WILD SHALL WILD REMAIN. \nThe Original 1997 TPB of The Wild Shall Wild Remain\nThis volume will have an all-new, fully drawn, 8-page Flaming Carrot comic story that appears HERE AND ONLY HERE! \nWe've frontloaded the pledge gifts with many spectacular and cool items from our archives. We had to scour the back room, the basement and the warehouse to dig these out. We wanted to make the biggest splash we could here. We wanted to give you the most for your pledge that we could. We wanted to get all these little jewels out of here and into the hands of someone that would appreciate and treasure them.\nWhile prices of Flaming Carrot items are, depending on condition, all over the board, in top shape or slabbed some people are asking a lot for them. The VISIONS issues can get up in the hundreds, and people have even asked over 3K for VISIONS #1. Flaming Carrot #1 (the oversized and the AV edition) in the $300 to $400 dollar range. And remember, these Kickstarter prizes are file copies, out of my archives. \n1979 VISIONS #1\nFlaming Carrot Comics Over Sized #1\nWE\u2019LL PUT THE MONEY TO GOOD USE We will have to print, store and advertise the hardback. We\u2019re going to try and print and bind it here in the US or Canada and have it in the stores for Christmas. That\u2019s what the kickstarter is for. We will have to SCAN all these pages. Both for PRINT and DIGITAL formats. The pages are huge. Not the 11X17 size of modern comics but the big, monster size originals of the golden age era. Yes, they were scanned years ago by the previous publisher, but they lost the scans. Or never bothered to save them. (So, creators, always get your scans and keep them backed up, no matter what your publishers say about doing it for you.) \nTO MY OLD READERS:  I expect to get some old readers, wishing to have these issues in a digital format, but please, tell your friends. Share the fun. And feel free to get multiple different pledges, and gift the extra digital copies to someone out there that needs a laugh right now. \nTO NEW READERS:   A lot of comic readers (and even a few innocent civilians) have heard about Flaming Carrot Comics over the years, but never could find, borrow or buy a copy or were never were in the right place at the right time. So here\u2019s a chance to nail 14 issues \u2013 over 350 digital pages \u2013 for a small fraction of what the contents of this book would cost you on Ebay or Amazon. \nNow this is crazy. YOU CAN GO ON AMAZON AND CHECK IT OUT. This book, the original collected volume, printed by Dark Horse back in 1997, it sells for as much as $102 to $200 dollars in nice condition. There were a few ragged out ones for 40 or 60 bucks but one guy had it on there for $372. I kid you not. \nTALES FROM A MAGICAL, BYGONE ERA. Flaming Carrot was the antithesis of the standard comic book superhero. Flaming Carrot has no super powers. None. He has no secret identity. He is Flaming Carrot all the time. And to top it all off, he\u2019s not very smart. He\u2019s simple. Childlike. So if he gets in a spot \u2013 see, he can\u2019t think his way out like Batman who is cunning and wise, no, Flaming Carrot just blasts his way out, just blasts his way out in a hail of gunfire. You have to remember, this creation was a child of the punk rock era. Punk/New Wave influences in ambiance and attitude. In essence. Sex pistols, Iggy Pop, Talking Heads \u2013 GoGos - Ramones \u2013 The Clash - The Residents\u2026 (But probably more Iggy Pop than anything else.) \nFlaming Carrot was an in your face, primitive rebellion to all the stand up and be counted/conservative/liberal/neo/lets all just get along/I\u2019m a survivor/everything\u2019s ok/ and comics are good for you baloney that was going around back then. Flaming Carrot\u2019s success and acceptance really proved that comic books could be subversive, insidious, mind-inducing, surrealistic, mood altering and most of all\u2026 FUN. \nWHY BUY THIS BOOK? WILL I LIKE IT?  Some people ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d some ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d/ The first time someone asked me what\u2019s it like I had to think. Was it like W. C. Fields meets the Marx Bros.? Was it like Edgar Allen Poe on pot instead of absinthe? Was it \u201ctoo many angels dancing on the head of a pin?\u201d How about a \u201churricane in a taffy store.\u201d SEINFELD meets DEATH OF A SALESMAN? A one way ticket to Palookaville? OK, I had it. It was THE FAR SIDE, only with a story line. So if that sound good to you, then you\u2019ll probably like it. \n The main thing I want to get across to you is - this is weird, off the wall and buck wild, but there is a story. There always is a story. A lot of critics/reviewers try to nail Flaming Carrot with the \u201cNon-linier story-line\u201d angle. No. There\u2019s always a story there. That\u2019s the magic. It seems like it\u2019s non-linier - all wild, and out there - but there is a story, and you can follow it. \nIt\u2019s just the story is not always that derivative, that hackneyed, and to someone with a superficial mind and a room temperature IQ, it appears non-linier. Like PULP FICTION. That\u2019s the perfect example. It seems like there\u2019s no story there too, but there is. It\u2019s just hard to see, when you are looking for it: enjoyably hard to see. \nLike good dancing that seems effortless, it\u2019s magic. So, for the new reader, I hope this helps you make a decision. The Flaming Carrot Experience is not for everyone. The art is probably an acquired taste, in the real early issues. There are some archaic references here and there, but nothing that should interfere with the enjoyment of reading it, and now, with Google, you can have some fun researching the occasional 80s or 90s references. \nA GOOD DEAL FROM KICKSTARTER. \nI ASSURE YOU! \nThe first FLAMING CARROT signed, Ltd, Collected volume was HALF THIS SIZE - about 130 pages. We priced it at $49.95, and almost sold out with the first solicitation.  We were figuring at pricing this at $75.00 for the regular market. But for this fundraiser at least, you will be able get the book for a $50 pledge. A 250 page signed and numbered hardback for $50. While the campaign is going on, of course. \nThe book will be signed, numbered, and for KICKSTARTER people and I will personally draw a quick, pencil doodle in the back pages of the book. Sort of a glorified autograph really. Cant\u2019 bee to fancy because\u2026 You see, there will also be a CHAMPAGNE EDITION with a proper sketch in the front of the book, all inked and nicely drawn. I will take my time on these Champagne drawings, and there will only be 200 books made. Like the first volume, the Champagne version will be $125.00 each retail.\nLimited Edition Volume One Hard Cover\nBut what if this kickstarter thing exceeds all of our expectations? what should we do? perhaps... just maybe... we make the Champagne Edition (Limited to 200) a Kickstarter prize at a $100 pledge level!

After our set, he insisted that we tour Australia, and that it might be beneficial for both our bands if we toured it together. And so, after discussing it among ourselves for .05 seconds, we thought it a good idea, too. After all, we've toured the US and Europe countless times--maybe it was time to push on to somewhere new. So we took a long, wistful look into the Vaz coffers and set off into our own private lives to see if this was even logistically possible, given that we all live in extreme-cost-of-living-NYC, have jobs to juggle, have rent to pay, the \"dream tax\" to come to turns with, etc.... \nMeanwhile, Jem, getting a probably hasty green light from us, begins to set up the tour not only for Australia but for SE Asia as well. Our excitement grows  as we hear how quickly the tour dates are filling in. On two new continents! \nJem, besides playing music with his own band, puts out, distributes records and sets up tours around Australia, and generally knows the ins and outs of that huge country we really haven't a clue about (The Simpsons \"30 Years of Electricity\" is about it...). He is even savvy enough to negotiate a government grant to help fund the potential tour. (In other words, all of our expenses are pretty well taken care of once we get there--via Dead and their van, etc. Once we get there.) But even after hearing how well things are going over there our wry smiles turn into rye smiles as we discover that round trip flights to Australia are, on average, $2000! \nThat's $2,000. A ticket. Each. \nSo, that's why we're here.\nConsidering this tour is also a good opportunity to make all sorts of things happen in a brave new hemisphere, we have decided to make the most of it and let you share in the benefits and rewards of this musically intensive, activity-laden, trip. In other words, we won't be sitting around on the beach eating barbified shrimp all day. \n Upon arrival, we set in motion a three-point plan:\n    1) We film a Vaz Documentary/Home Movie that not only chronicles our adventures in the Eastern Hemisphere but will also include a collection of VAZ live footage and, uh, one act plays that we have accumulated over the years. To be released sometime in the following year. \n    2) We record and release a live record gathered from shows played all across SE Asia. Did you know that in SE Asia, kids are informed of punk/art/rock happenings via cellphones and assemble/move like schools of fish towards it, once they learn of a happening? To us, this seems like an excellent backdrop for a live record. The Asian stint ends in Kuala Lumpur, where we mix the live LP and prepare for our trip home. \n    3) We'll also record a split single with Dead to be sold in Australia initially, and then distributed in US at a later date. We'll do this in either Melbourne or Brisbane. \nBesides all this, let's not forget, that we will also be honing lots of fresh, new material for an upcoming double record which will be recorded once we're back in the States and released in the spring of 2013 (give or take a few months) on Sleeping Giant Glossolalia Records. \nAll of these prospective projects will be available to you and to you first, if you help make this tour a possibility.  \nBesides this intense schedule though, we do plan on having a good time  blowing people's minds, meeting new friends, etc. Or maybe we'll drink with the locals, fight and get lost in the mid-continental desert.Whatever happens, you will see it in our documentary.

Fire a perceptual revolution. (And get a brand new handle on how your world really works.) \nWhat\u2019s The God Problem?\nThe God Problem: How A Godless Cosmos Creates is an upcoming August book from Howard Bloom, the man who has been called \u201cnext in a lineage of seminal thinkers that includes Newton, Darwin, Einstein,[and] Freud,\u201d by Britain's Channel4 TV and \"the next Stephen Hawking\" by Gear Magazine.\nOne Nobel Prize-winner and two MacArthur Genius Award winners say The God Problem is \u201cspectacular.\u201d So do luminaries like Barbara Ehrenreich, The New York Times Sunday Magazine\u2019s Charles Siebert, and Associated Press veteran Walter Putnam.  More important,  Heinz Insu Fenkl, director of SUNY's Interstitial Studies Institute says The God Problem is \u201cthe next paradigm,\u201d a book that \u201cwill take you to a place from which you will never re-emerge.\u201d \nWhat\u2019s the God Problem all about?\nThere's a secret hidden in a mathematical nugget called Peano's Axioms.  Is Peano's mystery the key to the cosmos?\nThe God Problem tackles the puzzle of how a godless cosmos creates; of how a universe without a bearded and bathrobed god in the sky pulls off acts of genesis. And it pursues the riddles behind five mildly flabbergasting heresies: \na does not equal a \none plus one does not equal two \nentropy is wrong \nrandomness is not as random as you think and\ninformation theory is way off base.\nThe result? Says James Burke, creator and host of seven BBC TV series, including Connections, \"Enthralling.  Astonishing.  Written with the panache of  the Great Blondin turning somersaults on the rope above Niagara.  Profound, extraordinarily eclectic, and crazy.   The most exciting cliffhanger of a book I can remember reading.\" \nWhy do we need you?\nA paradigm shift can flip the way that you and I see everything around us and everything inside of us.  Equally important, it can flip the vision of the leaders who make the policy decisions that shape your life and mine.  \nParadigm shifting takes work.  It takes snapping the media to attention.  Five New York Times staffers and contributors are reading The God Problem.  One says The God Problem is \u201cmind-bending\u201d and \u201cdaring.\u201d  Another says it\u2019s \u201cebullient\u201d and \u201centhralling,\u201d  a \u201cpiece of intellectual detective work, bursting with original insight.\u201d  And David Swindle, associate editor at PJ Media, says that The God Problem \u201cwill change your life.\u201d  But that\u2019s just a tiny start.\nParadigm shifting takes a media campaign.  Not just any media campaign.  A saturation media campaign.  Dan Schneider--founder of the 125-million-hit arts-and-ideas website Cosmoetica.com\u2014is the writer Roger Ebert calls the \u201cideal critic.\u201d Schneider poses a question: \u201cIs The God Problem a great book like Darwin\u2019s The Origin Of Species, Lyell\u2019s Principles Of Geology, or Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica?\u201d  That\u2019s for you to decide.  But Darwin and Newton mounted intense, long-term campaigns to make sure that their ideas gave new tools to your mind and mine.  \nNow it\u2019s time to make sure that even newer tools of thought are available to the very highest and the very lowest levels of the global mind. \nWhat does Bloom know about media campaigns?\nHoward Bloom, the author of The God Problem, is an expert in mass behavior, from the mass behavior of quarks to the mass behavior of human beings.  From 1968 to 1988, Bloom undertook one of the strangest Voyages of the Beagle in the history of science.  He entered a field he knew nothing about, pop culture, an arena he saw as \u201cthe mythmaking machinery of modern society.\u201d  And he founded and ran the biggest PR firm in the music industry, building or sustaining the careers of Michael Jackson, Prince, Bob Marley, Bette Midler, Aerosmith, Queen, Kiss, AC/DC, Simon & Garfunkel, Billy Joel, Peter Gabriel, David Byrne, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-DMC, and over a hundred others. His star-making generated $28 billion in revenues (more than the gross domestic product of Oman or Luxembourg) for companies like Sony, Disney, Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola, and Warner Brothers. All in a quest for scientific understanding. \nBloom designed the media campaigns that helped turn ferociously committed nineteen year olds who deserved to be stars into household names.  Nineteen year olds like Prince and Joan Jett.  Why bother? Star making has more importance than we usually think. Pop culture icons are role models on whom our souls grow.  \nBut changing the very way we think, feel, and see is crucial at a far deeper level.  The level of gut and brain.  And the level at which spirits soar.\nWhat\u2019s a saturation media campaign?\nSays Bloom, \u201cIn the 1970s and 1980s, most music industry publicists were satisfied if they landed six stories for their clients in a month.  I was not satisfied unless we landed 160.  And I preferred 600.\u201d  Why?  Says Bloom, \u201cBecause of our psychology\u2014yours and mine.  Something we only see once disappears from our minds.  Something we see six times makes a faint imprint.  But what we see sixty times sticks with us.  So six is not enough.\"\nBloom tells the story of the Bee Gees\u2019 manager, Robert Stigwood.  In 1976, says Bloom, Stigwood wanted to accomplish something forbidden.  He was a music manager, but he wanted to go into film.  And the film community looked down on music industry denizens.  What\u2019s more, Stigwood wanted to take a second-tier TV actor and turn him into a film icon.  Impossible.  In those days, if you were on TV, movie audiences wanted to have nothing to do with you.\nWhat did Stigwood do?  He hired three PR firms simultaneously.  Each firm had a different area of specialization.  One was good at glitzy, glossy publications.  Another was good at gritty trade magazines.  And the third was outstanding at areas in between these two.  The result?  Stigwood broke through the barriers erected against him by Hollywood.  And he turned his second-tier TV actor into a film star.  \nThe movie Stigwood rammed through the barriers was Saturday Night Fever.  And the minor TV actor was John Travolta.\nWhat does a saturation media campaign cost?\n A standard book PR campaign costs $20,000.  But, says Bloom, it barely scratches the surface. Spend $40,000 and you can scratch deeper.  But spend $60,000 and hire three publicity companies at once, and you can make a difference in the public mind.\nWhat will your money be used for?\nYour money will be used to drive the messages of The God Problem home.  Messages that David Swindle, associate editor of PJ Media, says put \u201cthe power  in your hands to provoke others and yourself to dig deeper and see your life as though you were looking at it for the first time\u2026 provoking people to remember how to think again.\u201d  And, the power, repeats Swindle to \u201cchange your life.\u201d\nWhy you?\nThe publishing industry is running on fumes.  Big PR budgets go to mainstream names like Hilary Clinton and Sarah Palin.  Few PR budgets go to those who work to break down the barriers of established thought and to give you new meanings.  But thanks to Kickstarter, if there\u2019s an author whose ideas you believe in, you can help that author break through.  You can help kick important ideas past the gatekeepers and into the centers of power.\nWhy join forces with Bloom?\nPJ Media\u2019s David Swindle sees it like this:\n\"The God Problem will change your life.  Here's the thing you need to understand about reading a Howard Bloom book. While reading it you'll find yourself analyzing yourself and the world around you in ways you never imagined. \n\"Bloom presents his reader with tools for understanding and interpreting human phenomena. He creates new connections you've never seen before in works that somehow combine science, history, philosophy, art, a mystical atheism, and joyous Baby Boomer optimism into a new nonfiction genre. \n\"Having read Bloom's three previous published books (and some of his unpublished gems too radical and honest for castrated publishers to even dare...) I've seen a progression in his work. He's getting deeper and deeper to the roots of human self-knowledge and the codes embedded within the universe's construction. \n\"These ideas will make you see yourself differently. Just take Howard's explanation of how something emerges out of nothingness -- his secret of why A is not A will change your life if you make the mistake of thinking about it too long and taking its implications all the way. \n\"Just as The Lucifer Principle will change the way you understand the evil in your heart; Global Brain will make you understand your role in steering the ships of mass minds; and Genius of the Beast will give you a chance to read the last page of the human drama so you can relax. \n\"Didn't get the memo that the boom and bust pattern we're so worried about in our economy goes back throughout human history and even deeper back into nature? That it's just a tool to provoke us to evolve? \n\"I say mistake because the error you make in reading Howard Bloom now is that you're gaining a revolutionary understanding of the world that won't be more commonplace for at least 10-15 years. One that will confound the intellectual idolaters of dogmatic political ideologies 'right' and 'left.' (I've found that partisans of both sides don't know what to make of a Bloom-style reading of the economic crisis.) \n\"And The God Problem is even worse regarding the power it puts in your hands to provoke others and yourself to dig deeper and see your life as though you were looking at it for the first time. Just try laying out Bloom-style arguments when the subject comes up and watch what happens. \n\"It's usually a lot of fun provoking people to remember how to think again.\"\nThe God Problem will change your life?\nHere\u2019s the reaction to The God Problem from those with early copies of the author\u2019s  manuscript--the manuscript that you can get if you invest in this crusade: \n\"Bloody hell, what a truly extraordinary book.

Sometimes that heart is bursting with love for the craft, while other times it's punctured and bleeding all over the place... 24 frames per second.\nMAD GOD is a mature film made with technology that spans the history of cinema.\nTHE MOVIE\nPhil Tippett was raised on the fantasy films of Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien; films that fueled his and other youngsters' imaginations with creatures brought to life using stop-frame animation.  As a young man, he was further influenced by European experimental filmmakers Karel Zeman, Jan Svankmajer and Vladislav Starevich, who used similar techniques in surreal and experimental ways. \nWith his work on the \"Star Wars\" movies, Tippett carved his own niche as a modern master of stop motion.  In 1984 he created his own studio where he continued to explore and innovate using stop motion. \nMAD GOD began with several minutes of stop motion animation in 1990, before the explosion of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) for movies.  But as his studio blossomed into a powerhouse of computer-assisted visual effects and animation, the MAD GOD project fell on the back burner. \nUNTIL LAST YEAR\nAfter sitting on the shelf for 20 years, artists at Tippett Studio implored Phil to revive MAD GOD. \nIncorporating footage shot before the surge of CGI with new puppets, scenes, environments, and in-camera effects, Phil is directing while mentoring an entire new generation in traditional stop motion animation and creature fabrication.\nThe crew is entirely made up entirely of volunteers, including artists from Tippett Studio, students from local art schools, and industry veterans who remember the \"good ol' days\" when effects were made by people on sets photographing puppets one frame at a time.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nEven independent films cost money, and MAD GOD is no exception. \nThe money raised through Kickstarter will be used to finance an abundance of the hard costs associated with making the first chapter of this film, including materials for making molds, armatures, rear and front-screen projections, lab services, hard drive storage, and studio rental space among other costs...  \nIn short, your money will finance the supplies needed to bring the film to life.  Your contributions will ensure that the first chapter gets completed, and you will have a front row seat to the making of this spectacle.\nWe've been emboldened by a number of incredible Kickstarter success stories to believe that independent animation fans and consumers can make a project as unlikely and non-commercial as MAD GOD a reality.  Your financing will facilitate this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision like few have ever attempted. \nABOUT THE PROJECT\nOver an 18 month period, a small team, under Phil Tippett's direction, will complete an approximately 12-minute chapter of the stop-motion/live-action/mixed-media creation called MAD GOD, using hands, tools, molds, clay, toys, garbage, blood, and whatever else we can get our hands on.  \nOnce this chapter is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice (determined by which rewards level is chosen). \nREWARDS\nA flat backer contribution of $10 gets you into the \"MAD GOD CLUB,\" with access to view the process on a password-protected section of the www.madgodmovie.com website as it unfolds and a copy of the first chapter of the film when it is finished as a digital download. \nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond that, we have a list of fun, premium, rewards ranging from postcards with art of the film to DVDs, signed by creator Phil Tippett, to custom-created sculptures. \nFor More Information, please visit www.madgodmovie.com or email kickstarter@madgodmovie.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Exciting MAD GOD News", "update_content": "Dear Team MAD GOD,\n\nWe have exciting news to share with you...\n\nAfter more than 30 years in production, and thanks in EVERY WAY to you, the backers of this project over the past decade, Phil has completed the feature length film version of MAD GOD!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Phil Tippett's MAD GOD Instagram is now a thing!", "update_content": "Hi Team MAD GOD!   \nLet's make this short & sweet - Phil Tippett now has an Instagram!  \nHis feed chronicles adventures in imagining, fabricating & animating all the parts & pieces that go into the glorious world of MAD GOD.  \nFollow him @madphilg on Instagram, won't you?  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/madphilg/  "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "VIP Pre-Tip: MAD GOD Kickstarter 3 is Now Live", "update_content": "Greetings Team Mad God!\nWe are inside of 24 hours for our latest project - the Augmented Reality Hologrid: Monster Battle game, featuring Phil's creatures, brought to life for you to play with!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Final Push for \"Hologrid: Monster Battle\"", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Collector's Edition for Hologrid Game", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "HoloGrid: Monster Battle // Live on Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "HoloGrid: Monster Battle // News from Phil Tippett", "update_content": "Good morning beloved backers of Phil Tippett's Mad God Pt1!\nLast week, we shipped out replacement DVD-Blu-Ray sets to all backers who reported having not received a DVD, whose DVDs arrived creased or damaged, or whose DVDs were reported having been seized by customs or lost in the post.\nThese were mailed to those of you who emailed us privately or responded to our Doodle Poll to report your DVD missing.

Bands such as The Melvins, Helmet, Unsane, Boss Hog and Today Is The Day have either got their start with AmRep, or appear as regular guests on the label. From 1986-1998 Amrep often hired many upcoming graphic and street artists to create posters for shows, releases and tours. Some of those artists were Shepard Fairey, Frank Kozik, Coop and Ed Fotheringham- all who have become quite successful in their careers. This documentary will tell the story of Tom's early life as a hard core punk eventually joining the Marine Corp and moving on to playing in bands and starting his own label, Amphetamine Reptile Records. During the 90's Tom would find success in his hard work with Amrep, and turn to the art world for new inspiration- building a gallery behind one of his restaurants and hosting some of the most cutting edge pop artists of the time as well as raising a family and running a successful business. This film will highlight many of the label's bands and visual artists through mini bio-pics weaved throughout Tom's story.\nOur small crew has conducted over 30 interviews and have planned another 20+ within the next two months. Editorial has started and we are raising funds for final completion which will involve sound mix and color correction.

Cosmic forces have held you at bay for untold aeons, but at last the stars are right and your maniacal cult has called you to this benighted place. Once you regain your full powers, you will unleash your Doom upon the world!\nThere\u2019s only one problem: you\u2019re not alone. The other Great Old Ones are here as well, and your rivals are determined to steal your cultists and snatch victory from your flabby claws! It\u2019s a race to the ultimate finish as you crush houses, smash holes in reality, and fight to call down The Doom That Came To Atlantic City!\nThe Architects of Your Doom...\nThe Doomis a labor of love and terror from three exceptional talents. It is the brainchild of artist Lee Moyer, inspired by his love of the Cthulhu Mythos and disdain for a certain board game that shall not be named. Game designer Keith Baker is best known for the Origins Award winning card game Gloom, and he brings the same dark sense of humor to the devastation of Atlantic City.\nKeith and Lee have enlisted the help of their friend Paul Komoda to design some of the more eldritch visual elements of the game. His talents can be seen on-screen in the prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing and Cabin In The Woods. He brings that vision and long association with H. R. Giger to his designs of the Great Old Ones.\nPaul intensely focused on Juliette for the 2011 prequel to The Thing\nIn the box: \n1 Game Board\n2 Dice\n4 Reference Cards\n8 Plastic figurines of Paul Komoda's sculpts\n8 Mythos Role Cards\n16 Dooms\n24 Gate Cards\n40 Gate Markers\n45 Chants Cards\n45 Providence Cards\n50 Wooden Cultists\n60 Wooden Houses \nAnd now also included thanks to your help in reaching our stretch goals:\n8 Wooden Hotels\n16 Tome Cards\n8 Wooden Claws to track Doubles Rolled & Gates Opened\nBackers who invest at least $75 receive a set of eight playable pewter miniatures sculpted by Paul Komoda in addition to the base game.\nBe Rewarded for Your Sacrifice...\nBy backing this project you'll be bringing The Doom That Came to Atlantic City to retail shops, game tables and frothing cultists around the world.

Instead of playing a puny mortal building a city or closing gates to save the world, you play one of the Great Old Ones, seeking to tear down the city, open gates, and destroy the world.\nAs an Old One, you have mutable traits reflected by Providence cards. So Hastur begins as The King In Yellow, but as the game progresses he could gain Flabby Claws and Membranous Wings. When you begin the game, your primary resources are your cultists, who keep you anchored to the world; however, certain actions call on you to sacrifice your cultists, and you can beat up other Old Ones to steal their cultists. Should you lose your last cultist, you will be banished until you can build up enough followers to return. \nThe second resource in the game are houses. As you move around Atlantic City, you destroy houses. The power you gain in this process allows you to perform the rituals known as Chants. When you destroy the last house on a space, you open up a gate on it. Gates add additional movement options and also grant their owner an additional power (though using this power requires the sacrifice of houses or cultists). Beyond this, opening gates is the key to victory. When you open your sixth gate, you win the game.\nImage is of a prototype board and does not represent quality of final product.\nHowever, every Old One also has a unique path to victory: Their doom. This is a strategic shortcut you can take that gives you a reason to use specific tactics in your choice of Providence and Chants cards, and something that adds replay value to the game. So there are houses on Boardwalk - but your goal is to destroy them, open a gate to Yuggoth, and ultimately to pull off the Ultimate Sacrifice.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $55,000 HAS BEEN HIT!\nCthulhu without the Necronomicon is like Boardwalk without a hotel. Our first stretch goal solves both of these problems by adding hotels into the game. Hotels are more difficult to destroy than houses, but destroying a hotel carries a considerable reward: a tome. These books hold secrets no mortal was meant to know, and they enhance the power of your existing gates. What terrible truths will you unearth from the ruins of Park Place?\n\nThe Shadow over Boardwalk goal went into effect when we reached $55,000. The components of the base game have been expanded to include 8 wooden hotels and 16 tomes.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $75k HAS BEEN HIT\nFor our next trick we announce The Gate and The Key, a stretch goal for $75,000. In the original base game all doubles rolled and gates opened were tracked using a spare wooden house at the top of your role card. Now that this new goal has been reached we'll add custom wood \"Claws of Doom\" to help you keep track of the destruction.\nTo top it off we're also including shiny custom dice with our Beauty & The Tentacle logo where the single pip would be. All backers (of a tier including the base game) will receive the gate counters, custom dice, plastic figurines and our previous stretch goal, The Shadow Over Boardwalk.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3: $100k HAS BEEN HIT\nWe thank you for your ongoing involvement in your Doom and we are pleased to announce your selections from the dusty Archives!\nFor everyone backing at $100 or above, you will receive these three stickers of DOOM!\nAll backers at 200 and above will additionally receive this signed and numbered limited edition print of The Call of Cthulhu called 'Cthulhu Rising'.\nYou can declare your love of the game right now on BoardGameGeek.com.\nWith twenty years of gestation, play testing and reworking, The Doom has become a sharply honed work of fun-to-play satire. \nHuge thanks to Coilhouse, io9, Wired's GeekDad, Quarter to Three, The Gaming Gang, Geek.com and Nerd Approved for notifying the masses of their impending Doom!\nThis card is not included in the game.

But when the lights came up, they all disappeared\u2026 \nUnless you had the toys. In which case, the adventure never needed to end.\nIn backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way, they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, more than 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans.\nPlastic Galaxy: The Story of Star Wars Toys is a new documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through interviews with former Kenner employees, experts, authors, and collectors, the film examines the toys' history, their influence on pop culture, and the fond and fervent feelings they elicit today. \nThe filmmakers -- rabid Star Wars fans and toy collectors themselves -- traveled across the country to visit some of the most amazing collections. Plastic Galaxy is chock full of not only production toys, but also prototypes, bootlegs, foreign figures, and un-produced goodies that no one was ever supposed to own. \nMade for both long-time fans and new collectors, Plastic Galaxy is scheduled for release on DVD in November, 2012. It will be available for purchase online, as well as through select brick-and-mortar stores across America. \nThe DVD will be Region 0, meaning it will be playable on any DVD player or computer in any country. Even in galaxies far, far away...\nWHAT AM I SUPPORTING\nFunding or not, this film will be released this year! The question is, will the producers have to sell off body parts to do it?

Nuestro objetivo es tener los libros en sus manos para el 31 de octubre, para Halloween. Nuestra agenda de producci\u00f3n es apretada, los servicios de env\u00edo y entrega, son frecuentemente ineptos y la futurolog\u00eda es una ciencia inexacta. \n\nDurante la campa\u00f1a\nEstaremos publicando tanto en contenido exclusivo p\u00fablico y respaldo en la secci\u00f3n de actualizaciones de esta p\u00e1gina Campa\u00f1a pedal de arranque.

Esto es, por supuesto, si la campa\u00f1a tiene \u00e9xito. Y eso nos lleva a:\nDoy la bienvenida a su ayuda para que la gente en todo el mundo que habla espa\u00f1ol saben que esto es en las obras y la \u00fanica manera de conseguir una edici\u00f3n de tapa dura o edici\u00f3n slipcased es comprarlo en los pr\u00f3ximos 40 d\u00edas a trav\u00e9s de esta p\u00e1gina y hacer que la gente lo suficiente como para hacer eso misma por lo que llegar al 100%.\nPuedes empezar por visitar el sitio Web, y ver lo que hay.\nTambi\u00e9n tenemos FACEBOOK, TWITTER, TUMBLR y cuentas de YouTube.\n\"Me gusta\", retweet, retumble, suscribir y aprobar los v\u00ednculos y gr\u00e1ficos y otras cosas a lo largo.

Today the co-publisher and designer is preparing for the release of Las Escrituras Sat\u00e1nicas, the Spanish language edition to be released on Halloween of this year.\nA team of 6 translators and proofreaders from just as many different Spanish speaking countries have been at work since January creating the best translation of the book for Spanish speakers across the globe.\nThe Kickstarter project is to find out if there is enough interest to publish a Deluxe Slip-Cased and Hardback edition.\nIf you want a hardback or slip-cased edition of this book, you need \"back\" this project now. It has to hit a minimum of 100% for anything but the paperback to be published.\nThis isn\u2019t charity, this is me selling you books. It's possible to invest and opt to not get anything, or just get a lapel pin or other reward for any price you set above the asking price. You can overpay by any amount if you're feeling generous... but I'm here to sell books, this book, an awesome limited edition Spanish language version. \nI\u2019ve set our goal to a level where  Las Escrituras Sat\u00e1nicas can be printed by the same folks who did the English edition. We\u2019re using Kickstarter because it works with the worldview presented in the book we\u2019re publishing. Not to imply anything about Kickstarter or the employees, but the Church of Satan believes in meritocracy--the best ideas, people and things should rise to the top.\nThe rewards being offered are fairly simple. There are 4 items available for pre-order, and different rewards have either a single item or a combination of these:\nBrimstone Lapel Pin\nPaperback Edition\nHardback Edition\nDeluxe Slip-Cased Edition\nThere are two different notations for shipping:\nWORLD - Price given is postage paid no matter where you are on the planet.\nTBD - Postage will need to be paid at time of order fulfillment, in addition to the price shown. We will figure out this cost based on your address.\nWe have listed the delivery date for November of this year. Our goal is to have the books in your hands by Halloween, October 31st. Our production schedule is tight, delivery services often inept, and futurology is an inexact science. \nKevin I. Slaughter was not only the co-publisher of the English language edition at Scapegoat, but the designer of it as well. Now he has his own publishing house, Underworld Amusements, that will be releasing Las Escrituras Sat\u00e1nicas. This printing will be the first non-English language version to meet the same high standards in both design and quality of printing and binding that the first edition received. Great care was taken in creating an iconic and stylish design, including an entirely new typographic style for the Rituals.\nDURING CAMPAIGN\nWe will be posting both public and backer exclusive content in the UPDATES section of this Kickstarter Campaign page. Updates will include progress on the book itself, progress on the campaign, and also a couple of translated essays from the book and a backer only video interview with Peter H. Gilmore.\nAFTER CAMPAIGN\nWe will be using our blog and this Kickstarter page to post updates to backers at least bi-weekly until all of our rewards are shipped. This is, of course, if the campaign is successful. And that leads us to:\nI think this project has the merit to go well past fulfillment level, but because I\u2019m operating out of Baltimore, Maryland, I also need your assistance to let people throughout the Spanish speaking world know that this is in the works and the only way to get a hardback or slipcased edition is to buy it within the next 40 days through this page and to get enough people to do that same so we reach 100%. \nYou can start by visiting THE WEBSITE, and see what's there.\nWe've also got FACEBOOK, TWITTER, TUMBLR and YOUTUBE accounts.\n\"Like\", retweet, retumble, subscribe and pass the links and graphics and other stuff along.

Desde noviembre de 2011, he gestionado algunos aspectos de este proyecto, haciendo algo casi todos los d\u00edas para avanzar hacia la meta. Desde ese momento, el equipo de traducci\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en un grupo din\u00e1mico y fuerte, con tres editores principales y cinco correctores. Cada editor ha pasado incontables horas estudiando detenidamente cada traducci\u00f3n individual de cada una de las 38 partes del libro. Algunos de nuestros correctores han le\u00eddo y anotado cada ensayo varias veces, durante las diferentes fases del proceso.\n\nTraducir no es simplemente reemplazar una palabra por su equivalente en otro idioma. Hay aproximadamente 387 millones de hispanohablantes, ubic\u00e1ndolo como el idioma m\u00e1s popular del mundo, solo superado por el chino mandar\u00edn. Decir que existe diversidad dentro del lenguaje es quedarse corto y las variantes regionales pueden crear significados m\u00faltiples para palabras que podrian contradecir la intencion. Muchos modismos del ingl\u00e9s no tienen equivalente en espa\u00f1ol, sin mencionar las palabras o frases introducidas totalmente por el satanismo.\n\nHa habido largas discusiones sobre la mejor manera de traducir palabras y frases de forma que sean no s\u00f3lo las m\u00e1s accesibles a la mayor audiencia, sino que transmitan la intenci\u00f3n y el estilo personal del Mago Gilmore.\n\nNueve meses despu\u00e9s, aunque en lo personal quisiera haber aprendido m\u00e1s espa\u00f1ol, me siento completamente seguro de que el libro a producirse ser\u00e1 la traducci\u00f3n m\u00e1s completa y considerada de una obra sobre el tema del satanismo a cualquier idioma extranjero, y ni hablar de cualquiera traducido al espa\u00f1ol.\n\nEl proyecto tom\u00f3 m\u00e1s tiempo del que hab\u00eda anticipado en principio, pero tal como se discuti\u00f3 entre los correctores y con un n\u00famero de patrocinadores, parec\u00eda haber un acuerdo un\u00e1nime de que era mucho m\u00e1s importante hacer la mejor traducci\u00f3n, que cumplir con una fecha l\u00edmite arbitraria. S\u00f3lo puede haber una primera edici\u00f3n de Las Escrituras Sat\u00e1nicas.\n\nAhora, se hacen los \u00faltimos pases de la correcci\u00f3n y se cuidan los detalles del trabajo final de la diagramaci\u00f3n del libro. Espero enviar los archivos finales a nuestro impresor a principios o mediados de octubre. Si todo sale de acuerdo al calendario revisado, las recompensas de Kickstarter se enviar\u00e1n antes de fin de a\u00f1o.

Slaughter\n\n------------\n\n\nOn January 25th of 2012 the translation work for Las Escrituras Sat\u00e1nicas officially began. I\u2019ve managed some aspect of this project since November of 2011, doing something to advance toward the goal almost every day. Since that time the translation team became a dynamic and strong group of three primary editors and 5 proofreaders. Every editor has spent countless hours poring over every single translation of every of the 38 parts of the book. Some of our proofreaders have read and made notes on every essay multiple times, during different phases of the process.\n\nTranslating is not simply replacing one word for an equivalent in another language. There are roughly 387 million native speakers of Spanish, placing it as the worlds most popular language, second only to Mandarin Chinese. To say that there is diversity inside the language itself is an understatement, and regional variations can create multiple meanings for words that may contradict the intent. Many English idioms have no equivalent at all in Spanish, not to mention words or phrases that Satanism has introduced entirely.\n\nThere have been long discussions on the best way to translate words and phrases in ways that will be not only the most accessible to the widest audience, but so that it convey\u2019s Magus Gilmore\u2019s own style and intent.\n\nNine months later, though I wish I\u2019d personally learned more Spanish myself, I feel entirely confident that the book that will be produced will be the most thorough and considered translation of a work on the subject Satanism into any foreign language, much less anything translated into Spanish.\n\nThe project took longer than I anticipated from the beginning, but as discussed among proofreaders and with a number of backers, there seemed to be a unanimous agreement that it was far more important to do the best translation, than to meet an arbitrary deadline. There can only be one first edition of Las Escrituras Satanicas.\n\nCurrently the final passes of proofreading is being done and the final work on the layout of the book are being attended to. I expect to be sending the final files to our printer in early to mid-October. If all goes according to a revised schedule, Kickstarter rewards will be shipping out before the end of the year. Pre-orders placed with Atomic Books or directly will be available to ship shortly after that. Underworld Amusements will begin pre-selling books directly once the books have been confirmed to have been shipped from our overseas printer.\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported the Kickstarter by backing the project. Those waiting to purchase, your wait won\u2019t be much longer. I have never worked harder or longer on any single book project, and I have never worked on any project with a more talented and dedicated team.\n\nI will continue to post updates here as the project progresses.\nFollow the dedicated twitter account:\nView the website:\n\nHail Satan!\nKevin I.

Our goal is $13,000, which will cover the cost of printing 5000 copies of the magazine and supplement, silkscreen print, shipping and handling, and project fees. \nThanks for your interest in our project!

For more information about Crap Hound, Show & Tell Press, and various rewards, please see below.\nABOUT CRAP HOUND\nThis 4th edition reprint is 100-pages including the cover, comes with a 16-pg. supplement featuring all new material, sports a new cover and includes five copyright free typefaces!\nBetween a brief introduction and the end credits, Crap Hound is pure imagery. Each page is filled with high-contrast line art, culled from vintage catalogs, advertising, obscure books, and found ephemera. Through sheer volume of artfully arranged iconography, Crap Hound provides a visual survey of death, telephones and scissors. \nDebuting in 1994 and created by Sean Tejaratchi, Crap Hound became a favorite of both zine readers and publishers, and has received enthusiastic reviews from sources including The New York Times Magazine, RE/Search Books, AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts), and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.\nRead a great interview with Sean by Ian Lynam in PingMag. Check out the issues currently available at Reading Frenzy.\nABOUT SHOW & TELL PRESS\nFounded in 2005, Show & Tell Press is an offshoot of Reading Frenzy, a small, specialty bookshop in Portland, Oregon devoted to independent, small press and self-published titles. Crap Hound is our main project, but we aim to publish a variety of titles -- zines, comics and books -- with a special focus on good design and strong visual content.\nVisit our Facebook page for more cover and interior views of Crap Hound. We also have a Show & Tell Press blog.\nABOUT THE REWARDS\nThe only way to guarantee obtaining one of our reward items -- digital bonus pack, 16-pg. supplement, buttons, print -- is to become a backer BEFORE our project ends. We will be producing a set quantity of each item and some may sell out during our project, any remaining stock will be sold at Reading Frenzy. Kickstarter reward prices will not apply.\nEverything we put out will be beautifully designed and skillfully produced using high quality materials. All our printing is done in the U.S. and Canada. We use American-made textile products, and forest friendly paper for all prints and cards.\n4-BUTTON PACK\nA pack of 4 buttons designed by Sean Tejaratchi! Death, Telephones, and Scissors images! Image will be added soon!\nSUPPLEMENT\nThis 16-page supplement contains hundreds of images not previously included in Crap Hound #6. It will be offset printed and saddle-stitched. After the project it will only be available with the purchase of Crap Hound #6 (4th ed.).\nSILKSCREEN PRINT\nDesigned by Sean Tejaratchi. Limited edition (250), two-color, 18x24, silkscreen print.\nBONUS DIGITAL COLLECTION\nPLEASE NOTE: The Digital Bonus Pack is only available as a Kickstarter reward for the duration of our project. It will not be available for purchase after our project ends.\nHundreds of images in the Crap Hound #6 supplement required extensive clean up and refinement in Adobe Photoshop before they were ready for layout on the page. These images were high-quality intermediate steps that were made during the issue assembly. Plenty were taken from imperfect photos or scans, and as such, they're not necessarily pristine. On the other hand, all have a great deal of detail that inevitably gets lost when reduced to fit on the final page.\nMany are pure line art, without any shading. Others have high-contrast stippling or grit as shading. Before they were reduced on the page, most of these images measured twice the size, almost always at 1200 ppi (pixels per inch). For a few files, when it's too good to pass up, a high-res greyscale or color version will accompany the high-contrast art.\nThis bonus collection will be uploaded and delivered to you via a download link. You will have two weeks to download it before it's removed. File size should be under 200 MB. Format will most often be high-res bitmap tiff. In some cases, greyscale or RGB will be included. All files were created on a Macintosh, if that's a concern.\nGIFT WRAP\nWe created this gift wrap for our last Kickstarter project and it turned out beautifully. 19x25, 2-color, offset printed. You'll get 3 sheets of each in our Pack O' Crap reward!\nGREETING CARDS\nAnother reward created for our last Kickstarter project, these beautiful silkscreened, 5x7, blank greeting cards were lifted directly from the pages of Crap Hound #8. You'll receive 3 of each in our Pack O' Crap reward.\n\nFONTS\nFive original digital fonts, created by Sean Tejaratchi. All but Orange Phelps feature only uppercase, though Clean Steve and Yelberton have alternate caps in the lowercase positions. All fonts feature a full set of numbers and the standard punctuation set (?!.,.$/ etc.).\n\nThese fonts haven't been previously offered for sale or distribution, and all are released under a Creative Commons license allowing for personal and commercial use, but not distribution.\nThis digital fonts will be uploaded and delivered to you via a download link. You will have two weeks to download it before it's removed.\nIN THE INTEREST OF SMOOTH SAILING:\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS: We've had a lot of issues with international backers forgetting to add extra $$ for shipping. PLEASE NOTE our instructions for each reward level. We can't identify international backers until after the project has ended, so we're counting on you to follow our instructions and avoid extra hassle after the fact.\nEVERYONE: Please read our reward description carefully to ensure you've chosen the one that you want. Rewards and pledges will not be adjusted after the project ends, but you can change your pledge and/or reward any time before the project ends.\nSorry, NO CUSTOM REWARDS. We've learned from our past several projects that this just creates confusion for backers and extra work for us. We hope one of our rewards works for you. \nFinally, PLEASE RESPOND to the survey you'll receive after the project ends promptly! Failing to do so creates an extraordinary amount of extra work for us. If you don't reply within five business days we cannot guarantee the delivery date of your rewards.

Recorded in Upstate New York with producer Kevin McMahon (Swans, the Walkmen, Titus Andronicus) and featuring eye-gouging cover art by Swans/Angels of Light leader Michael Gira, it's a devastating masterpiece of which we're extremely proud.\nAnd now, with the aid of our generous fans, we need to spread the word about the new album\u2014our loudest, heaviest, noisiest, and nastiest by far.\nPublicists are the gatekeepers to the music press. Yes, there are some simple ways to get the word out online, and we're already doing that. But those reviews and articles one reads about bands in high-level magazines, newspapers, and other publications come about via the pitches of independent publicists and PR firms. In general, the bands themselves don't make these breakthroughs happen. Why? Simple. We don't have the hundreds\u2014sometimes thousands\u2014of contacts, or the ready-made rapport that an experienced publicist has built up over many years in the music industry. Nor do we have the available opportunities to \"work\" the record; we're busy working ourselves, on writing and recording new music and at our day jobs, to simply pay our bills. And the fine but smaller labels that are releasing Ain\u2019t No Lies in Blood do not have their own PR departments. So it's clear that hiring a publicist is essential for getting the coverage this release deserves. But of course a skilled publicist needs to be paid for doing their job, something the band currently requires the resources for. This is where you, the fans, can greatly help.\nThe Chrome Cranks are launching a Kickstarter campaign to support the publicizing of Ain\u2019t No Lies in Blood, our first album of all-new material in 15 years. To do this requires a minimum of $4,000, the goal of this effort (any funds accumulated above this range will go toward further publicity for the album). And in addition to copies of the album itself, as rewards for the assistance of our fans in this undertaking we're offering a wide range of rare and tasty treats at several different levels of support. Along with mp3s, album downloads, and signed CDs and LPs, we have these in store (*premium amounts include packing and shipping costs):\n\n-Signed copies of Moon in the Mountain, a limited-edition CD EP comprised of an incredible 12-minute outtake from the Ain't No Lies in Blood sessions and five previously unreleased tracks recorded for British radio in 1995. This exclusive EP is limited to 300 copies and ONLY AVAILABLE as part of the Kickstarter campaign.\n\n-Signed copies of an extremely rare and stunning screen-printed gig poster for a performance with Dead Moon at legendary New York venue Coney Island High\u2014the Chrome Cranks' final show before our 1998 split. A cache of 30 of these beautiful, ready-for-framing items were recently unearthed and are being made available only via the Kickstarter campaign.\n-And, for the super-dedicated fan who has everything, a dream come true. In the 1990s we recorded nearly every rehearsal we did on cassette tape. A handful of these UNHEARD, ONE-OF-A-KIND cassettes\u2013FIVE, to be exact\u2014are being offered as part of a package only available at the $500 level. All material on these cassettes is UNRELEASED and NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE\u2014each one is a RARE peek into CHROME CRANKS HISTORY!!\n\nAnd so with the above in mind we're inviting you, our valued fans, to be involved in this important project, right here and now. We greatly look forward to your support. The world needs to know about Ain\u2019t No Lies in Blood. And the Chrome Cranks would be supremely honored for you to be a part of making it happen!\n\nSincerely,\nThe Chrome Cranks", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Okay, then...", "update_content": "Whew.
