[{"backer": "Dave Stolte", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "NEW ADD-ONS!\nThe Donn Of Tiki Zombie Glasses designed by B-Rex (CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE AS ADD-ON)\nThese zombie glasses designed by B-Rex portray Donn enjoying a zombie while reflecting on key moments in his life. His time in WWII is represented by the B-26 Bomber flying overhead, the International Marketplace is represented by Donn's treehouse, and The Marama is floating by in the background. We are ecstatic over B-Rex's design and we hope that you'll add one of these glasses to your collection!\nThe Donn Of Tiki Art Print by Kymm! Bang (CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE AS ADD-ON)\nKymm! Bang designed this beautiful piece specifically for us, and we're proud to offer it as an add-on to any existing pledges. \n\"Donn is doing his best thinking on the beach, being inspired, and using the sand as his sketchbook conceiving ideas, which will wash away when he\u2019s done to keep it a secret, the way he kept his recipes...\" - Kymm! Bang. \nThis add-on is available as a 20\"x 29\" print, or as a digital download so you can print it in any size you'd like.\nThe Donn of Tiki\n\n Film Summary:\nDonn Beach is widely considered the founding father of what we know today as Tiki culture. He spent years embellishing the details of his extraordinary life, and we've decided to tackle the task of separating fact from fiction to finally tell his story\u2014 warts and all. Sailing to Jamaica with his \"grandpappy\" in his youth, running rum with his brother Hugh in the days of prohibition, becoming a Hollywood icon in the 1930's with his themed tropical bar, hunting down cigars and liquor for Churchill during WWII, and helping to shape tourism in Hawaii are just some of the amazing stories in Donn's life that are somewhat known and celebrated among his fans. \nBut what exactly is \"Tiki Culture?\" And how did Donn contribute to an aesthetic and lifestyle that resonates with people to this day? We are digging deeper to find out who this grandiose character truly was by speaking with the people who knew him, historians, and sifting through journals and audio recordings he left behind. Our goal is neither to lionize nor demonize Donn, but to paint a portrait of a man who had a significant cultural impact in 20th century Americana and cocktail culture that still resonates today.\nWhy crowdfunding?\nCrowdfunding is an important tool for independent filmmakers like us. We're passionate about telling Donn's story on our own terms, and crowdfunding will allow us to produce this film with creative freedom. We believe that this story needs to be told with extreme care. While celebrating Donn\u2019s enthusiasm to share the cultures he loved with the American people, we must earnestly examine the inherent issues of cultural appropriation. It won't be an easy task and we don't take it lightly, but having the independence to tell this story without outside influence will insure the most honest and reputable documentation of this man's life.\n\nHow will you spend the money?\nWe've already started work on this film with our own investment of time and money, but without additional funds, we can't get this boat off the shore. We have begun shooting local interviews but are ready to push off and travel to other locations. In addition to travel and location costs, your contributions will help us with the following:\nequipment rental and purchases\narchival footage and image fees\nproduction insurance\nlegal counsel\nhiring crew\naudio transcription\nYour contributions will help us complete the production phase of this film and give us the opportunity to tell Donn's story in a way that inspires beachcombers, princes and pirates alike. This story has a sense of adventure that will resonate with casual audiences as well as Tiki aficionados, but considerable funds are necessary in order to tell it properly. \n\n\n About our team: \n\n\nWhat happens if you exceed the goal?\nThis goal doesn't make up our entire budget, this is only the budget we need to get everything shot and in the can. We are hopeful that we can exceed our goal, and if so, we will use the additional funding for post-production expenses including:\nediting \nsound design\ncolor correction\nmusic licensing\nmusicians and studio time for the score\nanimation\npromotion\n\n\nHow else can I help?\nWe can't make this film without your support, but financial backing is only the beginning. The more people who participate, the more chance we have of getting Donn's story out there. Please \u201cLike\u201d us on Facebook and Instagram, email this Kickstarter link to friends or family who love Tiki culture, rum, or South Seas adventure and might want to see this film become a reality. Thank you so much for your support. We can't do this without you.\n\nIf you or someone you know would like to make a tax-deductible donation, please visit https://www.documentary.org/project/donn-tiki \n\nThe Donn Of Tiki is a fiscally sponsored project of the International Documentary Association (IDA), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

Mo'ai were monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island in eastern Polynesia approximately 1200 to 1500 C.E. They were most likely created to honor important ancestors or chiefs.  Because Donn played such a critical role in the development of tropical cocktails and the Polynesian Pop experience, we find Shag's design a fitting tribute. The mug will come in three glaze options; the third will be limited to 100 mugs and come with a signed certificate of authenticity! \n(Please note that these are images of a 3D printed prototype taken during the design process. We do not yet have final glazes to display.) \n\nToday, the Rapa Nui people continually fight to keep and protect their land. We believe that it is important to learn about and respect the cultures that Tiki is inspired by. \nTo learn more about the Rapa Nui people and their current challenges, take a look at these links.\nRapa Nui - Minority Rights \nRapa Nui - Sacred Land \nRapa Nui - Wikipedia ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilmmaking is filled with risks and challenges. Timelines change, budgetary restrictions force you to come up with creative solutions. We're asking for money to kick off this documentary. It will cover equipment and travel costs for us to interview people who knew Donn personally and people who perpetuate his spirit through their own work.

Here's our current road map:\n\nWhat We'll Do With Kickstarter Funds\nLike we said earlier: building things is hard, and EXPENSIVE. For this project, most of what we need to do is invest in the creative team that will produce the live events and educational content for The Cocktail Journey. We'll use Kickstarter funds for:\n People: we have an incredible team that is helping us to build education and amazing cocktail experiences for you -- and we need to be able to invest in those people. Most of our project funding will go to support our team so we can continue to build out the full Cocktail Journey Experience.\n Membership Site: we have a little more work to build out the members-only experience at thecocktailjourney.com, which will be the main hub for our community to access on-demand educational content, live events, members-only resources, and to connect with each other.\n Production Needs: the great news is, we already have a lot of the stuff we need when it comes to studio space and gear. We'll use a small portion of the funds upgrading a few things to improve the audio and visual experience and make production more efficient for the team.\n Funding & Stretch Goals\nOur funding goal is $25,000. This is the baseline we need in order to launch The Cocktail Journey and explore 52 cocktails in 52 weeks with you! \nWhat we'd like to create down the road is much bigger than this, and there is a lot more that we can do.  We have a 5-year roadmap to build out some really incredible things ---  but today and for this Kickstarter, we're only talking about what we can deliver in the next year. And some of that depends on how many members we get and what kind of funding we have to work with:\nAt $25,000, we'll be able to fully implement our vision of weekly cocktail recipes and live events to explore 52 cocktails in 52 weeks with you! We'll also be able to build out the membership site and members-only resources, and begin producing introductory on-demand content.\nAt $50,000, we'll be able to produce more in-depth and regular content sooner, and begin to expand beyond the 15-Bottle Bar to address other kinds of cocktail education (Think: tiki cocktails, bitters workshops, new craft spirits and liqueurs). \nAt $100,000+ we'll be able to invest in our team more fully and have enough resources to provide the visibility and financial runway to implement our 5-year plan (which is very exciting!!)\nWe'd really like to get closer to the $100k mark with The Cocktail Journey launch this month. If that doesn't happen on Kickstarter, we'll get there regardless with some post-Kickstarter growth strategies to reach the levels of membership we need to build and sustain a great experience. \nYou can help (a lot) by sharing this project early and often, and bringing your friends and fellow cocktail lovers along with you on your journey.\n\nCheers,\nRachel Eva & Shawn Michael\nRachel Eva and Shawn Michael at our home bar -- and studio set -- in San Diego, California", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRegarding Kickstarter Projects in General:\n\nThis will be our 5th Kickstarter Campaign. We take these projects very seriously, and have experience knowing what we can commit to, and how to communicate when things don't go exactly as planned. For anyone who's ever started something new, you know that things rarely go exactly as planned! We commit to communicating about any challenges that come up, and what we're doing to address them. We'll also ask for your input to be part of helping us solve challenges that may impact your experience.\n\nBacker Testimonial from Napier Jigger Project: \"I received my stainless and copper jiggers today. The quality and packaging are first rate. I know you put a whole lot of effort into delivering a high quality product, while overcoming a lot of obstacles. You did both, in addition to providing backers with great communications around the process and involving us in many decisions.\"\n\nFor The Cocktail Journey:\n\nThe biggest risk we see with this project is if we make our funding goal but don't make it to 1,000 members. In order for us to build out the full Cocktail Journey Experience, we need a good base of founding members to help us design and provide feedback on the build-out. If we have a small number of backers (even if we meet our funding goal), we'll be able to deliver on our baseline commitments, but will also need to make membership growth a big area of focus after the Kickstarter ends, which may impact how much content we are able to produce right away.\n\nOne of the challenges with building a sustained, long-term project like this is making sure we have the right team to help us get there - and that we have the right resources to invest in that team. We have a 5-year roadmap for what we want to see happen with The Cocktail Journey. For this Kickstarter, we're focusing on what we can accomplish in year 1. If we make it to our funding goal of $25,000 we'll definitely be able to Kickstart this project, but will have a lot of work to do to grow after the Kickstarter ends. We have a plan in place to do that, but it will be more challenging if we only have $25k to work with -- it gets a lot easier at the $50k and $100k funding and stretch-goal scenarios. At those higher funding scenarios, we're also able to deliver more value to backers more quickly: mostly in the form of more on-demand educational content released more frequently.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rachel Eva and Shawn Michael\n5 created \u00b7 42 backed\nRachel Eva and Shawn Michael are artists and designers with a passion for well-crafted goods.

This rich, spicy blend of creamy coconut, luscious honey, fragrant cinnamon and even more spices will find its way into your every day mixology! Great in coffee with a splash of rum for a Coffee Grog too! (note to the deep tiki nerds, the original recipe calls for dairy, but for my lactose intolerant libation lovers, I went with coconut, which adds silky texture and the lightest hint of real coconut, it's so good!). \nHoney Mix: Not just any old honey, BG Reynolds has painstakingly sourced real California Orange Blossom honey, once used by Donn Beach for dozens of his delicious cocktails. This unique honey varietal provides a bright, citrusy flavor that not only sweetens but enhances the flavor of every tipple it touches.\nTropical Red \"Fassionola\" syrup: A vivid red syrup once used by many a tiki bar for adding intense tropical flavor to Hurricanes, Zombies, and Punches. It's been recreated by many a home bartender, and now BG Reynolds brings it to your retail shelf! This all natural syrup is full of tangy passion fruit, tart cherry, and a whole host of tropical flavors!\nBG Reynolds will be bringing this lineup to life late summer 2018, and we need your help to kickstart the project!

Once these are in production, we will be shipping internationally through BGReynolds.com\nQ: Will these syrups work without alcohol?\nA: Most definitely! As a sweetener in your coffee, or a non-alcoholic punch. We'll be sure to include a few teetotaler safe recipes in the booklet!\nQ: What is the kickstarter exclusive glaze for the mug?

Many don\u2019t have a good range of measurements, and we often find ourselves needing to use multiple versions and sizes to get that range.\nFor at-home bartenders without a sink nearby, double sided jiggers are sometimes very impractical. Pour simple syrup into the smaller side, and when you need to use the other side, sticky leftovers drip all over your hand and work surface. The Napier Jigger is one-sided, so you can make all your measurements without making a mess.  \nThe stepped design also means that it's easier to find half-measurements, even when it's dark. Try to estimate an in-between measurement on a v-shaped jigger, and you'll probably miss.  Many jiggers with internal markings are hard to read, and it's challenging to tell when your pour is at (or over) the mark you're aiming for. The Napier Jigger simplifies this by having major increments built into its physical construction.  \nOur re-designed Napier also includes frequently used 1/4 and 3/4 ounce measurements. They are indicated by internal lines marked between the steps in the bottom two sections. Bravo! \nMETRIC: We launched this project with a jigger design in ounces, but due to popular demand and a huge influx of international backers, we set (and met) our stretch goal of $50K to make a metric jigger as well. \nQuality jiggers are hard to find. Both home bartenders and professionals have to deal with cheap tools breaking all the time. This is a big challenge for manufacturing a two-sided jigger, which is why we decided to make it one-sided. It won\u2019t break!   \nBeautiful tools are breathtaking, and worth making. This jigger is absolute eye candy, and your guests will definitely take notice. Our Napier reproduction pays homage to an incredible vintage design, and looks absolutely stunning.   \nSpace is another issue we wanted to solve. Rather than having multiple versions on the bar-top, wouldn\u2019t you rather have one go-to measure that does it all? Plus it\u2019s hard to keep track of so many tools, and a real pain when one of your four jiggers is missing - and that\u2019s the one you need.   \nIndustry Jigger - No Handle\nWe're also making a version of the Napier Jigger with no handle. We specifically had bartenders in mind, because it stacks! This saves even more space on the bar-top, especially when one station requires storage of multiple jiggers for making several drinks at once. \nThe Industry 2-pack comes in stainless steel, which is durable and affordable for high volume use. We haven't yet made these, and it seemed destructive to cut off the handle of a $90 vintage jigger just to illustrate the concept, so use your imagination and these renderings as an illustration:\nIllustration of Industry 2-pack, stacking\nThe Original Napier Jigger (1930\u2019s) & Standard Spoon\u2019s Re-design\nNapier was a US jewelry company that began producing barware in the 1930\u2019s. The original stepped jigger was silver-plated, and offered 4 measurements: \u00bd oz, 1 oz, 1 \u00bd oz, and 2 oz. If you\u2019re lucky enough to find one of the originals, it will cost you $80 - $275, depending on what condition it\u2019s in.  \nWhen we set out to design our ideal jigger, we did a lot of research. We tested and prototyped a few designs, and just weren\u2019t happy with them. One day Rachel came across an Instagram photo of a vintage Napier stepped jigger, and exclaimed - \u201cTHIS is exactly what we\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d Then Shawn said \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve seen that jigger before - Jamie Boudreau uses one at Canon in Seattle.\u201d \nSometimes that\u2019s the way brainstorming goes here at Standard Spoon.  \nWe chatted with Jamie about it - he's been using a stepped Napier Jigger for years. He especially likes that since the walls are straight, it's easy to estimate half-measurements (as opposed to V-shaped jiggers), and that it means he now only needs one jigger, not 3. \nWe were intrigued. It took us months to find and purchase just a few of the vintage pieces to use and test. When we started using them, we fell in love even more. We are so excited to make these available (and affordable) for you to own, use, and fall in love with yourself. \nWe have made a few modifications to the original design. Partly this is to increase functionality, and partly to prevent shady folks from passing our tools off as originals to unsuspecting collectors:  \nAddition of Standard Spoon logo on underside. The original Napier Jigger has \u201cNapier\u201d underneath the handle. Ours will not, but will have our logo on the bottom of the jigger.\nUS (oz) Version: Addition of \u00bc oz and \u00be oz internal measurements. We will be adding two lines on the inside to make it easier for you to measure these very common amounts. The original Napier Jigger does not have these markings. These markings will be on the inside ONLY and are functional additions - they will not be visible on the outside of the jigger.\nInternal markings will be added for 1/4 and 3/4 oz measurements\nMetric (ml) Version: Since we met our stretch goal, we will also be making a Napier Jigger with milliliter measurements. We want to stick close to the aesthetics of the original design, but also make an accurate metric jigger (not just re-assign labels). The steps will be re-designed to correspond with 15ml, 30ml, 45ml, and 60ml (see more about the ongoing design process below).\nFinish Options: \nSilver Plated - The original Napier Jigger was silver-plated. We are honoring the original design with a silver-plated version. We are also adding:\nSolid Copper - the copper jigger will be SOLID copper, not plated. Copper plating has a tendency to rub off a little too easily, so when we found out we could make it completely copper, we went for it.  \nGold Plated - we\u2019re not making a solid gold jigger (how much would THAT thing cost?!), but gold plating processes are pretty well developed.     \nMetric Version of Napier Jigger   \nWe launched a minimum viable product (in oz only) on Kickstarter, and we met our funding goal in 4.5 days. Thanks Backers! That was confirmation we were on the right path. A week into the campaign we already had backers from 21 different countries (as of this writing we're up to 33).  \nThe obvious choice for a stretch goal was to create a version with milliliters for backers using the metric system (basically everyone besides the US, Liberia, and Myanmar).\nWe'll keep the aesthetic design of the Napier Jigger essentially the same, but the steps will correspond with 15ml, 30ml, 45ml, and 60ml.  You can read our announcement (with details) in Backer Update #2.\nSince the metric jigger is still in development, be sure to check updates for the latest news on design.\nWe'll be making the metric jiggers in the same styles and finishes as the imperial jiggers (the ones with ounces) - so just pledge for the Industry 2-pack, Silver, Copper, or Gold.  We'll have you indicate ml v. oz in our backer survey when the Kickstarter ends.\nDesign Prototypes & Manufacturing Plan   \nThis project is a unique one for us, because the product we want to make has already been made - 80 years ago.  \nThe antique jiggers we\u2019ve purchased over the last year are serving as our design prototypes. These are the ones we got:  \nPretty rough, right? Some of them don't look great, but all of them were solid and accurate after 80+ years of use. After using them, we decided that this was it.  \nDesign Prototypes\nThe jigger above on the left is the silver jigger we used in our video. Note that the final version of our silver jigger will be MUCH cleaner, exhibit no patina or blemishes. It'll look pretty close to this one, the very rare, pristine jigger offered by Sir Jacks (at the time of our Kickstarter launch, the price is $275):\nWe sent the second vintage jigger to our factory for analysis and to use as a model for our new jiggers. The vintage jigger on the right we plated in Copper, and that's the gorgeous one you see often on this page and in the video.  \nOur finished jiggers will be just as clean and pristine as the Silver and Copper versions shown here.\nWhere's the Gold? Vintage jiggers are in such high demand, we couldn't find another one to plate in gold as a sample (also it's been really tough to find someone who does gold plating quickly, economically, and nearby). But we have these digital renderings of the Metric Jigger to help your imagination:\nSilver - Copper - Gold\n(Note it Again: All the jiggers you see in our video and on this page are vintage Napier Jiggers - even the copper one we've cleaned up and made copper. These are our design prototypes, not production samples. The photos do not demonstrate the modifications we will be making such as additional measurements and a logo on the bottom. We'll have more 3D renderings coming soon to show those changes!)\n3D Models & Renderings\nSince we hit our original goal in only 4.5 days, we've already gotten started on some of our tasks to move forward!  We've made some 3D models, which will be EXTREMELY helpful in communicating accurate design with our manufacturer.  Here are some screenshots:\nAs we continue to make progress, we'll include more information in our Backer Updates - so be sure to check there for the most recent developments.\nManufacturer\nWe have provided these design prototypes to our manufacturer to study and dissect, and they have assured us that they can reproduce the Napier Jigger according to our specifications. We are using the same contract manufacturing team that we\u2019ve used for both of our cocktail spoons and for our Hammered Mixing Glass, and we are very pleased with their work and the history we have with them.  \nThe manufacturer we\u2019ve selected is in the manufacturing district of Shenzhen, China, and is very experienced with barware. They have made jiggers (with and without handles), cups, shakers, flasks, and other bar tools, and have worked with metal plating finishes. We\u2019re confident these can be made just the way we want them!  \nNow that we've also created 3D design files, we'll be able to clearly communicate measurements, styles, and details in a very direct way.\nAbout Metal Plating\nPlating is a finishing process where metal is adhered to the surface of an item. In our case, the Jigger will be manufactured in Stainless Steel, and then coated with either Silver or Gold. The exception: the Copper Jigger will be manufactured in 100% copper (yes, that means all the way through). \nMetal plating on any item can rub off with repeated use. In fact, it\u2019s really hard to find a vintage Napier Jigger with pristine silver plating. In addition, modern barware manufacturers often use the most economical plating available to make it look pretty. This is usually just a thin layer, and sensitive to wear. \nWe\u2019ve already discussed with the factory our desire to apply a thicker layer of plating to the silver- and gold-plated jiggers, so the beautiful finish will be much more durable than other plated barware you may already have in your collection. \nWhy We're on Kickstarter\nThe challenge with this product is that tooling and production is VERY expensive. We won\u2019t pull the trigger on tooling and production samples until we know that there\u2019s a desire for this jigger to be made, which is why we\u2019re here on Kickstarter.  \nKickstarter not only helps us prove the concept that this is a tool you want us to make, but it also provides us with invaluable feedback from you - our backers - on what's important to you when designing barware. We aim to please!\nProduction Plan\nOnce we meet our funding goal, we\u2019ll have the factory start work on tooling and production samples. We\u2019ll review the samples, provide feedback and make any changes that might be necessary, then go to full production. \nOur conservative estimate is to have these to you in the Spring. It\u2019s very likely that we\u2019ll get them out sooner, but we\u2019ve learned to build in a time buffer to account for any project delays, sample revisions, holidays, and/or problem solving that might need to take place. Of course, we'll always keep you up to date on any challenges we encounter and victories we celebrate!\nReward Levels & Shipping:  \nMost of our reward levels are pretty straightforward - we try to keep things simple. You can pledge for one of the four jigger styles (Industry 2-Pack, or Napier Jigger in Silver, Copper, or Gold), or become a benefactor by backing us at the LUXE Stirred Cocktail Kit tier. \n\nWe usually have a few fine folks each Kickstarter that want to support the creation of new barware in a big way, and we like to give them something special in return. This time, it's the chance to get both of our cocktail spoons in gold, silver, or copper finishes (currently they are only available in stainless steel).\nNew Add-On & Reward Tier:\nWe added the Gold Napier T-Shirt as a Kickstarter Add-on. Backers wanted a way to help us meet our stretch goal, so we gave it to them!  The Gold Napier T-Shirt can be added-on to any pledge level by increasing your pledge amount by $25.  We also added it as a standalone reward level for those friends who wanted it by itself.\nThe shirts are super-soft, pre-shrunk, and fit great in both men's and ladies' styles. The gold metallic ink is really durable and has held up great in the wash (I'd washed mine about 12 times when this photo was taken):\nMeet the Team  \nStandard Spoon Barware is just two people: Shawn Michael and Rachel Eva. We love cocktails and good design. We also love Kickstarter \u2013 we partnered with backers like you to launch Standard Spoon in 2014, and have brought all of our tools into the world thanks to crowdfunding.\nWe continue to use Kickstarter because we think it\u2019s important to engage with our community of backers and fans from the very beginning. We also want to be good stewards of our resources \u2013 so we won\u2019t invest time and money developing products that no one wants.

If making things was easy, everyone would do it.\n\nThis is the fourth cocktail tool that we're manufacturing overseas, and we've learned so much during the process for the other three that we have a good concept of what will be required to move forward. We're aware of common pitfalls (like national holidays delaying production), and are taking extra care to prepare for these in advance. We are also using the same contract manufacturing team that we've been working with since 2014, and we have a very good working relationship with them. They understand our values and the integrity of our tools.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge for this particular project is that we have not yet obtained production samples. The factory has assured us that they can produce these tools according to our specifications, but there's always the chance that something won't be exactly right on the first try. \n\nThere's also a chance that when we move into mass production, there could be a hiccup or two that happens during the process.\n\nIn either case, we'll work with the manufacturing team to problem solve any production challenges. \n\nIf this occurs, the impact to the project is usually just a time delay. We are fully prepared for this and have built a big time buffer into our promised delivery timeline. Ideally we won't hit any snags, and we'll be able to deliver well ahead of schedule. \n\nSometimes a slight design modification may be required in order to move forward. We have very high standards for our designs, and any change will be evaluated in depth, and communicated thoroughly to backers.

You can still get them here.\nHi Kickstarter!  \nWe (Shawn Michael and Rachel Eva) funded and fulfilled a Kickstarter Campaign in 2014 for two new bar spoons. We're excited to introduce you now to our new Mixing Glass and Maple Muddler:\nWe're also incredibly excited about being able to make these gorgeous Ebony Muddlers, and contribute to sustainable forestry practices in Cameroon in the process!  You can pre-order these right here on Kickstarter:\nQuality Barware for Craft Cocktails\nAs artists, foodies, and cocktail lovers, we enjoy not only the process of drinking a good cocktail, but the process of making one as well. When we started making cocktails years ago, we used a pint glass and a chopstick to stir our first Old Fashioned Cocktail.  Not my proudest moment, but hey - we didn't know any better, and hadn't collected the right tools yet!\nMaking a great cocktail is so much more than just mixing some booze together. With intention, the right tools, and a bit of learning, making a cocktail is a work of art by itself, and just plain impressive to your guests.\nIn the years since that first Old Fashioned, we've loved improving our cocktail experience with quality tools.  Here's an overview of the new ones we're bringing to you today via Kickstarter:\nThe Mixing Glass\nA Mixing Glass is used for stirred drinks as the prepping vessel. Always STIR cocktails when they contain only clear spirits and liqueurs, like the Old Fashioned, Martini, Manhattan, or Sazerac Cocktails. Add your spirits and other ingredients to the Mixing Glass, add ice, and stir to chill and dilute before straining into the glass you're serving in.\nA good Mixing Glass makes this stirring and serving experience a really enjoyable one, and adds that special touch of preparation and intention to cocktail making that guests always love.\nSince we created our bar spoons, we amassed quite a collection of mixing glasses to go along with them. We found that many of the fine, beautiful mixing glasses were very expensive ($45-60), and those that were more economical ($10-20) left something to be desired in the design department. \nWe wanted to create something that was stunning to look at, but didn't break the bank. Especially considering the fact that mixing glasses often DO break, it needed to be affordably replaceable.\nThe Maple Muddler\nWe love having a good muddler in our bar and use it frequently. \nMuddlers are sometimes used in stirred cocktails, like the Old Fashioned when you want to use a fancy sugar cube instead of simple syrup - use the Muddler to crush up sugar and mix it with bitters before adding your bourbon. More often, muddlers are used for shaken cocktails that contain herbs, aromatics, fruits or vegetables.  A Muddler is used to press fresh mint to extract its oils, and to crush cucumber, berries, and other ingredients for shaken cocktails. \n A Muddler is also an essential bar tool for crushing ice in a lewis bag to make drinks like the Mint Julep Cocktail.   \nThere are a lot of problems with muddlers. Many manufacturers of bar tools throw in a muddler as an afterthought to complete their bar tool offerings. Often they are made of cheap soft wood that dents easily. Quite often (somewhat unbelieveably), they are finished with stains or varnishes, which is a BIG NO NO when you\u2019re working with something you\u2019re about to put in your body. I remember one of the first muddlers we owned looked like a cherry wood muddler, but it was actually a reddish varnish that started chipping off into our cocktails.  \nAnother muddler design we don't prefer is the meat-tenderizer style \u2013 a textured muddle end that macerates indiscriminately. We don't always want to get at the ingredient like a garbage disposal. Mint leaves should never be torn to shreds for a mojito, but pressed lightly to release the oils only. A nice flat muddler end does just that.\nThe Ebony Story\nEbony is a beautiful, naturally dark, dense hardwood. Ebony is strong. Ebony is rare. Ebony is highly desired \u2013 and a threatened wood species. \n Ebony has a long history of use, dating back to ancient Egypt. Because of its density, it is one of the strongest woods \u2013 it is the only wood that is dense enough to sink in water! However, due to high demand and unsustainable harvesting practices, there just isn\u2019t that much Ebony left in the world. Every country (except one) that used to export ebony has either harvested all of it, or is protecting what little is left. Pete Lowry, ebony and rosewood expert at the Missouri Botanical Garden, calls the Madagascar ebony wood trade the \"equivalent of Africa's blood diamonds.\"\nSo\u2026 why are we making an Ebony muddler?  \nWe have another story to tell about Ebony \u2013 and it starts in Cameroon, the last place in the world where Ebony can still be legally obtained. Most legal ebony is used these days in the music industry \u2013 for fingerboards, pegs, picks, and other small parts. However, not all of the ebony that comes to the instrument factories is exactly what they need - it\u2019s too short for a fingerboard, or has a wormhole in it, or some other minor imperfection.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Taylor Guitars here in San Diego to make use of the ebony they\u2019ve acquired that cannot be used for guitar making. We\u2019re really excited about this relationship, because it\u2019s a way for us to put into practice in a sustainable way the philosophy of \u201cusing the whole pig,\u201d if you will \u2013 not wasting a precious resource that is valuable and scarce. In addition, by being an end-user of legal, secondary ebony wood stock, we\u2019ll be supporting the sustainability efforts of ebony growers in Cameroon.  \nHere\u2019s an incredible clip of Bob Taylor explaining the ebony wood crisis, and what he and his team are doing to support sustainable harvesting practices in Cameroon.  Video used courtesy of Taylor Guitars.\nWe are so pleased to be a part of this story!\nOur Design Philosophy\nQuality - with so many corners being cut in manufacturing today, our goal is to bring a standard of quality to our tools that takes us back to the era of the 40's and 50's, when products were built to last. This era also contributes to our design aesthetics, because mid-century tools were as beautiful and classic as they were sturdy.\nBeauty - because we're artists, aesthetic design is crucial to us.  We will not design ugly tools, no matter how functional they are.\nOriginality - again, probably because we're artists, and we have a great deal of artistic integrity.  We are not interested in creating something that already exists, so we consider innovation in every product we design.\nNot all products require the same kind of innovation - with our cocktail spoons, we addressed issues with functionality and longevity.  With our mixing glass, we've addressed issues of price point and accessibility to a beautiful glass. We're making a muddler the way it should be - strong, natural, and firm. We're making the first readily available Ebony Muddler - using wood so dense that it's nearly impregnable to liquid, with a handle that will give the most amazing user experience.\nDesign Process & Product Details\n Mixing Glass Design\nFUNCTION - Gorgeous aesthetics aside, from a functionality standpoint, this Mixing Glass is incredible! We've used it ourselves, it's been used by bartenders, has spent time in several high volume bars, and we've gotten great feedback.  Some highlights are:\nFeels very natural (effortless even) when stirring with a barspoon - it's a good diameter for the mechanics of barspoon use and the spoon flows like butter around the inside of the glass\nWeighted Bottom - feels great! It's heavier than a tin or a Pyrex glass so it stays where you put it, which makes it less likely to slide around and fall off the bar.\nWalls of the glass are a good thickness (4 mm) - feels sturdy, but not overdone. Thinner glass means cocktails chill more quickly.\nThe top rim of the glass is nice and thin (as thick as the walls) - so no unsightly bulging.\nThis glass fits a lot of liquid for its size.  It is in no way oversized in your hand, measuring about 3.5 inches (9 cm) in diameter, but has plenty of room inside - it comes in at a whopping 24 oz, or about 700 ml.\nFits really nicely in the hand when straining - not too big (or heavy) to handle\nFits a Hawthorne strainer like a glove\nAESTHETICS - We've gotten a lot of \"WOW\" moments from folks who love mixing glasses when we show them this one. Here's an overview of some of the aesthetic design features:\nAntique hammered glass finish - we wanted something different than some of the popular cut glass designs out there today, so we opted for one like hammered glass. It\u2019s subtle, provides texture, and feels natural and organic, like raindrops, leaves, or ripples in a lake. It reflects light incredibly, and makes any cocktail come alive.  \nSpout design - small and dainty, not something that looks like a giant, unsightly upside down nose:\nWe've found emoji to be helpful in communicating with factories overseas :)\nWeighted Bottom - because it just feels good and solid when you set it down, and it stays where you put it.  It reminds us of those nice Old Fashioned Glasses used in Madmen... there's just something about a beautiful slab of glass...\nSeam v. Seamless - For those of you that own a few mixing glasses already, you may be aware that some mixing glasses are seamed, and some are seamless. The seam does not impact performance, but it costs more to eliminate it, because it's a different manufacturing process. To keep our costs low, and therefore to keep the price point at a reasonable place, this mixing glass does have seams. However, the texture on the glass makes those seams a lot less noticeable, and we think it\u2019s worked wonderfully. So wonderfully, in fact, that we found them incredibly difficult to photograph!\nMaple Muddler Design: \nWe designed our Muddler out of solid, dense maple wood, with a nice big flat muddle end. It measures 10\" long, with a 3/4\" diameter on the small end, and a 1-3/8\" diameter on the large end. Some smaller diameter muddlers allow a stubborn strawberry or slippery cucumber to get away too quickly \u2013 you can really pin them down with this one. \nIt\u2019s got a straight, simple design which just looks amazing and makes it aerodynamically easy to clean quickly. And it contains no stains or varnishes (those can flake off into your cocktail!) - it\u2019s finished with natural mineral oil only. We recommend periodically applying mineral oil as a maintenance process, which is recommended for all wooden kitchen tools as a life-extending measure.\n  Since this muddler is made from natural wood, variations and markings in grain patterns are guaranteed - each Muddler is completely unique!\nEbony Muddler Design: \nVery similar in diameter to our Maple Muddle, the Ebony Muddler also features a sophisticated, ergonomically satisfying handle. It\u2019s quite lovely, and makes grasping a very gratifying experience.\nOur Ebony Muddlers have no stain or finish. Ebony is so dense that sanding and polishing are all the finish it needs. These muddlers are so beautiful and so durable that they will easily become treasured heritage pieces in your bar collection.\nA Note on Color: Ebony has a reputation as being pure black, but that\u2019s not how all ebony is. If you watched the video of Bob Taylor (above) shedding light on ebony harvesting practices, you\u2019ll have learned that only about 1 in every 10 ebony trees has a solid black core. The only way to know if an ebony tree was solid black in the middle was to chop down trees until you found one. \nRather than continue this grossly unsustainable practice of wasteful harvesting in order to supply ebony consumers with pure black wood, all 10 trees are now harvested and supplied to end users. This means that 1) we won\u2019t run out of ebony, and 2) the ebony that is now used today has color in it.  \nAnd it\u2019s beautiful! Swirls and fades of grey and blonde add character and a completely unique aesthetic to each muddler we make. So please embrace this new era of ebony, and celebrate the color of the wood with us!\nManufacturing Plan:\nMixing Glass \u2013 We are using an overseas factory for the Mixing Glass, and are working with the same project management team that we used for our two cocktail spoons. We learned a lot from our last Kickstarter project, so this will not be our first time working with an overseas manufacturer.\nThis time around, we have already communicated our design plans, partnered with a glassworks factory, and had two rounds of production samples made. The first sample was a first pass at our manufacturing request; we provided feedback, and the second sample was made, which we are very happy with! We are confident that we\u2019ve partnered with the right factory, and since we\u2019ve already paid for tooling costs and done the legwork on perfecting the design, all that\u2019s left to do is place an order!\nMuddlers \u2013 We\u2019ve already got our manufacturing process down for making the muddlers, so there\u2019s not much to figure out here! We have already been making some Maple Muddlers at our home workshop, and this is how we plan on fulfilling those (and the Ebony ones) that are ordered by early backers to be delivered in time for the holidays. \nWe have limited the number of muddlers that we promise to deliver by Christmas, because we have a limited capacity (and time) to get those out. Going forward, we\u2019ll be purchasing some additional machines and be able to buy wood stock in large quantities in order to turn out even more.\nReward Levels & Shipping\nThe pledge and reward levels are pretty straightforward, but for those of us who are visual people, here's a little diagram of what's included in each tier:\n  A note on holiday shipping: Only Ebony Muddlers ordered by US backers in reward levels 4, 7, and 10 will be shipped by the holidays due to limited availability.  ALL Maple Muddlers and Spoons that are ordered by the first 150 US Backers will ship by the holidays. Please note: Holiday Shipping is guaranteed to US Addresses Only, and Backers MUST complete their surveys by December 14th.\nInternational Shipping: Unfortunately, we are not able to offer holiday shipping to International Backers with addresses outside of the United States. In addition, because international shipping rates can be very expensive, we are not able to send multiple packages to international addresses. So if you pre-order a Mixing Glass and order a muddler or spoon as well, we will hold on to your muddler and spoon, and all your rewards will ship in one package. If you really want your muddlers and spoons before the Mixing Glass is ready, please add $15 to your pledge (in addition to the included shipping charges), and we'll send them separately.\nLooking for Multiples?  If you want to add extra tools to your pledge, you can do so by increasing your pledge amount to include extra Mixing Glasses, Muddlers and Spoons. To add an extra item, increase your pledge by:\n$15 to add one Maple Muddler\n$35 to add one Mixing Glass\n$55 to add one Ebony Muddler\n$35 to add one Aero Cocktail Spoon\n$45 to add one Wingman Cocktail Spoon\nDon't worry about adding extra funds for additional shipping costs; we've got you covered.\nThe Aero and Wingman Cocktail Spoons\nMissed our first Kickstarter?  These spoons were the result.  The Mixing Glass and Muddlers pair perfectly with these beauties, and we have a few reward options for you to buy a little cocktail set - a Mixing Glass and Maple Muddler with either the Aero or Wingman to accompany them.\nThe Aero Cocktail Spoon (top) and Wingman Spinning Cocktail Spoon (below)\nHere's a little description of the spoons; for more details, Visit our Website.\nAero Cocktail Spoon: While most straight-handled bar spoons are tacked together with a weak weld and often break, ours is fused into one piece for a seamless design.  Its slim profile is easy to insert around the ice in a mixing glass, and its aerodynamic body is great for near-friction-less stirring (perfect for left-handed use too). The bowl of the spoon holds 1/8 oz of liquid, including the meniscus. The weighted end provides for a beautifully balanced bar spoon, something that feels like a tool, not a toy.\nWingman Cocktail Spoon: For bartenders, this spoon requires less hand and wrist motion, improves consistency of dilution (especially when stirring two drinks at once), and decreases the concentration required in a high volume setting. This is a go-to spoon for bartenders dealing with occupational injuries or wrist strain. For the home cocktail enthusiast or beginning bartender, this swivel spoon is the easiest way to stir a drink. The bowl of the spoon holds 1/8 oz of liquid, including the meniscus.\n Cocobolo Muddlers\nWait... What?! \nYou may have noticed that the Benefactor Tier includes a special muddler we snuck in for generous backers.  We JUST received a very limited supply of Cocobolo; enough to make only 10 Muddlers.  Cocobolo is a tropical hardwood from Central America, and is known for its incredible orange and reddish-brown grain.  \nWe'll be turning some of those on the lathe this week and hope to post some finished photos soon, but until then, here's a peek at the raw wood stock we have on hand:\nWho We Are\nWe are Shawn Michael and Rachel Eva, a creative team also known as Work of My Hands. We are artists and designers, and love quality made goods.

Meet the WITCHDOCTOR, the overzealous protector of this mysterious archipelago. He\u2019s ready for action with his shiny cauldron, potent elixirs, and shrunken heads. There\u2019s only one problem\u2026 The Witchdoctor STINKS at magic. When he mixes a potion or casts a spell, watch out! \n\nWe\u2019ve had this guy in our head for a long time and are excited to bring him to life in his own stop-motion animated short.  Nobody knows exactly what the Witchdoctor is (automaton? demon? imp?) or where he came from.  But we think people will like him.\nThe Witchdoctor excited to mix a new potion!\nTECHNIQUE\nStop-motion animation, water puppetry, special effects\u2026 it\u2019s all going into the film. We\u2019ve assembled a close-knit group of artists to help us make The Witchdoctor. They bring all sorts of talents to the table top\u2026 painting, sculpting, sewing, digital effects, and even old school filmmaking. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re shooting portions of this story on super 8mm\u2014creating a cinematic brew of old and new. \nDARK RIDES\nOur film is inspired by theme park DARK-RIDE attractions. There\u2019s something haunting and elemental about those glow-in-the-dark environments that stokes the imagination. We are filming The Witchdoctor with a special black-light process so we can push the colors and highlights to the max. We've been experimenting with this technique for a while and can't wait to show you how it looks :)\nOur Tiki Idols bask in the cool glow of the black-light\nTIKI\nWe\u2019re longtime fans of all things Tiki, and have always hoped to make an animated film with a tiki vibe. We love traditional oceanic art and tribal carvings, as well as their modern, kitschy descendants.\nFrom Exotica music, to tropical d\u00e9cor, to ceramic mugs, Tiki culture is all about mystery and atmosphere, and that will permeate the animated world of the Witchdoctor.  We want the audience to sail into our exotic dioramas and lose themselves on a fantasy voyage. You\u2019ll even have the opportunity to bring home a souvenir from your travels\u2026  \nREWARDS\nWe are SUPER excited to offer a kickstarter-exclusive Witchdoctor tiki mug.  We're collaborating with Tiki Diablo on this mug, so it will be equal parts drinking vessel and art object.  No cheap trinkets, these will be handmade right here in SoCal.\nNEW REWARD!!!! \nPLAY\n\nWITCHDOCTOR SHRUNKEN HEAD KIT\nWhy let WitchDoctor have all the fun?  Now you can make your own unique shrunken heads at home.  Scare your neighbors! Wear them around your neck like a true head hunter!  \n\nThis kit includes all the materials you'll need, including a silicone mold of an original Screen Novelties sculpture.  Customize your head with different hair, eyes, and paint jobs.  We'll create an online gallery to showcase our backers' finished heads.\n*This reward can be added onto existing pledges.  See FAQ for details.\nOther physical rewards include a Witchdoctor T-Shirt and a view-master set with 3D stills from the short.  We also have some cool digital reward levels that include things like the finished short film, designs & storyboards, and time-lapse videos of the production.\nABOUT US\nScreen Novelties is a small animation studio founded by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan. We share a love of classic cartoons and stop-motion animation.\nup on the studio roof\nAs students of stop-motion history, we've been inspired by the amazing work of George Pal, Karel Zeman, Rankin/Bass, Jim Henson, Lotte Reiniger, and Ray Harryhausen, among others. Those influences show through in our animation, but we also strive to push the art form forward with our own fresh spin on design and craft.  \nIn the last decade we\u2019ve had the the privilege to work on fun projects like SpongeBob Squarepants, Chowder, Flapjack, Robot Chicken, Adventure Time, and Elf: Buddy\u2019s Musical Christmas. We\u2019ve also done a bunch of TV commercials and even got to do a crazy sock puppet sequence with Seth MacFarlane for the Oscars.\n We\u2019ve had a blast on all these projects, but we\u2019ve been itching to get back to our roots, making short films. Before we started the company we made some oddball shorts like Graveyard Jamboree and collaborated with Ray Harryhausen on the Tortoise & the Hare.\n\nIndependent shorts are fertile ground for experimenting with design and technique, and we\u2019re using Witchdoctor to push our limits as animators and filmmakers. \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nThe Witchdoctor is an experimental animated film. If we sought funding through traditional channels the project would likely veer in a direction that is not true to its spirit. Through Kickstarter, we hope to connect with supporters who value independent animation and see the potential of the Witchdoctor.\n\nWHERE THE MONEY WILL GO\nStop-motion animation is an intricate and laborious process. Everything seen on the screen is crafted by hand. Because of this, stop-motion is not cheap to execute. We have already invested significant time and money into making the initial puppets and the sets for the film. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have the resources to finish the film on our own. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reaching out to all of you through kickstarter. 100% of the funds raised will go into the production of the film. The graphic below shows how we plan to allocate the funds:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES\nEvery film carries a certain amount of risk, because each film has a unique set of challenges.

Thank you for donating and supporting our film!\nAfter a sold-out premiere at the 2015 SXSW Film Festival with features in Variety, Uncut, Billboard and others, Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove is ready to make its way onto screens around the world. \nSir Doug & the Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove tells the story of Doug Sahm, the wild man musician\u2019s musician and unsung hero of Texas music. A country music child prodigy and teenage rhythm and blues dynamo who caused a riot at his San Antonio high school, Sahm emerged as an international rock star leading the Sir Douglas Quintet. He landed in San Francisco just in time for the Summer of Love in 1967. He returned to Texas as the cowboy hippie rocker who built a burgeoning music scene in Austin before forming the Tex-Mex super group The Texas Tornados. A kinetic, quirky character with a solid sense of place as well as an innate wanderlust, Doug Sahm\u2019s story is the story of Texas Music.\nPhoto by Van Brooks\nMaking a film of this scope is no easy feat, nor is it cheap. Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove was made possible by the Society for the Preservation of Texas Music, a 501(c)3 non-profit, and we've made it this far. In order to incorporate the best of Doug Sahm's music into our documentary, tracks like \"Mendocino\", \"She's About a Mover\" and over 40 more of Doug's quintessential songs, we need to pay for music licensing. The world NEEDS to hear Doug's authentic sound, so we've taken to Kickstarter to raise the funds to license the music of Doug Sahm for the documentary. With your help, our film can reach the world.\nIt's the mission of Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove to spread Doug's music far and wide to earn him his rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kickstart our documentary and you kickstart Doug into the Hall of Fame! Not able to donate to the film?

From 1996 to 1999, Sahm and Patoski served as announcers for the SXSW softball tournament championship game, which traditionally closes the annual music/film/technology festival.\nLouis Black - Executive Producer\nLouis Black co-founded The Austin Chronicle, where he is editor, SXSW, where he is a director, and was a founding Board Member of the Austin Film Society. He has written extensively on film, music and politics. Executive producer of Be Here to Love Me, A Film About Townes Van Zandt, he was a producer on the Peabody Award Winning The Order of Myths. Having produced documentaries and reissues of classic Texas films (Eagle Pennell's The Whole Shootin' Match and Tobe Hooper's Eggshells) he is currently working on a number of documentary and narrative films as well as more reissues of classic Texas independent films.\nAlan Berg - Executive Producer\nAn award-winning documentary filmmaker and native Texan, Alan co-founded Arts+Labor in 2004. His films have screened at Cannes, SXSW, and The Los Angeles Film Festival, and he\u2019s had two documentaries nationally distributed by PBS. He has won more than twenty state and national awards for his reporting and worked on the PBS Best Practices in Journalism project. Alan has also taught reporting and long-form narrative storytelling at the University of Texas.\nDawn Johnson - Producer\nDawn Johnson grew up in Austin, Texas. After graduating from the University of Texas with a double major in Government and Philosophy, she stumbled into filmmaking when a friend asked her to help with a documentary he was making with Rick Linklater. Since then she has been producing and directing feature and short documentaries, television series, and commercials. \nDawn's work as Producer/Director on the KLRU series Downtown earned her three Lone Star Emmys. She was the production manager for Margaret Brown\u2019s award winning film Be Here To Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt. She was the lead Field Producer for the A&E series Heavy, and recently produced a pilot for The National Geographic Channel about Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. She worked with Arts+Labor as the producer of their film Outside Industry about the history of the SXSW music conference.\nMost importantly, Dawn is a huge Doug Sahm fan.\nFriend of Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, Dr. John, Fathead Newman, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and several generations of musicians of all stripes, Sahm played a critical role in launching and re-launching the careers of Willie Nelson, Freddy Fender, Flaco Jimenez, Steve Jordan and Roky Erickson. Above all, he was the \u201cGroover\u2019s groover\u201d, a kinetic whirlwind moving a mile a minute who also happened to be an exceptional musician and a natural bandleader. An engaging, larger than life character who operated on instinct, he wore his heart in his lyrics, and made some profound observations along the way, not the least of which was: \n\u201cYou just can\u2019t live in Texas/if you don\u2019t have a lot of soul.\u201d \nDelivering the word in rapid-fire hip-talking soul cat jive straight out of San Antonio\u2019s El West Side, Sahm was a player\u2019s player who could hit the note, work a rhythm, and fall into a natural groove effortlessly, no matter if he was playing onstage or in the studio, cutting record deals, hyping a gig, or making movie cameos playing himself: the pot-smoking, Pearl Beer-drinking, enchilada-eating longhaired electric cowboy from Texas. \nHe was big in Austin, big in San Antonio, big in San Francisco, big in Sweden, big in western Canada, big on television\u2019s American Bandstand, Shindig, Hullabaloo, Ready Steady Go, Austin City Limits. Admired by pretty much every player he shared a stage with, he was a singing, twanging encyclopedia of Texas music, able to quote T-Bone Walker, Bob Wills, Adolph Hofner, Sunny Ozuna, Lefty Frizzell, Buddy Holly, and the Thirteenth Floor Elevators at the call of \u201cin the key of C, gentlemen.\u201d \nThis all started in the spring of 2013 with the dedication of Kerry Awn\u2019s 80 ft mural above the produce section of the Central Market Westgate, a bird\u2019s-eye view of storied poster artist\u2019s vision of Austin, which included not one, but two references to Doug Sahm. Actually, it started fifty years ago with a song I heard on the radio, whose groove suggested a band from Britain rather than a five piece from Texas. From there, Doug Sahm has taken me on a lifelong musical odyssey that threads through San Francisco in the late sixties along with all the hippie accouterments that went with it, back home to San Antonio, where he had a deep history as a country and western swing child prodigy and a rock and roll and rhythm and blue teen sensation, up to Austin, where he set up shop next door to a low-ceilinged club just as Austin was becoming recognized as a musical hot spot built upon the idea of the Cosmic Cowboy, then on to exotic places such as Sweden and British Columbia, always circling back home to Texas, where he organized the Texas Tornados supergroup as well as blues bands, rock bands, and western bands.\n\nSir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove, Featured in Uncut\nSahm\u2019s journey tells the story of popular music, of coming of age in Texas, the soulfulness of San Antonio, and the emergence of Austin \u2013 all wrapped into one kinetic bundle of energy. It\u2019s a story I\u2019ve wanted to tell for almost forty years, because Doug\u2019s story is the story of Texas music. But it wasn\u2019t until the spring of 2013 that I realized the way to tell Doug Sahm\u2019s story was as a film documentary. A book wouldn\u2019t suffice. Readers can\u2019t hear Doug\u2019s drawl, appreciate the encyclopedic breadth of his music, or see where it came from.\nTime is short. Doug\u2019s been gone fifteen years already. Two of the four founders of the Tornados, Augie Meyers and Flaco Jimenez remain active, and Doug\u2019s influence remains strong.\n\nThe project has afforded me the luxury of reassessing more than forty years of cultural immersion in the subject \u2013 the person, the people and the scene around him, the power of his music and other music during certain periods of time, and, ultimately, the way certain music \u2013 Doug Sahm music, for sure - conveys a sense of place. \n\nI\u2019ve learned twice as much about Doug and the world around him than I already knew, which I thought was a lot. It makes me want to dig deeper, discover more, and chase my curiosity. In the meantime, I can say this: You want to know what Texas sounds like? Have you ever wondered why San Antonio seems so soulful? Or how Austin became Austin?\nSit back and watch this.\n\nRARE VINTAGE POSTERS ONLY AVAILABLE THROUGH KICKSTARTER REWARDS:\nPoster #1 (only 1 available)\nPoster #2 (only 1 available)\nPoster #3 (only 1 available)\nPoster #4 (only 1 available)\nPoster #5 (only 1 available)\n        \n\nHow do I sign the petition without donating to the film?

Thank you for spreading the word about our Kickstarter campaign with your friends!\nHow did this film receive it's initial funding? Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove was made under the auspices of the Society for the Preservation of Texas Music, a 501(c)3 non-profit.\nHow does the induction of musicians into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame work? The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website states the nomination guidelines for inductees as the following: Beginning in 2012, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened Nominee voting to fans around the world. The Top Five Nominees as voted by the fans count for one ballot entry, which is weighted the same as individual ballot entries submitted by members of the international voting body. - See more by visiting the RRHOF website. \nIf I support the Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove on Kickstarter, is Doug Sahm guaranteed a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee? By supporting us on Kickstarter, you're helping share Doug Sahm and his music with the world through our documentary. A nomination into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is not guaranteed, but the inevitable buzz surrounding Doug through this successful Kickstarter campaign is what's needed to get the Hall of Fame focused on Doug Sahm as a nominee. If we can raise $75K from Doug Sahm's fans wanting to help release our documentary into the world, we'll be able to show the Hall of Fame how many people support Doug Sahm and his musical legacy.\nWait a minute, aren't you a film? What does your film have to do with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? Though our film isn't about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the mission of Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove is to raise awareness of Doug Sahm and share his music with the world. What better way to use the film than as a vehicle to rightfully induct Doug Sahm into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\nWhere does the $75K go? Filmmaking is an expensive art form. Though we have completed Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove, in order to distribute the film and share it with the world, we must license over the 40 tracks played in our film. $75K is what we need in order to license these songs. Without these tracks, our documentary wouldn't honor Doug Sahm in the same way, and we believe all the world deserves to hear and celebrate these quintessential Doug tracks.\nHow will $75K help get Doug Sahm into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? If we can pay for music licensing and distribute the film around the world, more folks will join in the campaign to induct Doug Sahm into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Now, more than ever, people are turning to movies to learn their history. In this case, this film will tell the story of Doug Sahm and his musical genius, shedding light on so much that is our culture. We believe the number of fans supporting Doug Sahm via our Kickstarter will influence the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they look for their next round of inductees. \nHow does Kickstarter work? Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraiser. We have only 30 days to raise $75K or we don't receive any money at all. It's a risk, but we know that with the help of the community--of Doug Sahm lovers like you--we can do this. It's a big goal, and we can't do this on our own, but we believe Doug Sahm's fans are willing to go the extra mile to celebrate the king of Texas music. Credit cards are charged at the end of a successful campaign. Should our Kickstarter not reach its goal (and we have NO reason to believe it won't be successful), your credit card will not be charged.\nIs this a trick? Nope. This is no trick. The Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove filmmakers want nothing more than to get our film out into the world, raise awareness of Doug Sahm, and see him earn his rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. We believe that with your help, we can do this!\n\"La M\u00fasica de San Anto\" mural\nThe Official Sir Doug & The Genuine Texas Cosmic Groove T-Shirt \n$100 gets you this baby!\n \nUpdated every 24 hours.

Despite the efforts of one of the industry\u2019s top agents, the best offer we received was in the low five figures from a third-tier network. The offer also would have restricted digital distribution, and most important, it would not have covered the $80,000 in remaining costs to license the music, archival footage, and deliver the completed, cleared movie. From the outset, those costs have been the highest hurdle. They total nearly $250,000, or roughly half the production budget. Which now leaves us at Plan B. The Austin Film Society has helped us secure a digital release through Sundance Selects. This will ensure the film\u2019s presence on iTunes, Amazon, and a variety of streaming services. The world will now be able to see Doug\u2019s story. But we still need to raise $80,000. If you\u2019re moved to help us close this gap, we\u2019re deeply appreciative. But we\u2019re also deeply appreciative of the support and advocacy you\u2019ve provided to date. We will release the film as soon as the expense is covered.

There are only a handful of restaurants in N. America that makes this dish (we didn't know that until we started making it LOL)\nI'll keep the beginning of this simple.  We've accomplished a lot, made a LOT of mistakes in 5.5 years and moved three times (you can find us HERE right now) to get us to where we are today as a still existing+relevant Asian Fusion restaurant in the super competitive market of Los Angeles.  We've also proven our staying power statistically BEATING the most common restaurant closing statistic three times over, namely:\nMost restaurants close within the first year...\n(first move = 2.5 years; second move = 1 year; third move = 1.5 years ^_^)\nThe Current Din-Dins (aka DINNER) Menu\nWe've found a new passion in life; made a TON of new friends and found that we have a talent for giving a crazy experience serving incredible Asian food that many people haven't had before OR haven't had in a long time... and that last reason alone is ENOUGH for us to strive to make this thing (Starry Kitchen) happen.\nBUT I think a brief history of Starry Kitchen is in order so that YOU, our potential new fan/customer/donor and most importantly FRIEND (more friends are NEVER a bad thing) can understand WHY this is so important to us and WHY we're doing it (it's a pretty good story at the very least ^_^).\nHumbler + Unknown Beginnings (aka from our apartment!)\nSTARRY KITCHEN RECAP:\nAfter the financial collapse of \u201908 everyone was scrambling and we were no different.  My wife had been laid off from her job in the Advertising industry, I was working as an independent producer/film sales agent in Hollywood scrambling to make a buck and both of us looking for a new way to survive.  That\u2019s when my (super talented) wife started cooking and posting her exotic creations onto to Facebook.  All of our friends were super impressed by her talent and were begging for us to open a restaurant, and that is what we did... with a non-so-traditional beginning.\nEggyolk p0rn: (from the pop-up) Vietnamese Minced Beef-tacular w/ Fried-egg-liciousness\nMy wife, our Kitchen Ninja at an event called Test Kitchen\nMay of 2009 my wife/partner/best friend/executive chef/Kitchen Ninja and I started an Illegal+Underground restaurant out of the back of our apartment that we called... STARRY KITCHEN!  And it took off WAY faster than we had anticipated eventually making our apartment the #1 Asian Fusion restaurant listing in ALL of Los Angeles (our apartment!?!)  \nPeople crammed into our apartment during the last days of the Illegal+Underground V.2 (the \"Black Ops\" days)\nWe got too BIG: people, Yelpers and eventually the press finding out about our story leading to us being found and shut down by the health department.  But I didn't care and ran it for another 3 months \"black ops\"-style while we were coincidentally already in the process of finally moving into a real+permitted \"brick+mortar\" spot.\nGet your mind outta the gutter, we're talking about our Crispy Tofu Balls OF COURSE!\nFebruary of 2010 marked the LEGITIMATE launch of Starry Kitchen in a legit brick+mortar space that we took over from friends, and that eventually went viral for us to crowds and busines we could only dreamt of.  Only problem, we didn't know how to really run a restaurant correctly, and neither did the people we took over the space from which led to just as many mistakes as our successes.  We had to learn on our own at a VERY fast rate.  \nTeam SK + our French Chef friend Laurent Quenioiux in front of our first+formerly \"REAL\" brick+mortar lunch restaurant\nThe Go BIG, or GO HOME MOMENT!\nAfter 5.5 years, those personal mistakes eventually led to having to sell our space, becoming a pop-up, moving two more times, fending for ourselves to keeping our employees and customers with us, finally landing in Chinatown as part of this amazing revitalization that's happening as we speak AND keeping Starry Kitchen ALIVE!\nWhat success we HAVE had has all come from us NOT playing by the rules.  Whenever we play by \"the rules\" we've always failed, but every time we break them and make our own rules: us, our staff and ultimately our customers ALL win.  Not everyone will understand that, and that's OK because we're happy to help lead EVERYONE to greener and tastier (Asian) pastures on this journey for all that support us and not alike.\nFRESH Noodle Garlic Noodles (aka \"the make-out noodles\") made w/ rendered chicken fat and clarified Irish brown butter... because we CAN! :)\nSo it's time to get back to having a REAL brick-and-mortar again, BUT do it right, go BIG and have a place that truly feels like STARRY KITCHEN the moment you walk in... or GO HOME.  No half-assing it.  We don't like it, customers don't like it, the staff doesn't like it.. no one likes it, so we're not going to do it UNLESS we can do it right.\nWe want to stay in Chinatown and continue to be part of the community of #theNewKidsofChinatown, apply all the success we've been lucky to experience and MOST importantly the lessons of failure as well as we forge on to be crazier and tastier than we can ever imagine possible.\nI CAN be serious+I know how to operate a restaurant sometimes TOO\nWHERE ARE YOU GOING+DO YOU HAVE A PLACE?\nYup and YUP! We're staying in... CHINATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWN and have a place two blocks from our current pop-up so we can stick around the neighborhood we love!\n\nCUT TO THE CHASE: \"THIS STORY IS GREAT, BUT YOU SOUND CRAZY AND HOW IS IT REALLY $500K?!?\":\nThe simple answer: I may sound crazy, but there is no room to \"break the rules\" when it comes to the COST of opening a full fledged restaurant.\nShort anecdote: our friend that opens Chipotle-style \"counter-service\"/fast-casual restaurants (no bar or anything special) spends an average of $600,000+ building out his restaurants. \nIn our 4.5 years of experience being \"legit\" we found this to be true too often: saving money (in the wrong places) can easily cost MUCH more money in the long run.  \nExpensive mistakes affects not only the bank account, but also the staff and customer experience.  And when the customer experience suffers, the business can't make the money to pay for those mistakes anymore.\nThis # below is THE cost of building and operating in an existing restaurant (and can get much higher) with the look+feel we're aiming for.  These estimates were built together with a small and very experienced team (all three of us combined equal ~35+ years of experience) that includes:\nour designer, Kellie Patry, who's been the lead designer on projects big and small including hotels, bars, restaurants and even coffee shops\nChris McIntosh, former Director of Operations for the the LA burger chain, Umami Burger. Specifically oversaw the budgets, build outs and full opening+execution of many of their locations, and also built and successfully sold his own restaurant recently as well\nInside our current pop-up at Grand Star Jazz Club\nThis estimate is based on getting a ~2000 square foot (sq ft) space (80+ seats with a small bar).\nRather than debate about why an industrial workhorse food processor (Robot Coupe) is $900 vs a $50 home one, let's jump into the major line items that sets this in reality:\n$25k - Kickstarter's cost (5%)\n$25k - Amazon payments (5%, Kickstarter's credit card processing partner to process your pledges)\nAfter Kickstarter+Amazon, we only have $450k in actual funds to work with:\n\n$175,000 - Current Market Rate Construction on a 2000 sq ft space (full kitchen, dining room, bar remodel)\n$50k - Furniture (mid-level quality: chairs, tables, bar tables, stools including extras for larger parties and general replenishment)\n$25k - Food Service Equipment (plates, glassware, stemware and silverware to start with)\n$20k - Beer and Wine License (license and price of consultant to jump through city hoops)\n$15k - Floor Repair (city approved repairs and fixes before opening)\n$15k - Plumbing Repair (city approved repairs and fixes before opening)\n$10k - Opening food inventory (gotta get the food to make and sell ^_^)\n$7k - Restroom repair (city approved repairs and fixes before opening)\nThese are the major items that budget is made up of.  Some #'s are more flexible than others, but we have to be responsible and account for delays, going over-budget, and the unexpected.  \nThis also doesn't include:\n$50k - ~1+ month Operating Budget (staff payroll not including management for a 6 day a week lunch and dinner restaurant when NOT overstaffed)\nSecurity deposit on a lease, maintenance contracts, daily wear-and-tear repairs, daily linens and uniforms, accounting, advertising/marketing\nwhatever is left: to pay back those that helped us from the beginning\nCONCLUSION: MAYBE we're not so crazy after all and it DOES add up! :)\nSO who's READY to join us on this tasty journey.. HUZZAH!\n\"IS THERE A PLAN B?\"\nNOPE, this IS the plan and our LAST STAND. This is not the \"Go Big or Go to Plan B Moment!\"  We're going to give it our ALL and we're putting all our eggs in THIS basket.

Both are equally challenging, but somehow I've survived in both.\n\nThe main issue with owning a restaurant is, we're at the whims of diners, their appetites and even proximity. People cannot be forced to try us, our food or any restaurant in Los Angeles until they're ready AND is convenient to them because the reputation about Los Angeles traffic: it's true! What could normally take 30 minutes without traffic can become 1 hour and 30 minutes. Bottom line, they must want to, whether it be from previous experience, word of mouth, Yelp or literally just being on our front door step with the option of being hungry or not.\n\n\"We're in the business of being CONSISTENT\": consistent timing, consistent taste, consistent attitude, consistent feel, consistent response and consistent communication amongst the staff\"\n\nThe primary issue for Starry Kitchen IS being fully capitalized, including to be able to pay our staff consistently and on time who have been loyal to Starry Kitchen since day one! Another issue for us is to be able to weather storms that come with launching a unique, kicka$$ Asian restaurant in Los Angeles. In addition to ensuring CONSISTENCY whether the restaurant only has one table w/ people, or is completely packed. As a restaurant, we only have one chance to make a first impression, and once a customer decides to walk in through our doors- as brazen as I may come off, we recognize it is OUR business to lose (or win) and when we can't service people consistently, or consistently impress them giving them a reason to come back because we're trying to save a buck or two, or because we I can't financially justify employing people during a slow period; THAT'S how we LOSE business, which at this point is something my wife and I are unwilling to sacrifice. We want to do it right, make the right decisions for us and our customers, and grow the business so people will want to come back, bring their friends, families, loved ones and grow with us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Nguyen Tran\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nI'm ultimately a story teller (at least my mom thinks so... \"thanks mom\") so here goes: LIFE: I'm a proud Vietnamese-American (HECK YEAH...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Ok, I lied... more recipes to come much sooner.

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.coolest.com/countdown!\nA 21st Century Cooler? It's about time!\nRegular coolers are boring, break easily and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the ice. The COOLEST cooler is 60 quarts of AWESOME packed with so much fun you'll look for excuses to get outside more often.\nMaybe you want to use the built-in ice crushing blender to whip up some margaritas or smoothies on your next boat trip or tailgate?\nMaybe you just want to always have music on hand with the waterproof bluetooth speaker or want to recharge your electronics with the built in USB charger?\nWhat else?\nREWARDS:\nUPDATE:  Color Voting Complete! \nHere are the Final Coolest Color options. When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

The Classic spoon is legit.\" - Erick Castro, Polite Provisions, San Diego\nStandard Spoon - SPIN\nWe\u2019re on Kickstarter to introduce a new style of bar spoon, designed to spin freely in a mixing glass with ice.  For bartenders, the Standard Spoon improves efficiency, requires the same or less hand and wrist motion, improves consistency of dilution (especially when stirring two drinks at once), and decreases the concentration required in a high volume setting. \nFor those of you who love making craft cocktails at home but don\u2019t have the hours of experience a professional does, this bar spoon is the easiest way to stir a drink. Here's a photo of our current prototype.  Be sure to check out the two videos under Design Process that give an in-depth look at the prototypes and demonstrate how easy it is to use this bar spoon.\nStandard Spoon Spin Prototype\nStandard CLASSIC\nWe also appreciate traditionally styled bar spoons, and know there are some weaknesses with those currently on the market. We designed the Standard Classic for simplicity, elegance, and durability. The slim profile of the Standard Classic displaces less ice in a full glass, and is easy to insert around the ice, unlike some cumbersome models with over-sized bowls and awkward angles. The smooth body is great for near-friction-less stirring, and perfect for left-handed cocktail bartenders too! The weighted end provides for a beautifully balanced bar spoon, something that feels like a tool, not a toy. Here's a photo of our current prototype:\nStandard Classic Prototype\nThe Classic spoon is also great for a lot of non-cocktail purposes; think of iced tea and lemonade, coffee drinks and french presses, or stirring anything with style and class. We wrote up a great TOP TEN list over at our blog - check it out!\nQuality, Guaranteed\nWe love well-crafted goods. Unfortunately, most products you find these days are subject to a manufacturing strategy called planned obsolescence; they are designed to fall apart, so you'll buy them again and again. We set out to design a brand of bar spoons that do the exact opposite. They will be so well made that we've got a no-questions-asked replacement policy. When you own one of these spoons, you should never have to buy another bar spoon again.\nStandard Spoon T-Shirt\nHigh-quality t-shirts screen printed right here in San Diego, available through Kickstarter for a great price of $15.  Retail price will be higher, so get this swag while you can! Cotton & polyester blend make up this extremely comfortable shirt.\nFRONT (SS Logo) and BACK (Standard Spoon - San Diego)\nShirts will be available in sizes Small - XXL, and you can specify your size once the campaign ends and we send out a backer survey.\nTo add a t-shirt on to any other reward level, just add $15.00 to your pledge amount.  Kickstarter only allows you to select one reward level, so if you have pledged for either spoon or the set, make sure you only change the green numbers under \"pledge amount,\" and that you do not change your \"reward selection.\"  We'll make sure to confirm what the extra funds are for once the campaign is over.\nWho We Are  \nWe are Shawn Michael and Rachel Eva, a creative team also known as Work of My Hands. We are artists and designers, and love quality made goods. We successfully funded our first Kickstarter Campaign in 2012 to launch a new collection of sculptural lighting. Here's what we bring to this project:  \nShawn Michael has the mind of an engineer. He's behind the beautiful prototypes, the spoon design, and smooth functionality. He's extremely innovative, a skilled craftsman, our webmaster, and also did all the photography. He doesn't like to do something unless he can do it well. He's also our resident humorist (can you tell from his video below?) \nRachel Eva is the project manager. She works in the field of Risk Management, so rest assured nearly every possible risk has been analyzed and mitigated. She handles manufacturing correspondence, analysis, and information management. She's also a writer and the one in charge of communications, blog posts, and updates.\nRachel Eva and Shawn Michael\nYou can find more project information, photos, videos, updates and thoughtful writing about what we're doing on the Standard Spoon website & blog.\nDesign Process\nAs you can see, we've been through many prototypes! We started in our workshop with the ubiquitous red-tipped bar spoon and some steel pipe.\nPrototypes in the Workshop\nOur final, functional prototypes are the result of precision machining, silver soldering, and lots of hand polishing, and look very similar to what we'll be producing if we're funded.  These prototypes are high quality products in and of themselves, and perform beautifully.  Silver soldering is a strong and aesthetically pleasing way to join metal parts, and this is how the spoon bowl is joined to the handle in our prototypes.  Unfortunately, it also requires a great deal of time and precision, and is not a process suited to large scale production. \nMost commercially manufactured bar spoons with a smooth handle (not twisted) use welding as the method to join the spoon bowl to the handle. Unfortunately, the weld fails and the spoon comes apart. Since silver soldering is not an option for larger quantities, and since welding is a weak alternative, we're pursuing a cast method for a seamless design to eliminate this weak point in our final spoons.\nUp Close & Personal with the Prototypes This demo video takes an in-depth look at each prototype, and clearly explains what will be different with the final manufactured spoons. \nThe final version of the Standard CLASSIC will be cast as one piece of solid stainless steel.\nStandard Classic - Diagram of Final Design\nThe final version of the Standard Spoon - SPIN will have two parts: the spoon, and the handle on the spoon that spins freely.\nStandard Spoon Spin - Diagram of Final Design\nBoth spoons will also be polished for a fine finish, and feature the Standard Spoon logo, shown here on a prototype:\nStandard Spoon Branding\nHow to Stir a Cocktail with these spoons This demo video explains the correct use of a classically styled bar spoon, and why the Standard Spoon is so darn easy to use. \nManufacturing Plan\nWe've had hours and hours worth of conversations with bartenders and bar-ware makers, flatware manufacturers, machine shops, welders, metal smiths, hardware manufacturers, jewelry makers, stainless steel foundries, and engineers.\nKnocking our heads together... again.\nTo achieve as seamless a design as possible, we're casting the spoon from molten stainless steel using a mold.  This is most important for ensuring the bowl of the spoon is made in one piece with the handle. In many bar spoons, the spoon bowl is welded or tacked to the handle, and eventually comes apart. In other spoons, the entire piece is stamped from sheet metal, and the twisted handle serves as much for structural integrity as it does for aesthetic design.\nWe explored in detail half-a-dozen different ways to make these spoons, and decided on a manufacturing method called investment casting. This process is used to make very intricate parts with smooth finishes, and we think the process is pretty incredible.  You will too if you check out this video  (please note we're not associated with this manufacturer, or their music choice, in any way):\nAs part of our research, we've have had manufacturers and engineers perform feasibility studies, probe for improvements and efficiency, validate measurements and engineering, and create 3D files. We have received several excellent quotes from competent manufacturers, and have selected our top candidate.  \nOnce we're funded (with your help), both we and our manufacturer will be assured of the project's success, and we'll move into the final design and manufacturing stage.  The main design task we have left is to translate the precise shape and contour of the spoon bowl into 3D files, including testing to ensure the bowl of the spoon holds about 1/8 oz of liquid.\nOnce we place the order with our manufacturer and pay for the tooling costs, they will produce the mold and create samples from it for us to approve.  Once approved, the production run starts.\nHelp us make these great new bar spoons by becoming a backer of this Kickstarter project, and being the first to have one for your cocktails!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges when someone is doing something new and different, especially if it involves a physical, tangible product. \n\nIn our experience with manufacturing projects, time delay is the biggest risk we face. This could manifest as unforeseen production delays, communications, or even something that seems as simple as packing and shipping (it's not that simple). This is why we've established delivery deadlines in the Summer of 2014 as a conservative estimate to allow for contingencies.\n\nThe only way to make this spoon affordable is to make it overseas. Our main concerns with this are accurate communication, quality control and freight shipping time. We've addressed each of these issues in advance so they won't become big problems later on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Video Update: New Cocktail Tools & 20% off Spoons for the Holidays", "update_content": "Hey Backers! \nIt's been over a year since we sent out your spoons - how are you liking them?\nA lot has happened since then, so we thought we'd share a little year in review:\nCocktail Events & Press"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "A Mixing Glass and Two Muddlers Walk into a Bar...", "update_content": "Hi Backers & Friends,\nWe hope you all have been enjoying your spoons, stirring up many great cocktails this summer and fall!

Once the Grippit units are complete, shipping turn around times are no more than 7 days.\nCompletion of Kickstarter Campaign:\nEnd of January to Beginning of February\nProduction of Grippit Units:\nEnd of February to Beginning of March\nRelease of Grippit units for Shipping:\nBeginning of March\nFulfillment of Orders:\nEarly to late March\nWhen the units are received, I will pack them up myself and send them via a certified carrier. Obviously if there are any delays or mishaps, I will personally inform everyone who has pledged of the new timeline. Any questions about where their Grippit is will be answered promptly, and with full disclosure. If your unit is somehow damaged or lost during the shipping process, I am more than happy to replace it, free of charge.\nThank you for being a part of my dream!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce the funds are raised, the next challenge is to take the Grippit into larger markets.

The challenge will be marketing the product to make everyone aware that the Grippit is now a reality!\n\nThrough Kickstarter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and various print mediums, I will strive to give the Grippit a presence in the marketplace so that our energies, funds, and dedication are not misplaced!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Shipping International", "update_content": "Greetings to everyone!\n   Thank you all very much for your continued patience and support of the Grippit!\nI have finished national shipping, and am on to international.

I started the film in 1996 when I looked like this: (17 years younger and 30 lbs lighter. That's me on the left!)\nDenny and his father, Tommy at first day of shooting in 1996\n This is a documentary film about an elite group of studio session musicians in Los Angeles in the 1960\u2019s who played on hits for the Beach Boys, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra, Sonny and Cher, Jan & Dean, The Monkees, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, Mamas and Papas, 5th Dimension, Tijuana Brass, Ricky Nelson, Elvis Presley, Johnny Rivers and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and that\u2019s just a few! The amount of work in which they were involved was tremendous.  These musicians have since become known as \"The Wrecking Crew\".\nTop: members of the Wrecking Crew recording with Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios. Left: Tommy Tedesco. Right: Joe Osborn. Bottom: Hal Blaine\nFrom \"Be My Baby\" to \"California Girls;\" \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"Mrs. Robinson;\" \"You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin'\" and \"Up, Up and Away;\"\"Viva Las Vegas\" to \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" the group dubbed \"The Wrecking Crew\" played on all of them.\nFor six years in a row, the Grammy Award for \"Record of the Year\" was recorded by Wrecking Crew members.  Just look at this list!\nHerb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass in 1966 for \"A Taste of Honey\"\nFrank Sinatra in 1967 for \"Strangers in the Night\"\nThe 5th Dimension in 1968 for \"Up, Up and Away\"\nSimon & Garfunkel in 1969 for \"Mrs. Robinson\"\nThe 5th Dimension in 1970 for \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" and\nSimon & Garfunkel in 1971 for \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\"\nPhoto: Beverly Hills screening, honoring Hal Blaine for 7 Grammy wins. Left to right- Denny Tedesco, Lou Adler, Jerry Moss, Hal Blaine, Herb Alpert.\nIn 1996 my father, the guitarist Tommy Tedesco, was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  I knew we didn\u2019t have much time with him so I started filming his story and that of the other session musicians of the 1960\u2019s & 70\u2019s.\nUnfortunately, my Dad passed away in 1997 without seeing a frame of the film, but I continued to film his friends and the artists of the day. The film includes wonderful interviews with Brian Wilson, Cher, Nancy Sinatra, Herb Alpert, Glen Campbell, Roger McGuinn, Gary Lewis, Dick Clark, Al Jardine, Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, and Leon Russell and others.\nWhy do I need Kickstarter?\nThe story of these musicians cannot be told without the music. There\u2019s a lot of it and music costs money.\nI was told from the beginning, \u201cYou won\u2019t get the labels and publishers to agree on favorable licensing fees.\"  Well, you know what? I proved everybody wrong.  I didn\u2019t give up. The record companies and publishers have been incredibly supportive and have agreed to extremely favorable terms. However, there are over 120 music cues in the film and that adds up to  a  huge amount of money, so I kept trying to raise the money to pay for the licensing while continuing to film interviews.\nBy 2006, I had been shooting interviews for 10 years!  My wife/producer Suzie was concerned we possibly had made the most expensive home movie ever, but I compare it to building your dream home.  You have all the lumber, the best appliances, the best fixtures and an amazing view, yet until you build it, you don\u2019t have a home.\nSo, we brought in the talented Editor/Producer, Claire Scanlon (who, by the way, won an Emmy this year for her outstanding work on \u201cThe Office\").\nClaire and I worked together to finish the film and we were finally able to enter it into the film festival circuit in 2008.  Our first screening in front of real people to whom we weren\u2019t related was at SXSW and it was an amazing experience. The film went on to play in over 50 festivals and win a dozen awards. The reviews were outstanding.\nHowever, the film still had a huge price tag for music licensing and was not picked up for distribution due to that high cost. It was a pretty bad year for everyone being that 2008 was the beginning of the recession. So, I kept on trying to raise the money to pay the licensing myself.\nIn 2010, I realized the only way to get this film released was through donations. The International Documentary Association (IDA) became our fiscal sponsor. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve raised nearly $300K in donations to pay off labels, publishers and some of the stock footage, but we still need to pay a fee directly to the musicians through the AFM (American Federation of Musicians). This is called a re-use fee and is one bill I can\u2019t wait to pay. I\u2019m happy to be able to pay the musicians for the memories they gave us.  These musicians are the reason I have stayed with this project for over 17 years. I want to finally give credit where credit is due.\nThe money raised on Kickstarter will not only pay for the AFM costs, but also the last few song licenses, some stock footage licensing, an online edit (so I can add new footage) and the final mix.\nIt\u2019s been a long road with many ups and downs. I\u2019ve had such a huge amount of support from the musicians, artists and fans. I want to tell their story to the world.  It\u2019s a story that needs to be told. As Nancy Sinatra says, \u201cThe musicians really are the unsung heroes of all these hit records,\u201d and it\u2019s time for the world to know who they are.\nPlease, help me tell their story so music fans everywhere will know the truth behind the music. This film is not just for musicians.  It\u2019s truly the soundtrack of your life. You\u2019ll never hear these songs the same way again.\nI have financed the film myself over the last 17 years by refinancing my house and maxing out my credit cards.  And now, I\u2019m tapped out. My family has supported me in this endeavor, but we\u2019ve gone as far as we can, so now we\u2019re reaching out to Kickstarter for the finishing funds we need in order to get this film released to the world.\nOur Goal:\nThe $250,000 we raise in this Kickstarter campaign will be used to pay the last licensing bills for the music and musicians. Once all the licensing is completely paid off, I will be able to sign a deal with a distribution company.  My hope is to get a small limited run in theaters, but mainly this film will be available as a VOD, digital download and DVD. If in the unlikely event a distributor doesn\u2019t pick up this film, I will literally drive around the country myself and sell it out of the trunk of my car, but I really hope that won\u2019t be necessary!\nPlease, check out the rewards we have to offer. Other than the film itself, there are T-shirts, bowling shirts, caps and Dickie jackets with the Wrecking Crew logo. We also have coffee mugs, bumper stickers and posters as well as signed memorabilia from Nancy Sinatra, Don Randi, Joe Osborn and Hal Blaine.\nI thank you for your support.\nSong Dedication On DVD Chapter:  We have listed songs that the Wrecking Crew worked on over the years.

Leitham as a duet album.  The other songs on the album include: \"Bags Groove\", \"Four\", \"Loverman\", \"Milestones\", \"Song is For You\", \"Walking and Talking\".

This project is about commissioning music, but it's also about making sure it gets heard by you and anyone else who loves hearing something new and great.  Our promise is that this new work and any that come from our STAGE II SEED FUND will be shared on our SoundCloud page. \nStage 1 is a new work of music by California composer Byron Adams for Cantus. We expect to premiere the 5-7 minute long work this spring, bring it with us on tour in the coming years and make it available for anyone to hear on our SoundCloud page. \nStage II (with the Adams commission funded...THANK YOU by the way) is a seed fund for future commissions. As a nonprofit we have the ability to sock away any extra funding into a restricted account to be used only for commissioning new music. There is nothing quite as exhilarating as having new music to sing. With your help, we will be adding new works to the repertoire in the years to come.\nWhy this project is important to Cantus\nSinging music fresh off the page is so important to us. Cantus believes in commissioning new music because it keeps our work relevant. We love music from almost any century (the 15th wasn't great) but composers who are writing now are sharing thoughts and ideas that we are all thinking. \nWe travel all over and our music is heard on public radio. We also use SoundCloud to share. (We remember how important that is from Kindergarten.)\nHere's our recording of \"An Irish Airman foresees His Death,\" performed live last fall.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThis is our first Kickstarter project but we think it\u2019s a good fit for Cantus. Not only will the new work by Byron be toured by Cantus to audiences in the thousands, but we\u2019ll make it available for streaming on our SoundCloud site. And for any works created through our Stage II Seed Fund, we'll share them on SoundCloud too. There are a cappella ensembles starting up all over the country who are interested in new music and who often ask us for suggestions. So, your funds will help new music happen, but you can be pretty sure it will have a long life as well. \nWho are we?\nKnown around the world for our adventurous programming and gorgeous blend, Cantus is a professional male vocal ensemble based in Minneapolis.   We are different than many vocal ensembles or choirs in that we rehearse and perform without a conductor or music director. We are also full-time employees of our organization, (with salaries and health insurance!). The Washington Post said our sound has both \u201cexalting finesse\u201d and \u201cexpressive power\u201d and refers to our music-making as \u201cspontaneous grace.\u201d (Thanks, WP!) We perform for audiences across the country and at home in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Each year we share our own love of singing with thousands of students through workshops and master classes. We hold semi-monthly open rehearsals in Minneapolis and would love to see you there any time. \nWho is Byron Adams?\nByron Adams has earned a Bachelor of Music degree, magna cum laude, from Jacksonville University, studying piano with Mary Lou Wesley Krosnick and composition with Gurney Kennedy. He received a Master of Music degree from the University of Southern California, where his teachers included Halsey Stevens, Robert Linn and Morten Lauridsen. He received his doctoral degree from Cornell University, studying composition with Karel Husa and musicology with William W. Austin. \nByron says that he has loved the music of Czechoslovakia since he was a boy. He tells us:  \"My beloved teacher at Cornell University, Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Karel Husa, grew up in Prague, and from him I learned an enormous amount about Czech music as well as the \"soul\" behind that music. I also played music by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k as a pianist, especially the G minor Piano Trio. Indeed, my Serenade for Nine Instruments, composed in 2011 as a 90th birthday gift for Professor Husa, alludes to Czech folk music in the first two movements, and the second movement is an homage to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Professor Husa -- I quote a theme that they both used, \"Ye Warriors of God,\" which was the hymn of the Hussites who fought for religious freedom in the 15th century.\" \nWhat will the money be used for?\nThe money from our goal is used for Byron\u2019s fee as a composer with some additional funds going to his travel expenses. \nStage II Seed Fund will be put into a restricted fund (that's nonprofit lingo) that can only be used for other new works. \n8.29.13 New video!\nWe're just a week into our project campaign and getting such a great response from you.

Despite craft cocktail and farm-to-table trends that have swept the country, many women across the United States don\u2019t know their backside from a bourbon, scotch or rum, and are notorious for giving bartenders ill-informed drink criteria (\u201csomething fruity and not too strong, please\u201d).\nIn Booze for Babes, I work to blow the lid off of the women-don\u2019t-know-Jack Daniels-about-liquor stereotype by empowering lady tipplers how to drink better in a fun but non-pandering way while also celebrating lady bartenders, distillers and spirits experts. Lynnette Marrero, the co-founder of Speed Rack, a ladies-only bartending competition, and the NYC chapter of Ladies United for the Preservation of Endangered Cocktails (LUPEC), has written the foreword. There are also interviews with Dushan Zaric, owner of New York City bars Employees Only and Macau Trading Company, Marcia Simmons, author of DIY Cocktails, Julie Reiner of the Clover Club and Flatiron Lounge in New York City, Dave Stolte, author of Home Bar Basics (and Not So Basics), Adam Seger, a Chicago-based bartender extraordinaire and creator of hum, plus female entrepreneurs and distillers like Rachel Barrie of Bowmore-Morrison, Allison Patel of Brenne Whisky, Hollis Bulleit of Bulleit Bourbon, Allison Evanow of Square One Organics and Julie Reiner of the Clover Club and Flatiron Lounge.\nIn short, as I say in my video, I want women to belly up to the bar and own it. I want women to demand the best in their glasses. I also want servers to stop assuming that my husband is the one who ordered the Willett Pot Still Reserve, and that I ordered the ale. Enough already! \nTHE BACKSTORY\nThe book came about because I used to be the sort of girl who generally knew what I wanted in life but managed to lose my way at a bar. That is until a trip to the heart of bourbon country opened me up to the wide world of fine spirits. I came back more educated about booze, even preferring to #drinkitneat, and garnered newfound respect at the bar (just before my 'enlightenment,' I recall drinking Creamsicles - a pitiful concoction of whipped cream vodka and OJ). Realizing I was not alone, I wrote a feature for Bust magazine about women and whiskey, considered the \"manliest\" of spirits, which became the thesis for this book, which is now completely finished and has been professionally edited, designed, illustrated and indexed, with printing being the last step.\nThis is not just another recipe book. Readers can expect to learn:\nWhy every lady should know her liquor\nA short history of ladies\u2019 on-again, off-again relationship with the hard stuff\nHow to choose a quality gin, whiskey, rum, tequila, brandy, vodka or liqueur, and look like a badass doing it\nHow to appreciate a spirit neat \nHow to tell a marketing ploy on a label from the real deal\nHow to train your palate and hone your taste\nHow to mix business and booze\nHow to build a well-equipped home bar\nHow to entertain with spirits in a way that honors old-fashioned traditions and impresses guests\nHow to set up tastings for various spirit categories\nDozens of recipes for cocktails, bitters, vermouth, liqueurs, and more\nFor a comprehensive Table of Contents, please click here.\nFor a sample chapter, Why Every Lady Should Know Her Liquor, please click here.\nThe book will be available in paperback, as well as on Kindle, Nook, iBookstore, SmashWords, Kobo and Copia. It is 8.5 x 5.5 inches, approximately 319 pages. The print version has a four-color cover, and is black and white on the inside. \nTHE TEAM\nBooze for Babes was professionally edited by Lisa Butterworth, a senior editor for Bust magazine, designed by Lan Truong, also of Bust, and illustrated by Rebecca Pry, a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design whose work has appeared in the New Yorker. I am a professional journalist by trade whose work has appeared in outlets like Private Clubs, Travel & Leisure, Travel Channel, Fox Business Network, The Daily Meal, The Latin Kitchen, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, AARP The Magazine, Wine & Spirits, and more.\nTHE ROLLOUT\nMy blog [www.boozeforbabes.com], which collects orders and serves as an educational resource, was professionally designed and built. I am also working with several celebrity chef-owned restaurants in Washington, D.C. on educational events and tastings for the public this fall and winter. Several spirits brands whose marketing aligns with my mission have expressed interest in partnering to promote the project as well.\nThe book will be distributed to specialty stores and select indie bookstores, as well as major book retailers via a distributor called Atlas Books, which will begin marketing the title in September once I meet the Kickstarter goal, which will pay for the first print run and some miscellaneous remaining design and indexing costs.\nI'm totally stoked about this project and hope you'll back me.

Though people were initially skeptical, the drinks won them over, and the three of us -- myself, beer blogger Ezra Johnson-Greenough, and bar owner Yetta Vorobik -- have gone on to put on beer cocktail events from Vancouver, Canada to New Orleans, Louisiana. In the time since our first \"Brewing Up Cocktails\" event, I've noticed beer cocktails appearing increasingly often on menus in the some of the best bars around the country.\nHaving imbibed, researched, and created numerous beer cocktails over the years, the time is right to create the definitive book on the subject. Cocktails on Tap will feature approximately fifty recipes, culled from historic documents, my own menus, and contributions from talented bartenders all over the world.\nBeer and Loathing\nThough beer may seem like an unusual cocktail ingredient, mixing with beer is a centuries old practice. Wassail, the festive, warming winter drink, is an old-time mixture of ale, wine, spirits, sugar, and spices. Early recipes for the flip called for beer and rum. Charles Dickens records a character enjoying a few too many pints of Dog's Nose, a combination of porter, brown sugar, and gin, in his serial novel The Pickwick Papers. In the Basque region, imbibers enhance plain lagers with Amer, while in Mexico they use hot sauce, citrus, and savory flavors in the Michelada. With Cocktails on Tap in hand, readers will be able to recreate these and other vintage recipes.\nBeer has become a favorite ingredient for bartenders and Cocktails on Tap features the best of these of contemporary creations too. Drinks like the Mai Ta-IPA and Hopped Up Nui Nui put hoppy twists on a classic tiki cocktails with the addition of India Pale Ale. The Green Devil boosts the powerful Belgian beer Duvel with juniper-forward London Dry gin and a rinse of aromatic absinthe. The Averna Stout Flip is one of many rich and creamy beer cocktails perfect for a winter night.\nZelda\nThe recipes in Cocktails on Tap demonstrate why beer is a versatile and delicious ingredient. Different styles of beer stimulate our basic senses of taste. Dark roasted malts and aggressive hops add bitter notes to a drink; sour ales like lambic and Berliner Weisse provide tartness; fruit ales and beers with residual sugars bring sweetness to the table. The full spectrum of beer styles finds its way into cocktails, used in ways that range from simply pouring them into the glass to reducing them into flavorful syrups.\nAverna Stout Flip\nWith more than fifty breweries and a vibrant cocktail scene, it's no surprise that this book hails from Portland, Oregon, home to our entire creative team:\nJacob Grier, author, is the lead bartender at Metrovino and a consultant for several spirits brands. His first recipe guide, The Cocktail Collective, was published in 2010. He writes the long-running weblog Liquidity Preference, now in its tenth year, and has written for The Atlantic, Reason, The Oregonian, and other publications. His Portland Rickey -- made with saison ale, gin, lemon, and Chartreuse -- has been named the official drink for this year's Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans.\nDavid L. Reamer, photographer, is a food and lifestyle photographer whose images have appeared in Bon Appetit, Food & Wine, and GQ. Born and raised in New Jersey,  David cooked for thirteen years before finally trading his chef's knife for a camera.

He is currently shooting cookbooks for acclaimed Portland chefs John Gorham (Toro Bravo) and Gabe Rucker (Le Pigeon). David lives with his wife, Meredith, their dog and cat, and two chickens.\nMelissa Delzio, designer, is an independent designer, creative adventurer, and publisher of Our Portland Story.

The labels; Bourbon, Rhum, Geni\u00e9vre(Gin) & Agave(Tequila) are engraved into the glass with a high powered laser creating a crisp contrast with digital precision. \nRhum - the Constance\nThrough Kickstarter we are offering this set in two batches, the early bird first run to be shipped in July and the second run to be shipped shortly after in August. In addition we are also offering a custom etched Constance set for a premium with a personal message of your choice on the reverse side of each bottle to commemorate any occasion.  And finally, our Kickstarter exclusive set!  This one time only set of 8 Constance bottles will offer Cognac, Eau de Vie, Whisky(Scotch) & Mezcal in addition to the originals: Bourbon, Geni\u00e9vre, Rhum & Agave.  This set is in very limited supply and only available until June 4th.\nThe second set, named the Variance, consists of four unique but harmonious vessels to lay the foundation of your home bar. Each one of these bottles offers it\u2019s own appeal through both structural form and individual label design. Because these bottles originate from premium spirits and liqueurs their aesthetic offers a great level of distinction but because of their obscurity their availability is limited. The Variance, too, will be manufactured in multiple runs shipping in July, August & October in order to maintain supply.\nThe Variance\nOur bottle inventory is collected with the help of the remarkable bar staffs of local dining establishments and cocktail havens throughout San Francisco. These tireless individuals store away empties one by one slowly accumulating each set for us that we then strip, sanitize and repurpose giving them a new and permanent shelf life in your home bar. \nBourbon - the Variance\nOur goal is to not only catch every last one of these four bottles but to increase the number of bottles consumed.  By mining these bottles out of the waste stream we create an environmental friendly product at a economically sustainable price. \nAgave - the Variance\nWith your help, Reclamation Etchworks will be able to purchase it's own laser machine.

If we exceed our goal we will be able to open a fully functional facility here in San Francisco, employing local talent and boosting our local economy.  Cheers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any new project there is always the possibility for setbacks. We foresee two possible obstacles with Reclamation Etchworks. The first, should we lead a successful Kickstarter campaign and be able to purchase our own laser machine, is that this machine may fail. We've actually seen this happen in our immediate community and understand the frustration that can result. Which is the good news, we have friends that have purchased their own laser machines. This is not only a good support network for when maintenance issues arise, but there is also the opportunity to rent time on their machines. We also have the source in which we have successfully made all of our Constance and Variance bottles this far, TechShopSF. We will continue to have access to their shared laser machines and will inevitably be able to fulfill the orders. Shipping dates may be stretched in this scenario as our work week would be reduced to 12 hrs of etching each week.\n\nOur second concern is coming up short on empty bottles in which to etch our decanters. This is where our other network comes into play- the boozers. We've cast a wide net over the city of San Francisco and it's cocktail slinging aficionados in order to catch as many of the empty bottles that we use as possible. But there is a chance that this may not be enough. If this is the case we may have to extend our reach to neighboring Napa Valley(I hear they do some drinking up there), Oakland & San Jose. This will lengthen our pick up days quite a bit but luckily Northern California is a beautiful place to travel. Frankly, if our business is successful beyond just Kickstarter, we'd like to expand and open up shop in other cities as well. We find it would be more economical and environmentally sustainable to have another workspace in, say Portland, Chicago or New York, than to ship empty bottles from there to SF and then back out to customers. And I'm told they enjoy a nice cocktail from time to time there too. Although these challenges may cause frustration, they will not prevent us from creating our new beloved product.

Now, I'm eager to make my own small-batch, artisanal book. \"Caffeine and You\" is almost ready for editing and final infographics.

My biggest risk is keeping within projected page count; I may need to cut or edit \u2013 a normal challenge I've been through many times (gritting my teeth sometimes but always successful in the end). One other risk with all projects: delayed delivery. Extreme events and acts of god can interfere with production and fulfillment. So can mundane events, like printing hiccups, and not enough time in the day (even with caffeine!). C'est la vie. But if the project's funded, the book *will* be published and delivered. \n\nAND the biggest Kickstarter risk: not enough backers to fund this project.

Remember, There\u2019s no saint without a past and no sinner without a future.\n\u25cf Tupac was a true humanitarian, he truly made a difference in the lives of others around him. You will see this in the movie.\n\u25cf He thought politicians were the biggest gangstas, and he had plans to go into politics, in order to clean it up, later in life.\n\u25cf He was a strong supporter of charities such as A Place Called Home,          a charity that caters to at risk youth.\n\u25cf Pac was full of energy, full of life, and un-relenting. He had an incredible work ethic, as you will see in this film when you see never-before seen home movies of Pac in his natural environment.\n\u25cf Pac wanted to share a candid view of his life with you, which is why he told me to grab my camera and record everything he did for the last few months of his life.\nYou see, many people think they know everything there is to know about Tupac; they know his music, they know he has sold over 75 million albums (and his albums are still selling well today), fans know his work as an actor in movies, and they even know the great documentaries that have been made about him since his demise. But despite all of that, it amazes and saddens me that his fans are still to this day in the dark, about this last days of life.  \nThose 7 days remained a secret\u2026 until now.\nYou can bring Tupac\u2019s story to life today. You, right now, are the most important person to Tupac because you are going create Pac\u2019s unreleased documentary. You may not know me, but I met Pac and worked with him for the last 8 months of his life. He and I became close and Pac agreed to let me film him in those crucial last months. I considered Pac my friend, my brother and my leader. And after Pac was shot in Vegas, I was one of only a handful of people who were with him in the hospital in Las Vegas.\nThe chilling details of Pac\u2019s last 7 days are unknown to most fans. Those 7 days were surreal, infested with FBI informants. Gut-wrenching nights spent with Pac drifting in and out of consciousness. You would be stunned to hear about the vicious death threats sent to Pac in his weakened state, and yet the Vegas Police Department refused to cooperate - the whole experience was nerve-shattering.\nAnd yet what happened during those 7 days has remained a secret, until now. You see, Pac wanted you to see the real him, this is why he hand-picked me to follow him around with my camera and document his life. You and I were robbed of more than just his music when his life was tragically cut short, you were robbed of the story he wanted to tell you. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way\u2026\nYou will be a part of Pac\u2019s story today by joining us in creating the 7 DAYZ documentary. I thank you for your help in the only way I know how, by giving you access to a jackpot of never-before-seen 2Pac photos, audio files, photo books, posters, video and audio that the general public will NEVER see. This is our \u201cthank you\u201d for helping to tell the world about 2Pac\u2019s story. I think you are going to love the home movies Pac made, they reflect on all aspects of his personality, some are fun, others are serious, and above all, they are inspiring.\nNow is your time. You are now a part of history, thank you for helping us to allow the world into Tupac\u2019s inner sanctum. Remember, Tupac\u2019s 7 DAYZ story is more than just the last days in the hospital, you will see never-released footage from Pac\u2019s every-day life, interviews with some of Tupac\u2019s inner circle, many of Pac's friends who have never spoken to anyone before now. This is truly the first opportunity for you to see Pac as he lived through his eyes. I cannot wait for you to see and feel the 7 DAYZ experience.\np.s. Remember, 7 DAYZ is an opportunity for you to tell Tupac\u2019s story to the world, a story that has yet to be told. We want you to see the interviews, photos and video footage in the 7 DAYZ members area DO FOR LOVE, that has never been seen or heard before. Today is your opportunity to get a piece of the 7 DAYZ story. This film is for you, all you have to do is join the 7 DAYZ crew. Also, a portion of all proceeds of this film will go to TASF.ORG, Pac's charity, because that is what Pac would want. \nThank You, and I hope to thank you in person at the 7 DAYZ premiere!\nGobi/Saijo artwork", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery film project has a risk of coming up against production obstacles. The most common problem is not having the resources to complete the film. The beauty of the 7 Dayz project is that I have more than enough never-before-seen footage to complete the movie. Today on YouTube there are several pirated snippets of this footage, and these clips have been viewed by 252,074 Tupac fans and counting. I am excited to share this footage with Tupac fans, and we have more than enough to complete several movies. The majority of the 7 Dayz footage is already shot and simply waiting for editing. There will be some additional interviews, but I have so much raw movie footage for 7 Dayz, there will be no problems coming up with enough footage for the movie.\n\nThe beauty of this project is that the team and all the individuals wanting to be a part of it are eager to see this come to fruition. I personally have being fortunate enough to work in film production for the past 17 years. I have had the pleasure of working with Yoko Ono, Snoop Dogg and Trent Reznor, to name a few.

Bitters distill and impart unique characteristics, flavors and aroma which can be used to create amazing cocktails. Historically, there have been only a handful of prominent bitters that have defined classic cocktails, but in Hawaii, cocktail culture has evolved differently around local flavors and ingredients. Many of these flavors are only readily available on the Islands, yet tropical cocktails are enjoyed around the world. Help launch Hawaii Bitters Company's first bottles of authentic barrel aged bitters to bring flavors like Lilikoi, Chocolate, Kona Coffee, Myer Lemon, Maui Lavender, Tiki and more to craft bars and cocktail enthusiasts everywhere!\nCheck out our coverage on Honolulu Magazine's Biting Commentary!\n100% locally sourced and handcrafted! \nEach bottle of Hawaii Bitters will be handcrafted by Kyle Reutner (an award winning craft bartender and chemist) & Mike Prasad (cocktail enthusiast, blogger and cocktail competition judge) in Honolulu using all locally sourced ingredients. We will actually visit the farms and choose only the best ingredients to include in our bitters. Every part of Hawaii Bitters will start and finish in Hawaii, from the flavor ingredients, the spirit base, bottling even the artwork and handstamped and numbered labels. A 100% authentic product of Hawaii.\nHawaii Bitters will be created to the highest standards with flavors not available anywhere else.\nYou help us choose & unlock up to 7 flavors!\nOur initial goal of $9,500 will allow us to make 3 initial flavors which backers will vote for. HOWEVER, we want to make more! If we raise over $15,000 then we will be able to create 5 flavors and if we raise over $20,000 then we will be able to create 7 flavors! Backers will vote for what flavors we create. Each flavor costs $3,000 to $4,000 to test, fine tune and create, so the more you back, the more flavors we can create for you!\nHelp a backer take the next step.\nHawaii Bitters Company was founded by Mike Prasad & Kyle Reutner. Mike is an avid cocktail enthusiast, co-founder of MXLGY.com, cocktail competition judge, digital strategist behind the viral Kogi BBQ Food Truck and Kickstarter Backer of over 300 projects! This is his first time working on a project of is own. Kyle is half of Imbibe Hawaii, one of the top craft bartenders in Hawaii and has won national competitions. He is also a chemist who understands the science behind creating the best bitters possible. Help us take the next step and launch Hawaii Bitters!\nWhat we need to raise funds for.\nSo far, we've already spent our own money on producing some test batches, buying base spirits, test barrels, on label design, website, and more, but to get each flavor right, we need to refine each flavor. That means for each flavor we want to create, we have to purchase test and production barrels (which can cost up to $500 each), make smaller test batches to create consistent flavor (which includes buying base neutral spirits and ingredients and paying for commercial kitchen time) and then finally producing and bottling the best production batch we can for backers. This adds up quickly per flavor.

He quickly found success as one of the creators of the TV show, Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse, which led to more work designing some of the most arresting and iconic images in pop culture. Most recently, his word paintings, which feature pithy and often sarcastic text statements crafted onto vintage landscape paintings, have made him a darling of the fine art world.\n\nWhether he\u2019s parading a twenty foot tall puppet through the Tennessee hillside, romping around the Hollywood Hills dressed in his LBJ puppet suit, relaxing in his studio pickin\u2019 his banjo, or watching his children grow up much too soon, Wayne White always seems to have a youthful grin and a desperate drive to create art and objects. It is an infectious quality that will inspire everyone to find their pleasure in life and pursue it at all costs.\n\nBut along the way, Wayne had to learn how to balance family and creativity; making a living and making art; playing the game and being himself. All while confronting all the deeply personal questions, fears, and feelings that plague and inspire any person who wakes up every day, driven to create.\n\nThe movie features never before seen footage of the making of Pee-wee's Playhouse, along with new interviews from Matt Groening (The Simpsons), Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo), Paul Reubens, Todd Oldham, Gary Panter, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine), and many more.\n\nThe Story of Beauty Is Embarrassing\n\nYears in the making, Beauty Is Embarrassing was completed in February of 2012 and premiered at the SXSW film festival in March. In Austin the film played four screenings to packed houses and won praise from the likes of Wired, Variety, the Hollywood Reporter, Ain't It Cool News, and others.  An additional screening was added on the last day for being one of the most buzzed about films at the fest. And things have only gotten better. \n\nAfter SXSW, we took the movie to Hot Docs in Toronto and Full Frame in Durham.  The movie won Best Documentary at the Cleveland and Crossroads Film Festivals and the Audience Favorite Award at the Nashville Film Festival (where Wayne himself was presented with...yes...the Governor's Award).  In June we'll be screening at Silverdocs Film Fest and at the Los Angeles Film Festival in the beautiful Bing Theater at (where else?) LACMA.\n\nHere are some of the stellar reviews we've received:\n\nDaily Variety\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\nAint It Cool News\n\nWired Magazine\n\nWhy We Are On Kickstarter?\n\nWe are very excited that Kickstarter gives us the opportunity to self-distribute Beauty Is Embarrassing theatrically.  It is our belief that this is the best way to get the movie out to as many fans as possible and offer them the theater experience that so many have loved. This movie was MADE to be shown to a crowd. We've sat with hundreds - sometimes nearly thousands - of people and felt the energy that comes from a room full of folks gathered to watch Beauty Is Embarrassing. After our screenings, audience members routinely walk up to Wayne with smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes, thanking him for being who he is and doing what he does. And we're convinced that it's the electricity of the theatrical experience that brings out these emotions. Fans are contacting us on a daily basis wanting to know when they can see it in their home town - and we want to bring it to them.\n\nSo we're going to put the movie on our backs and do put it out ourselves. We've assembled an incredibly talented group of filmmakers and film marketers and they're chomping at the bit to get started.  We have a plan but we need your help.  It takes a lot of money to launch a movie into theaters and we feel that Kickstarter provides the perfect opportunity to garner the support we need. Fans of the movie and of Wayne himself understand the message and we know they'll come through for us.\n\nWhen can you see the movie in theaters?\n\nWe are currently scheduling a Fall release beginning in September.  Our Kickstarter program will end on July 4th, and that will give us 3-4 months to book theaters and do the necessary marketing to have a successful run.\n\nWill it play in your hometown?\n\nPossibly!  Right now we are planning a limited release with a short list of major cities in the mix.  The cities we are considering are all over the country so hopefully the movie will just be a short drive from where you live. If you have a theater in mind or you happen to book one, give us a shout. Audiences really do have the power.\n\nHowever, as part of our program we're also offering the special opportunity to host a screening at your local theater.  There are two chances to host the film and the second (slightly more expensive) option includes a visit from Wayne White himself.  We'll send him out with the film and you'll have him for the night.

A restless maverick and sometimes self-destructive genius, he became revered as an actor, director, and artist.  Few people understand the man who brought an almost psychotic intensity to such roles as Easy Rider, Apocalypse Now, Blue Velvet, and other masterpieces.  \nOUR GOAL:  Our goal is to honor and explore exceptional artists like Dennis Hopper in the most visually rich way and informative way as possible.  It has taken 5 years to get to this point on our own dime.  We have a 77-minute film cut, but in order to maintain creative control and keep as many goodies as we have in the film, we have to raise the funds to cover the enormous expense of acquiring licensing rights.  Our initial target of $35,000 is very low.  With your enthusiasm and back up we can increase this amount.\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?  Every Kickstarter project must be fully funded before its time expires or no money changes hands.  If we don't meet our target it will be a very sad day, but your credit card or debit card won't be charged.  If we do meet our targeted amount, the rewards will be shipped out wherever you live in the world. \nHOW CAN I DONATE AND BE A PART OF THE FILM?  Just click the green \"Back This Project\" button in the upper right-hand corner of our page.  Please email us if you have any problems or questions or you just want to communicate at: hopper@warnersisters.com.  Dennis Hopper fans are scattered around the world, please help us to reach as many folks as we can. The more people who participate the better our chances are of sharing this incredibly personal and inspiring story.\nWAYS YOU CAN HELP OUT ARE:  Enjoy promoting this with us. Tell your friends about the project, do things like \"Like\" the project on Facebook: www.facebook.com/DennisHopperInHisOwnWords, Tweet about it, and send along any other bright ideas you might have along this line.\nWHY SHOULD YOU HELP US MAKE THIS MOVIE?  Because you'd love to join with us to create a legacy for this great artist or perhaps you love assisting others make their dreams a reality or it just sounds like FUN.  Plus, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you are a part of sharing a side of Dennis which is rarely seen.\nWHEN WE REACH OUR GOAL, THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR:  5% goes to amazon.com for a business account to run the money through; 5% goes to Kickstarter for providing this opportunity; clearance research; legal fees to find out what can be used under the Fair Use rules;  licensing the rights for the film footage, photos & music we've used; producing a trailer; graphics for the film; sound editing and mixing; color correction; on-line editing and mastering; making DVDs; marketing; and shipping costs for rewards.\nHOW DO I FOLLOW THE PROJECT AND CONTACT US?

We want to bring an updated bar tool to everyone: the home mixologist, the bartender, and the tiki world.\nThe swizzle stick hails from different parts of the world - from Slovakia, used in soups and stews, to the Caribbean, for mixing classic cocktails and made from the swizzle tree.  Today these natural pieces are difficult, if not impossible, to find, so we wanted to make a modern version of this classic tool that everyone could get their hands on and enjoy.\nWe started our design process by identifying key parts of the swizzle stick that were important to its use and performance.  These included how well it swizzles a drink and how you, the mixologist, interact with this tool.  Through research and prototype iterations we finalized a rib patterned handle that gives grip while swizzling and adds to the aesthetic appeal of the piece.  The \"blades\" of the SwizzleStik also went through a few iterations and the simplest design proved to be the best choice for a great-looking, functional bar tool.\ntheSwizzleStik will be made from recyclable material that will stand up to repeated cold temperatures in your drink mixing as well as the high temperatures and cleanser contact in your wash cycles.\nOur blog has more detailed information so feel free to check it out!\nwww.theswizzlestik.com\nWhy We Need You!\nWe are excited to bring this bar tool to everyone and can't wait to use them ourselves.\nWe've done the research, the design, preliminary mold work, initial prototypes, and the planning.  Now we just need your help to get through the next big step: the funding.  \nWe plan on having production steel molds made in order to mold production parts here in the USA.  It is expensive to make full production-ready molds that make quality parts. And even with a mold made there are still minimum order quantities that we must purchase to get this project off the ground.\nAll of this adds up, so we need your support to fund this project into existence.

We are down to 14 days!\nIf you haven't been following the developments, let us catch you up. About ten days ago, we signed a lease for an amazing space in the heart of the Arts District of Los Angeles. The space is everything we dreamed of finding, but we're officially and affectionately calling it our \"hot mess!\" It is a space that time and it's previous tenants forgot. (See our updates for photos) It needs a MINIMUM of 125k in renovations/repairs. We have 55 windows that need repair, replacement, or are simply missing. We are without a kitchen and have two really beat up bathrooms (3/8 found asbestos in one today and had to stop working until we have $ for inspections!). But... in spite of all the work we have ahead of us, and all the $$$ we need to raise, we love and believe in this place, and Gastronome Gallery.\nThis loft/space will enable us to do pretty much everything we dreamed of achieving in a space. We can run all of our workshops, tastings, and hands on classes in addition to hosting pop-up dinners. In a few weeks we'll be building raised beds for a rooftop urban baby farm. We eventually hope to have heirloom chickens and we'd love to rescue/raise some bees. Our \"boutique\" shelves will feature products made by the amazing artisanal food crafters, chefs and artists we know. People will have the opportunity to purchase many artisanal and handcrafted items they simply can't find in commercial stores. Once every couple of weeks, we'll open our doors to local chef and they can have round table pow-wows and have a chance to relax, share ideas with one another and collaborate. We'll also have food documentary nights where people can stop by, grab a bag of organic popcorn and watch an important food documentary, followed by discussions on how we can impact our food system as urbanites and create positive change in our immediate communities NOW! We're also going to bring in our talented friends over to teach community yoga/health classes on weekdays. And we'll have our massive walls ready as a gallery space for the vast community of artists we are connected to around the country. That's what we're talking about when we say: Gastronome Gallery : Culinary Lab \u221e Hub. Basically, the sky is the limit! We are currently only hampered by our lack of funds... otherwise, we've already got the talented individuals... many of whom committed to working with us months ago when we first began building the bones of our company. Now... we need the seed money to bring everything to fruition.\nThanks so much for all the love and support! You have no idea what it means to us to have this overwhelming outpouring of excitement and encouragement.\n                                                                 \u2013\u2013                                                  \nWe are creating a unique space for Artisanal Food Crafters, Chefs, Artists and Gastronomes to come together to explore, teach, learn, and create community. \nWe keep saying that Gastronome Gallery is the culmination of a dream.\nWell... many dreams. The ideas started to come together a few months ago when we were collaborating with different friends and colleagues in the food community. \nAlmost everyone we know is this fountain of creative knowledge. And we realized that what we really wanted to do was to spend time with these amazing people all the time. We wanted to sit around a table with them and bounce ideas off one another. We wanted to cook with them, collaborate, teach, learn and host classes and pop-up dinners with them. We suddenly had this sense that more than ever before, we felt incredibly connected to everything happening around us, and we felt this deep sense that we were part of a community that spoke the same language. Now all we had to do was to figure out a way that we could all be connected constantly. \nFor a while we were flummoxed by how we intended to achieve this idea?... and suddenly it occurred to us! We had to be the anchor, the bridge, the lab... the hub. And so, Gastronome Gallery came to life. We decided that we should find a space in The Arts District of Downtown Los Angeles, where we could create our dream: Culinary LAB \u221e HUB. \nSo that's what we're doing... At this very minute, we're busy looking for just the right space that can fit into our dream. A place where all of these great ideas can happen and come to fruition. \nThe funds we raise from kickstarter will:\nHelp us with securing just the right space.\nHelp us buy necessary equipment and furniture (i.e. tables, chairs, kitchen equipment and lots and lots of cutting boards and useful tools/accessories).\nHelp us with doing some community outreach and give us time to work with urban farmers we know to work in different communities to explore the importance of growing our own food and cultivating biodiversity right here in Los Angeles. \nAnd so much more!\nOh... the sky is the limit! We have so much we want to do. The more we raise, the more we can achieve. It's not just about us sitting in a loft and hanging out with people we love to spend time with. On a very grassroots level, besides creating community, we want to attain the sort of world we wish to live in. And not only will this space help us connect with others, it will help us help others reach out and flourish.\nThank You for all your love and support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Gastronome Gallery\nFirst created \u00b7 41 backed\nNazie Fatima Shekarchi ChefSee more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Thank You for all your support!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone...

Making a film about \"happiness\" can be akin to making a movie \"on life.\"  The subject is so enormous that filmmakers are in danger of getting lost in it.  In our experience, investigations that linger and stories that stick tend to focus on characters -- in this case, people pursuing happiness.  So, we are pursuing the happiness question through the unique lens of one person searching for it, and experimenting on himself.\nThe guinea pig - the film's co-Director and subject, Stefan Sagmeister.  His accomplice - documentary filmmaker Hillman Curtis.\nTheir pursuit: \"The Happy Film\"\nThe Story \n\"The Happy Film\" centers around our main subject, Stefan Sagmeister, a New York-based graphic designer known for his rock n roll collaborations and typography. In the course of a year, Sagmeister will experiment with various practices that are widely touted as increasing one\u2019s happiness: meditation, cognitive therapy, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe documentary will test these various methods during 3 x 3-month experiment periods.  The production team will work closely with a group of health professionals to properly assess Sagmeister\u2019s well-being. Our health partners will monitor Stefan prior to the experiments, as well as participate in occasional check-ups during the course of our 9-month study.\n\nThroughout the film, Sagmeister\u2019s maxims, by way of the book \u201cThings I Have Learned in My Life So Far\u201d, will function as typographical set pieces that related to the ongoing experiments.\n\nWhere We Are\nWe are actively producing this film.  A contribution to \"The Happy Film\" at this stage will have a measurable impact on the film's outcome.  To date, we've shot approximately 40% of our footage.  Sagmeister spent 3 months in Bali where he underwent an intensive meditation period.  His trip was book-ended by fMRI lab visits and psychological surveys.  Our documentary team was there to track his experience, as well as film a never-before-seen maxim.  Sagmeister has returned, and is now starting a 3-month experiment in cognitive behavioral therapy, followed by a 3-month experiment with SSRI's.  These experiment phases will be heavily documented and will contain extensive medical supervision, leading to some new costs for our team. \n\nTo Learn more about the film\nWatch Sagmeister's 2009 TEDtalk,\"The Power of Time Off\". \nRead the maxims in the 2008 book \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far\".\nRead recent articles about the project in The Atlantic and Salon.com\nThe Team\nStefan Sagmeister is a 2-time Grammy Award winning graphic designer, and founder of the studio Sagmeister Inc.  He is co-directing the short with filmmaker Hillman Curtis.  Hillman's most recent documentary is \"Ride, Rise, Roar\", a film about David Byrne.    Ben Nabors is a New York-based non-fiction producer and runs the production studio {group theory}.

For more information about Crap Hound, Show & Tell Press, and various rewards, please see below.\nATTENTION INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: We've had a lot of issues with international backers forgetting to add extra $$ for shipping, as well as some trouble calculating shipping on rewards that involve multiple items. PLEASE NOTE our instructions for each reward level. We don't know who is pledging from outside of the US until after the project has ended, so we're counting on you to follow our instructions and avoid extra hassle after the fact.\nABOUT CRAP HOUND\nBetween a brief introduction and the end credits, Crap Hound is pure imagery. Each page is filled with high-contrast line art, culled from vintage catalogs, advertising, obscure books, and found ephemera. Through sheer volume of artfully arranged iconography, Crap Hound provides a visual survey of dozens of popular and lesser known superstitions. This all new issue is 100-pages including the cover and features two copyright free typefaces!\nDebuting in 1994 and created by Sean Tejaratchi, Crap Hound became a favorite of both zine readers and publishers, and has received enthusiastic reviews from sources including The New York Times Magazine, RE/Search Books, AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts), and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.\nRead a great interview with Sean by Ian Lynam in PingMag. Check out the issues currently available at Reading Frenzy.\nABOUT SHOW & TELL PRESS\nFounded in 2005, Show & Tell Press is an offshoot of Reading Frenzy, a small, specialty bookshop in Portland, Oregon devoted to independent, small press and self-published titles. Crap Hound is our main project, but we aim to publish a variety of titles -- zines, comics and books -- with a special focus on good design and strong visual content.\nVisit our Facebook page for more cover and interior views of Crap Hound. We also have a Show & Tell Press blog.\nABOUT THE REWARDS\nThe only way to guarantee obtaining one of our reward items -- digital bonus pack, buttons, greeting cards, rubber stamps, wrapping paper and tote bags -- is to become a backer BEFORE our project ends. We will be producing a set quantity of each item and some may sell out during our project, any remaining stock will be sold at Reading Frenzy. Kickstarter reward prices will not apply.\nWe'll be posting images of the various rewards and posting updates throughout the project, but you can rest assured that everything we put out will be beautifully designed and skillfully produced using high quality materials. All our printing is done in the U.S. and Canada. We use American made textile products, and forest friendly paper for all prints and cards.\nTOTE BAG\nHigh quality, 100% cotton, silkscreened tote bag designed by Sean Tejaratchi.\nWRAPPING PAPER\nSix sheets of superstition themed wrapping paper, two designs, approx. 20\"x28\". We THINK we're going to silkscreen the gift wrap! More details soon...\nGOOD LUCK\nBAD LUCK\nCARDS\nA 6-pack of silkscreened greeting cards featuring three of each of the cards pictured below. These blank greeting cards are appropriate for a variety of occasions and suitable for framing!\nBUTTON SETS\nA neat set of superstition themed 1\" buttons. An assortment of good and bad luck, just like real life!\nRUBBER STAMPS\nHigh quality, clear photopolymer stamps, includes an acrylic block for mounting and instructions on how to get the best quality imprint from your stamps.\nBONUS DIGITAL COLLECTION\nHundreds of images in this issue of Crap Hound required extensive clean up and refinement in Adobe Photoshop before they were ready for layout on the page. These images were high-quality intermediate steps that were made during the issue assembly. Plenty were taken from imperfect photos or scans, and as such, they're not necessarily pristine. On the other hand, all have a great deal of detail that inevitably gets lost when reduced to fit on the final page.\nMany are pure line art, without any shading. Others have high-contrast stippling or grit as shading. Before they were reduced on the page, most of these images measured twice the size, almost always at 1200 ppi (pixels per inch). For a few files, when it's too good to pass up, a high-res greyscale or color version will accompany the high-contrast art.\nThis bonus collection will probably be uploaded and delivered to you via a download link. You will have two weeks to download it before it's removed. File size should be under 100 MB. Format will most often be high-res bitmap tiff. In some cases, greyscale or RGB will be included.

THANK YOU.  IT'S BEEN SO ENCOURAGING AND OVERWHELMING (AND SO QUICK) THAT WE'RE HOPING TO KEEP MOVING TOWARDS OUR NEXT MILESTONE OF $50,000.  AFTER ALL, WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH TIME LEFT MIGHT AS WELL KEEP GOING! \n---\n+ Pool is our initiative to build a floating pool for everyone in the rivers of New York City, and we need your help.  We've spent the last year working with engineers, swimmers, consultants and planners studying what it would take to swim in clean, natural river water right here in the city.  Now with your support here on Kickstarter we can bring + Pool one giant step closer to the water.\nBACKGROUND (and why we think this is a good idea)\nWe started + Pool last June, during what seemed like one of the hottest summers of our lives.  As a New Yorker, you spend most of your time on an island surrounded by water, and when it gets as sweltering hot as it does in New York, you naturally start fantasizing about swimming in the river. But the rivers here aren\u2019t the cleanest and swimming in them isn\u2019t necessarily the best idea. We wanted to do something that could change that.\nSo we proposed a pool.  More specifically, we proposed a pool that uses and filters the very water that it floats in.  A pool that makes it possible to swim off the shores of New York. In river water. That\u2019s clean.\nDuring that summer we designed + Pool and launched it into the world with the main intention of building a team that could help us realize the project.  We figured it might attract attention from some engineers and experts that could help us out.\nWhat we hadn\u2019t anticipated was that within the first few days over 50,000 people had shown interest in the project and we were fielding calls left and right about how to make this pool a reality.  At the end of the first week, we got a call from Arup, one of the most innovative engineering firms in the world (and frankly, a firm we never thought we\u2019d even get a chance to talk to) who basically said, \u201clook guys, you've got something new here, and we want to help you make it happen.\u201d  Arup offered to donate their resources and it was at that moment that we realized that this thing was really going to happen.\nFILTRATION\nThe most important aspect of + Pool\u2019s design is that it filters river water through the pool\u2019s walls - like a giant strainer dropped into the river.\nThe concentric layers of filtration materials that make up the sides of the pool are designed to remove bacteria, contaminants and odors, leaving only safe and swimmable water that meets city, state and federal standards of quality.\nThis pool will be the first of its kind, which is of course very exciting, but really we just want to be able to swim in the river.\nA POOL FOR EVERYONE\nWe wanted the + Pool to be enjoyed by everyone - at all times - which is why it is designed as four pools in one: Children's Pool, Sports Pool, Lap Pool and Lounge Pool.\nEach pool can be used independently to cater to all types of swimmers, combined to form an Olympic-length lap pool, or opened completely into a 9,000 square foot pool for play.\nWHAT WE\u2019VE DONE SO FAR\nWe launched + Pool in June of last year and garnered a surprising amount of public and private interest.\n\nWe met with interested swimmers, designers, engineers, community organizers and consultants to build a team to develop the project.\n\nWe spent the last year talking with local cultural, developmental and environmental groups, learning about the waterways and refining the social and ecological performance of the project.  \n\nWe\u2019ve talked with municipal and civic organizations to find out what kinds of permitting and approvals we\u2019d need to get + Pool into the river.\n\nWe teamed up with Arup and spent the winter studying water quality, structural configurations, energy use, site potentials and of course the filtration system.\nArup helped us understand the state of New York City\u2019s waters and what the pool needed to do to achieve our desired level of water quality.  At the end of May, we received the final feasibility report from Arup that essentially said \"yes, this can happen, and here\u2019s how.\"\nNow we have to test it.\nWHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT (and how you can help)\nWe\u2019re looking to raise $25,000 to begin physical tests of the filtration materials and methods that we spent the winter studying.  With each donation amount you'll receive an article of + Pool summertime attire, from tantoos and koozies on up to sunglasses, tanktops and towels.\nA $500 donation will get you the entire outfit complete with a handy + Pool tote bag to tote your new outfit around.  Give more than that and you'll not only become a proper Sponsor or Partner of the pool, but we'll engrave your name onto a piece of the pool itself.  Your name will become a permanent fixture on what we'd like to imagine will be a defining icon for ecological innovation in New York City.  You + Pool.       \nOUR GOALS\nOur ultimate goal for this phase is to build a full scale mock-up of the + Pool filtration wall so that we can prove to the city how real this thing actually is.  Material testing sure is pricey, but the more money we can raise here, the closer we are to getting + Pool in the water.\nIf we can raise:\n$25,000 - We can test the Primary Filtration Layer: a geotextile that is both the first and most crucial layer of the filtration assembly.\n$50,000 - We can test the Secondary Filtration Layer: different membranes that make up the most complex section of the assembly.  This is basically the meat of the filtration sandwich.\n$100,000 - We can test the Third Filtration Layer: Innovative disinfection methods that are clean and safe for both swimmer and river.  No point in just dumping a bunch of chlorine into the pool if it's going to flow back out into the river!\n$250,000 - We can develop and design the full water-cleansing assembly and find the most suitable structural, mechanical, electrical and of course filtration systems to get only the best out of the river.\n$500,000 - We can build a full-scale mockup of a piece of the pool, water filtration and all, to present to the public, to the city, to everyone.  We will also piss ourselves a little because oh my that would be incredible.\nTHANK YOU\nThank you to GYLo for the video up there, and thank you so much for believing in and supporting this.  We hope that all of us will be swimming in a plus-shaped pool in the rivers of New York very soon.

We'll test all the filtration materials in real-river conditions with a 35 foot by 35 foot temporary and floating science-lab version of the + POOL that we're calling Float Lab. It'll be docked at Brooklyn Bridge Park in the East River this summer, and you'll be able to see for the first time how this POOL actually works. That's wild."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "3 Days Left to Make + POOL a Reality for NYC!", "update_content": "Hi All, \nJust a note amongst the recovery efforts and news surrounding Hurricane Sandy that all of us at + POOL hope that you and your loved ones are all dry and safe.  Things are still pretty weird here in blacked-out Lower Manhattan, but it's nothing compared to how places like Staten Island, Breezy Point other neighborhoods across NY and NJ were hit.  The resilience, camaraderie and patience city-wide has been incredible, and we hope everything can get cleaned-up, rebuilt, and turned back on soon."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Hope Everyone is OK After Sandy", "update_content": "+ POOOOOOOOOL!\nApologies for the lag in updates in the last few months.  We've been getting our hands dirty (literally, with water that isn't, say, Poland Springs) down by the river.  \n\nAfter our Kickstarter campaign ended, we put all of your donations to use by spending a month testing the Primary Filtration at the East River.  We looked at 6 different membranes in collaboration from Gunderboom and analyzed them across 16 different parameters with the help of professors and researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.  In short, we spent four weeks in our own + Pool Science Lab in a trailer on the shore of the river.  We tested for things like turbidity, color, fecal coliforms, suspended solids, etc.  We got very good at incubating poop.\n\nAnd the results were great.  The membranes performed as well if not better than expected in some cases and provided a great base to move into the next filtration layer.  It'd be a lie to say that filtration is solved, cause it's not.  In fact we still have PLENTY of work to do and right now we're starting to plan out Test#2, which we hope to do in February."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 30, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/694835844/pool-a-floating-pool-in-the-river-for-everyone", "project_name": "+Pool: A Floating Pool in the River For Everyone"}}]
