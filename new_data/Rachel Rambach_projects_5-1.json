[{"backer": "Rachel Rambach", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hey everybody!\nI have the opportunity to record my next EP / album with a great Nashville-based producer. I'm super excited for the project but I need your help!\nI need a top-notch, professional record in order to pursue more opportunities. As you can imagine, working with professional producers isn't cheap. My goal of $5,000 is really the bare minimum. That will probably get me 4 or 5 songs (an EP) depending on how many musicians we have to hire per song. To record a full-length album, I'll need more like $10,000-15,000. And even that is just recording - there are still other expenses, like CD duplication, art work, any promotional costs, etc. I set the goal at $5,000, though because that will at least get an EP. If we raise enough for a full-length album, that'll just be a bonus!\nI've got quite a bit of unrecorded material - some brand new songs and some not-so-new that just haven't been recorded yet. Check out the reward sections. You can even pick a song to be recorded!\nI have a hard time accepting people's money but I look at it this way: it's kind of like pre-ordering the music. And having the money upfront ensures that the recording can even be made. So if you think you'll download it when it's done, or buy the CD anyway, you might as well pre-order it so I can even make it. And if only 200 people donate at the $25 level, we'll hit the goal. If 400 do so, we'll be able to do a whole album. If 600 people do so, we'll hit the REAL goal.\nI really appreciate anything you can give! Thanks for reading!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are multiple ways to record an album. Shifts in the music industry and the availability of inexpensive, easy-to-use recording gear have made DIY projects more common. I've been a part of making recordings like this and fairly happy with most of the results. (The Micah Walk Band's \"Bright Side Fantasy\" album was a DIY project and I'm very proud of it). The fact is, though, that it takes a whole lot of expertise to record music well, expertise that I don't have. And since I believe that my current batch of songs are the best I've ever written, I came to the conclusion that it was time to seek the help of an experienced professional. That's why I've enlisted the help of Nashville producer Andrew Osenga. \n\nPaying the producer is a big chunk of the expense, but it's not all of it. Once you decide how a song will be produced (are we going to record this song with acoustic guitar and vocals only? Do we need a whole orchestra? Piano? Marimba?) you have to hire the necessary musicians. The more musicians you hire, the more expenses add up. Fortunately, though, a producer like Andrew has the expertise to get things done quickly and a network of musicians who may have a hefty hourly rate, but can perform quickly. \n\nI have never worked with a professional producer before. I am extremely excited to do so and I believe the outcome will be the best record I've ever recorded.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Thank you!", "update_content": "Hey everybody!

What are you waiting for?!\n****************\nIn a world where bands make records, one girl is making a record... again. She has the skills. She has the drive. She has the team. But there's one thing missing. How will she pay for all of this? From the makers of Allison Weiss's first Kickstarter project comes a new story about one girl, and one internet, coming together to make something happen.\n\nThe Backstory: almost 3 years ago I signed up for Kickstarter.com not really knowing what I was getting myself into. I made a little video, thought up some prizes, and put it on the internet all in a matter of hours. I was nervous but excited and hoping for the best... and completely shocked when I met my goal in only 10 hours, and more than tripled it over the course of 60 days.\nWhat did I learn? The internet is amazing! There are people all over the globe who like what I'm doing! I don't need a label to make a record! There are still good citizens out there who want to pay for music... in advance!! Prizes are awesome! Playing a four-hour marathon show is an insane idea! Making records is expensive and when it's time to promote, the costs are even crazier! I learned that making music for a living is tough, hard, and quite a gamble, but when you've got friends and fans who will help you do it, the scary part becomes FUN and suddenly a stressful situation is more like a PARTY! \n\nSo what's different this time? The goal is higher, there are new prizes, I cut off all my hair and I'm not wearing any glasses, I am 24 years old, I moved to New York, there are more of you, but there is still one of me! The project isn't just about pressing a record, it isn't just about recording an album, it's about taking this to the next level. I've spent the last year touring and writing and working on this brand new record, and and it's high time that I level up. In the past I worked alone. I didn't have a producer, I skimped on recording equipment, and I spent nothing on promotion. This year everything changes. Let's make a list...\n\nYour generous donations will go to...- Paying the glorious Chris Kuffner to produce this fine full-length\n- Paying the indispensable Elliot Jacobson to play drums\n- Paying the various musicians who've contributed their skills to all 10 songs\n- Paying for recording space\n- Paying for mixing\n- Paying for mastering\n- Paying for some cool album artwork\n- Paying for music videos \n- Paying for a publicist to promote the record\nIf we exceed the goal, donations could go to causes such as\n- Paying for me to tour behind the release to places I haven't been yet\n- Paying for fun new merch\n- Paying for even more music videos\n- Paying to press the record on vinyl\n- Paying my rent so I can focus on making the record the best it can be\n\nSO YOU SEE... Making a record is expensive. Actually getting that record out into the world is so much hard work but also the greatest joy a musician like myself can experience. So that's why I'm coming to you today (again) to ask for help (again)! Because you see I'm not just doing this for me, I'm doing this for everyone (again). I want to make something awesome (again) that we'll both love and we can all say we had a part in (again).\nARE YOU READY? LET'S DO THIS!!!

Democracy now!!!!\nYOU WILL VOTE TO DECIDE:\n- what songs I play (covers?! oldies?! \"Dissolve\" 25 times in a row?!)\n- where I webcast from (Andrew's kitchen?! my bedroom?! my mom's basement?!)\n- which friends I'll call on to be special guests (insert your own thrilling examples here?!)\n- what I'll wear (boxing robe?! marching band uniform?! crocs?!)\nSO! That's that for now... As long as you guys keep flooring me with your incredible support, I will continue to think of new things I can do to say thanks.\nxoxo times a billion -Jenny\n+++++++++++++++++ DAY 2: +++++++++++++++++ Holy crap! You guys are amazing! Not only did we reach $20k, we did it in about 28 hours! Thanks to your swift aid, you've earned not just the rewards initially promised you, but also a feat of pain endurance performed by Mr. Elliot Jacobson (his chest will be waxed on video FOR YOU) and a 50's pin-up style photo shoot of me by Deborah Lopez. (Personally I am more enthusiastic about the Elliot thing, but to each his or her own!)\nSo here is where things start to get interesting!!\nI chose my goal based on a modest budget that seemed somewhat attainable (maybe). I never in my wildest dreams thought you all would support me so strongly or so quickly. I am deeply moved and find myself somewhat speechless in this department. (Good thing I figured thank you notes into the rewards!)\nBut as Aesop wrote in many a fable, a hustler's gotta hustle. The bottom line is, the more I am able to raise, the better I'll be able to make this record and the more cool stuff you'll be able to snag out of the deal! So following this train of thought, I'm going to add on this offer to my Kickstarter rewards:\nIf we reach $30,000, everyone who donates $15 or more will receive a digital download of the album demos.\nPeople often ask me where they can find acoustic/solo recordings of my songs. I love performing my songs in arrangements for a six piece band as much as I love playing solo, but until now, I just haven't been able to offer many stripped-down recordings. I want to be able to let YOU choose which way you want to hear my songs on any given day, and I also believe that there's something truly magical about the intimacy of a guitar/vocal recording.\nSO If we raise $30,000 I will record solo acoustic demos of every song on the record and if you donate $15 or more you'll receive a digital download of the album's worth of demos!!\nIf this goes through and you've already donated $15 or more, you're covered! You'll receive the demos no matter WHEN you pledge; it's just THAT you pledge that matters!\nEveryone have a safe and happy holiday weekend!!!!\nxoxo Jenny\n+++++++++++++++++ MY ORIGINAL POST: +++++++++++++++++ Hi there. My name is Jenny Owen Youngs and I write songs, play guitar, and sing. I've released a couple records and am now preparing to make a new one - the difference this time around is that I'm going to make the album without the support of a label. This means I get to realize my creative vision to the fullest, but it also means that I have to shoulder the full financial responsibility.\nSo I've decided to partner with the good people at Kickstarter to try to raise funds for this recording project - $20,000 in 40-something days to be specific. I know that number looks pretty massive, but as recording budgets go, that is actually quite modest. Tracking, mixing, mastering, paying my band and my producer Dan Romer adds up!\nYou may be asking yourself, \"What do I get out of helping you, Jenny?\" Thankfully, there are many answers! First and foremost there is the satisfaction that comes with knowing you're supporting a worthy cause. But let me speed ahead to where you GET AWESOME THINGS in return for helping out!\nA cornucopia of goods and services await you, dependent upon how much you contribute.\nGOODS include but are not limited to:\n-Advance copies of the album -Music available exclusively to Kickstarter donors -Tote bags and buttons and things things things -My freaking GUITAR\nSERVICES include but are not limited to:\n-A video of me shouting your name while standing in a picturesque location -Your outgoing voicemail message recorded by me -A skype lesson with me or Elliot Jacobson -A private pancake dinner & house concert by me for you\nYou can read the column on the right of the page for a full list of incentives! Every reward level includes all the incentives from the previous levels too!\nIf I can reach my goal by the deadline, my project will be funded and you will get stuff. If I fail to reach my goal, however, I will get nothing, you will not be charged, and you will not receive your rewards. Bitter tears shall be wept by all.\nThanks so much for checking out my Kickstarter project. I hope you'll consider helping me help you help me help you (??) ... and consider spreading the word to those people in your life who love helping and/or getting stuff!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Needle Drop of the album for you, and what's to come.", "update_content": "GREETINGS MY FRIENDS!\nI hope you're all having a killer spring.

It has since been downloaded hundreds of times, and I have received many comments, reblogs, phone calls and emails from ladies of all ages telling me that their lives have been positively affected by the work.\nI am now pulling together an extended version of the zine, with additional content by me, as well as guest editorials from influential, smart, confident and creative women who I personally chose to contribute: Gala Darling (groundbreaking blogger, galadarling.com), Allison Weiss and Jenny Owen Youngs (singer/songwriters,allisonw.com and jennyowenyoungs.com), Jaime Calder (writer, 12x2.wordpress.com), and Jessalyn Wakefield (writer and artist, amihuman.net).\nI would like to self-publish the extended zine in book format. I have been a member of and contributor to the zine community since adolescence myself, and I initially wanted to produce YAAF as a zine because I wanted the information to appear in a friendly, non intimidating format, and a hand-sewn paper zine is about as colloquial as it gets. However, I would like the extended version to hold up better and last longer, so it may be passed on from girl to girl, or kept and cherished for a long time, the same way the feminist books I read as a youngster have occupied prime real estate on my bookshelves for years.\n$350 will be enough to publish some promotional copies which will be sent to newspapers and magazines, as well as to publish copies to send to women's shelters, Planned Parenthoods, and after-school programs nationwide. If contributions continue past $350, more copies will be sent to these places.\nDownload the original audio podcast (for free) at http://www.youareamongfriends.com.\nXO\nP.S.
