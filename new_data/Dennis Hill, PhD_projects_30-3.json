[{"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Accession was formed from the question, \"Can it ever be a good idea to 'brick' your own computer?\"\nYES, YES IT CAN.\nThe focus of this project is to build a prototype of Accession.\n\nWhy Not Use Hardware AND Software to Protect Your Data?\nAccession is a different way of looking at security for your computer. It is a combined hardware and software solution designed to make your computer completely inaccessible when you are not using it, employs a philosophy of compartmentalization in design, integrates a multitude of security software to help protect it AND utilizes a USB \"key\" to run it.\n\nHardware Designed for Security\nThe building blocks of Accession start with the hardware. Accession will be built utilizing three separate encrypted solid state drives; one to store specialized operating system files (not actual operating systems) and two additional drives to store daily backups and hourly snapshots.\nVisual Representation of the USB \"Key\"\nAt the core of Accession is a USB flash drive that it uses as a \"key\". This flash drive houses RiseOS, our own operating system that runs the entire computer. When this \"key\" is removed, it \"bricks\" the computer, making your data completely inaccessible as there is no operating system to hack.\nImagine being able to physically secure your computer in something as simple as a lock box when your work day is over. Accession allows you to do this and more. These \"keys\" can even be assigned to workers or employees if multiple people use the same computer.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nIntegrated Software Solutions\nAccession doesn't only rely on its unique structure for security, it will contain software solutions to help protect your data. This includes encryption on all hard drives, automated primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your entire computer in the event of a catastrophic viral infection (including ransomwares!) or other disastrous failure, real-time monitoring and a data loss prevention (DLP) system.\n\nCompartmentalization\nCompartmentalization- the division of something into sections or categories. Also a military term for separating the details of an operation between operatives to prevent the entire operation from being compromised if any one operative is captured.\nThis is the philosophy behind Accession.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nAccession not only compartmentalizes your data through hardware means, but also through software. Accession will have the ability to run multiple, separate operating systems within RiseOS. These can either be a transplanted, existing installation or a fresh installation.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nThis means your current computer, programs AND data can be transferred to Accession with NO loss of functionality!\nThis compartmentalization combined with all your data separated between three encrypted physical locations, which are only accessible through the USB \"key\", decreases the chances of any of your data becoming compromised.\n\nThe Project As It Sits Now\nAs of the writing of this project, we currently have two \"working models\" of Accession (NEITHER is an actual prototype, as these \"working models\" are not built using the planned form factor, CPU, RAM or hard drive specifications of the actual proposed prototype system, however, RiseOS is installed on,and working from,a USB flash drive on both \"working models\"). These \"working models\" were built so we could begin the coding and building of the operating system and additional security features, and to start preliminary testing. The images above contain actual screenshots of RiseOS. We added the monitor to make it look fancy. We have secured a vendor, and contacted numerous others, to manufacture the prototype computer (without the operating system) and the finished systems.\nRiseOS is roughly 60% complete as of this writing. It is based on another operating system, SanctumOS, we created, so the basics are already in place, what is remaining to complete is additional in-depth coding to enhance the security software and remediation systems and to tighten up the look and feel of the operating system to make it more familiar and user-friendly.We are also developing a simpler graphical interface for unlocking the encrypted drives.\nThe \"working models\" of Accession have gone through preliminary testing of the primary and secondary remediation systems against ransomware infections; specifically Petya, NotPetya, WannaCry and Ryuk. We believed this was essential to complete as soon as possible as this is a primary feature of Accession. These remediation plans have been used successfully on other solutions offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, but not with this complex of a design. They have performed admirably in all preliminary tests and recovered 100% from each infection. The recovery process took between 45 and 53 minutes depending on the infection and whether it was the primary or secondary remediation system. We project that the actual prototype recovery time will be quicker due to the higher proposed hardware specifications. We will be uploading a screen capture of a ransomware infection on Accession and the recovery process through the primary remediation system once the security coding is more complete, roughly within the second week of April. (this video will be edited ONLY for time constraints. We don't believe ANYONE wants to sit through a 53-minute video of a bar slowly moving across the screen, although we will make the complete, unedited video available to any backer who wishes to see it. [UPDATE: The video actually ended up being 87 minutes, see our UPDATES]). The secondary remediation system does take the computer out of the operating system, so doing a screen capture of this remediation system will be a little difficult. This secondary remediation system is planned only to be used as a last ditch recovery system.\n\nPlans for Funding\nThe funds we are raising will be used for the following:\n-  The materials for, and construction of, an actual prototype system, this includes all the proposed hardware (i.e. form factor shell, CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives and USB drive);\n-  The hiring of one or two additional employees for additional coding, both controlled-environment and \"real world\" testing, and other responsibilities;\n-  The filing of a provisional patent and of the actual patent once Accession is completed;\n-  Expenses associated with testing Accession in a \"real world\" business environment. This includes the cost of commonly used business software such as Quickbooks, MySQL, CRM software, etc. to ensure Accession does not inhibit any such software;\n-  Expenses associated with testing Accession within different business network structures. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual servers, VPNs, networked drives, NAS systems, cloud storage, cloud computing, etc.;\n-  The writing, editing and printing of a \"quick start\" user's manual and the creation of a troubleshooting website;\n-  An additional \"slush\" fund for unexpected expenses. We have tried to take into account any and all expenses associated with this project, but as any creator or developer will tell you, there is always something unexpected that appears.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks:\n We are not new to technology. Our team of two have a combined 57 years working with, building and designing computers, hardware and software. We are fully versed in multiple forms of coding for Windows and Linux. Josh started his own computer repair and service company, Trust Tech Management (www.trusttechmanagement.com), in 2015 geared towards providing honest, inexpensive and quality computer services for small businesses and residential users. Realizing there was a need for innovative cybersecurity solutions for small businesses, he started Archai Solutions, LLC (www.archaisolutions.com) unofficially in 2020 and officially in 2021, with the philosophy that standard cybersecurity techniques were not working and new, revolutionary solutions were needed. If the accepted solutions were enough, hackers and ransomware attacks would not be the threat they are.\n\n We have been working hard to ready Accession for Kickstarter, but life is nothing if not unpredictable. Here are the risks we foresee and our plans for assessing them:\n\nCURRENT SILICON SHORTAGE: With everything that has happened in the world in the past year, every day life has become disrupted. Manufacturing and supply has been no different. Anyone in technology knows that there is currently a shortage of silicon. This is making computer parts, such as motherboards, graphics cards, etc. in short supply. We have identified and contacted numerous vendors to help reduce any shortages or lead times we may come across that could prevent fulfillment of Accession.\n\nCODING AND DESIGN: Even with all our experience, there's no way around it; coding and design takes time. This along with our philosophy to make this system as simple to operate as possible and give it an easy-to-understand, familiar look and feel, sometimes makes this process a little slow. We are designing this system for EVERYONE, not just technology fanatics.\n\nACTS OF GOD: Every day can bring new challenges. Fires, natural disasters, emergency situations can all happen in the blink of an eye. We are using two different locations for R&D to prevent any natural disaster from disrupting the development of Accession.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Josh Van Metre\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI have been in the technology business for over 25 years.

You will be \"leveled up\" by gaining this knowledge.\n\nRegardless if you are a beginner with Python or a seasoned programming rock-star, Michael Driscoll will help you continue to grow in your developer journey. There are hundreds of awesome tutorials on his blog, Mouse Vs Python, that you can read for free! \n\nImage Processing with Python uses the Pillow package. Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library. Pillow originally released in 2010 and has been stable for many years. It is a well known and trusted imaging library for Python. \n\nYou can rest assured that Michael knows Python. He has been programming and writing about it for over a decade. Michael also has EIGHT other Python books.\n\nYou can get a free sample of the book using this link. This contains a PDF version of the first 3 chapters.\n\nPillow: Image Processing with Python will be published in April 2021\n\nIf you miss the campaign, the book can also be purchased on Leanpub: https://leanpub.com/pillow/\n\nThis book will be printed in COLOR.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

All the pages of the book will be printed on special thick 157gsm paper. This is a high-quality mat art paper, which definitely feels well and holds well. The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The first and most important thing was to assemble the team of professionals. We spent some time looking for illustrators whose drawing style would be convenient and could match with others\u2019 styles. It was a big deal to find writers for this project as soon as our expectations were rather high and we had a huge number of unsuccessful attempts before we could find writers who can perfectly complement their texts with the illustrations. We also searched out for many researches who support both our writers and illustrators with all the needed technical information. We managed to find experts in scientific, medical, technical and social fields who constantly advise us on what information the book should include to provide readers precise and workable instructions. All in all, we have 36 people in our team, about 10 side experts and this number is constantly growing. After that came the second step of our work which unfortunately took more time and turned out to be more complicated than we expected. We all had to get used to each other to stabilize and optimize the working process. The problem on the technical side was that we\u2019re an international team of nearly 40 people living in different countries all over the world. Time lag challenged our determination and commitment to work together on this amazing project. Finally, we won this fight but there were many others yet to come. Sometimes it was a hard time for us to learn to hear each other, we could meet every day and argue about many small and insignificant thing for hours. We still meet every day but now we can proudly say that our meetings are more productive than ever before. At last, making process is synchronized and we\u2019re actively working on the book.

To bring this concept to life we\u2019re working hardly and experimenting on both levels of the book \u2013 illustrations and texts.\n\nWe think that the best way to describe our way of working process is to say that we use cut-and-try approach.

It is impossible to spot any pixel on the screen that is projected.\" --Tyriel Wood\nMade by Unbox Fantasy, a professional crew assemblage from the former editors of tech review media. \nStill tethered to the past with an old bulky head-mounted display (HDM) or backpack-sized HD monitor weighing on your mood while working or watching entertainment? You may be feeling dizzy due to the visual \u2018melee attack\u2019 of first-gen displays or bothered by curious prying eyes when watching videos in public, or feeling self-conscious like a time-traveler with a bizarre gadget strapped to your head while trying to relax with some multimedia?\nGet GodView and set yourself free from old technology for an incredibly immersive visual experience for fun and productivity. Whether you are a hardcore gamer, movie fanatic, or busy commuter looking for an entertainment solution, GodView is a revolutionary solution that delivers an extradimensional experience for multimedia. A next-gen wearable with a perfectly balanced super lightweight, affordable, and stylish design suitable for everyday use.\nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\n\nGodView is designed as a standard-setting smart device, to bring user & budget-friendly mixed reality to life. Any content on your mobile phone can be cast wirelessly to the 300-inch virtual display in front of you.  It unveils vivid imagery before your eyes, empowering you with superb vision even more lifelike than what your eyes can show you.  \nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\nHigh Resolution\nGodView serves as a match for a professional monitor with a resolution of 2*2560*2560 (5K) that is sharp enough to eliminate ghosting, graininess, or optical grating, which allows you to experience visual details you can\u2019t see with typical displays.\n 3650 PPI See-Through Demo:\n Large Display Size & FOV \nGodView creates a massive 300\u2019\u2019 virtual display with a binocular 110-degree wide field of view (FOV) that naturally merges virtual details into the real-world viewed through the lens, for an incredibly immersive experience.\nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\n High Refresh Rate & Brightness\n  GodView supports a 90Hz refresh rate so the images you see are always extremely smooth without visible flickering, and with a brightness up to 2000 nits, the display is ultra-clear even in bright daylight.\nMyopia Adaptability\nIf you wear glasses, it\u2019s time to put them aside! GodView can self-tune its clarity for myopia of -8~0D, which means near-sighted users can see clearly and comfortably without wearing their everyday glasses or contacts. (Offered as an optional function in addition to the standard model). By continuously controlling the change of focal length, the eye can be trained to achieve the purpose of adjusting myopia. Holographic optics change and adjust the focal length automatically according to an advanced algorithm.\nNB.

Without the distraction of cords or a bulky headset, you can indulge yourself completely with \u2018God\u2019s view\u2019 and enjoy the best visuals.\n\n  Why Super Waveguide \nGodView utilizes the super waveguide optical solution made of lightweight resin. This innovation transforms the conventional head-mounted display into an everyday fashion item weighing just 55g, less than 1/10 of Microsoft HoloLens\n Wi-Fi Connectivity \nGodView achieves its unique lightweight performance without a heavy battery or processor onboard. It uses a compact Wi-Fi 6 bridge housing a power supply that can work continuously for over 4 hours and any multimedia on your smartphone can be cast wirelessly to the GodView virtual display in front of your eyes.

The Kolude Hub version is designed with an all-in-one docking function that lets you read and transfer data, and charge your keyboard or other devices, all at an extremely fast rate\u2014doing what no other keyboard could do. \nIf you\u2019re a busy traveler who needs a spectacular keyboard to go with you wherever adventure, work or business takes you, we have a special Bluetooth version of the Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard. Along with being extremely compact and portable, the Bluetooth version offers you a truly wireless experience. The built-in 850 mAh lithium battery provides you 10 hours of continuous working time with a backlight and 650 hours without a backlight. In short, with the Bluetooth version, the Kolude KD-K2 allows you to get everything done and going wherever you are, wherever you go!\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with your Mac or iPad, you\u2019ll be thrilled to have an extremely advanced multifunctional keyboard hub that lets you do more\u2014whether it\u2019s work or play\u2014with your Apple Devices. We\u2019re introducing the Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard, designed to let you extract even more value from your Apple devices, having far more gaming fun or working efficiency with a keyboard hub like no other. \nA superb feature of the keyboard that deserves a highlight is the Full Functional Host, a USB 3.1 type-C uplink interface that not only supports iPad 11\u201d/\u201d12.9 and MacBooks with USB-C generations, but also other non-Apple devices, such as Surface Pro7 and other laptops and tablets with a USB-C interface. \nThe Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard is equipped with Hotkey functions that are compatible with iPad OS and Mac OS. At the same time, we\u2019ve added more optimization functionalities for Windows to achieve higher compatibility, and a switching play between Mac and Windows just by pressing several keys combined. \nThe Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard is made from premium aluminum. That makes it an extremely stylish keyboard that\u2019s also robust and made to last. At the same time, the aluminum structure prevents the device from overheating and from feeling too hot when you use it, and it keeps it extremely lightweight and easy to carry.\n\nAn impressive design that kills your productivity doesn\u2019t impress us at all. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built the Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard with round groove buttons with scissor-switch keys. This ensures that you have highly reliable, responsive and quiet keys with short travel times that perform wonderfully when it comes to typing. After all, what\u2019s a keyboard good for if not for typing, right?\n\nNow this is a matter of personal preference, which is why we created three options. You can have your Kolude KD-K2 in silvery, gray, black version. Either way, this is the ultimate keyboard that you\u2019ll definitely enjoy working or playing with!\nThis is not our first Kickstarter campaign. In fact, in March 2020, we completed a successful Kickstarter for the Kolude KD-K1, the previous version of the now launched keyboard. We raised a total of USD $172,000, over 1,000% of our funding goal, and we diligently fulfilled our rewards to our backers. That tells you that we have the experience, technical knowledge and background to create a new Kickstarter success story for the Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard, which can now be yours!\nKolude was founded in Shenzhen, China, where our own established factory with more than 100 professionals who work every day on every stage to get our products excellently manufactured. We also have a team of highly experienced designers who focus on designing and creating state-of-the-art electronic and non-electronic accessories, such as Kolude KD-K2, which we\u2019re now presenting to you.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike all Kickstarter projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the quality we demand of ourselves.

We love Black and many backers have asked for Black for our previous project because Black color is more stain-resistant in the long run. White color chargers are for illustrative purposes and may be offered later at retail after fulfillment for Kickstarter is completed. Please understand that having multiple color choices, especially for different chargers within the same reward will just complicate and delay the entire Kickstarter fulfillment process. For example, we won't be able to ask for your color choices until after the project ends via a survey which means we cannot accurately prepare the rewards beforehand.\nEarly Bird Special (50% off)\n$39    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$49    -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$88    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nKickstarter Special (40% off)\n$48     -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$59     -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$108   -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nExpected Retail Price\n$79.99     -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$99.99     -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$179.98    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nReward Fulfilment\nTo ensure timely reward delivery, we will ship rewards via insured postal service from our fulfillment and distribution centers in:\nCalifornia USA - fulfilling rewards within the United States\nProject Timeline\nSeptember 28, 2020 - Kickstarter begins\nOctober 26, 2020 - Kickstarter ends\nNovember 2020 - Production begins\nDecember 2020 - Shipping of Early Bird rewards\nJanuary 2021 - Shipping of Kickstarter rewards\nFrom the team that brought you the World's First 100W USB-C battery pack and Kickstarter Most Funded power bank project\n(as well as the world's 1st, smallest, and most crowdfunded 100W GaN charger)\nAbout Us\nHYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making award-winning USB-C products since 2015. We also have a long proven track record of delivering Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects. Our most successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo project, HyperDrive USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro, raised over $3.1 million and is currently the most crowdfunded MacBook and USB-C accessory. Our latest Kickstarter and Indiegogo, HyperJuice 100W GaN Charger, which raised over $3.3 million is the most crowdfunded USB-C charger. The HyperJuice 130W USB-C Battery Pack is the most crowdfunded power bank project on Kickstarter ($1.4M). Our HyperDrive USB-C Hub for iPad Pro is the most crowdfunded iPad accessory ($1.2M) and many more. So we do have a lot of experience with USB-C and Apple products. This is our 26th crowdfunding project. Our previous crowdfunding projects have altogether raised over $14 million and we have delivered to over 140,000 backers.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nBig thanks to Team MVP for producing our awesome video and product photos.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is without risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Kickstarter. We are also no strangers to portable power, USB-C, mobile accessories or crowdfunding.\n\nThe HyperJuice charger that you see in the above video/photos are actual full working prototypes.\n\nWith your support, we can bring HyperJuice to users everywhere. We have started mass production and your contribution will help us achieve economies of scale and keep the product cost low.\n\nWe have sufficient materials to manufacture about 5,000 units now. Beyond that, the lead time is about a month. Your strong support will give us the needed affirmation to place a larger raw materials order and start mass production earlier.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "1 x HyperJuice 65W (KS Special)", "descp": "Get one (1) HyperJuice 65W, at 40% off the expected retail price of $79.99!

It establishes the standard for future USB power strips by providing higher speed charges for all your appliances including laptops while eliminating the need for adapters.\nFunctionality doesn\u2019t have to come at a cost of good design. Adopting a tradition-defying look, sleek outline and fireproof glossy coating, PowerCloud transcends into a sophisticated desktop powerhouse to keep a complete workstation and entertainment center fully powered and charged.\nIt is a must-have essential for working from home. If you are busy working to a tight schedule at home in the presence of your family, Powercloud automatically keeps all the cords and devices organized so well and makes clutters and messes disappear for good.\n\nPowerCloud is a power strip equipped with 3 AC outlets, 2 USB-C Power Delivery (PD) ports and 1 USB-A Quick Charge (QC) port.\nIn addition to providing a large amount of power for electrical devices such as computers, TVs, printers and lighting, it also offers blazing-fast, adapter-free, cable-only USB charges to phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nLeading the way is the 65W of USB-C power - the highest of all on the market - able to give your 13\u201d MackBook Pro or MacBook Air a full-speed charge without the need for additional usb power bricks.\nIf you commute daily between your residence and workplace, you can have one PowerCloud at home and one in the office, then you can say goodbye to those heavy, bulky adapters without worrying about your devices running out of power.\nIf you travel a lot, you just need to bring one PowerCloud which fits perfectly in your backpack instead of lugging around several big power adapters to have all of your devices powered up or charged up at maximum speed.\nPowerCloud not only supports PD3.0 fast charge tech through its dual USB-C ports but also QC3.0 through the USB-A port rated at 18W, able to charge compatible devices up to 4 times faster than a conventional USB power strip. For instance, you can charge your smartphone up to 80% in just 30 minutes.\nPowerCloud can quickly charge everything you throw at it. In addition to smartphones, tablets and laptops, it also works with Nintendo switch, Kindle, power banks, keyboard, headphones, smart watches, table fan and light.\n\nPowerCloud packs three AC outlets in its compact footprint which are widely spaced to accommodate even oversized plugs and power adapters without overlapping.\nThe contact points inside the socket are made with absolute precision at a level of 0.1mm and subjected to rigorous tests to ensure secure grips after thousands of times of use. It won\u2019t become loose or wear out over time to cause heat or sparks, nor too tight to budge the prongs.\nPowerCloud puts the safety of you and your expensive electronics above all else by employing an all-around 10-fold protection. It offers safeguards against overheat, overcurrent, overvoltage, overcharge, short circuit, overload, undervoltage and electrical shock, fried components, pokes of fingers or other objects. It also comes with a fire-resistant casing of the highest fireproof standard in the industry.\nDon't work with an office or live with a home tied down by messy wires and tangles of electric cords. Powercloud helps keep your space clutter-free and your mind stress-free for maximum productivity and creativity. The ports on the PowerCloud are strategically arranged in two separate zones: the top zone dedicated to AC outlets and the front zone dedicated to DC usb outputs. The power cables on the front can be routed to the back and hidden from sight. The USB cables on the front are easy to access and quick to plug/unplug. So they won\u2019t end up unruly and bundled up together. And the separation of high- and low-voltage ports eliminates the risk of electric shock and fire hazards.\nPowerCloud is the best 6-port charging station for multiple devices. It connects up to 6 devices simultaneously, meeting the diverse power needs for work and play of the whole family.\n\n\nCombined with smart IC, PowerCloud automatically detects and adjusts the power for connected devices accordingly and ensures rapid, optimal charging while greatly extending the lifespan of the batteries.\n\nPowerCloud packs 65W of USB power, which can either be distributed throughout the three ports or dedicated solely to the USB-C port with a minimum of 45W output even when all the ports are plugged in, giving your laptop or tablet a good amount of juice.\nPowerCloud sports a minimalist design which will blend in nicely sitting next to your iMac, MacBook or iPhone. It is a departure from blocky, tedious power strips that are meant to hide under desks and behind furniture. You can leave it in plain sight on a desk or table top as a decor which adds functional style to a workspace at home or in the office.\n\nThere is a LED light which will illuminate green when your devices are being charged, and a master switch to turn on and off all power.\nSince 2008, Torras has been a brand that never settles for mediocrity and is full of aspirations and dreams.

On each Omen card it outlines how many Room Tiles, How Many Enemies Start, and Boss health cards at the start of the game. \nPlayers will use these tiles to construct the map. There are 4 types of tiles: Enemy Spawn Tiles, Player Spawn Tiles, Regular Tiles, and The VAULT. Players will start by placing The Vault tile, then regular Tiles ending with spawn tiles.  \nOnce all the regular tiles are placed, Players can now choose where to place their spawn tiles and the enemy spawn tiles. \nEach character also has a unique set of actions, such as how far they can move and how many tokens they can use.\nPlayers will have to use their abilities and their tokens to scare enemies away from the Scare Factory. Eventually, you will have to fight off the boss that is leading the attack. Work together and combine your abilities in order to stop the humans from commercializing fear itself! If you want to know more or see the game in action, take a look at the videos on our page. Start defending The Scare Factory from those pesky humans and capitalists! \nSpeaking of which, the enemies in Scare Factory get a turn all to themselves. They each spawn on a unique enemy tile at the start of the game. They roll a dice which dictates where they go. Sometimes, if you\u2019re lucky, you can choose where they go. Most of the time they will search the factory for you, so you have to be careful!\nWhen an enemy is fooled into stepping on a scare token, they will be scared. Players then roll to see which direction they go. Again, like regular enemy movement, there is a chance that players can control where the enemies go. Sometimes the enemy will flee the board immediately. We will discuss that in a moment. If you land on another scare token, this starts a scare chain! After three scares, an enemy flees, removing them from the board. One of the most important parts of the game is these scare chains. \nAnother big aspect of enemy interaction is Ward Tokens. If an enemy walks into a ward token, players become able to move said enemy wherever they choose. As you may be able to tell, this is very helpful in completing a scare chain.\nThe Boss is a very powerful force to be reckoned with, so it\u2019s best to be on your toes. The boss will not be active at the start, letting minions do the dirty work, but inevitably they will come to deal with meddling interlopers (like you) themselves! Bosses have a set of ability cards that give them and the other enemies new powers. There are 32 total, but only 5 are active at a time.  \nThese abilities serve another important purpose: they act as the bosses' life. With each scare you pull off while the boss is active, you can remove an ability from the pile. Once this is done, the ability underneath is revealed and becomes active during the boss phase. Keep fighting through and remove all the cards in order to win! Hopefully, this has given you a bit more insight into the threat you are fighting against! Good luck in your fight to free the Scare Factory!\nDo you want to Test Play 'The Scare Factory' ? If so sign-up to get access to a tabletop simulator version. SIGN UP\nThe game is 100% playable without stretch goals, but we feel these are great incentives to provide to our backers for helping us fund 'The Scare Factory'. Also all stretch goals will be considered KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!!!!   \nMORE TO COME!!!!\n Being a first-time creator on Kickstarter we knew miniature production is a huge aspect of having an immersive player experience. I wanted to share a bit of our story about how we developed our miniatures.\nInitially, we wanted amazing characters in the game, but we also wanted them to look great. Our first step was to concept everything in 2d. From the concepts, we went into 3d development with our Talented art team.  The 3d development was combined with many iterations from the Design team on how the characters should look and feel. Lastly, we purchased 2 3d resin printers to test each 3d model. After each character was 3d printed we made adjustments to height, the scale of objects, details, etc. Just so everyone is aware we did 3d print every single character a minimum of 3-5 times to make sure iterations improved. The Video below showcases the full process of the Man-O-War expansion Boss!!!\n\n As explained earlier we adjusted our character heights via iterations and came up with our own scale that we thought was a great fit. Our heights range between 33mm (humans) and 60mm (Players and Bosses) \nWe really wanted to show off our amazing miniatures and decided to partner with a couple of painters. We reached out to Circle of Nerds and he offered an amazing paint demo (showcased below). We will also be doing a live painting demo with Life of a Board Gamer on October 20,2020 for everyone to check out. \n Some More Showcases \n Social Media\nWe have been doing quite a few posts on Instagram to show real pictures of the game and also have some youtube videos showing testing, art dev, and much more. Here are some links to check out our social media\nInstagram\nYouTube\nBGG \nShipping Details: All shipping prices are estimated in USD and are subject to change. We will also be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics to help with customs and tax friendly shipping. We will also be doing free local pickup for anyone located in The Greater Toronto or Kitchener/Waterloo Area. \nSupAR Games originally created in 2018. We focused our development on Augmented Reality technologies while doing some work for hire projects. We took our years of video game development and poured our efforts into 'The Scare Factory'. We brought on an art team, design team, and multiple testers. Together we have spent over 5000 hours to bring you 'The Scare Factory'\n Special Thanks to the people below to help us showcase 'The Scare Factory'\nLance Hinkel from Learn 2 Play for Learn to Play Video and Overview \nMark Streed from Dice Tower for the Preview \nOMG Nexus for Interview and an Overview \nLouie Martinez from Circle of Nerds for his Miniature painting demo\nDanijel Ljubas from Life of a Board Gamer for his painting livestream on October 20\nStephanie Cassandra from Minimum Player Count for a great video (coming soon)\nBoth Sides of My Table for an awesome written preview\nand the friends and family that help support the development of The Scare Factory\n Our timeline has been carefully planned. With the majority of art already created we will only need some touchups for production and template focused. We have already reached out to multiple manufacturers and they are prepared to take on our project. There is always a chance of delay, but we will make sure to let the backers know about any delays in production. \n Pledge Manager will be Backerkit ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nScare Factory is the first tabletop game that SupAR Games has worked on. Thanks to our experienced staff we have done our best to avoid the classic pitfalls that many first time projects fall into, but we still feel that it\u2019s important for you to know. We have assembled a team with a wide variety of skills to ensure that we are able to not only create the best content we can, but also to get different voices to help keep our goals realistic and our vision achievable. The main game art has mostly been completed already. The only new art that would be needed is for stretch goals and updating for printing components. That will allow us to get into production quite fast. \n\nWe are working hard to ensure that production will go smoothly, but as you may expect, it is possible that there may be COVID-19 related delays.

I have found that while learning how the various widgets work in wxPython is valuable, it is even better to learn by creating a simple application that does something useful.\nThe code in this book will be targeted for Python 3 only using wxPython 4.\nNote: If you missed the campaign, you can still get the book over on Leanpub. It will also be available on Amazon, Gumroad and other retailers in May 2018.\nCreating GUI Applications with wxPython\nThe code in this book will run on all 3 major platforms:\nWindows \nMac \nLinux\nIn this book, we will be creating the following applications:\nA simple image viewer \nA database viewer \nA database editor \nCalculator\nAn archiving application (zip / tar) \nPDF merging application \nXML Editor \nWe will also learn how to turn your applications into executables for Windows.\nAs you learn how to create these applications, you will also learn how wxPython works. We will go over how wxPython's event system works, how to use threads in wxPython, make use of sizers and much, much more!\nStretch Goal #1: $5500 (COMPLETE)\nAdd chapters on the following topics:\nMP3 Tag Editor\nNASA image downloader / search tool\nStretch Goal #2: $8000\nAdd new chapters that cover\nFile search utility ($6500)\nSimple FTP application ($7250) \nGraph creator (or TBA) ($8000)\nRelease Date\nI expect to have this book finished by May 2019\nWriting Style \nThis book will be written using my original conversational style. What this means is that the chapters will probably vary in size more than most programming books. \nI still follow the rule of giving simple examples paired with simple explanations instead of spending an inordinate amount of time re-explaining the same subject over and over.\nIf you've never read anything of mine before, you can download Python 101 for free or read it online. You can also check out my blog for writing examples.\nWho should read this book? \nThis book is for someone who already uses Python and would like to learn how to use Python to create fun cross-platform graphical user interfaces.\nWhat's the money for?\nISBNs cost money, especially if you have multiple formats of the book (paperback, PDF, mobi, etc). The money will also cover the initial print run of the book for the backers. It will also cover copyright registration and the cost of my illustrator. It would be great if I could do some web advertising as well. \nI'm looking forward to working with my backers to make the best Python book possible!\nAbout the Author\nI'm a professional full time Python programmer by day and Python blogger by night. I've been programming almost exclusively in Python for almost 10 years. I co-authored Core Python for DZone.

Places for good.\nSadly, we found ourselves more and more disappointed and frustrated about what existing ones are turning out to be: giant monetisation platforms with very little care and interest for their best asset: people.\n\nWe could probably write a book about everything wrong going on, but chances are if you have an internet or tv connection you have seen it in the news lately. \nSo instead, we'll focus on what makes Openbook different than any other social network.\n\ud83d\udd4a Honesty\nClaiming that you do something is not enough. People should be able to prove it. That's why all of the code for Openbook will be open-source.\nThis means anyone will be able to check on what we are exactly doing and hold us accountable for it.\n\nGoodbye closed walls!\n\ud83d\ude48 Privacy-friendly\nThis was our initial drive to build Openbook.\nWe wanted to create a social network where we could chat and share things with our friends and family with the confidence that our privacy was respected and protected.\n\nOpenbook will have zero tolerance for the tracking and monitoring of people.\nSurf the network with absolute peace of mind! \ud83c\udfd6\n\ud83d\udcb8 A revenue model that supports content creators!\nLet's get it out of the way: Our revenue model is not nor ever will be advertisement. \nInstead, it will be based on a digital currency called Tip \ud83c\udff5.\n\nThis currency will be used for a lot of things. Our priority though?\nSupporting content creators.\n\nThe internet is nothing without content creators and we are committed to finding ways for them to not just make a living but also have a stable income and make profit.\nYou will be able to Tip them at any given moment, but even better, become their angel and commit to donating certain amount of money to them on a flexible or fixed manner.\nIn exchange, they will be able to create exclusive content for you which you will receive directly in your feed.\nThis is just one example of the things possible with Tips \ud83c\udff5 ! Read more here\n\ud83d\ude9a Got another social network? Bring it all with you!\nDue to recent advancements in data-portability pushed by the European Union, if you already have a social network you will be able to import your photos, videos, chats and more into Openbook from existing major social networks!\nMoving away to another social network has never been easier.\nFull disclosure: There's a lot of room to improve on how existing social networks do data portability.\n\ud83d\udd12 Secure by design\nFrom day one, we will take malicious practices for granted and take care to minimise or eliminate their impact.\nDue to the open-source (see Honest point) nature of our code, we will also do our best to encourage info-sec professionals/enthusiasts to hunt for vulnerabilities. \nWhile initially we won't be able to afford fancy rewards or large bounties, if we succeed, we won't be shy about them. \n\nWe acknowledge the worth of finding a security vulnerability goes beyond a free t-shirt.\n\ud83d\udc77 A diverse & experienced team\nOur team consists of globally recognised information-security experts, talented software engineers, hackers, seasoned designers, human rights advocates & award winning privacy activists.\nWe recognise the challenges of building Openbook but most importantly, we are ready to take on them.\n\ud83d\udc83 Fun & social!\nBuilding a secure version of an existing social network will never be enough to compete with existing social networks. If we want to succeed we must build something unique, something better.\nAnd for this we're looking into build a social network that is actually fun to use and most importantly... wait for it... social *ba dum tss* \ud83e\udd41.\nWe have a lot of ideas. For example, a fun and secure way to chat with anyone around the world using animated avatars, new types of content and... oh wait, right, we're not supposed to share these kind of ideas just yet. \n\nYou get the idea, we want to dare to innovate, to break the status quo social networks have been in for the past years.\nEven better? We're open for all ideas! We'll create a place where you will be able to submit your idea, vote on other people's ideas and ultimately see it become a reality!\nTalk about doing things together.\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8 Customisable!\nSocial networks are all about who we are. Our friends, our family, our memories, our conversations. Nowadays we're all confined to the same silly template and colours of the corporation hosting us. \nWe want to change this. We want to make Openbook personal, for it to feel like home, like an extension of yourself.\nThat's why we'll be making every single piece of Openbook customisable.\n\nP.S. Yes, even our logo.\n\ud83c\udf0e And last but most importantly, a project for good.\nTech companies have a huge potential for doing good outside the digital realm.\nWe want Openbook to be beneficial for everyone, not just to the country that hosts us. That's why, if we succeed, we'll be putting 30% of our profits straight into making the world a better place for everyone, forever.\n\nWe're doing this in partnership with FoundersPledge, a non-profit that makes sure every single cent given makes a factual difference.\n\nEducation, cash transfers to those in most need, sanitisation, nutrition and disease prevention to name a few of the causes we will be supporting.\n\ud83c\udfc1 The Kickstarter goal \ud83c\udfc1\nFull-disclosure: This campaign is a re-launch. In our previous campaign we set our goal for 100k and made it to 45k. We reduced our minimum viable product, pitched in some of our personal savings and decided to direct every single cent towards getting us through 6 months of full-time software development. No extra-hands, no dedicated team workspace and definitely not enough servers to handle any significant load, but\u2026 If we succeed at building a great first version, we go from there.\n\ud83d\udcf130,000\u20ac | Openbook mobile version!

We have \"flexible\" offices, also known as cafes and our own apartments.\nWhere are you based?\nWe are based in The Netherlands, Europe! \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\nWhats with the funny job titles?\nWell, if we put things like CEO, CISO, COO and else, people immediately assume we're a settled company that will be just fine without backing. \nWill it be decentralised?\nInitially it will be built on a centralised manner. This will allow us to focus in innovating in regards to the user experience and functionality product rather than coming up with a brand new behind the scenes technology.\nIn the future, we\u2019re looking into decentralisation from very specific angles and for different things. Application wise, resiliency and data ownership.\nA project we\u2019re keeping an eye on and that shares some of our vision on this is Tim Berners Lee\u2019s MIT Solid project. It\u2019s all about decoupling applications from the data they use.\nIf the digital currency is such an important part of Openbook, why are you not offering it as a reward?\nOffering any kind of money equivalent goes against Kickstarters rewards rules.\nDid you re-launch your campaign?\nYes we did. You can read more about this here.\nThe open-book.org domain is annoying! Remove the dash NOW!\nThis annoys us too. Sadly, we don't have enough funds to purchase the openbook.com domain. If we get funded, this will be something will be doing and all of the annoyances will be gone! So please, help us get a proper domain!\nIf I donate and you don't meet your goal, do I get my money back?\nYep! And In fact, the money only leaves your account AFTER the kickstarter campaign ends.\nMeaning no goal reached = no money charged.\nCyber-cyber?\nCyber cyber cyber.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 Openbook Founder Starter Pack!", "descp": "Get early-access to the network, claim your Openbook @username, show off a Founder Badge in your profile and earn a spot in the Openbook's Founder Book! \ud83d\udd7a\nAll of this for 5\u20ac!\nINCLUDES:\nClaim your username\nExclusive Founder Badge in profile\nYour name in the Openbook's Founder Book\nEarly-access", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["934 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac14 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 + \ud83d\udcbb Exclusive Laptop Stickers!", "descp": "The Founder Starter Pack plus 2 exclusive and highest quality laptop stickers! \ud83d\udc4c\nINCLUDES:\nClaim your username\nEarly-access\nExclusive Founder Badge in profile\nYour name in the Openbook's Founder Book\nExclusive Openbook Black Sticker\nExclusive Openbook White Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["281 backers", "Limited (118 left of 399)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac39 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 + \ud83d\udcbb+ \ud83d\udca7 Sustainable Water Bottle", "descp": "We want to do good for the world.

Engineered to be a 4K media center and desktop replacement in one, Panther Alpha is powered by the latest Panther OS (based on Linux) and Android Marshmallow, bringing you endless of possibilities in an affordable, easy to use, tiny package!\nEquipped with a 2GHz Quad Core Cortex A53 and 2GB of DDR3 Memory, the Panther Alpha outperforms popular developments boards such as the Raspberry Pi 3 and aims to be not only the most polished ARM powered Linux desktop experience yet but also the most complete Linux experience by tying hardware and software together.\nPanther OS is a Linux based operating system designed for Panther Alpha, to help you accomplish more on your computer with less. With Panther OS, you get a familiar, reliable desktop experience that gives you access to your cloud-apps through Google Chromium and thousands of desktops apps such as Libre Office or Gimp (a popular Photoshop alternative) through our application\u2019s store.\nFreedom - Our library of thousands of open source applications are completely FREE. You can download and install them easily and they\u2019re yours to keep forever. No registration. No licensing - for home, business, school.\nSecurity - Backdoor viruses, malware, and other exploits are no match for Panther. A 2014 ESET report indicated there to be as many as 400 times the reported threats on Windows as there are on Linux, making the latter the more secure by quite some distance.\nCompatibility - Panther OS seamlessly integrates the apps you know and expect from Mac and Microsoft alike. Things like Office compatibility, Exchange support and Google Apps are no afterthought. They\u2019re built-in, along with all your other favourite programs.\nCustomization - No two Panthers are the same, and your machine is defined by you, just as it should be. You can easily change backgrounds, colors and fonts - even the entire desktop. The way your Alpha looks is entirely up to you. Whether it\u2019s a Windows-inspired taskbar, or a familiar Mac layout, the Linux Desktop is extremely customizable right out of the gate, so you can make it your own from day one. \nEfficiency - Panther OS uses up to 80% less memory than the average desktop computer. What usually takes around 1,000MB RAM after startup, Panther OS does with just 200MB. Even under full load, Panther rocks 17 times less energy compared to the Mac Mini.\nWe\u2019ve designed Panther Alpha to be a reliable companion, wherever you go. With no moving parts, no fans, all-flash storage, a strong aluminum casing and a power consumption of only 2W to 4W, make the Panther Alpha the most efficient, all-in-one (Linux) desktop computer in the world. All that in a package not much bigger than your wallet.\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective: The average desktop uses between 80-260W and runs Windows and other licensed software from at least Microsoft (Office, Antivirus, Photoshop, ..), costing you hundreds, if not thousands in licensing fees and renewal. Panther Alpha on the other hand uses 2W-4W and runs Panther OS, giving you easy access to thousands of free open source applications that rival paid applications such as Microsoft Office and Photoshop, both in quality and usability.\nPanther Alpha is a trusty companion for everyone, with at least two major Panther OS releases planned for our very first device and security fixes for up to 4 \u00bd years after each Panther OS release. Assuming you\u2019re using the device for 5 years, that\u2019s $17.8 per year or around $1.50 per month - less than a coffee.\nWe\u2019ve taken a look at what our users truly need to stay connected and while Apple has since reduced their latest Macbook Pro to Thunderbolt 3 ports only, with adapters costing up to $40, Panther Alpha still features the real \u2018thing\u2019: Gigabit ethernet, HDMI 2.0, 2 x USB, microSD card reader, S/PDIF and the good, old 3.5mm headphone jack. If you\u2019re going wireless, you can rely on 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and even IR, for presentations or to control navigate your media from the couch.\nHook-up your Panther Alpha with a gorgeous TV, modern display or beamer and output up to 4K. Your eyes, friends and family will be breathless. Even if you\u2019re laboured with a two-ton 1990s display unit, an $8 HDMI to VGA adapter from any back alley hardware store will turn it into the perfect output for your Panther Alpha.\nAnd if the 32GB on-board flash storage isn\u2019t doing it for you, you can easily expand via microSD, USB hard disk or NAS (Network Attached Storage), even shared from another Panther Alpha, for even more space to store your favourite music, photos, and videos.\nPanther Alpha might not look like what you\u2019d expect of a desktop computer, but looks can be deceiving. Beneath the gorgeous aluminium casing lies a powerful 2GHz quad-core 64 bit ARM Cortex-A53.\nPanther Alpha packs a serious punch. Compared to the much-revered Raspberry Pi 3, it boasts twice the memory and runs around 48% faster. Not to mention that it\u2019s designed with end users in mind. It\u2019s the complete package.\nThe Alpha also enjoys far more connectivity options than the Intel Compute Stick, including GB LAN and 4K video, giving you considerably more bang for your buck.\nIn addition, we strive to make Panther Alpha the perfect piece of equipment, whatever your needs. Whether you plan to develop with, on or for the system, use another OS (Linux, Android, Unix) or turn your Alpha in a server, head over to our community and share your ideas.  \n If you\u2019re still looking for stocking fillers, the Panther Alpha makes the perfect Christmas gift for that special someone. All our Kickstarter backers are eligible to receive their very own free digital gift certificate to give away when the big day arrives. At the end of the current campaign, you\u2019ll be able to let us know which model you\u2019d prefer to receive, and whether you\u2019d like us to send out a Christmas gift certificate.\n$200,000: If we can hit this goal together, we\u2019ll be able to offer an exclusive aluminium black version of the Panther Alpha. You can select your color preference at the end of this campaign.\nIn June 2016, we had the idea to turn the Raspberry Pi 3 into a stable computer platform. Our chief goals were to: \nMake Linux more accessible to the novice user \nEducate people on the benefits of open source, especially in regards to security \nProvide a complete, affordable platform \nMeet the needs of the everyday majority and allow them to take back control \nThe results were a resounding success, and we began handing out units to friends, family, and business associates to take for a test drive. The Raspberry Pi 3 gave us a good idea of what the platform is capable of, but we needed more power and more memory. We were looking to build a device not only for developers, but also the end-users, and now it was much clearer how to achieve that. \nWe continued working on the Pi 3 but maintained the ambition to take it further. We began reaching out to investors and distributors, and soon raised the $12,000 we needed to get started on a platform of our own, and found a manufacturer that could meet the specs we desired. With a few high-quality samples in hand, we hired Aaron Sowry; an Embedded Software Developer with vast ARM and Linux experience. With his help, we were able to initiate the device and begin work on what later became known as \u2018Panther OS\u2019.\nWith your backing, we can continue working on the computing platform of the future and you will get one of the first - your very own, Panther Alpha - in fact, one of the first in history!\nThe initial release of Panther OS will bring a stable platform to first backers, but allows future updates to be dictated by your feedback. We strive to ensure the continued development of Panther OS, with more meaningful updates designed to enhance your experience.\nOur backers will receive a developer kit along with their hardware. With the Panther OS SDK, you\u2019ll get access to the kernel, most of the framework and more to give you the ability to develop, customize and built the future of Linux with us. For example, you can modify the kernel to support your favorite hardware peripherals, and the framework to customize certain features and look and feel of Panther OS.\nWe have pledges designed to specifically support work on the Amlogic S905: \nWayland Support \nMainline Linux Kernel Support \n\u201cEarly Access to Panther OS\u201d backers get access to Panther OS beta builds, driver packages, and build script. They can use our work on drivers related to the S905 on their own devices with this chipset or to port other Linux OS distributions to Panther Alpha - you have completely control.\nWe\u2019re a diverse group of designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have spent the last year honing the Panther Alpha into what we believe to be a revolution not only for Linux computing, but the rights of every user in the world today. Here\u2019s the team behind this ambitious plan:\nPanther OS, paired with Panther Alpha is our answer to what\u2019s going on in the world: We're giving the power back to the user, with access to thousands of tested, completely free open source applications that don\u2019t compromise on usability but save you real bucks. Powerful tools such as TOR and a built-in VPN client help protect your privacy online and the sensible, pre-configured Firewall and non-logging DNS shield you from hacking and hijacking. The portable design allows you take Panther Alpha everywhere, to use as your desktop, as a server or hooked-up to the TV, to serve your media.\nWe\u2019ve taken away the headaches Linux can cause by providing a unified platform of hardware and software with integrated updates. Panther OS gives the power to choose what you share back to you: no mandatory sign-ups, secure software, and built-in tools to protect your privacy that are often left inaccessible to novices. We make computing much more efficient, with a highly-optimized OS that serves the majority of users. Your PC simply doesn\u2019t need to be any bigger, nor does it need to be more expensive. The complete Panther platform will set you back no more than $100 with zero ongoing costs and even significant reductions to your energy bills.\nThe future looks bright. Following the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign, we plan to launch Panther Alpha on Amazon and make it readily available to distributors worldwide. We\u2019ll continue to perfect Panther OS with new point releases annually and full releases every two years. To subsidize new Panther OS point releases, we\u2019ll manufacture more powerful ARM-based hardware, always with three key points in mind: lower energy use, affordability, and stability.\nOur ultimate goal is to make Panther Alpha the recognized computing platform to meet the needs of the everyday user, and increase our reach which will result in further developer support and community benefits. Your support is not only a vote to make open source software more secure, more private, and more efficient, but also for your own freedom to use your computer however you please.\nLet\u2019s get the message out there! We want to put the Panther Alpha into the hands of ordinary computer users that stand to benefit from increased privacy, smarter energy consumption, and reduced operating costs. Share our campaign on Facebook and help us make Panther the go-to desktop PC for everyday use.

Such beautiful pens out of sight or under piles of papers was certainly not the answer.\nThe Pen Rest brings that order. It takes up no room, really... it stacks vertically.\nI looked high and low for the perfect, most beautiful totem, desk art for pens I could find... there was just nothing out there! I had created the Worlds FIRST vertical stackable modular Pen Rest.\nPens are precision instruments with billions in use worldwide. Most are kept in a drawer, a mug, or under a pile of paper.\nI love pens of quality, Mont Blanc, Cross, Shaeffer and others to name but a few. To many people they are very desirable, as they offer confidence to the user, portray their image, personality, and have a character all of their own.\nThere are certainly pen holders available and even desk accessories, but none that I ever found could do justice by showing off high quality, often high priced fountain pens, roller ball and mechanical pencils that are so carefully made, detailed often with unique features and designs.\nPerhaps I'm a perfectionist!\nThe Pen Rest had to have the following features for me...\nIt must be a solid object with weight that stopped it sliding about It needed a delicate shelf to place my pen horizontal on it. Visually appealing I wanted to be able to admire my pens A Modular Stackable design I have no idea how many pens I might have now or in the future so I wanted to be able to build on my Pen Rest and keep its aesthetic appeal.\nA brief Background to my design idea..\nI believe a writing instrument should be seen ... clearly and not hidden away.\nI wanted a modular stand too ... one that you could add to as and when you felt like it.\nThe design had to be practical and yet smooth, with rounded edges.\nI was particularly keen that the block should give the appearance of floating and so the chamfered edges give that illusion.\nMaking the block vertical meant little footprint was being taken up. The actual area taken up on a desk is just 60mm x 45mm and yet you can stack as many pens as you like.\nA critical part of the design was to create a centre of gravity that did not change even if you stacked a load of pens.\nThis is because, the weight of each block is 227g, plus the weight of the top of 31g creates a paper weight effect ... a dead weight. As the pens added weigh less than the block... and the centre of gravity is about 20mm from the back of the block, the Pen Rest does not find itself tipping over.\nOnce the CAD drawings were completed I set about getting the right manufacturer and creating prototypes.\nHonestly when I tell you they are old school ... think back old films 1920's! But their workshops are so high tech that they receive work from highly sensitive customers.\nThese guys will be machining the Pen Rest to the absolute finest degree and tolerance that I have ever seen. They manufacture parts for atomic plants and the aircraft industry.\nYou'll be so impressed when you get your Pen Rest.\nOnce the parts are made they go through a variety of processes polishing, sand blasting and anodising before they are complete.\nThis is a very time consuming process that cannot be cut short. To get the highest quality finish every time each Pen Rest is individually cut.\nStackable, Modular and Practical - \"The Pen Rest\"\nThe Pen Rest stacked using three blocks and one top (also a great place to display your ink). The Pen Rest is beautifully shaped to reflect the curves of nature and lovingly display your pens.\nThe silver anodised colour matches Apple Macs very well.\nQuotes from a few people that have seen a sneak preview\n\"as a Mechanical Engineer I was thrilled with what you have done. The design and finishing of the pen rest looks fantastic.\" Thomas Tan www.onfountainpens.com\n\"The Pen Rest is a great idea as too many deserving pens end up being tucked away without being appreciated the way they should. I hope David will reach the 'soft cover' stretch goal.\" - Matthias Meckel Bleistift.memm.de\n\"I like it. I think its a neat idea and design\" Coy - Root Designs R&D\n\"The rest itself is certainly quite aesthetically pleasing, and the anodized aluminum would make it quite enticing as desk top art. Stackability is a big plus - after all, who has only one pen inked at a time? :-)\u201d Ken Cavers kcavers.blogspot.ca\n\u201cI love the design and concept. Very minimalistic and creative\u201d Mark Anthony - Creator of the LYPEN\nI can manufacture the blocks in Gold, Silver or any other anodised colour. If there is interest in other colours during the campaign I will add other colour options.\nThe Pen Rest is unique because it is stackable.\nEach Pen Rest has a 45mm sill that gently balances your pen in the middle so that it is easily accessible but most importantly can be seen in all its glory.\nThe unique sill on which the pen rests on is recessed slightly to allow for the various diameters often attributable to different designs.\nThe gap between each pen is sufficient to pick up a pen without knocking off the others from the Pen Rest.\nEach Pen Rest is manufactured from the high grade materials available. Our first run will be in aluminium using the latest milling and CNC machining techniques. However, stretch goals include the Pen Rest in Stainless Steel, Copper, and 24K Gold Plate.\nBecause of the weight of each Pen Rest, it can be used as a paper weight, but unusually can be stacked as high as you like.\nEach block contains a unique tongue and groove allowing the interlocking of the blocks, so that the lines flow smoothly together.\n3D print shows interlocking and feasibility 3D print shows interlocking and feasibility The chamfers on its edges give a floating appearance at the bottom and a gentle smoothness to edges removing any risk of scratches to your precious pens.\nI believe that your favourite pens should not end up in a mug, or just tossed to one side on the desk. They deserve better than this.\nThey need a home, naturally accessible and solid enough to not move.\nEvery order will receive a free pen. It has the weight and feel of a quality pen and stylish looks.\nI have been looking at protecting the shelf as some feedback from Pen Bloggers have suggested that some additional protection may be required to prevent any chance of marks to pens.... even though the surface is exceptional smooth and the pen only rests on the outer edges.\nSo every order will receive a soft felt cover for the sill with every block sold \nTimeline\nKickstarter ends In November 2016.\nOrders will be dispatched by 12th December 2016 latest in time for Christmas.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Pen Rest One Plus - Early Bird", "descp": "Early Bird - Get a Single Pen Rest in Midnight Blue or Silver block and receive one top of your choice from Silver, Gold, Midnight Blue or Oxford Blue, you'll receive felt to add that quality finish too... but that's not all !

We are confident that we can bring the Memory pen to market with your support! We love our supporters and value your feedback. You will be helping us to define the end product appearances and its features.  \nWe will be MFi approved with the memory Pen\n  Simply plug in the Memory Pen and start downloading your images and videos.\nRunning out of Memory, don't you hate that? You have an event to go to and want to shoot some memorable images and your device is full of images so you no longer have room. Wouldn't you like a low cost secure portable device that fits in a pocket, backpack and purse to download these images and clear space? We did too, so we created the memory pen in 64 and 128Gb versions for IOS and micro USB devices.\nSee what others are saying! \n\"It's something that business managers and entrepreneurs are going to want immediately\"\n    Journalists, medical record keepers, and especially creative types like writers and photographers, are going to love this new wrinkle in mobile device technology.\u201d\n      John Nadeau interviews Andreas Haase\n  Packaging sample with IOS and micro USB versions\nRaptor Creative has created the Human Technology Products brand name to bring you cool CE products. We value Kickstarter and the feedback it supplies us. We will be using the funds to move the Memory Pen into production for Holiday delivery. We know that your support is important to us and we are ready to deliver. \nIn iOS & micro USB versions\nMemory Pen was designed to give you the customer the ability to down load your image and video files securely and quickly. This results in freed up space on your iOS or Micro USB device.  Our application software is still undergoing some final tweaks so that your files will be secure on the Memory Pen. the Memory pen is a 3 in one device so you don't need to carry too many things. First you have 64 to 128Gb of space to fill, then there is the stylus for using your tablets and touch screen devices and if you ever need to use a ball pen for writing down messages, you have that too!\nMemory Pen with Micro USB for Android Devices.\nWe will be offering the Memory Pen in 4 color selections and 2 connector types. Once in production we will offer more choices going forward.\nRight now you need your support to get this product to market. The tooling is completed and the boards are created. A couple tweaks to the software and we are ready to ship in 60 days.  \nPocket clip with Human Technology Logo\n  Plastic molded parts sample\n  Preparing the tooling for the plastic parts\nOur team is comprised of seasoned award winning industrial designers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, sourcing experts and marketing sales.

Yet one key aspect has been generally ignored: the art of introducing the new data science paradigm to legacy enterprises. This is something that requires far more than just a shift in technology. It also requires a shift in corporate culture, sensibilities, and priorities.\nWritten by leading industry consultant Lars Nielsen, Change Management for Data Science provides proven tools for successfully transforming legacy enterprises into true data-driven environments, and gives managers the vital information they need to avoid common pitfalls in this transition. The book is in the last stages of development under the editorial supervision of Edward Renehan, Managing Director of New Street Communications and longtime Director of Computer Publishing Programs for Macmillan.\nThe book's INTRODUCTION:\nTeamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. - Andrew Carnegie\nIt's not so much that we're afraid of change or so in love with the old ways, but it's that place in between that we fear. \u2026 It's like being between trapezes. It's Linus when his blanket is in the dryer. There's nothing to hold on to. - Marilyn Ferguson, Futurist\nChange is scary. Change is threatening. Change is annoying. Change is work. But change is also exciting, invigorating, renewing, and refreshing. Change is the evolution, growth, and expansion of horizons. Change is the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d of what has gone before to make way for better, smarter techniques, tools, and technologies. New thinking.\nWhat's the biological alternative to evolution? You guessed it. Extinction. Organizational survival means organizational change. And there's no more important business skill than knowing how to innovate and manage this change.\nI've written Change Management for Data Science with the single intention of arming you with the knowledge and tools necessary to introduce the most draconian changes to hit many a workplace in decades: the parallel revolutions of Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics.\nIn an age when information is everything, or very nearly everything, the flood of the constantly-flowing tsunami of of Big Data has drastically redefined the terrain of countless long-accepted business models and organizational practices.\nIt isn't pretty out there. Anciently established roles are being thrown into states of flux, and traditional chains of authority disrupted. Power is changing hands. Veterans feel demeaned, and some become disgruntled. Experience \u2013 once respected \u2013 has become a suspect thing: an artifact from a prior, antique time; a propeller in the era of the jet engine.\nThe literati among us might be reminded of a line from W.B. Yeats: \u201cThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed ...\u201d\nBut the \u201ccentre\u201d can and must hold. Anarchy is not an option.\nIt is key for us to make sure that uncertainty among veterans is minimized, disorder avoided, and the threat of chaos stopped in its tracks. It is essential for us to make sure that new shoes do not unduly step on old toes. And it is vital for us to take a situation ripe with potential for rivalries and transform it into an opportunity for building a more sustainable, effective, and profitable team.\nWe must enable all players to understand and buy into the vision of a data-driven workplace: a workplace where professionals acquire, interpret, and leverage data in order to maximize efficiencies, iterate and create new products and services, and otherwise successfully navigate the emerging and constantly changing competitive landscape.\nIn this effort, we must come to understand the importance of the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of data. Granular and key metrics data, once defined, should be shared by all decision makers in the organization, not just amongst the data science team. The data science team should artfully propose conclusions, but not impose them. Conclusions should be jointly arrived at, and should be the result of merging data science results with the experiential knowledge of line-managers and other key professionals.\nAs well, all appropriate professionals \u2013 not just data scientists \u2013 should be armed with the tools, training, and permissions to make their own queries into the firm's data store, whether this be Hadoop-based or otherwise configured.\nAs you'll see in the following chapters, the importance of cooperation and coordination between traditional and non-traditional players cannot be overemphasized. The most important task we face is to marshal and orchestrate this cooperation and coordination, and make it blossom into productive results for the entire enterprise.\nVince Lombardi once commented: Individual commitment to a group effort \u2013 that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\nThe \u201cQuants\u201d with all their metrics will hold a key position on your new team, but not the only position. It is important that the players in the field respect the work of the pitcher, but equally important that they know the pitcher respects them and understands their role as being vital - especially since several of the outfielders were once pitchers.\nWith that in mind, let us proceed ...\nAbout the Author\nBased in Amsterdam, Lars Nielsen has more than three decades of experience consulting for such firms as IBM, CBS, Amgen, Intel, and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His books include the bestsellers A Simple Introduction to Data Science, What Every Manager Should Know About Data Science, and Computing: A Business History, of which none other than the late Andy Grove (co-founder and longtime Chairman of Intel) said: \"Nielsen provides a most excellent and understandable narrative of a complex history.

This is the YouTube generation, and it's important that communication be clear, concise, and generate a real connection with the viewer. So many blogs are shot and loosely edited together, and they don't have to be. With a prompter that is voice activated (for iOS), or speed controlled (android), video creators can now create more dynamic video with a true eye-to-eye experience.\nAlso, actors often have to do commercial shoots involving a prompter script, as do politicians, priests, and political pundits. It's important to have a device that can record the speaker, while also allowing for prompting. Plus, by sliding the prompter off-center, actors can read left or right of cam, doing video based auditions of lengthy roles.\nWhat if there was a soldier, Sgt. GoodDad, and he wanted to read bedtime stories for his/her child without having the books to carry? He could get the script emailed, and RECORD bedtime stores for his child to watch on Youtube privately. And make that eye-to-eye connection with the camera, when he can't be face to face.\nAn interrotron is a device where two people have a discussion and it is recorded for emotional and psychiatric discussion. Here, you can do a 'facetime' between two mobile devices, while recording the emotional expressions on the laptop. \nShare now please!\n Benefits & Features:\n\u2022 Optical teleprompter glass ensures clarity for the best video quality\n\u2022 Heavy duty weatherproof case protects your Micro 750 during transport\n\u2022 Lighting can be rotated in/out for a dimming effect\n\u2022 Modification ability allows for shooting with DSLR's\n\u2022 Actors can open the rear panel, slide off-center, and shoot web based auditoins.\n\u2022 YouTuber's can create better videos with the same tech from expensive broadcast prompters.\n\u2022 Ports for chargers and/or microphones\n\u2022 Compact size\n\u2022 Works best with iPhone\u00ae/iPad\u00ae but also works with android software.\nWho this is for:\nIf you EVER are going to create an online video, you should back this project. According to YouTube, 1 out of 3 people connected to the internet have uploaded a video to YouTube. Not to mention all the CEO Messages, HR Videos, Acoustic Jams, Priest Sermons, College Entrance Videos, Video Game Blogs, and even Political Candidates.\nFor the Troops:\nWe were hoping that soldiers overseas would read bedtime stories right into the camera, and upload those videos to YouTube so their children back home can have video bedtime stories with eye-to-eye contact. Just drop the story onto a Google Drive, or DropBox, and the script uploads with ease to most mobile prompting software. (Featured here is PromptSmart for iPhone)\nStretch Goal:\nIf we break $60,000 we will include a lens cleaning cloth for the glass. We will also include an additional laser cut 16:9 rear matte-board that can be swapped out for DSLR's. This way you won't have to cover the rear with a black cloth on the DSLR modification, you can just slide the camera up against the cut matte-board in the down position. We will also put some Tompter stickers in the package too, because everyone loves stickers.\nAbout the lighting:\nWe have included two USB 2.0 light sticks that are hooked to a 'Y' cable so you can plug them into most laptops. Some laptops don't have a USB, but that's ok, there is those USB wall plugs, and USB batteries that can power the lights. They are for you to experiment. One idea is to rotate the light inward, effectively blocking some of it (dimming on the fly). So, we encourage you to make your own videos, and share them with Tompter. we would love to see what you created with the Tompter Micro 750! Show us your videos, auditions and more!\nNon-US shipping:\nNon-US shipping is about $90. I wish I could get it lower because I know so many of my fans of my other custom teleprompter products reside in other countries. If I get emails here for a particular country, I don't mind opening it up here for you to back this project! Just understand it's about $90 to ship it. I get a break on two. If I ship two, it's $115... so it's much better to back in pairs.\nNew side design with charging hole:\nNew charging/mic cable hole added to the design!\n  Here is a sample of laser engraving for large orders!\n  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nDisclaimer:\nHardware only.

The only problem is that no-one wants do that.\nThere\u2019s too much money in consulting and selling books about the veneer without ever giving up the actual secret sauce.\n\u201cThis book and video course won\u2019t be like that. In fact, they\u2019ll be very different from that, and probably nothing like what you\u2019re used to. Here\u2019s why: Secret Sauce is not so much a book as it is a tutorial.\nSecret Sauce is a step-by-step, systematic dismantling and dissection of every channel and practice that actually works, laid out one after another. It\u2019s a guide that will handhold you all the way to getting traffic, users, and revenue.\nOur goal with this book and course is that someone who knows absolutely nothing about marketing could sit down, follow the instructions, and make what they\u2019re doing blow up. We\u2019ve done this before - a lot.\nOur combined efforts account for millions of monthly pageviews, millions of social followers, millions of emails, millions of dollars in revenue -- no matter how you slice it, this stuff just works. We\u2019ve tried hundreds of growth hacks in order to give you only the methods we know will work.\nMost everything you\u2019ll read is something anyone can do with a little bit of effort, and which requires very little (or zero) marketing budget.\nBy the time you finish this book, you will not only have a dozen ideas about different strategies that can help your idea succeed, but you\u2019ll know exactly what it takes to implement each one of them.\nAfter you read this book you will be able to sell units of and get users signed up for literally anything.\nWhat you\u2019ll find in the growth hacking playbook works.\nI was on welfare/benefits 3 years ago, and used growth hacking techniques to get millions of visitors to websites I created and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment, and got into the Techstars accelerator. I then launched a growth hacking agency and have used these techniques to move hundreds of thousands of people to websites, and acquire tonnes of users and followers for startups.\nSpeaking in London, England, Winter 2015\nA key change in my life happened a year ago. An accelerator had heard I was a \u201cgrowth hacker\u201d and asked me to give a talk to their current teams. I put together a slide deck of what I considered the basics, and gave a presentation. Halfway through my talk I realised half of the room was taking pages of notes, while the others stared at me in disbelief. The minute my talk finished, founders ran up to me asking for my slides and if I did consulting. I was surprised- I hadn\u2019t seen many people in marketing give talks and presumed you were meant to give practical advice and show people how to do things, pieces of software you can use to automate things, etc. this was not the case. I gave more talks and it\u2019s an incredible feeling how much people find my talks useful. That\u2019s where the idea for this book came from. Give as many people practical, actionable advice and strategies as possible. My growth hacking talk was eventually voted best workshop of SXSW V2V 2015. Earlier this year I gave a 30-date speaking tour of America, and am so excited to get this knowledge out there in full for the first time.\nThis is the first time I\u2019m pulling back the curtain and unveiling my secrets, along with my co-author Austen Allred, who has moved millions of visitors and dollars through growth hacking across every channel from SEO to Pinterest and everything inbetween.\nWhat you\u2019ll discover in Secret Sauce can be used for good or evil. It is very powerful stuff. Right now, only a few people know how to do these things. We\u2019re blowing the whistle on the tactics other people are using, and handing you the tools to do them yourself, and find your secret sauce.\nAnd with that substantial word of warning, we launch our kickstarter. If this book gets funded, it will be available very soon after the Kickstarter ends (like, by the end of June or mid-July at the very latest). We\u2019re not sure what the blowback is going to be as no-one has done a book like this before. If you\u2019ve ever read a marketing book and found it didn\u2019t contain enough specific strategies to try, the growth hacking playbook is for you. If you work in marketing and want to use new techniques to boost your companies brand and get promoted, this book is for you. And if you run your own company, you are going to adore this book.\nSecret Sauce will give you the tools you need to execute growth hacking strategies in a wide range of environments\u2014but I have another goal in sharing it with you. \nAs many have pointed out to me, I could keep this information to myself and make more money from clients- but I truly believe we\u2019re all better off if we share the knowledge and grow our companies together. As such, everyone who donates anything will be invited into a private growth hacking group on Facebook, where we\u2019ll create an ongoing community to help each other with our digital marketing and startup growth problems. I wish there had been a group like this when I was on welfare and starting out on my company three years ago, rather than having to learn it all by trial and error. There\u2019ll be no links or spam in the group, just questions, answers, and discussions from and to the community around this area which has so little useful information. This will make sure that the learning will continue after the campaign ends.\nThose of you who have followed me for a while know that when give a talk, I love to go big\u2014ridiculously big\u2014in offering as much value as possible.\nWe\u2019ve created several different backer reward levels with lots of rewards for each bracket.\nTier 1 \u201cGROWTH HACKER\u201d will receive:\nA digital copy of the seven-part growth hacking book.\n- Entrance to the secret growth hackers\u2019 club on Facebook\n- Thank you page in the book.

The slim, padded carry case makes transporting Pillarhub easy and safe while the simple, sleek design means you can use it with any style of computer and it can fit right alongside your laptop in your carry bag.\nIntroducing Pillarhub\nPillarhub comes with USB 3 and USB C compatibility\nOur Story\nThe Pillarhub team got together over the common frustration of find a truly portable monitor that was slim enough to not add too much extra bulk over the laptop. We were all fed up with fiddling with software or working with half hearted solutions. There was no one product or solution that we could take with us while traveling. After the frustrations cleared, we got our heads together and came up with the following checklist that would make the perfect solution for us:\nIt needs to be light and portable\nIt needed a good screen\nIt needed to run with no power cables (or ability to charge)\nIt needed to fit into my laptop bag\nWith that in mind we got to work and went through a few iterations before settling on a 2 screen system. There was always a fear that the second screen would add too much bulk and would make the product non-viable. We worked with our manufactures to chip away at the weight and slim down the panel until we are now confident that the added bulk is no longer a compromise.\nWe\u2019ve since worked with a dozen manufactures to ensure the high quality of our panels and spend countless hours on the 3D printer prototyping parts to finalize Pillarhub. We believe that the powerless setup was a big leap and we are proud to share the Pillarhub product with the world. Help us spread the word so we can showcase our product to the world.

For those of you who are familiar with large-scale electronic manufacturing(molds, wiring, inputs, etc); there are often overlaps from facilities which produce for multiple brands (e.g. Ho Hai Precision industry (trading as FoxConn) manufacturing for Apple at facilities that are not wholly owned by Apple; thus Ho Hai makes devices for multiple Chinese brands beyond Apple and often phones are using similar if not identical technologies.) This is similar to our case, as we do not have the resources to setup a screen manufacturing facility in China, so contacted many facilities in an effort to find a solution that met our needs; often which have overlap such as using similar tapered design, brightness controls, etc. that will work with our custom 3D stands.)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Product Sketches & Images", "update_content": "WOW!!!

It records their tremors and provides detailed insights about how their activities and diet affect their tremors. \nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram | Website | Press Kit | support@trequant.com\nShare us on Facebook & Twitter\nTrequant helps you to be more confident and aware of your situation, by letting you know how your tremors work. \n Tremors are completely unpredictable, even the slightest change in your mood can cause huge changes in your tremor intensities and you have no control over it. With Trequant you can observe and identify what activities affect your tremors positively or the diet that helps you to reduce your tremors. You can also connect with a community of tremor patients and share your problems, or solutions with the community. You are able to share your tremor intensities and collaborate in friendly challenges that motivate you to perform daily exercises that are beneficial to you as a tremor patient.\nThe graphs visualize how with changed activity i.e increased morning walk and a nap during the work stress John was able to reduce the intensity of his tremors. He has a better understanding of how his activities affect his tremors, now he can choose what helps him. This will help him control his tremors better and be more confident.\n Trequant is collaborating with thehopenet.org to get the donations into the hands of rightful patients so they can benefit from it the most and help align their activities to handle their tremors better.\nTremors are unintentional shaking or trembling of muscles. It is the most common neurological movement disorder and hands are the most commonly affected parts. Other parts of the body include head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. It isn't a life threatening disease but makes life difficult, even the simplest daily tasks become really hard\n Its as simple as it gets, once the watch is paired with the companion application, you're a tap away from recording your tremors.\nTrequant allows tremor patients to easily record the values of their tremor intensities accurately without even thinking about it. It allows you to go about your daily routine doing the tasks you do and records your tremors silently. All you have to do is wear it on your wrist and start recording, and it gathers your tremor intensity based on kinetic vibrations of your tremors. It uses 6 sensors to monitor the movement of your arm. Our proprietary algorithm records the accurate value of the tremor intensity by filtering out normal hand movements. Not just that, the device comes equipped with vibration motor to remind you of your medications.\nTrequant companion application (which can be used both on a mobile or a computer) is an extension of the wearable. The application allows you to record your tremors, or set up medication reminders, and the type of recording you want to do. The application creates detailed insights of your tremors and lets you see for yourself what activities or diets affect your tremors positively. It can let you know if your tremors have been intense throughout the day or not.\nThe design of the wearable has been carefully chosen after numerous iterations along with your feedback. Minimal and strong to make you feel in control, and it saves you from all the weird looks.   \n The mobile application is built keeping you in mind, simple, extremely easy to navigate and great readable design for non-technical people. The application is completely self explanatory, and completely friendly.\nTrequant houses 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscopes, which allows the wearable to accurately determine the vibrations in the body caused by tremors. Isolating the tremor vibration, Trequant determines the detailed amplitude and frequency values which helps define the tremor in numbers to be understood in a more rational way. \nTrequant has been in the works for 2 years now. Let us give you an insight into the different stages:\n We have been working for two years, and in two years we have developed 4 different prototypes of our product. We now have our final prototype and all we need is your support to finish this product and get this into the hands of people.\nTrequant watch was designed to keep it classic so people feel comfortable wearing it in public. Reaching to the final stage required a lot of changes and feedback from product design & manufacturing experts. These are the dimensions of the watch:\nThe watch is is just about the size of a normal watch with double the intelligence. It is suited for both the genders.\n Trequant makes use of the latest technologies available in the market, including:\n6-axis motion sensor to accurately record tremor movements\nVibration motor for medication reminders\nSwiss watch movement to show time\nUltra low power processor and bluetooth low energy for long battery life\nExtra memory to save data for a month \nLithium polymer battery to power for 7 days \nLeather straps for comfortable wear\nAfter discussing the manufacturing with various famous names in the manufacturing sector we have choses PanAsia Solutions http://panasia-inc.com as our partner. They have finalized the dates along with the feasibility reports that certify the manufacturing of Trequant in the given time frame and costs. \nPanAsia specializes in the manufacturing and distribution of the hardware products and the company is behind some of the biggest names in the industry. Panasia Solutions provides us on the ground presence in China. They have 15 years of experience in designing, refining, and producing branded consumer products for sale and distribution in markets throughout the United States, Canada, and the EU.\nAs we anticipated some patients who cant really make use of a watch requested for a bracelet/band that fulfilled the basic purpose. After numerous iterations we present the Trequant Band. We haven't built a prototype for the band yet but based on our previous designs and the technology equipped in the final prototype of the watch we are 110% confident that this would be the final shape, size, battery life and technology of the Band.\nThis band comes in multiple sizes and you'd be able to put it on different body parts, such as your head, thighs etc. We will be introducing multiple attachments for ease of use on any part of your body as a stretch goal. And if we are able to cross the stretch goal the attachments will be given to all the people who have pledged for the band.\nThe technology used in the band is same as the watch, but to avoid  any confusion here is the breakdown: \n-6-axis motion sensor to accurately record tremor movements.\n-Vibration motor for medication reminders.\n-Ultra low power processor and bluetooth low energy for long battery life.\n-Extra memory to save data for a month.\n-Lithium polymer battery to power for 7 days.\nTrequant companion application is a multiple platform application, which means it can be run on your mobile phone, or personal computer both.\nWe understand not everyone has a smartphone and or is able to use one, especially those who suffer from extreme tremors. Trequant can easily be connected with your computer using our usb. \n*Some Laptops come with built-in Bluetooth BLE. You might not need the USB at all, however we are sending out free USBs to everyone who pledges to buy our wearable.\nTrequant Circle, be a part of something bigger the best way to stay connected with the people you love.\nTrequant Circle is an exclusive idea being introduced by Trequant. The purpose of the Trequant circle is to link the people with tremors via a unique chain. Because we believe you are who know the best about you because we believe that in order to find a solution for this problem people need to be encouraged to talk to each other, indulge in collaborative discussions and find answers to their problems including tremor anomalies. With Trequant Circle, people can add their friends, share their tremor stories in complete confidence with each other for discussion or collaborative analysis and motivate with each other with the help of positive competition.\nWith detailed discussions and deals with the manufacturer we have been able to workout our goal and where it has to go.\nBy supporting this project, you are also contributing to the future of Trequant. These funds will help Trequant progress from prototype stage to a power system that is ready for the global market.

You can use \"Pre-Order\" button above (well, it should appear as soon as the project is over).  Or, as an alternative, you can wait for a Kickstarter for Vol.2 of the book; we certainly plan it, and we certainly plan to have \"Vol.1+Vol.2\" option there (though we do not provide any formal guarantees).

After 20 years in the AAA industry, this project is teaching me new things. Even if it was just half as ambitious as it is, it would be a must-have.\"- Matt Pritchard, AAA Industry veteran, developer of RTS games, FPS, Mobile F2P, and IoT devices, author and expert on multiplayer cheating.\nWhat's the Big Idea?\nOne of 20+ illustrations from Vol.1\nThe idea behind this book is to summarize the body of knowledge that already exists on multiplayer games but is not available in one single place. And quite a few of the issues discussed within this series (planned as three volumes 400+ pages each), while known in the industry, have not been published at all (except for maybe in discussion forums). \nProgramming and deploying an MOG is a daunting task, and having a frame of reference is usually quite helpful \u2014 \"hey, those guys have already tried this, and it worked for them.\"\nBy the end of Vol. 1, we'll complete our discussion of the things related to architecting your MOG, and will be ready to start discussing \"Development\" (Vol. 2) and \"Deployment\" (Vol. 3). For more details on what's within the book, see the tentative Table of Contents (it also includes links to all the beta chapters from Vol. 1). \nThis current project is only about Vol. 1, \"Architecture,\" but Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 are already planned (and obviously my enthusiasm about them will get an additional boost when Vol. 1 is successfully funded ;-)). \nWhy Me?\nI really hate to speak about myself, but this is one of those cases where I don't have much choice. So, here it goes (and if you really want further details, you can dig them out of my LinkedIn page).\n20 years ago (damn, I am getting old) I was a co-architect for an electronic stock exchange of a G20 country, and for all practical intents and purposes stock exchanges are just another game genre. The project was fun and, among other things, allowed for real-time trading over the cellphones of that time (those with 9600 baud connection).\nA few years later, I became a chief software architect working for a start-up that quickly grew into a rather large online game with half a million simultaneous players that processed half a billion user transactions per day. The project taught me a damn lot about such different issues as scalability, DB physical layout, server farms, attackers and cheaters of all kinds, and bot fighting \u2014 just to name a few.\nSince then, I have consulted and performed due diligence on several game-related projects. In addition, I've spent quite some time researching the field and discussing related problems and their respective solutions with people from the industry.\nI feel that this puts me in quite a unique position of knowing not only one single game, but a bunch of them, and being able to summarize and generalize my real-world experiences. Oh, and I have been writing for industry journals (and am especially proud of articles in CUJ and C++ Report) since 1998, so the process of typing sentences is not something new for me either.\nSince When Are Rabbits Programming??\nFrom an 2010 article in Overload\nI cannot speak for all of rabbitkind, but this particular hare has gone alongside my writings for quite a while now. He was born as \"No MT Bugs\" Hare in 2010, in an Overload article titled \"Single-Threading: Back to the Future?\"\nTherefore, there is evidence that this particular rabbit has been programming at least since 2010. Yes, he has changed his appearance, but deep inside, he is still the very same bunny with a na\u00efve idea of making programs less buggy. BTW, the character is created by Sergey Gordeev, a guy with many animation awards, known (among other things) for being a director of some of the Animated Mr. Bean series.\nWho Is this Book For?\nThe book is intended for those intermediary developers who want to become senior ones, and for senior developers and up. I expect that the book will also be useful for decision-makers, from PMs all the way up to CEOs \u2014 so if you by any chance know one, please make sure to give her a link to this page ;-). \nOn the other hand, if you are working on your first programming project, this book will probably be too difficult for you. There will be no explanation on what event-driven programming is all about, what the difference is between optimistic locking and pessimistic locking, why you need a source control system, and so on. Instead, there will be discussions on how the concept of futures fits into event-driven programming, when the use of optimistic locking make sense for games, and how to use source control in the presence of unmergeable files. \nIn the same spirit, the book is not intended to be a CD to copy-paste your sample MOG from. Instead, the book aims to help you write your own code that is tailored to your own needs, and tries to advise on the available choices at most of the junctions.\nWhat's the Plan?\nCurrently, the \"beta\" chapters of the Vol.1 are already available on my blog ithare.com. The same \"beta\" posts are also available re-formatted as a single PDF (11.1M, 355 PDF pages; please note that this is NOT how the book is going to look). \nSteps still to complete to bring the \"beta\" draft into the shape of the ready-for-printing Vol.1:\nRestructure Vol.1. Done.\nGo through Vol.1 again, \"harmonizing\" and clarifying things. I expect to add about 30'000 words during this process (give or take). Current progress: ~30% completed, 12'000 words already added. ETA: July 2016. At this point all the backers will get an (MS Word) draft.\nMake another pass through Vol.1, this time is more about self-editing (not that much will need be changed at this stage, I hope). ETA: August 2016. At this point all the backers should get another (MS Word) draft.\nGive it to a professional copyeditor. Cost estimate: $3100 (140'000 words @ $0.022/word). ETA: September 2016. At this point all the backers will get yet another (MS Word) draft. \nGive it to a book design/layout specialist. Cost estimate: $2900 ($500 overall design + 400 pages@$6/page). ETA: October 2016. At this point E-BOOK rewards will be sent out.\nPrint paperbacks with CreateSpace, and get them sent to backers. ETA - November 2016. At this point PAPERBACK rewards will be sent out.\nStart selling Vol.1 on Amazon (planned price is $24.95 for Kindle, and $34.95 for paperback)\nBecome rich and retire to the Bahamas ;-). On second thought - this book probably won't suffice ;-(.\nWhat's Inside?\nPretty much all MOG genres are within the scope of the book, from MMOFPS on one side of the spectrum to social games on the other side \u2014 with stock exchanges and multi-player casino games in between. However, things such as gameplay (including AI), and monetization are intentionally left out. In addition, the areas of physics and 3D graphics are too large by themselves and \u2014 to avoid expanding this into a 10-volume series \u2014 are only discussed very briefly (with pointers to good books on these subjects provided).\nAn excerpt from the tentative full ToC of the Vol.1: \nChapter I. Game Design Document from an MOG Perspective\nChapter II. On Cheating, P2P, and [non-]Authoritative Servers\nChapter III. Protocols\nRTT, Input Lag, and How to Mitigate Them (includes Client-Side Interpolation, Client-Side Prediction, and Lag Compensation)\nGame World States and Reducing Traffic Publishable State, Interest Management, and different Compression techniques)\nPoint-to-Point Communications and Non-Blocking RPCs (including discussion on message queues)\nIDL (includes hints on writing your own IDL compiler)\nChapter IV. DIY vs Re-Use. In Search of Balance\nChapter V. Event-Driven Programming\nClassical Event-Driven Programs\nDeterministic Event-Driven Programs (including benefits such as production post-mortem for both client and server, replay testing, and so on)\nRPC Processing in Event-Driven Programs: from Plain Event Processing to Futures (with lambda call pyramids in between)\nRelation to Actors, Node.js, and Erlang\nChapter VI. Client-Side Architecture\nGraphics (only very basics)\nProgramming Language for Client-Side\nClient-Side Architecture Diagram (based on multiple event-driven objects)\nChapter VII. Server-Side Architecture\nNa\u00efve Architectures\nWeb-Based Architecture (including write-back caching and locking strategies)\nClassical Architecture\nFront-End Servers\nLoad Balancing (including Round-Robin DNS, Server-Side Balancing and Client-Side Random Balancing)\nEternal Linux-vs-Windows Debate\nProgramming Languages for Server-Side\nChapter VIII. Unity 5 vs UE4 vs Photon vs DIY for MOG\nChapter IX. Pre-Coding Checklist: Things Everybody Hates, but Everybody Needs. From Source Control to Coding Guidelines\nChapter IX concludes Vol.1; for the list of the Chapters planned in Vol.2 and Vol.3, see the full tentative ToC.\nSTRETCH GOAL @10K: +50% ILLUSTRATIONS - REACHED!\nAs we have reached our first stretch goal @EUR 8K, it is time to announce our NEXT STRETCH GOAL. If we reach EUR10'000, then we'll ask our illustrator Sergey Gordeev (who is more known for his animation awards and directing Animated Mr Bean) to draw additional 10 or so illustrations for the book, increasing the number of illustrations in Vol. 1 by approximately 50%!\nIn addition, if we reach this goal, it will be our backers who decide on the face of the 'No Bugs' which is used in the book (see options here: http://ithare.com/facelift-for-no-bugs/ ). While we already had a vote on it on the site, results were not conclusive, so (at least for the book) we'll defer to the vote of our Kickstarter backers!\nSTRETCH GOAL @8K: \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL\" EDITION - REACHED!\nAs we're now 100% funded (BIG THANKS TO ALL THE BACKERS!), here comes our STRETCH GOAL (which will become available at reaching the number of EUR8000). If we reach this stretch goal, all the backers will have a choice to have their books/e-books shipped/downloaded either as \"regular\" books, or as \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" books, with the latter only available to Kickstarter backers.\nThese \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" books/e-books will get a new cover (probably with \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" on it), a special \"THANK YOU\" page (and probably a separate ISBN too, though it doesn't really matter). Our illustrator will start working on the Kickstarter cover as soon as we reach this stretch goal, so you will see it sooner rather than later...\nOn \"VIRTUAL PRESENCE\" Consulting\nTwo of the rewards mention \"VIRTUAL PRESENCE\" Consulting. It will be as if I came to your office for the specified number of days. However, I will come not in person, but over Skype or something similar. You will describe your problems to me, and I\u2019ll do my best to advise you on how to solve them. A few notes regarding this:\nHow I use my time during these days is up to you. You tell me your story, I listen; you show me a document, I read it; you ask me for advice, I go offline for some time and come back with the best solution I can think of.\nWith this in mind, it makes sense to ask me questions at the end of one day to get some advice the next day. While technically I am not obligated to think between the days, I am unlikely to be able to keep myself from thinking about a challenging problem ;-)\n100% confidentiality is assured (well, save for somebody hijacking the Skype channel or something).\nPlease do NOT assume that you can hire me at these rates outside of this Kickstarter project. Beyond this Kickstarter project (for which I have special permission) it will need to be done through my employer and, to the best of my knowledge, it is going to be MUCH more expensive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the moment, the project is already at a rather advanced stage.

Prodigious processors concentrated in 14 nm, with an amount of energy consumption of 5 or 6 Watt.\nThe UDOO X86 embedds the newest Arduino\u2122 101, with all the upgrades - including 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope and Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity.\nThe Arduino\u2122-compatible platform onboard is connected with the main processor through an internal USB port.\nIn terms of software UDOO X86 is compatible with the official Arduino\u2122 101 IDE and with all the sketches, tutorials and resources available in the Arduino\u2122 101 community.\nSpeaking of hardware, UDOO X86 has the same pinout layout of Arduino\u2122 101. In other words, UDOO X86 is compatible with all Arduino\u2122 101-compatible shields, sensors and actuators.\nThe board operating voltage and I/O is 3.3V but all pins are also protected against 5V overvoltage.\nWhy is an Arduino\u2122 101-compatible module such a great addition to this board? \nUDOO X86 can be used to program the Arduino\u2122-compatible module directly with the standard Arduino\u2122 IDE.\n  But the ace in the hole of UDOO X86 is the communication between the Intel\u00ae Quad Core processor and the Arduino\u2122-compatible plaform. The interconnection between the two systems is the distinctive feature of UDOO, and this time we have pushed this interaction even further. The board is designed to allow the Arduino\u2122 101-compatible microcontroller to run when the powerful CPU is powered off, and wake it up when something's happened in the world. IoT gets easy. \nUDOO X86 supports a multiboot configuration and boot from everywhere, being even more flexible.\n\nBut what really makes UDOO X86 a true PC is its flexibility, first of all in terms of storage: UDOO X86 mounts 8 GB eMMC on board, a Micro SD card reader as well as SATA, M.2 Key B and USB 3.0 ports to attach your new-generation hard disk.\n\n\nUDOO X86 is also above the standard in terms of software flexibility: on UDOO X86 you can run any x86-compatible OS: Linux\u00ae, Windows\u00ae or Android\u2122.\n\nMoreover, the processors we've chosen are specifically dedicated to the PC domain. \n\n \n\nThe UDOO X86 can connect over Gigabit Ethernet.\n\nMoreover it has an M.2 connector that can connect over Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth Low Energy via an external Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy module, that you'll get if you choose the Performance Kit here on Kickstarter and, once the product is shipped, on sale in our shop.  \n\nIn case you're wondering, you can use any Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module already available on the market.\nNot only this: the Arduino\u2122 101-compatible has its own embedded Bluetooth Low Energy module embedded to seamlessly communicate with wireless sensors, smartphones and tablets.\nNeed some ideas?\nWatch Netflix, Sky Go, Amazon Instant Videos or other streaming platforms in the quiet calm of a fanless Home Theather Personal Computer;\nadd a USB DVB-T2 tuner to turn whatever attached monitor into a Digital Terrestrial Television;\nexploit the HDMI-CEC to allow UDOO X86 connected to your TV through HDMI port to communicate back-and-forth with your TV and thus, to control UDOO X86 through your remote control;\nuse your mobile phone or any RC5 IR-enabled remote control.\n\nAll the retrogaming old glories fits in your pocket. \nUse UDOO X86 also as a Steam\u00a9 in-home streaming machine for your main Steam\u00a9-machine: you can play in a different room or even remotely over 7,500 videogames!\nPower to the gamers!\n  UDOO X86 is Home PC  \nSurf the web. Check your email. Edit your holiday pictures on Photoshop. Update your Facebook status. Write a novel with Microsoft\u00ae Word\u00ae. Read the newspaper. \nStill need a netbook?\nFinally comes a fast compiling board, so to let you experiment also when you're short on time - at hackathons or in class - a board which is compatible with all the resources for the PC and Arduino\u2122 world, well-documented and supported by an open source community: you won\u2019t ever feel alone as a teacher.\nConsidering its compatibility with Arduino\u2122 and the gargantuan amount of resources for the PC world, no other single board computer is supported as much.\nNeed even more power?

As more mosquitoes lay their eggs, the pheromone concentration increases and this specific location become more attractive to other mosquitoes.\nHow Does It Work?\nWe have created a proprietary mixture, based on the mosquitoes-friendly swamps of Southern Louisiana, which is already attractive to mosquitoes. When you set the trap, you include this liquid which will entice the mosquitoes in your environment to lay their eggs there. This is when the magic happens\u2026\nMosquitoes lay their eggs, and while doing so release their pheromone into the liquid to signal to other mosquitoes this is a safe place. \n Every three to five days, you drain the liquid, discard the filter and the eggs, and put the liquid back in the trap. As more mosquitoes lay their eggs, the pheromone content in the solution (fluid) increases, making your trap the most popular place for female mosquitoes.\nSoon, your trap has the highest concentration of pheromone in your environment, and the vast majority of the mosquitoes lay their eggs it\u2026 \u2026 and get discarded as well. Leaving you without mosquitoes!\nThe Trap\nThe trap is sturdy, made of metal (aluminum or copper) and decorative. \nThe trap is about 12\" high, with a cap about 6\" high. It is highly durable and will last for years.\nIt's shipped with a quart (liter) of the starting breeder liquid to attract mosquitoes, and a year-long supply of filters to replace every 3-5 days.\nPerfect for Gardeners and People Who Care about Their Enviroment\nThe ideal person to use this is someone with a yard or garden, and who takes care of it regularly.

Standalone server.\nVery powerful and flexible, indeed! But \u2026\nWhat happens if someone steals your NAS disks, your SD card, or your USB drive? \nWhat happens if someone sniffs the sensors' or actuators' communication lines and steals your telemetry? \nCan you afford to expose your data? Or \u2026\nWorst-case scenario: since RBPi is easily available, all your products can be replicated by your competitor.  \nEven worse: what if a system mimics one of your authorized machines? (Man in the Middle attack).\n\u2026 Can you afford to lose your business?\nWe want strong security, so we cannot rely on software-generated keys/certificates because they do not use true random generated numbers. At the same time, this strong protection system must not overload RBPi's processor, nor collapse its OS.\nWe're proud to introduce PiSec, the best security solution to your Rasbpberry Pi (and all devices with a SPI bus).\nRBPi + PiSec = 360\u00ba security\nPiSec is a hardware solution. No previous experience on security is required and you don\u2019t need to study complex security algorithms or write long pieces of code. All you need to do to secure your RBPi-based system is to plug PiSec on it.\n\nReduced development costs and faster time to market!\nPiSec features:\nPiSec features:\nA True Random Number Generator (TRNG).

Please scroll down to find out the details.\n========================================\nIntroducing the QooPow\u2122 qualMeter\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter is a revolutionary, smart and cost-efficient DIY device, which can simply help you to diagnostic and get to know the quality of your USB cables and chargers in a glance without any technical background. \nWith qualMeter around, you will never need to worry about on getting wrong cables and chargers for your precious smartphone or tablet.\nSpecial rewards exclusively for BackerClub's Members only!\nqualMeter handles wide range of mainstream USB charging cables. It also tests loading capability of the 5v chargers to roughly define their quality.\nOur motivation for creating the QooPow\u2122 qualMeter was from the observation that there are too many low quality and compromised charging products in the market, especially 3rd-party charging cables and chargers. There is lacking of an easy and simple way to measure the quality of charging cables and chargers for people.\nIn our daily life, USB cables and chargers are playing big role of mobile device charging, therefore their quality is critical for the charging. Low quality charging cables and chargers could cause serious damage on your mobile devices or might even burn down your house. You can easily find tons of images, videos and stories by simply search Google and YouTube with keywords like charging cable burning, charger on fire etc. \nGoogle Search Screen Shot about \"charging cable burning \"\nWell, a burning or something on fire is very obvious to us to catch. The question is how can we find it out before it burns? or even before we buy it?\nFurthermore, there are also other important but hidden impacts that most of people wouldn\u2019t know in a easy way such as slow charging, strange behaviors on smart phone when charging, dropping data transfer and so on. The following Tip would give you some ideas about how a low quality charging cable will cause slow charging.\nTech Tips:\nWondering why is your charging so slow? A non-qualified charging cable could have a dramatic voltage drop. For example, if your charging cable's impedance is 500m\u03a9, which many low quality cables do. It will have 0.5v drop @1A charging current, that means you will only get 4.5v at the phone end when your charger provides 5v for charging. Most of smart phones won't even charge in this case. That explains a lot of charging issues we have.\nA Low Quality Cable at Charging\nIn addition, the charging current is now getting higher and higher due to massive application of smart devices. Many devices are charged at 2A or above such as pads and tablets etc. The quality of charging cable has become critical nowadays. Take the given example above, it will have 1v dropping if you are charging at 2A current which leads to only 4v to the device end. Beside the safety issue you may have, there will be certainly no charging at this low voltage for smart devices.\nFYI, Check out this USB charging cable review video from YouTube: \uff08in case if you are not able to watch here, here is the link: https://youtu.be/doMHmGatyYc\uff09\nUnfortunately, like the above video, to evaluate the performance of the charging cable and charger is not really an easy task for most of non-tech people or even sometimes for tech people. It requires not only some electronic knowledge but also needs expensive testing equipment. People find it's very hard to deal with all different kind of massive charging products.\nNow, with qualMeter, we\u2019ll be able to make differences. It is a revolutionary product that allows everyone to have the easiest and smarter way to rule the charging.\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter was initially made for our own lab demanding as we are developing smart and fast charging products for mobile devices. The purpose of making such tool was based on the situation that we needed to roughly measure the different qualities of the cables/chargers and their impact on our products\u2019 performance. \nWith qualMeter, we are able to easily category the pile of cables and chargers without complicated reading and analyzing. When some of our friends were showing their great interests in this little device, we started to realize that it could benefit others. So we decided to take qualMeter to Kickstarter and to share with you.\nPart of qualMeter's testing environment\nOne of our friends, Rebecca, was suspecting on one of her new bought charging cables, which always felt hot when charging. We gave Rebecca one of our qualMeter prototypes for testing. By using the qualMeter, she was able to find out this cable was in a bad condition before the wire burns on fire. She then checked rest of her cables and chargers, and was able to eliminate 2 other bad cables and 1 bad charger. The next day, Rebecca went shopping. With a little help from qualMeter she bought 3 good cables in a decent price. The businessman was shocked to see her using qualMeter and even asked her where to get one. Lol~ Rebecca was extremely happy with qualMeter, because she's smarter. \nWhat makes the qualMeter so unique is it comes along with a simple idea that everyone can measure the quality of random cable/charger in a simple way, an affordable way. It intends to provide an easy and simple solution in a fairly low cost. \nqualMeter is designed for non-tech people but can certainly be used by tech-savvies for roughly testing as well.\nWho needs QooPow\u2122 qualMeter?\nIf you\u2026\nAre unsure about the quality of your USB cable & charger;\nAre looking for safe and faster charging; \nDon\u2019t want to be cheated by those unscrupulous businessmen; \nAre tired with poor quality of charging cables and chargers; \nHave ever been in dilemma of choosing right USB cable/charger; \nAre dealing with USB cables/chargers as a business; \nWanted to have easier and simpler solution to rank the pile of cables/chargers; \nMore...\nThe Features of QooPow\u2122 qualMeter?\nqualMeter is basically made for testing USB charging cables and chargers. It has two major functions:\nCable Test Mode - Simply connect both ends of your USB charging cable with qualMeter and plug it into any 5v USB charging port. You can read the LED indicators to have an idea about the quality of your charging cable.\nCharger Test Mode - Simply plug qualMeter into any 5v USB charging port. You can read the LED indicators to have an idea about the quality of your USB Charger.\nqualMeter has embedded an ultra low power Micro-Processor, a brain, to provide the ability of being smart. Beside its main Cable Test and Charger Test features, it also comes with the following highlighted features:\nCable Shielded Test \u2013 A shielded cable usually has better quality. It\u2019s not only good for charging but also a benefit for data transferring.\n==========\u21ca\u21ca\u21ca New Added Function \u21ca\u21ca\u21ca==========\nCable Short Circuit Test - When you plug qualMeter at Cable Test Mode, the red LED indicator will start flashing If your cable is shorted. You should stop using this cable immediately!\n==========\u21c8\u21c8\u21c8 New Added Function \u21c8\u21c8\u21c8==========\nReversible USB plug \u2013 With the reversible USB plug design, you don\u2019t have to worried about the direction of plugging into a USB charging port. \nPLAY\n\nPlug n Play \u2013 qualMeter comes with no switch or any control button. There is no manual operation needed to be done. It works automatically according to the status it detects.\nHow does QooPow\u2122 qualMeter work?\nqualMeter is designed to provide a simple and straightforward way to test cable and charger without any technical background. That means with qualMeter in hand, everyone is able to distinguish the quality of a cable or a charger.\nSimply connect the cable you are willing to test into corresponding ports as following diagram.\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter has two main testing modes, cable test and charger test. It automatically switches between two modes.\nCharger Test Mode: Without cable plugged in, Charger test mode is enabled right away when qualMeter has been plugged into an USB power source. The orange charger test indicator lights up and it also confirms the testing current is 1A. You can find out the quality of this charger at 1A output by reading the Quality Indicators on the left.\nPLAY\n\nCable Test Mode: Cable test mode will be enabled when both ends of a cable have been connected with qualMeter. Then plug qualMeter into an USB power source. The blue cable test indicator (the left one) will be turned on. You can find out the quality of this cable by reading the Quality Indicators on the left.\nPLAY\n\nShielded Indication: At the Cable Test mode, if the blue Shielded Indicator (the right one) lights up, it means this cable is shielded.\nPLAY\n\n==========\u21ca\u21ca\u21ca New Added Function \u21ca\u21ca\u21ca==========\nCable Short Circuit Test - is as simple as other functions. Just plug both ends of the cable into qualMeter as usual, then plug qualMeter into any 5v USB port. The red LED indicator will start flashing If your cable is shorted. Otherwise, if the cable is not shorted, the qualMeter will automatically start the Cable Test mode to tell you how good is this cable. That\u2019s it ! :)\nPLAY\n\n==========\u21c8\u21c8\u21c8 New Added Function \u21c8\u21c8\u21c8==========\nHow to read the testing results?\nUnlike regular testing devices, there are no numbers bother to read, no buttons, no extra operations, no calculations and no technical background are needed. All you need to know is just colors, the Green, Yellow and Red, which correspond to Good, Fair(OK) and Bad. That\u2019s it! \nYou see colors; you see the quality of your cable and charger.\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter is suitable for wide range of mainstream cables and is compatible with most of major 5v USB chargers.\nSpecifications\nMain Material\uff1aRaw PCB (CCL FR-4) Pb free\nDimension: 47.8mm x 23.8mm x 11mm (the length of the USB plug is not included)\nPower Input: USB Type A reversible Male Connector\nInput Voltage: 4.5~5.5v\nCable Test Connectors: USB Type A Female Connector, 4 types of mainstream charging connectors such as Micro-USB, Mini-USB and others.\nCharger Test Current: @1A\nLED Indicators: Green x2, Yellow x2, Red x2, Blue x2 and Orange x1  \nThe Rewards for qualMeter\nIf you are interested in getting extra USB charging cables proved by qualMeter, please visit our online shop at www.qoopow.com. Thank You!\nThe Stretch Goals\nThe CAD$50,000 stretch goal (Fulfilled!)\nWe have also come up an idea to develop a more advanced version qualMeter X. It provides more advanced Charger Test function by allowing 1A/1.5A/2A/2.5A/3A output testing and an Output Compensation indicator, which can cover almost all major USB chargers. If you think you\u2019d like to support us to continue on developing the qualMeter X please help us to reach the CAD$50,000 stretch goal. \nThe pledge option for qualMeter X will be available when the CAD$50,000 stretch goal has been reached.\nWE'VE MADE IT! REMARKABLE! \n$50K CAD stretch goal is behind us!\nGet ready to upgrade your qualMeter to qualMeter X?\nHere are the list of the upgrades which will be brought to you with NEW qualMeter X :\nAll functions from qualMeter; \n2x USB Type-C ports are now added (which you are all asking for :)); \nAdvanced Cable Test Mode, @1A/2A; \nAdvanced Charger Test Mode, Full range 1~3.1A (100mA step) Current testing; \nAdjustable Electronic Load;\nOutput Compensation Indication; \n32-bit 48MHz MCU;\nFlash memory for saving the last testing result;\nControl Switch\nFuture Function Extension.\nWe have brought much more than it was expected! \nThe qualMeter X is about 1/3 bigger compare to qualMeter.\nAnd here is the way how we can upgrade your qualMeter to qualMeter X.\nHere is a simple chart to tell you how to upgrade by saving you some time.\nPlease be aware, The upgrade price doesn't apply to the extra qualMeter. If you have pledged extra qualMeter and wanted to upgrade to X version at the same time, you could either drop it to get the Extra qualMeter X reward or jump to the X Angel's Dual Pack.\nHow to use qualMeter X?\nSame as qualMeter, the X version is also simple to use.\nWhen will the qualMeter X be shipped?\nTo be honest, we only have a rough idea for now since qualMeter X wasn't part of our development and production plan at the beginning. The development has just started. We are currently working on the first PCBA layout. The embedded programing, tooling, material and other related sourcing are very different with qualMeter.\nGeneral speaking it will be at least 2 months later after qualMeter has been shipped. However, we are going to try our best to make it happen as fast as we can without compromising the quality. We should have a clear idea on the delivery time for qualMeter X by May.\nThe CAD$80,000 stretch goal\nAs you know qualMeter came from lab usage, it might not look pretty for now. We decided not to put a plastic shell for it to lower down the total cost since the industrial design and plastic molding are expensive. However, we have made efforts to make sure it's durable and safe to use. We do think the style of current looking is raw and tech-ish, kind of nice. :) \nIf you think you'd like to have a plastic shelled version of QooPow\u2122 qualMeter please help us to reach the CAD$80,000 stretch goal. Then we will be able to hire an industrial design team and to make moldings. \nIf you have other ideas, we'd really love to hearing from you!\nWhere are we at in development?\nqualMeter Prototypes, PCBs and some Development Tools\nAt the current point, we have the latest PCB version on hand. Intensive testing is coming to the end, and we are ready to turn it into mass production version. The outline is pretty much firmed though there might be a few slight adjustments to be done on PCB. We are approaching the moment when the capable manufacturer should be involved. We are working with our partners in manufacturing and supply chain and will continue push forward while Kickstarter campaign is going on.\nThe latest qualMeter prototype is ready for mass production.\nThe Schedule\nWho are we?\nIntelliplus is a creative tech start-up formed in 2013, who is focusing on Smart-Ware development. Our vision is to Make Life Easier & Simpler. Currently our main development team is based in Chengdu, China. Chengdu is one of the biggest cities in western china. With her over 2,500 years of historical and humanistic culture, Chengdu is also well known as the cradle of China IT industry. And our manufacturing partners are mainly located in Shenzhen, China, where is the world's IT manufacturing center.\nWe have been contracting and working with one of the top Internet Companies in China and helping them to build fast charging products under their own brand since 2014. By going deeper and gaining more knowledge on the fast charging technologies, we think it\u2019s time to launch our own smart charging products and brand - The QooPow\u2122 series.\nOn our mind, charging is one of the things that should be peaceful and joyful like art. It should be a part of our quality life. Despite there are plenty of charging related products in the market, few of them can stand out. In fact, there are too many low quality and compromised products.People deserve better charging products!\nWe believe we can do better! And here we go.\nBy launching the QooPow\u2122 qualMeter with the excitement, we are proud that we have made it and will continue to do so. Other QooPow\u2122 series smart charging products are in the line of development, more to come.\nThe Core Team\nWhat you can help us? \nOur efforts over the past two years on smart and fast charging technologies have helped to bring qualMeter onto Kickstarter stage where you are connected to participate. A journey we have started to Make Life Easier and Simpler, and to free our mind to make our world a better place! \nqualMeter is our ice breaker to the world. And now, we are heading to mass production and turn our idea into real products! \nThank you!

The CowTech Ciclop is a RepRap 3D scanner with a large scan volume, simple, yet elegant design, and a disruptive price point that blows any other laser scanner out of the water. The user prints the plastic parts on their own printer in any color and resolution they choose, and can assemble the scanner in less than 30 minutes. Then, simply take any object you want to replicate, set it on the 200mm laser cut acrylic turntable, and start scanning. We wanted to make sure our product was usable for anyone who owns a 3D printer, so we meticulously designed  our parts for a print bed volume of only 115mm x 110mm x 65mm (4.5 x 4.3 x 2.6in) so they can be produced on even the smallest of printers. \nLaser scanners are a very common type of 3D scanner that use a pair of line lasers that flash in succession in combination with a camera and a rotating turntable. As the lines flash on the object, they trace the outline of the object in red light. The camera then picks up the location of the laser lines in 3D space, converting those lines into hundreds of thousands of points, and as the turntable rotates, every side of the object is scanned into a cloud of points, which can then be stitched together to form a mesh that replicates the surface of the object with up to 0.5mm precision. \n3D printed model, scanned on the CT Ciclop. Print resolution 0.2mm, PLA, on a Prusa i3 (Horizonal banding due to poor printer quality)\nOverhead view. 0.2mm, PLA, Prusa i3.\nThe CT Ciclop retains a high degree of precision, even after printing on our entry level 3D printer.\n.stl File ready to print in Cura alongside the cross-section of the 3D mesh in CloudCompare\nOur scanner was born out of the BQ Ciclop, an open source scanner using the same design and software as our scanner. We kept all the same basic functionality as the original BQ, but redesigned the scanner from the ground up, making several significant changes and adding many features.\nFirst, we were able to slash prices by designing our own Arduino shield, using a more logical turntable bearing, purchasing our own laser cutter for the acrylic parts, and importing many of our components from reputable manufacturers overseas. We designed our printed parts to use significantly less filament and half the print time of the BQ version. Furthermore, we decreased the minimum bed size of the printer needed to print the parts to a measly 115mm(L) x 110mm(W) x 65mm(H) (4.5in x 4.3in x 2.6in), from a 6x9x3 required on the original. We focused a great deal of energy on aesthetic improvement as well, replacing the ugly and unwieldy threaded rod with sleek laser cut acrylic, adding a magnetic back cover to access the electronics, and an internal LED glow to make the scanner stand out in any environment.\nThe CT Ciclop scanner is a fully open source Rep Rap project, and all details will be released after the campaign is concluded. \nThe term 3D scanner is a bit of a misnomer. Technically, most 3D scanners are actually point cloud generators. The scanner itself is a tool to make a .PLY file, or a point cloud, made up of hundreds of thousands of points that represent the geometry of the object. The typical user will want to convert this point cloud to an .STL file, which can easily be printed on a 3D printer. Once you have a digital 3D file of the part, the possibilities are endless. The CowTech Ciclop uses Horus, software developed by BQ for their version of the scanner. Unfortunately, Horus doesn't support .STL exports at this time, but this feature may be developed in later versions of the program. Fortunately, there are many options for post processing programs that can stitch the point clouds together into a printable file. These include Meshlab, Cloudcompare, Netfabb, Blender, and more. We recommend Meshlab and Cloudcompare, and will provide detailed documentation with the scanner on how to use these programs. \nLimitations\nAll laser scanners can struggle with objects that are very black, very shiny, or furry, as the laser doesn't register properly with the camera. The CowTech Ciclop, like the BQ version, is designed for experienced users who can familiarize themselves with different software programs in order to use the scanner and get high quality outputs from it. \nWe like to think of a 3D scanner like a video camera. A nice camera gives you the tools to take great pictures and videos, but without post production work in a video editing or photo editing program, you will likely be disappointed in the end result. \nYou want a scanner?

While we took different paths in college, life led us both back home to our respective family farms, and we formed a logical partnership, designing products together in the winter time when the farming workload is significantly reduced. We have both been designing logical products for use in farming and ranching our entire lives, and while 3D scanning was a new field for both of us, design and fabrication is certainly not.\nJason Smith received a BA in engineering from Harvard in the spring of 2015. His first foray into entrepreneurship and Kickstarter came when he invented a music responsive LED light show with his roommate in an introductory electrical engineering class. After a summer internship with Salt Lake City based company Power Practical, which has launched 5 successful Kickstarter campaigns totaling over $1.1M, he launched Rayger with his roommate ( www.raygerlights.com), bringing in nearly $25,000, earning a Kickstarter Staff Pick (now \"Project We Love\"), and delivering over 90% of the rewards 2 months ahead of schedule. When he isn\u2019t working on product development, he takes care of 500 black angus cows on his family ranch.

However, the experience of a previous campaign has taught us a lot about many of the issues. By building several working prototypes using sample parts from the same manufacturers we will order our production run from, we are confident in the quality of our components as well as the speed and reliability of our manufacturers. We have even used several of the manufacturers before to provide components for our first campaign.\n \nThe most likely issue we foresee is a delay in shipment. This is an issue that plagues many Kickstarter campaigns, and can be challenging to avoid if even just a few small things go wrong. We have tried to mitigate this issue by doing most of the legwork of part sourcing ahead of time, and listing a realistic delivery date on the rewards rather than an optimistic one.

The quality of the reflection (hologram) is one of the bes,t as the clear panels are made out of the thinnest possible plastic, yet can hold up to 5lb of pressure when fully assembled.\nHolapex LIGHT: This hologram pyramid measures 4 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. The Holapex LIGHT was designed to fit most smartphone/IPhone screen sizes 4\"-6\" inches.When assembled it can take up to 3lbs of pressure.\nHolapex VIVID: The Holapex VIVID was designed to work with tablet/IPads 7\"-12\" inch displays. It measures about 6 inches wide and 3 inches tall. When assembled it can take up to 5lbs of pressure.\nParts: Both Holapex Pyramids come as parts and can easily be assembles. Each pyramid comes with the following parts:\n1 X Matte Black Hat/Cover with model of Pyramid printed in white (VIVID or LIGHT)\n4 X Clear reflectors made out of PET Flexible plastic.\n1 X Matte Black Base/Feet made out of Acrylic.\nAfter producing many prototypes, with different materials, angles, sizes, and colors, we improved every part of the pyramid, provided best angle for best reflection, best color for pyramid, and best materials for each part.\nThe clear panels come with a protective plastic on each side, to protect it from any scratches when shipped. The material used for these panels is a PET Plastic material that is flexible and will not break. The panels are made out of the thinner possible PET plastic to give the best hologram effect with the least to none double blurr reflection.   Each panel comes with male or female connectors, that allow you to easily assemble all 4 sides into the shape of the pyramid. Then easily place the hat over the top of the pyramid and the base on the lower area. Keep in mind, the hat and the base are just optional, and are not needed to use the Hologram properly.\nHow does the Hologram Pyramid work?\nThe pyramid reflects whatever is being displayed on your device, giving it a hologram effect. It's simple technology, but here is a picture to better illustrate how it works.\nCan you use any picture or video with the Holapex Pyramids?\nYes! Although there are hundreds of videos on youtube that you can use with your Holapex pyramid, we decided to make an app for Android and IOS devices!\nThe app is called \"Holapex\" and is ready for download and use! The app allows you to select any videos or pictures from your gallery, and automatically converts it into a 4 sided video or picture, that you can use with your Holapex pyramids!

Now, he's making it his mission to help other parents inspire their kids to get more involved. He says the number one issue is that we don't provide kids with enough context around why they should learn computer science.\n \u201cIt was impossible. I simply could not get the buy-in amongst my kids. They refused to willingly spend time on it no matter how much I incentivized it. It was too intangible for them.\u201d\nAuthor and creator, Franchino is the a real world computer programmer and designer\n\nEventually he discovered the reasons why they were reluctant:\nIt felt like more school work to them. It wasn\u2019t as cool to them as it was to their father\nThe digital natives were more interested in playing traditional video games and sports\nHis kids had no context of why they should spend time studying computer science. The benefits and opportunity were not clear to them\nA programmer, HCI designer and user researcher by trade, Franchino quickly saw the opportunity in this crisis. He began asking other parents what their views were on the matter and found that most parents had similar goals and frustrations, with no solution at hand.\n\u201cThese kids were practically born with iPhones and tablets in their hands.

They take technology for granted.\u201d\nFranchino's three children are digital natives\nFranchino isn\u2019t just talking about learning to code apps either. He\u2019s talking about ECE, an emerging field that bundles electrical engineering, computer sciences, the internet of things and more.\n\u201cToday you can put your skin cells on a chip and analyze them with a Pi. You can remote control a live beetle with diodes and some code. There will be 50 billion IoT objects online by 2020. Even your soccer ball will soon have a MEMS chip and a tiny wifi module that can tell your phone how much force or spin you kicked the ball with. I wan to start educating kids early on about the future of ECE by way of story telling.\u201d\nLast year, Franchino quit his job and developed this graphic novel so he could share his experience and ignite students\u2019 passions for designing and building their own projects. \u201cI began authoring parts of a graphic novel illustrating the life of a young hacker using the likeness of my oldest son, Frankie Jr. I like to think I combined lots of action with real world hacks and technology. Every chip, hardware part, code snippet and brand in the book is real, nothing is masked.\u201d\nFranchino found success in doing this and his kids are now eager to learn on their own and are fascinated with hacking and hardware. \u201cI\u2019ve given the materials to other parents and the results are in, this definitely could work.\u201d\nFranchino and John Richard have been working on The Boy & the Computer since April 2015\n Much progress has already been made!\nThe first draft of the graphic novel was tested amongst a controlled group of 15 students in August of 2015\nOpening scene of the main character, Gou, as he sets his on the Raspberry Pi for the first time.\n\nWorld leaders express their views on why kids should get started earlier.\nPLAY\n\nFranchino explains some of the philosophy behind why he started his company\nFranchino uses inspiration from his personal career to illuminate the politics in the tech and startup industry.\nMany of the characters are real people Franchino has worked with. Practically every cast member will teach you about computer science.\nFranchino has even used his own children as models that represent typical American household behaviors.\nUnlike other tech inspired comic books and graphic novels, The Boy and the Computer does not mask brands or concepts with fake alternatives\n\nEarlier character sheets profiling real world industry professionals, hackers, designers and prodigies to understand their reactions, expressions and thought process. All of these people will come together to teach the reader important lessons, give clues and help the reader memorize important concepts which could make the difference in real life.\n\nHere are some early examples of our sketches:\nHere is Gou, the main character. You can get a sense for his intellectual capacity by the faces he makes and his reactions to people and his environment.\nHere is Gou's father who's been discouraged from the technology industry by local entrepreneurial, disparaging zealots Chad and Deric\nTara is Gou's crush although older and extremely mischevious, she is one of the only characters who is not a hacker or technology industry type\nDr. Winslow is one of Gou's many advisors. Gou meets with Dr. Winslow at the University of Chicago to be inspired\nLadybug is an MIT hardware hacker who plays hard to get with Gou and is reluctant to help him for a variety of reasons.\nThe Rabbi in many cases, helps Gou understand the gravity of many situations and uses analogies from the Torah to guide Gou\nN\u014dn, Gou's brother is an athlete. Each cast member supports Gou in a unique way.\n TSHIRTS!!!!!\nThe Node, a small computer that Gou builds along with the reader, is called the Node.\nWhat's a function?\nHardware hacker\nOur timeline is simple, we don't want to overcomplicate it.

It allows Users that have no knowledge of any Software languages or methods to create sophisticated and complex Programs in a fraction of the time of contemporary methods using only their High School knowledge and problem-solving skills.\nIt took 5 years to find the answer to the long-standing question: \"How do you bring the power of software creation to all educated persons?\" and then 5 years to write the Software \"Code\" with contemporary methods and tools.\nAOS creates a code-less Environment for the User that is based solely on the academics of Information usage that we all learned by the time we left High School. It is based on the foundation of Humankind's knowledge - Algebra, Mathematics and Informational Solutions but extends beyond just numbers as do all Software Development Tools to work on Text, Time, Logic, Pictures, Audios, and Videos (the 7 Universal Data Types).\nAOS creates a bubble around the User/Programmer. Outside of the bubble are horribly complex constructs like the TCPIP Protocol which requires a 3 Volume Set of books to describe how to move Information around the planet. Inside the bubble is the User/Programmer, their Informational need (which never has anything to do with the box), their High School knowledge, and a clear idea of how to work their problem through Mathematics and Grammar.\nThe bubble around the public should have been the first thing accomplished by the original creators of software technology at Bell Laboratories back in the late 70's. The hardware technology could then change anyway it needed without affecting the interface to the public. But it never happened - until now.\nThe toolkit we use to figure out anything Informational (it's all informational) is really, really tiny but powerful beyond words in how we put that simple set together in complex ways.\nAOS is in essence all of the fundamental Information manipulating capabilities that software professional have sitting down to the most prominent tool for making Windows programs. Therefore, there is no piece of Information you cannot work with and no Answer you cannot produce if it's pure Information you are after (vs entertainment or something related to the operation of the computer).\nThe System at present is in Alpha stage.

A BranchLibrary extends the security outward allowing ClientComputers to connect to different branches in TheTree.\nSentience Inc does not support the policy of charging more to businesses just because they have deeper pockets. We do not support the policy of disguising updates as Versions to get more revenue.\nAOS is Licensed to the public for $5/mo per license regardless of business or individual to be affordable to all persons who need assistance with their Informational life. A free version will always be available to the public so that Programs made in AOS can be used by anyone. Customers can license their creations if they so desire because AOS was designed to support User Licensing. This opens the door for the truly great problem-solvers out there to make money with their intellectual abilities.\nFor security, all AOS Licenses are renewed every month. The software makes this transparent to the customer if they so desire without financial info being retained otherwise AOS is renewable with a button click each month. The software monitors the renewal process and completes it.\nSentience Inc needs a small staff of Software Engineers to cleanup and support AOS to bring it to the Licensing stage. AOS will then be ready to assist any organization on a global scale. Mobile usage is incredibly important now with the way most people stay connected. The Applications we make in Windows Desktop need to be usable on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone to be truly available to us as the creators and users.\nA minimum of 3 full time Software Professionals and an office for them to work in for the next year will cover the cleanup of AOS, Licensing startup, and entry into the mobile computing environment.\nThe future of AOS with your gracious help and support:\nadopt Linux, own it, improve it, then marry it with AOS and be the only OS on the machine: ALUX (AOS on Linux)  for $5/mo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest difficulty to producing a powerful and useful software product is not in whether or not you can solve the problem but rather how well will it operate in its environment.\n\nAOS handles everything computer to support the Programmer and therefore represents a significant time-based overhead.

Compounding the problem, many sites refer to older versions of Rust that used different syntax. Instead of wasting time trying to find the information you need in the current syntax wouldn't it be better to have a single source of information on Rust? \nRust is a melting pot for ideas from diverse languages:\nTraits: Very similar to typeclasses in Haskell\nStack and Heap memory allocation: From the land of C/C++\nPattern Matching: Common in functional programming languages\nIterators: Mundane in Object Oriented Programming\nAlgebraic Datatypes: A powerful feature from functional programming\nChannels: A dataflow concept that originated in Communicating Sequential Processes by Tony Hoare\nAdditionally, these topics are unique to Rust:\nDynamically Sized Types (DST)\nTrait Objects\nObject Safety\nClosure/Function Traits\nMultiple Pointer Types (Box, Rc, Arc, Cell...)\nDepending on your background you may have experience with some of these concepts but to be proficient with Rust you need to understand all of them. The official documentation does not explain all of these concepts in detail.\nProposed Contents\nThis book investigates topics that are only briefly introduced in the official documentation\nThe following is a preliminary list of topics I feel are important to understand but are not explained in detail in any single source of information. The basics of the language can be learned from the rust-lang.org site so this information will assume you have read the official documentation but want more.\nThese topics will be covered in detail using code examples and just enough theory so you thoroughly understand them.\nTraits and Multidispatch\nDynamically Sized Types (DST)\nTrait Objects\nObject Safety\nAssociated Types\nAlgebraic Datatypes ('struct' and 'enum' types)\nOwnership, Borrowing and Lifetimes\nHigher-Ranked Lifetimes\nPattern Matching ('match' keyword)\nStack/Heap Memory\nPointers\nUnboxed Closures and Function Traits\nBackers will have access to draft chapters.\nTarget Audience\nThis book is intended for those who already have experience in at least one programming language and have read through the documentation on the Rust website.\nDepending on your experience, some topics may cover information you already know or be completely new to you.\nYour background can be in C/C++ or Java/C# or Python/Javascript or Haskell/Scala... it doesn't matter as long as you already understand how to program.\nWhy Am I the Right Person to Write this Book?\nMany of the features found in Rust are also found in other programming languages that I have already learned.\nMy desire to learn new things has pushed me into languages such as Haskell, ML, Lisp, Eiffel, Mozart, Prolog, Java, C, C#, Lua, Python, PHP and now Rust. I understand various programming paradigms like OOP, dataflow, reactive, functional and logic. Using knowledge from all of these areas I will be able to explain how these concepts relate to Rust so you too will understand them.\nPrevious Publishing Experience\nIn October of 2013, I ran a successful Kickstarter project for a book called \"Dataflow and Reactive Programming Systems\". It was delivered on time in April of 2014.\nSince then I have been selling the book on Amazon, LeanPub and my own website (deepFriedCode.com).\nRecently some readers commented on Hacker News...\nMatt Carkci's book discusses the different closely related topics of data flow, flow based programming and reactive programming, very clearly and in quite some detail ...

How good is your memory?\nIf you are like most people, you probably have difficulty remembering what you had for lunch yesterday! When you have many different, extremely complex passwords how can you remember even just one of them, let alone all of them?\n Take this one for instance: xXkleG!8+Ke$?mcd\nIt's a great password, but will you be able to remember it?\nAnd, you need dozens more just like that one - all different.\nEnter Enigmaze - a secure password manager logbook that enables you to quickly create passwords that are almost impossible to guess, yet easy to find and use when you need to log in to your online accounts.\nEnigmaze comes in a classic gift box, so it's a great present for your geek friends.\nWhy do we call it Enigmaze?\nEnigma comes from the second World War where there was a gadget called the Enigma Machine. The Enigma Machine was invented by a German, Arthur Scherbius to encode messages sent by wire so that if intercepted, the messages would be unreadable. Basically it was a method of creating a coded message that looked like nonsense to anyone other than the recipient.\nCreating passwords that are difficult to crack is not difficult, but remembering them is.  \n\nEnigmaze to the rescue!\nKeep your password secure in your wallet or share it with a client\n\n\nYou can use a variety of encryption methods, such as a UV invisible ink pen, transparent overlay cards, your own custom method, or much more. The choice is yours!\nThe Enigmaze notebook gives you:  \n- Hardcover stitched binding\n- Pocket size A6 (94 x 143mm / 4\"x5.7\" exterior) \n- 88 sheets of acid free ink-proof 70 g/m2\n- Different grid for every sheet.\n- Alphabetical tabs (3 pages per letter) for organizing and storing you passwords. \n- 10 empty sheets for taking notes at the end of the book\n- Plenty of space for web addresses, usernames (yes, we forget those, too!), and passwords.   \n- A light weight, sturdy construction that is ideal for carrying in your pocket, handbag, or backpack. \n- An elastic closure and an expandable inner pocket.   \n- Invisible ink marker with UV light (may not be as shown)\n- Frosted, grid printed PVC card.\n\n\n With Enigmaze, you will never, ever, forget a password again! \n\nEarly prototype under UV light\nHow to use Enigmaze:\n\nThere are many ways to use your Enigmaze password logbook, and your methods are completely up to you. You can even vary your methods for different websites creating impossible to crack passwords, even if somebody else has your Enigmaze.\nFor example, one method is drawing a line on the grid with a UV pen. \nThe line can be straight, or parts can be drawn at different angles. Alternatively, using the outer letters and numbers for navigation, you can highlight individual characters on the line. Your password can be any length you wish, but anything less than eight characters is not recommended.\n\nUsing an erasable ink pen to change your password often.\nPLAY\n\nThe alphabetical index enables you to find your password quickly, for example you would go to 'G' for Google, or Godaddy. \n\n\nYou can have lots of fun just thinking up new methods while at the same time creating passwords that are almost impossible to crack!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from our previous projects and we are confident we can deliver a high quality product, on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 314, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/programming/enigmaze-secure-password-manager", "project_name": "Enigmaze - Secure Internet Password Log Book"}}, {"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "C.H.I.P. is a computer.

The course \u2018Learn Node.js By Building 10 Projects\u2019 won accolades for being resourceful from learning enthusiasts, Kickstarter Backers and other students who are learning it.\nSo, following the successful launch and delivery of our Node.js course, we are glad to announce yet another project on Kickstarter, it\u2019s a complete course to learn a very useful technology Angular.JS.\n\nAngular.JS is one of the latest and most useful technologies around, which is why we have decided to make yet another landmark project based course on Angular.JS. \nWhat is Angular JS?\nAngular.JS is an open source web application framework maintained by Google.\n\nIt is a robust client-side technology for building modern web applications using model-view controller (MVC) software architecture. Angular.JS adds more functionality and features to a single-page HTML web application. Today, a lot of developers rely heavily on the MEAN stack (Mongo.DB, Express.JS, Angular.JS and Node.JS) and learning Angular.JS is surely a fruitful investment. \n\nAngular.JS offers a bunch of interesting features, such as asynchronous dependency injection, deep link routing, form validation, two-way data binding and deep linking, to name a few.\n\nSome of the popular applications built using Angular.JS:\n\nDematerializer (a blogging platform) \nPunchPlay (music player application)  \nSendmachine (an email marketing tool)  \nBetrend (a fashion portal)  \nSo, what makes Angular.JS a preferred choice for designing web applications? Let us take a look at some of its prominent features.\nAngular.JS uses directives to add new mark-ups to HTML and turns static HTML files in to something dynamic. It is an innovative approach to incorporating HTML and developing big web applications.  \nAngular.JS organizes views, controllers, directives, filters and such other elements in to separate modules. This division becomes convenient for building and managing an application.  \nAngular.JS has a built-in dependency injection system and is unit-testable.  \nAngular.JS uses data-binding directives to provide a projection of the model to the application view. It automates synchronization of data between model and view components. This allows developers to avoid writing a considerable amount of boilerplate code.\nAngular.JS has a built-in template engine consisting of plain HTML pages (views) as well as controllers written in JavaScript to build rich user interfaces.  \nAngular.JS uses directives to extend HTML dialect by creating new HTML elements and attributes as well as custom HTML tags that work as new widgets.\nAbout the Project \nProject in Angular.Js \u2013 Learn Angular.Js by Building 10 Projects .\nIn this course we will create 10 different projects implementing Angular along with some other technologies\n\u2022 HTML5 / CSS3\n\u2022 JQuery\n\u2022 NodeJS / NPM / Node Modules\n\u2022 Bootstrap\n\u2022 Foundation\n\u2022 Facebook API\n\u2022 Instagram API\n\u2022 Socket.io\n\u2022 MongoDB\nProjects we will be covering in this course are\u2026\nProject 1 \u2013 Basic Angular Website: A simple website using dynamic functionality from AngularJS\nProject 2 \u2013 myContacts Address Book: Small app to manage contacts\nProject 3 \u2013 Web Template Store: Application that displays web templates for sale\nProject 4 \u2013 Web Sockets Chat App: Real time chat using web sockets\nProject 5 \u2013 Angular Facebook App: Facebook authentication and posting app\nProject 6 \u2013 Knowledgebase: Article database using MongoDB\nProject 7 \u2013 User Login App: Custom user authentication app\nProject 8 \u2013 Instagram Gallery: Display images from Instagram\nProject 9 \u2013 Job Directory: Small job listing site\nProject 10 \u2013 Concert Finder: Concert/music directory\nImportance for developers:\nToday, Angular.JS has a pretty vast scope for mainly two reasons. Firstly, it is maintained and promoted by Google. Secondly, a large community of developers are making valuable contributions by introducing newer features and functionalities to this technology. There is also much scope for experimenting with Angular.JS to test its significance in diverse applications.\nYoutube\u2019s Leanback on PlayStation as well as DoubleClick are already helping Angular.JS to spread like fire. It is a matter of time that Angular.JS will capture the technology market by attracting large-scale companies, start-ups, developers and business owners. So, grab this opportunity to join our latest Angula.JS course and become an industry expert today.\nBack this Project to get the early access to the \"Projects in Angular.JS\" course before everyone else. All the students will get the course access on udemy.com platform after its launch by 20th June 2015.

Beautiful and fun at the same time, the clock uses the famous Fibonacci sequence to display time in a brand new way.\nThe Fibonacci Clock has been designed for curious and inventive people who like a time piece that keeps them on their toes. \nIn the news ...\nThe Fibonacci Clock In The News\nGizmodo - \"A Fibonacci Clock Is Hands-Down The Nerdiest Timepiece\"\nThe Guardian - \"world's most stylish nerd timepiece\"\nHackaday.com - \"the best looking clock we\u2019ve ever featured\"\nMirror UK - \"Are you clever enough to tell the time on the world's most complicated clock?\"\nWoodworking For Mere Mortal - \"The Fibonacci Clock is just so cool\"\nNat Corbeil - \"Un Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cr\u00e9e le buzz sur le web\"\nDigital Trends - \"This Fibonacci clock forces you to do math to tell the time\"\nHow do I tell time on the Fibonacci Clock?\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers created by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the 13th century. This is a sequence starting with 1 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. For the clock I used the first 5 terms: 1, 1, 2, 3 and 5.   \nThe screen of the clock is made up of five squares whose side lengths match the first five Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3 and 5. The hours are displayed using red and the minutes using green. When a square is used to display both the hours and minutes it turns blue. White squares are ignored. \nTo tell time on the Fibonacci clock you need to do some math. To read the hour, simply add up the corresponding values of the red and blue squares. To read the minutes, do the same with the green and blue squares. The minutes are displayed in 5 minute increments (0 to 12) so you have to multiply your result by 5 to get the actual number. \nOften, there are multiple ways to display a single time. To add to the challenge, the combinations are picked randomly from all the different ways a number can be displayed. There are, for example, 16 different ways to display 6:30 and you never know which one the clock will use!\nMake it a lamp...\nPress the mode button on the back of the clock and it will turn into a modern version of the lava lamp. Two different lamp modes are included with the clock, but you can hack the clock and make your own. The possibilities are limitless.\nPLAY\n\nHack it, it's open!\nThe Fibonacci clock is driven by an Atmega328 micro-controller running Arduino. That means you can change the code running in the clock using the official Arduino IDE. The possibilities are as infinite as the Fibonacci sequence! I can't wait to see what you will come up with.\nTo make it easy to hack, I have included an FTDI connector so that you don't have to remove the chip to reprogram it. On top of that, a yellow LED has been connected to pin #13 to help you debug your application.\nThe Fibonacci Clock is an open source / hardware project. Once all the rewards are shipped I'll publish all the sources and the schematics on my website under the GPL license.\nThe making of\nThe following video is a time-lapse of the construction of the latest prototype I built.\nI had to build many prototypes before I was satisfied with the result. \nRewards\nWhy I need your help\nElectronics projects tend to be much cheaper when mass produced.

How refreshing to hear such a brave opinion after almost a decade of MVC-domitaion. \nPLAY\n\nAnyway, I really suck at Angular. \nIt's just weird to me to use directives in HTML. \nIt's almost like using HTML to code JavaScript. \nI never got used to it. At the same time, I keep hearing good things about React.\nThat's why I had this idea of learning myself and teaching you React.js (with this course). \nI used the same approach 4 years ago when I wrote my first book on Node.js. \nIt became Amazon #1 Best Seller in the Client-Server category and helped a few thousand engineers.\n7 Ways To ROCK With React.js\nReact.js is a JavaScript library. \nIt's used for creating user interfaces (UIs). \nIt's created and used by giants such as Facebook and Instagram. \nMillions of people use apps built on React.js. \nThink of React.js as the View in Model, View, Controller.\nThe difference between Backbone.js, Angular.js and React.js is that React.js creates its own virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for pages' components. \nYou work with them, not the DOM. \nThis provides tremendous flexibility and awesome performance,\nbecause React.js knows the needed changes beforehand and updates the DOM tree accordingly. \nThis allows to avoid unnecessary DOM operations and makes updates more effective.\nHere are some of other advantages of React.js:\nDecoupling\nIncreased cohesion using a component model \nAbstraction, \nComposition\nExpressivity \nVirtual DOM & Synthetic events (which basically means they completely re-implemented the DOM and its event system) \nEnables modern HTML5 event stuff on IE 8 Server-side rendering Testability Bindings to SVG, VML, and <canvas>\nOnly Wise People Can Qualify\nSmart people learn on their mistakes while wise learn on mistakes of others. Save time with this course...\nI published nine books on JavaScript and Node.js that have been downloaded or bought by over 10,000 developers. \nIn addition to that, I have experience in online courses. \nThree of my courses have over 2,000 students enrolled. \nThe #2 course on Node on Udemy\nI'm not bragging. \nI'm only making a point that I am capable of delivery once the demand is proven by the campaign. :-)\nI worked with Backbone.js before. I'm not an expert on React.js. I haven't build anything production-ready with it (yet). \nThis will give me the advantage of a beginner's mind. \nThat is I won't have the knowledge curse and will be able to explain everything in the layman's terms.\nJoin me on this journey and learn React.js by backing this campaign with $50. \nHigh Performance JavaScript Without The Headache\u2014Limited Time Offer\nThe course will have at least 1 hour of HD video, and examples on the following topics:\nReact custom components\nCommunication between React components\nIntegration of React with jQuery UI / Bootstrap components\nReact Router and routing in React \nRendering React on the server\nReact and server / mBaaS\nThere are four options:\n$197\n$47\n$12\n$7\nFund $197, and you'll get my other online courses (same as with $47 pledge) plus a two-hour Skype session with me where we can pair program, or just talk.\nThe $47 will get you the life-time access to the React.js course \n+ 5 ebooks (Rapid Prototyping with JS, Express.js Guide, Intro to OAuth with Node, JS FUNdamentals) \n+ life-time access to Node Program online course\n+ life-time access to Mongoose online course\nHowever, for only $12, you'll get the life-time access to the React.js course\n+ 5 ebooks (Rapid Prototyping with JS, Express.js Guide, Intro to OAuth with Node, JS FUNdamentals)\nLast but not least, the $7 backing will get you the life-time access to the React.js course itself.\nPick your option and back the campaign before it's over... \nor before the limit of backers is reached. \nThe campaign is ending in a few days!\n---\nCheers,\nAzat Mardan\nPS: React.js is hot, hot, hot.

We love 3D printing and all the doors it opens, but we don\u2019t like our printers. It seems like every day something jams, breaks, shifts, or fails. Even when our printers do work, they need fine-tuning to print well. All in all, we probably spend more time working on our printers than on our inventions.\nSure, there are some high-end machines out there that consistently work well\u2014but why do they have to be so expensive?\nGo into a store with $179 and see what you can get. A microwave, a mini-fridge, a vacuum, etc. All of these products are pretty complicated, and no one expects them to require fixing every week. We believe a 3D printer shouldn't be any different.\nThat\u2019s why we designed Tiko.\nTiko is a 3D printer unlike any before it. We meticulously designed every piece of it to make it high quality and easy to use, while keeping costs down in order to achieve a great price. So, what makes Tiko different?\nMost 3D printers have a multipart frame. These are bulky, difficult to assemble, and easily damaged. This is where Tiko is fundamentally different. Tiko is unibody. That means the whole frame is one piece, introducing an amazing array of benefits. Easy to manufacture. Virtually impossible to misalign. That's how you get a quality 3D printer for $179.\nTiko is a delta 3D printer with three sets of arms moving in unison to control the movement of the print head (more on this later). The essence of Tiko\u2019s innovation is our discovery that delta is the ideal configuration to unlock the many benefits of unibody.\nFrom the very beginning, we were determined to make an accurate printer. Tiko\u2019s unibody construction and delta mechanism have been carefully designed to deliver exceptionally high mechanical repeatability without the need for high-precision components. That\u2019s right, you heard us. Even without high-precision components, Tiko is still able to print incredibly consistent layers. \nTiko printed the vase pictured above at a 200 micron-resolution, but it can print as fine as 50 microns.\nThanks to unibody, Tiko is also enclosed. Whereas most 3D printers have problems with warping prints, Tiko\u2019s enclosed print chamber means that prints are isolated from the outside environment, resulting in strong and consistent print results, even when the wind blows.\nTiko\u2019s slender unibody frame, delta mechanism, and ultra-compact liquefier/end-effector enable it to print objects far larger than any similarly sized 3D printer.\nLike most delta printers, we started with a circular print volume. But we wanted more than that, so we expanded Tiko\u2019s print volume into the corners for those extra-long prints, maximizing space efficiency.\nNot only can you print large objects, you can actually remove them easily, too. Tiko\u2019s print bed is flexible, so once your print is done, you simply lift the printer off the bed, then twist to pop off your print. \nAnd with the specially-formulated coating on Tiko's print bed, prints adhere consistently. No more scraping, no blue painter\u2019s tape, and no glue stick shenanigans either.\nYou know what else is flexible? Your choice of filament. Tiko uses non-proprietary 1.75mm filament on a standard 1kg 165mm (6.5 in.) diameter spool, so you can experiment with different materials. Tiko also detects when you\u2019re out of filament and pauses the print so you can reload and resume. \nWires are so 1996. Connect Tiko to the cloud, and you can print from almost anywhere, even from your smartphone. No Wi-Fi? Tiko makes its own wireless access point so you can print directly, too.  \nTiko\u2019s browser-based software is super user-friendly. We\u2019ve already optimized Tiko\u2019s performance, leaving only a few straightforward settings so you can spend more time on your ideas and leave the printing to Tiko.\nTiko\u2019s enclosed build chamber also means children and pets can\u2019t interfere with the liquefier, a small but dangerously hot component that is typically left exposed in other 3D printers. Taking things a step further, Tiko has an onboard accelerometer that automatically shuts the printer down if it\u2019s disturbed.\nThis same accelerometer is used for auto calibration, plus something even cooler. Tiko can measure its own performance, so with your permission, we can use performance data from your printer to help make every Tiko better. This will help us improve our firmware and slicing engine AND keep your Tiko running at peak performance. Everybody wins!\nTiko\u2019s unibody construction also makes it incredibly strong. The stiffness of the frame improves print quality while making Tiko durable and easy to ship.\nBut even with all that strength, unibody makes Tiko surprisingly lightweight.\nBy now you might be wondering: How can a 3D printer this good, with all these features, cost so little? Well, it wasn\u2019t easy. But if you\u2019re not afraid to geek out, neither are we...\nYou emailed us, you asked us technical questions, and we\u2019re happy to deliver. Right off the bat, there are a few things you should know:\n1) Tiko has almost no parts in common with any other 3D printer in the world. Period. With a few exceptions, every component inside Tiko is a bespoke part designed for rapid and inexpensive manufacture.\n2) Every component you see below is a generation or two behind where we actually are. We are in a highly competitive field with rampant product-cloning, so we hold our intellectual property very close to the vest, and a number of these technologies are patent-pending. These older parts worked well, and they\u2019re similar to what\u2019s in the final Tiko, but the latest generation is even better. And secret!\nNow let's get technical...\nONCE AGAIN, UNIBODY\nIt all started with unibody. In most 3D printers, the most expensive (by far) item is the frame. That\u2019s because most 3D printers have a frame built from multiple beams that are fastened together. In delta printers, this frame is often made from three vertical extruded-aluminum beams. We had a simple thought\u2026 what if we extruded all three rails together?\nJust like that, we had it. A unibody chassis. Strong, lightweight, virtually impossible to misalign, but also one we could extrude by the mile at a very low cost. Being made of one piece means no assembly is needed\u2014no fasteners, no alignments, none of that.\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, but an enormous leap forward. And it's only the beginning.\nDELTA\nDeltas really do it better. We don\u2019t want to lecture you on robot kinematics, but it\u2019s no secret that parallel manipulators are inherently more accurate than their gantry/serial counterparts. We\u2019ve said it twice, and we\u2019re proud to say it again. Tiko does not use high-precision mechanical components. Why not?\nBecause we don\u2019t need to! Tiko\u2019s low-part-count parallel-arm mechanism has consistently demonstrated exceptional mechanical repeatability without the use of high-precision rails and linear bearings. That means we can manufacture Tiko using consumer-grade tolerances and relatively simple parts, rather than the crazy-expensive CNC-machine components found in other 3D printers.\nDIRECT-DRIVE SYSTEM\nHaving developed an inexpensive chassis and rails, we didn't want to mess it up with a complicated drive system. Most 3D printers use an eye-popping arrangement of belts, pulleys, and tensioners. Instead, we developed a proprietary direct-drive system in which the motors are mounted onto carriages that drive themselves directly along the rails.\n\nSimple, reliable, and super-inexpensive to make. How we integrated the gear racks into the rails during production, however, is our secret. \nNOTE: Don't worry, we abandoned the above pictured NEMA-14\u2019s ages ago. They were expensive, heavy, and noisy. Tiko now uses a completely different type of motor that has proven far more suitable, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how little it costs. This alone had a major impact on our pricing.\nCUSTOM ELECTRONICS\nOnce we had perfected Tiko\u2019s mechanics, the electronics became the most expensive part of the printer. Most 3D printers use hobbyist electronics, which are great for tinkering but overpriced and underpowered for a consumer-grade product. So, we developed our own.\nTiko\u2019s electronics employ carefully chosen surface-mount components that are optimized for mass manufacture. These make Tiko faster and smarter, while costing less.\nFurthermore, Tiko\u2019s high-efficiency liquefier and motors use only a fraction of the energy required by most 3D printers. This allowed us to use smaller and less expensive electronic components and a standard \u201cbrick\u201d power adapter instead of a bulky PSU, which further reduced costs.\nPASSIVE-COOLED LIQUEFIER\nLastly, there is Tiko\u2019s liquefier assembly. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the only liquefier in the world that can extrude PLA without active cooling\u2014and in an enclosed space at that.\n\nWe spent close to a year getting it right. Why did we bother? Because cooling fans are expensive. Aside from the fan itself, you need a finned heatsink, the wiring to the PCB, the PWM output to drive it, and the added assembly steps to install and wire it in. There\u2019s also the noise, the size (which would compromise print volume) and the problem of dust collecting in the fan/heatsink.\n\nTiko\u2019s one-of-a-kind passive cooled liquefier solves all of these problems, and it's compact, energy efficient, and inexpensive to manufacture.\nAt its core are the carefully designed convection-optimizing heat vents. These vents maximize the upward flow of hot air while shielding the heatsink. The exact specifications are secret, but Tiko's liquefier maintains a remarkably low inlet temperature without any forced airflow\u2014even inside a warm print chamber.\n\nBy incorporating the heat shield into an injection-moldable end effector with integrated ball joints and making a geometrically simple heatsink without any fins, we dropped costs even further.\nTITANIUM NOZZLE\nAchieving our demanding thermal performance criteria also required the use of a one-of-a-kind aerospace-grade Titanium alloy nozzle. The nozzle minimizes conduction to the heatsink without the need for an insulating barrel. The reduced heat flux results in a nozzle that requires very little energy to maintain its temperature, making it exceptionally energy efficient.\nNotice how quickly the temperature drops off. We freakin' LOVE Titanium!\nThis unique nozzle makes for an extremely compact and efficient liquefier, which gives Tiko excellent extrusion control while enabling trouble-free nozzle changing, as no molten filament ever comes into contact with the threads. It also improves print quality by minimizing the effects of radial disturbances in the carriage. \nBut isn't Titanium expensive? Sure it is, but by making the components so small, it actually reduced our costs.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nTiko\u2019s cutting-edge technologies and bespoke parts give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. It wasn't easy, but we did it, and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring Tiko to you.\nNow for $179, you can have a Tiko. What you create with it is up to you.\nAnd first movers can get a Tiko at our limited Earliest Bird ($99) and Early Bird ($139) prices.\nIf you want multiple Tikos\u2014for your whole family or a school or to simply print more things at the same time\u2014multiply $179 by the number you want and set that as your pledge amount (Example: 3 x $179 = $537 for three Tikos). \nNOTE: Multi-Tiko pledges will only be counted in multiples of $179. Earliest/Early Bird prices are limited to one-per-backer.\nOne of the questions we get asked most is, \u201cCan you use your 3D printer to print another 3D printer?\" Well, kind of! For an $18 pledge, you can get a 1/10th scale Baby Tiko Unibody\u2026 that was printed by a Tiko!\nAnd for any pledge amount, you'll be helping make 3D printing accessible and dependable for a new population of inventors who haven't had easy access before now. We'll keep you informed of our progress through consistent campaign updates, and over time we'll share creations from around the world that came to life thanks to your support. \nFULFILLMENT\nWe\u2019ve been working on Tiko for over a year. During that time, we\u2019ve gone through many iterations, developed some remarkable technologies, and created a strong network of manufacturers to form a solid supply chain. With your help, we can initiate the following steps to bring Tiko to you\u2026\nSHIPPING\nIn order to make sure that all backer information is up-to-date so we can ensure fair rates, we will collect shipping fees when we send backer surveys this Fall. Exact shipping rates will vary depending on destination, but will not exceed $65 USD per Tiko.\nTiko rewards will be shipped according to Kickstarter pledge order, starting this November. If you want your Tiko soon, you should move fast!\nWhat is it about us that makes us so different? How were we able to build Tiko, and why are we the ones to deliver? Let\u2019s get better acquainted.\nMatt Gajkowski (Center)\nMatt was born and raised to be an entrepeneur. He believes in simplicity and relentless progress, and he isn't afraid to challenge established ideas. He is the mind behind Tiko's groundbreaking technologies and the muscle that has brought them to market. Matt worked as a freelance product designer before starting Tiko. He now has a vision for the future of 3D printing and the know-how to realize it.\nSharon Charitar (Left)\nSharon gets things done. She handles Tiko's market research, community management, PR, bookkeeping, etc. You name it, she's done it, expertly. An analyst at heart, Sharon finds data that we use to improve our business and our product. She is the glue that holds all of Tiko's operations together and keeps us running smoothly and efficiently.\nMichael Zhang (Right)\nMichael was born in China and moved to Canada at age 12. He is fluent in Mandarin and has many connections back home. Michael leverages this, along with his sharp technical skill set, to work with experienced manufacturers without language or technical barriers. This enabled us to find new ways to manufacture Tiko's bespoke parts and push the envelope on Tiko's performance while reducing manufacturing costs.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to bring Tiko to this stage, but we couldn\u2019t have done it alone. It was through the patience, support, and enthusiasm of some amazing partners that we\u2019ve made it this far.\nSpark Centre is a non-profit support organization that helps entrepreneurs bring innovative technologies to market. A passionate team, they have supported us since day one. They are the minds behind the $25,000 Ignite competition and the Thrive accelerator program. Before we met Spark, our prototype was held together with tape and popsicle sticks. If you have an idea, talk to them!\nFallon StarterKit takes the same top creative talent that works on Fallon\u2019s high-profile ad campaigns and lets them create crowdfunding campaigns for select projects. Boy are we glad they selected us! This campaign is the result of our extraordinary partnership with Fallon.\nThere are numerous other amazing companies we\u2019ve worked with for manufacturing, legal, accounting, etc. Building a printer is one thing, building a company is another, and it\u2019s because of their hard work that Tiko is ready for you.\nTiko has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With Tiko, we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \n\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tiko is only as good as its parts, and up until now, all of those parts have been prototyped using 3D printing and machining. In production, our parts will be made using injection molding and other processes, which means they'll have different tolerances and mechanical properties than those we\u2019ve prototyped. If any of these changes compromises performance, we will have to go back and tool them again. This is not a fast process.\n\nFurthermore, we will not release a printer that doesn't meet our high standards, so we'll run endurance tests on every single aspect of Tiko until it's ready. This too, takes time.

To design one, our team of engineers and designers developed groundbreaking ways to reduce manufacturing costs, increase ease of use, and maintain high quality performance. So here it is: the 3D printer everybody across the globe has been waiting for!\nThe Genesis Uno and Duo make printing on the go a breeze. They have a unique space-maximizing and user-friendly design that allow you to comfortably and efficiently print all of your 3D projects without sacrificing quality. The Genesis DUO takes it further by doubling your print options in terms of colors and materials.\nAs well as a large print volume, the Genesis Uno and Duo offer many more additional features that make these printers stand out in the 3D market:\nFull sized LCD: Control and monitor your printing progress right at your Genesis printer\nSD support: Start untethered printing right from your Genesis\nWireless connectivity: Control your Genesis via PC, tablet, or smartphone  \nAuto-Calibration: Drastically reduce the time spent on calibration \nBlazing print speeds: Print your prototypes at up to 150 mm/s\nWith standard print volumes and the fastest print speeds in their price range, the Genesis Uno and Duo truly set the bar high. Their compact, user-friendly design incorporates extra features that enhance the printing process and the quality of their outputs without added manufacturing costs or bulk.\nTo make this amazing 3D printer, we first had to address the technical and design issues that were behind the high cost and inconsistent quality of other 3D printers on the market. We found that many of the Cartesian, square-shaped, and Delta 3D printers made inefficient use of structural materials and space.\nOur patent-pending design, which exploits material strength and the rigidity of a properly mounted axis, keeps production cost low by removing nearly half the structural volume of existing machines and decreasing by 50% the amount of needed components, while continuing to allow for a large build volume of up to 1 cubic foot. Every component of the Genesis 3D printer is designed with multi-functionality in mind to reduce manufacturing cost of redundant components. In addition, all electronics are housed together to further lower the time and cost needed for cable management.\nOur cantilever design eliminates bend or misalignment, and allows the Genesis 3D printer to withstand any rapid print movement or handling.\nThe Genesis 3D printer also offers an unmatched modular design which allows you to easily upgrade printer parts so that your Genesis 3D printer can remain on par with the best consumer 3D printers on the market.\nDual-Extruders\nDual-extruder printers in the present market perform at slow print speed due to bulky motors on the axis. In order to address this problem, we incorporated a lightweight, well-tuned Bowden system that allows incredibly fast print speeds of up to 150mm/s and a resolution quality of up to 50 microns.\nAuto-Calibration\nAdditionally, we included an auto-calibration sensor that allows consistent adherence of the first print layer, the most critical step in any 3D printing process. Genesis\u2019 autonomous calibration system along with other key features keeps it ready to print at all times.\nLCD and Wireless Connectivity\nPrint on the go with an SD card and monitor your print status right on the LCD screen. Control your Genesis 3D printer from your smartphone, tablet or PC via Wi-Fi or USB to keep your desk or work area clutter-free.\nTechnical Specifications\nKickstarter Reward Offers\nBecome familiar with the different options the Genesis 3D printer offers . with the graphic below. \nComparison\nProduction Timeline\nOur machine is fully functional as demonstrated in our video.

Thank you!\nThe next thought that struck me was, \"Do I need another stretch goal for the final hours of the campaign?\" In my discussions about Madeup with folks in the computer science community, I have become aware of the importance of a block-based interface (like Scratch and AppInventor and many others). I contemplated adding a stretch goal to implement a blocks interface, but I had to admit I intend to add this whether or not I meet a stretch goal. I felt it disingenuous to announce it as a stretch goal when I plan on implementing it anyway. Of course, if you would still like to contribute, I welcome your support.\nStretching\nThanks to the generosity of 50 backers, we have reached our initial $2500 fundraising goal. Since there's some time left on the clock, I asked the backers if we should pursue a further goal. The most requested stretch goal is a desktop version of Madeup. What were their reasons?\nAn Internet connection would not be necessary.\nIndividuals would not need to be concerned about accounts and privacy issues.\nSo, if we can reach $4000 by the end of the campaign, I will work on a desktop Madeup client to be released during summer 2016. Work on this will not precede our initial goal of getting the web client released in early 2016.\nWhat is Madeup?\nMadeup is a programming language for making things up. Its speakers navigate 3-D space to generate printable shapes. The language is designed to teach computation from a tangible, first-person perspective and to help students integrate technology back into the non-virtual world. The models that we build in Madeup can be sent directly to a 3-D printer.\nThe Madeup language is a fully-featured programming language, supporting both imperative and functional styles of programming. It supports the following:\nmathematical operators\nconditional statements\nloops\narrays\nboolean logic\nvariables\nfunctions\nrecursion\nhigher-order functions\npartial function application (in progress)\nAs Madeup users write code to wander through space, they think about the structure of shapes, how we use mathematics to model the world, symbolic thinking, and sequential and diverging processes. Students who use Madeup learn as much about computer programming as they do mathematics, design, and logic. And they do so in a spatial context, which allows them to leverage a great wealth of their own prior knowledge. All this, plus the output can be held in one's hand!\nTODO\nWe have developed Madeup in our free time for the past year and a half. It is still in alpha stage. We are hoping to raise enough funds to clean up its rough edges and make it freely available to the general public. In particular, we want to use it in summer camps, introductory programming classes, professional development for K-12 teachers, and outreach events.\nMadeup is almost ready to be shared with others, but some work remains. With your support, we will complete the following tasks before making it publicly available:\nBug fixes (mysterious orientation flips, awkward joints, improperly handled concavities, etc.)\nDocumentation\nLesson plans\nSpeed-ups (metaball generation, mesh generation)\nImproved user interface\nAccount system\nMuch of the work will take place in summer 2015, when we are not as busy at our full-time university teaching jobs.\nExamples\nA traffic cone made of two simple tubes.\nA worm composed of spheres on a sine wave.\nA helix generated with a tube command.\nA star extruded into a solid.\nA vase generated by revolving its cross-section around the y-axis.\nA ripple generated as a two-dimensional parametric surface.\nWill it work?\nWe have already used Madeup in a few public workshops at our library and local schools. Our favorite feedback from these early tests was from a young woman just starting middle school: \"How do I build a sphere?\" The participants have been excited to make things.\nModels built by middle schoolers using Madeup at a workshop held in the L.E. Phillips Memorial Public Library in Eau Claire, WI.\nRewards\n$10 or more: your name goes on the Madeup Slab of Thanks, a 3-D model of the names of all our gracious supporters.\n$25 or more: a Madeup sticker is sent to you in the mail, along with a hearty expression of our thanks.\n$50 or more: you are given early access to Madeup and its documentation. You'll be able to create your own models!\n$75 or more: a 3-D printed ceramic rupee designed in Madeup is sent to you in the mail.\nYour generosity pays--in foreign currency.\n$100 or more: a 3-D printed ceramic trivet composed of interlocking spirals and designed in Madeup is sent to you in the mail.\nThese interlocking spirals are so powerful, they won't let your table won't get scorched by hot pots and pans that you set on them!\n$250 or more: a 3-D printed initials keychain is sent to you in the mail. We will generate a contour surface around the intersection of your three initials and then print it. See an interactive demo.\nIs it a C? Is it an R? Is it a J?

Most importantly, it is really fun to play whether you are a musician or you just want to make some noise.\nCapabilities\nSynthino XM is a polyphonic, multitimbral synthesizer with many features:\n5-note polyphony for superb playability\n12 waveforms, 5 drum samples (kick, snare, hi-hat, tom, clap), and noise generator\n12-bit audio at 25KHz output rate\n4 MIDI channels, each with separate waveform and ADSR envelope settings\nMIDI over 5-pin MIDI jack or USB\nMIDI over USB works with DAW software on Mac and Windows computers as well as iOS and Android devices\nlow pass filter with cutoff frequency and resonance controls\n2 independent low frequency oscillators (LFOs): pitch and filter\nselectable waveform for LFOs\n1V p-p audio output voltage with enough current to drive headphones\narpeggiator mode, up to 16 notes\n4 arpeggiator patterns: up, down, up-down, random\n4 built-in arpeggiator chords or use MIDI to specify up to 16 notes\narpeggiator pitch transposition control\ntempo control with MIDI clock input\n16-step live performance \"groovebox\" sequencer\nsave/load patches and sequences in EEPROM\npitch fine-tuning adjustment\nprogrammable/upgradable over USB\nHardware Features\nBack view: MIDI input, mini USB, 1/4\" mono audio output\n1/4 inch ( 6.35 mm ) output jack: Works with headphones, line output for recording, and direct connecting to standard guitar amplifier. We will include a 1/4 to 1/8 inch stereo adapter with each Synthino XM for headphone/earbud use. When running on 9 volt battery power, the unit turns off when the audio plug is removed.\nStandard 5-pin MIDI input jack: This allows you to plug-in any standard MIDI keyboard, interface, sequencer, or drum machine to control the Synthino XM.\nUSB mini jack: Allows MIDI over USB functionality. This modern implementation enables sequencing and control from iOS, Android, PC,  and Mac devices. It can also be used to upgrade firmware using a simple upload utility. Synthino XM can also be powered from the USB port of cell phone charger, laptop power, or battery pack.\nLaser-cut acrylic cover: The top and bottom of the device are laser-cut frosted acrylic that give the Synthino XM a gorgeous finish. We searched far and wide for acrylic with just the right look.\nKnobs, Buttons, and Blinking LEDs\nWe wanted a fun, tactile, aesthetically pleasing user interface free of distractions and with just enough buttons and knobs that change your parameters on the fly so you can instantly explore new sounds. The software modes we designed are geared towards people to have fun playing around without any previous musical experience and at the same time we have a powerful live sequencer groovebox mode that every synthesizer fan will enjoy. The visual indicators are in the form of 4 bright orange LEDs located below the buttons. \nSoftware\nThe Synthino XM has 3 modes: synthesizer, arpeggiator, and groovebox. When Synthino XM is powered on, all the LEDs blink, prompting you to select a mode by pressing one of the buttons (1-3).  In some modes, the pots have secondary functions labeled as \"fn:\". These functions are enabled/disabled by pressing button 4. When \"fn:\" functions are enabled, the LED under button 4 flashes. The entire device can be reset by holding button 4 for 3 seconds, allowing you to choose a new mode to use.\nMode 1 - Synthesizer\nSynthesizer mode allows you to play the Synthino XM with a MIDI controller connected to the MIDI jack or from your favorite DAW (digital audio workstation) software with MIDI over USB. You can also play the synthesizer in standalone mode using the 3 note buttons. Explore different sounds by changing the waveform, controlling the note envelope parameters (ADSR - attack, decay, sustain, release), modulating the pitch and filter with independent LFOs for each, and adjusting the low pass filter.\nThere are 4 independent voices corresponding to MIDI channels 1-4. Each voice can have its own envelope and waveform, allowing you to play 4 completely different sounding instruments at the same time. Use the voice select knob to choose a voice (indicated by LED) and then use waveform and ADSR knobs to modify that voice's parameters. The LFOs and filter, however, are global and affect all voices.\nThe Synthino XM is 5-note polyphonic, and the 5 simultaneous notes can be played on any combination of voices. For example, all on one voice when playing from a keyboard, or the 5 notes can be spread across the 4 MIDI channels when sequencing the Synthino XM from DAW software on your computer.\nSynthesizer demo:\nMode 2 - Arpeggiator \nThe arpeggiator lets you play predefined arpeggios or set your own arpeggio notes with MIDI. Use the pattern button to cycle through the patterns: up, down, up-down, and random. Use the chord/MIDI button to cycle through predefined 4-note chord arpeggios: major, minor, M7, and m7, or to select MIDI mode which creates an arpeggio with currently played MIDI notes (up to 16 notes!). Of course you can change the speed (BPM), transpose arpeggios up and down, and modify the envelope, waveform, and filter parameters. There's a ton of fun to be had, even when using the arpeggiator in standalone mode without any MIDI input.\nArpeggiator demos:\nMode 3 - Live performance \"groovebox\" sequencer\nGroovebox mode is the most sophisticated feature of the Synthino XM. It is a \"live\" 16-step sequencer which allows you to lay down 4 different tracks by playing a MIDI controller. For simplicity when performing a live sequence, this mode does not have secondary functions on the pots.\nWhen the sequencer is running, any note or drum sample you play will be recorded to the current track and repeated as the sequencer runs. Change tracks using the track select knob. Each track can have its own envelope (AR) settings. The individual notes on a single track can even have different waveforms, so you can create very rich, complex sequences. The clear track button clears the currently selected track, and the preview button lets you play notes/samples with your controller without recording them so you can hear what it will sound like. The track fader knob lets you control the volume of each track individually, and transpose lets you transpose notes up/down (but drum samples won't transpose). You can even enable a metronome to help with your timing. The Synthino XM groovebox mode is incredibly powerful and expressive. No musical talent is required to make great sounding sequences! And when you have a great sequence you can save it to memory to recall later, even after the power is turned off.\nGroovebox demos:\nSynthino XM is better...\nPowerful microcontroller - The ATxmega128a4u has 2x speed, 4x flash memory, 4x SRAM of any comparable Aduino based synthesizer out there. Waveforms are synthesized with a true 12-bit DAC for smooth sound. This is not scratchy PWM audio!\nMIDI Over USB - Note sequencing from Android with OTG (On-The-Go) cable, USB Camera Adapter on iPad or iPhone. Standard USB port on Desktop PC or Laptop. Drivers are pre-loaded on all those systems. It will just show up as \"Synthino XM\" under MIDI Output Interfaces.\nBuilt for easy upgrades and customization - We will release mechanical drill files for anyone who wants to integrate the Synthino XM into a custom project. We take the community of our users seriously and any improvements and upgrades will be considered. Custom colors of laser cut panels and accessories will be eventually available.\nMade in USA - By keeping our fabrication and assembly in-house we can afford to expand and economically create the Synthino XM. With fewer middle men you as a backer and future customer will received the best deal. We also take pride in being a local business.\nOur Story  \nWe are both experienced \"makers\" that have both run our own electronics business for years. In fact, we were both recently profiled in the new book Maker Pro published by Maker Media:\nMichael Krumpus and Alex Dyba both featured in Maker Pro\nWe started collaborating on Synthino project in early 2014, the finished design you see evolved almost naturally because the hardware was telling us what to do. Initially the synthesizer experiments were coded for the nootropic design's Audio Hacker Shield, surely it made sounds but limited by only 5 buttons and 3 pots with no way playing notes, but even with the added MIDI shield, we obviously had monstrous setup was not clean, friendly, or practical. \nAudio Hacker synthesizer prototype\nYet those steps helped us to define the limits of what we wanted in a portable microcontroller synthesizer. Our team had a deadline later that spring, a pivotal point and we concentrated on developing a standalone synthesizer not a collection of Arduino shields. Thanks to Michael's tireless efforts writing the software and laying out the hardware to incorporate Alex's functionality suggestions the Synthino ONE was born and debuted at the Maker Faire Bay Area 2014.\nWe had overwhelmingly positive feedback and of course plenty of suggestions from people who stopped by our booth. Before boarding the plane for cold Minnesota Alex contacted RobotSpeak synthesizer specialty retailer in San Francisco, although an actual meeting never happened that contact led to surprise project producing 100 units over the summer for the band Information Society! \nInformation Society Deluxe Synthino ONE Project\nIn August of 2014 we fulfilled out obligations of delivering the units to be included in the band's deluxe box set of their new record _Hello World. The Deluxe release sold out within hours. \nNEW Synthino XM Production Version\nWe learned so many things from painstakingly creating over 100 units by hand and soldering thousands of through-hole components. The functionality and features were all squeezed out of the Synthino ONE's same as Arduino ATmega328 hardware. We needed faster fabrication and a faster processor with double the speed and 4 times as much memory. From the Atmel ATxmega128a4u the new Synthino XM was prototyped and born. \nOver the fall and winter of 2014 we continued the work on Synthino XM perfecting the code and improving our manufacturing processes to be able to produce the new XM units in-house. We chose white circuit boards, orange LEDs and frosted acrylic for an aesthetically pleasing design that will get attention for its beauty, not just its great sound.\nRewards\nAlex Wearing a GetLoFi Black GetLoFi T-Shirt - $20 reward level\n2 T-Shirt Options, we will contact you for size.\nProject Timeline\nWhy Crowdfunding? \nWe know that this Kickstarter campaign will be the best way to get the word out about our awesome product. We ask for your support to validate our vision of a fun user-friendly synthesizer by providing us with materials we need to make it a success.\n\"Synthino\" is a trademark of nootropic design, LLC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced makers that both run our own electronics businesses and have proven track records in manufacturing and shipping to customers all over the world. But, like any complex project, there are some risks that could get in the way: \n\nProduction Equipment Failure: We are planning on using a shared laser cutter for this short run of Synthino XM units, its possible that the machine can break or be broken by another user. Our surface mount reflow oven may malfunction and cause delays until new one is acquired. \n\nSoftware Bugs: It is possible that there could be grave software errors that may not manifest until after the units are shipped. Although the units can be easily updated over USB it is an extra step we would not be thrilled with making users do. \n\nComponent Failures: It is also possible that any one of the parts we receive and use in our batch of units could be faulty and fail from repeated use of Synthino XM.

Maybe an LED, touch sensor, or some other genius invention to solve the world\u2019s problems?  Help us launch Conductive PLA and you will be able to!   \nProto-pasta Conductive PLA is an FFF/FDM 3D printing filament designed for users interested in combining 3D Printing and electronics. It allows you to print conductive assemblies that integrate switches, potentiometers, LED\u2019s, capacitive touch sensors, and more!\nProto-pasta Conductive PLA Highlights\n1-High electrical conductivity, between 60X and 700,000X more conductive than readily available conductive filaments at 15 ohm-cm\n2-Compatibility with other PLA materials for use in dual-head printers with good layer adhesion for creating circuits\n3-Reduced brittleness over existing conductive products (filament is quite flexible)\n4-Excellent print quality\n5-Proto-pasta Conductive PLA is affordable\nWhat is it made of?\nProto-pasta Conductive PLA is a compound of Natureworks 4043D PLA, a dispersant and conductive carbon black.  \nHow conductive is \u201cconductive\u201d?\nGreat question!  Here are the numbers:\nVolume resistivity of molded resin (not 3D Printed) \u2013 15 ohm-cm\nVolume resistivity of 3D printed parts perpendicular to layers \u2013 30 ohm-cm\nVolume resistivity of 3D printed parts through layers (along Z axis) \u2013 115 ohm-cm\nResistance of a 10cm length of 1.75mm filament \u2013 1.8Kohm\nResistance of a 10cm length of 2.85mm filament \u2013 600ohm\nThe measure normally used to characterize a conductor is \u201cvolume resistivity\u201d with the units of Ohm-cm.  This can be confusing because it is not obvious what it means like \u201cmiles per hour\u201d.  It is simply the resistance through a 1cm X 1cm X 1cm cube of material, with full sheet contact at 2 opposing surfaces.  It is often misprinted as ohm/cm which is not a common unit of measure.\nWe measured the conductivity using a fixture we machined that clamps a sample between 2 sheet conductors and 1cm cubes printed on a Printrbot Simple Metal and machined from solid resin. \n Measuring Volume Resistivity of Molded Resin\nPrinting Samples on Printrbot\nPLAY\n\nSo how strong is it?\nWe have not done substantial mechanical testing on this product but have some subjective parameters that should be useful in comparing this material with others.\n-Strength:  Fair strength.  More flexible than PLA, but less layer adhesion\n-Stiffness:  Low, semi-flexible\n-Heat Resistance:  Similar to PLA, use below 50C\n-Layer Adhesion:  Fair layer adhesion.  Not as good as normal PLA\n-Flexibility:  Filament is quite flexible but will break if bent repeatedly (particularly 2.85mm).  Printed parts are rigid if more than a mm or two thick.  Thin sections are somewhat flexible but fail along layer lines if flexed more than a few times.\n-Failure Mode:  If flexed to breakage, failure will be along layer lines.\n-Warping:  Very low warping\n-Dual-Head compatibility:  Compatible with (sticks to) PLA in dual material prints\nPrinting\nProto-pasta Conductive PLA is quite easy to print and is compatible with most printers that can print PLA.\nParameters:\nBed Temp if available: 50C\nHot End Temp: 230C\nRewards\nWe have a number of rewards that we are excited to share! \n$15 + Shipping - 125g Loose Coil of Conductive PLA in 1.75mm or 2.85mm\nOne 125g Loose coil (no spool) of high quality Conductive PLA in 1.75mm or 2.85mm diameter.

It\u2019s easy to use the browser-based control panel to start, pause, and resume prints, stream from a webcam and slice your STL files. The Photon Elephant is the simplest electronics solution for getting a 3D printer up and running without needing to coordinate a bunch of independent software and firmware tools. \nUnlike existing solutions, we use the Raspberry Pi\u2019s GPIO pins to directly drive the motor controllers for your printer. We even went a step further and built a convenient SDK that makes Photon Elephant a tinkerer\u2019s dream! Do you want to try incorporating sensor feedback to close the loop and get perfect prints every time? Maybe you want to build an SLS printer, but the standard five motor controllers just aren\u2019t enough? We provide a simple specification so the Makers and Hackers of the world can spend more time innovating and less time figuring out the inner workings of firmware code.\nPhoton Elephant is a bundle of hardware and software built around the Raspberry Pi that controls your 3D printer. Many printers today use a Raspberry Pi to send commands to an Arduino, which actually manages the motors and sensors, but has no operating system. Photon Elephant eliminates the Arduino entirely, putting the power of linux directly on your printer!\nWe think that creating new and exciting 3D printers should be easier, so we set out to make a simple and powerful platform that anyone can build on. We found the process of working with the available open source solutions to be tedious and out of date. The next generation of 3D printers deserve better. That's why we built Photon Elephant.\nPhoton Elephant is built for Hackers, Makers, Students and Entrepreneurs! It can handle the whole stack, controlling everything from the User Interface to the motors and sensors! If you just want to get a printer up and running, Photon Elephant does the work of a slew of other products, making it the simplest solution available. If you are looking to do something new, the SDK makes Photon Elephant the easiest platform to build on.\nNever flash firmware again! We\u2019ll send you an SD card (or an image if you\u2019re feeling a bit more adventurous) and you just plug it into the Raspberry Pi. Wire any compatible* printer up to the Photon Elephant companion board, and you\u2019re ready to go! No more worrying about making a bunch of different programs like slicers, firmware and printer managers talk to one another. Just open a browser on any device on your WiFi and start printing!\n*We currently officially support only Cartesian RepRap-style printers (Prusa, Printrbot, etc.). We are actively working on support for Delta printers and SLS printers, while our SDK can be used to easily support almost any printing methodology.\nWith the Photon Elephant SDK, we empower both hobbyists and startups like never before!  We expose an additional header coming off our companion board with 40 pins for you to run custom motors and sensors to your heart\u2019s content! Using our SDK, you can create powerful plugins to control your own electronics and unleash totally new tools on your 3D printer.\nSimple additions like extra motors or extruders only require tweaking some XML. If you want to do something more complicated, you can use the SDK to easily add support for anything you can imagine! Maybe you want to start incorporating new sensor feedback data into your print process to improve reliability, or you want to add an extruder that uses a bunch of motors for full color? The Photon Elephant SDK is built for this kind of thing! Understanding a few of our system calls is all you need in order to get up to speed and start hacking. You worry about the high-level logic of what you want to do, and we\u2019ll worry about the rest!\nFor More Information Check Out Our Developer Blog!\nThe 3D printing industry is shifting so quickly that today\u2019s high performance printer is tomorrow\u2019s paperweight. Given how hard it is to predict the direction the industry will shift, flexibility is the name of the game. It doesn\u2019t make sense to spend your time modifying firmware directly on a chipset that might not be used at all tomorrow.\nPhoton Elephant\u2019s SDK helps you keep up with the rest of the industry by making it easy to add new features to your design.

What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not.  Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn.  Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating.  It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With KickStarter's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.\nLet's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder is no exception to that rule.  The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets.  If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories.  So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight.  You can't.\nBut if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.\nWe'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories.  Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising.  If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.\nIf you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold.  If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment.  If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.\nSo, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute.  Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder and enhance your calorie burn.\nWhether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort.  Note that The Cold Shoulder cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.\nThe Problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories\nThe first thing I always hear when I say I\u2019m touting a \u201ccold vest\u201d is, \u201cI don\u2019t like being cold.\u201d But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over\u2010stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro\u2010intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.\nThere is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long.  There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories.   But it's not.\nThe Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure\nIn addition to exercise, there\u2019s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It\u2019s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you\u2019re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact \u2013 and I should know,  since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.\nThe idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.\nI was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, \"If cold exposure burns calories, there\u2019s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn.\" That\u2019s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. The vest looks like this:\nThe Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest\nI have put it to the scientific test and proved this vest's efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Here are a few before-and-after shots after just 3 weeks of using The Cold Shoulder:\nResults of 3 weeks of wearing The Cold Shoulder\nConsidering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?\nWhy You\u2019ll Love The Cold Shoulder\n1. Burns calories without exercise. Whether you\u2019re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you \u2013 the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.\n2. Saves time. It takes about 30s to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Then you go about your day until the ice melts, and it's another thirty seconds to take it off and put it back into the freezer.  Do that twice a day, and you've spent 2 minutes to burn 500 calories. Compare that to the same calories burned in a gym workout, which can consume several hours once you include travel time, change room time, and waiting for the machines that are busy when you want to use them. Two minutes vs. two hours, for the same 500 calories.\n3. It\u2019s effective. The idea is based on decades of research by scientists from Harvard to Cambridge and beyond. Mild cold exposure burns calories \u2013 it\u2019s a scientific fact. The only question is how to do it comfortably, effortlessly.... even fashionably!\n4. It\u2019s comfortable. The first time you wear it, yes, it'll feel cold. But you won\u2019t shiver. After trying it a few times, you\u2019ll hardly notice you\u2019re wearing it. Some of our current users actually look forward to putting it on.\n5. It gets more effective the more you use it. As your body acclimatizes to periodic mild cold exposure, it gets more used to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories. It gets easier and easier to burn off more and more calories, just like going to the gym gets easier the more you do it. This is exactly opposite to drugs or supplements, which usually decrease in effectiveness as your body builds a tolerance to them.\n6. It\u2019s fashionable. You can wear it pretty much anywhere. I've worn it to fancy French restaurants, as part of a 3-piece suit. I even tried wearing it on my wedding day, but my fianc\u00e9 \u2013 now wife \u2013 decided it wasn\u2019t quite ready for that.\n7. Sold direct at wholesale prices. Expect to pay significantly more once this is available in retail stores. There\u2019s no middle man on KickStarter. We\u2019ll manufacture your vest and ship it directly to you.\nHow Does It Work? \nThe Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn\nYou don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure \u2013 such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank \u2013 can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you.  On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.\nFor example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. It\u2019s the water. They spend their day in water that\u2019s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.\nDue to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.\nAny mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it\u2019s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it\u2019s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.\nOur vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:\nDue to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.\nThese are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you'd burn without it.\nExample clinical trial result - Nick Hamilton\nBelow is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss.\nNick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen.\nEvidence from independent scientists\nFor more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it's independent and objective.\nOur Mission\nWe want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn\u2019t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.\nWhy We Need You!\nAlthough we have the designs and prototypes finished and our manufacturer stands ready to produce the vests, the cost of production is high unless we fulfill minimum order quantities. In order to cover the costs of fabric and production at this level, we need to commit to this minimum order quantity to secure the best deal, which can then be passed onto you, with special rewards exclusively offered here on Kickstarter!\nWill It Fit Me?\nWe have sizes to fit everybody from XS to XXX-L. We\u2019ll get your sizing option after the funding period is over.\nThe Details\nInside-out view of the front + back of the vest, showing ice pocket locations.\nRe-inforced stitching at stress points\nVelcro closure on ice pockets to firmly hold ice packs in place\nVelcro closure at the front of the vest, which allows tightening the waist as you lose weight\nThe Cold Neck can be used alone or in conjunction with the vest to add an additional 20-25% calorie burn.\nBacker Rewards\nStretch Goals:\nWomen\u2019s sizes: Although the current vest is unisex, it's not particularly flattering to the female form. If we reach about $40k in funding, we will have enough spare capital to hire a female clothing designer to design a version more tailored to the female form. We envision it as having a fashionable waist-level fabric body-wrapping belt to adjust the waist size, rather than Velcro.  If we get here, and you want a female version of the vest, you'll be able to choose that after the funding period is over, but it'll probably add about an extra month to your delivery date.\nProduction Plan\nOnce funded, we will put in our order for materials. Delivery and preparation of materials may take 2-4 weeks. During that time we\u2019ll confirm sizing for all of our backers and prepare the manufacturing process. To ensure quality construction, we\u2019re personally overseeing manufacturing of our vests in the Los Angeles Fashion district, which requires 4-6 weeks. We source our ice packs from the USA.  Once the vests are made, we\u2019ll prepare them for shipment (at most 1-2 weeks), and then ship them to your door (2-3 days Domestic US, or 1-2 weeks International). \nTotal time from funding to shipment: Between 8-12 weeks within the continental US, plus another 1-2 weeks for international shipments.\nOur Guarantee\nWe are confident that you will be happy with your vests and the results it will produce, but if for any reason you\u2019re not completely satisfied, just send it back (you pay shipping, and please give us a \u201cheads up\u201d first), and we'll repair or replace your vest and ship it back to you free of charge.\nTESTIMONIALS\n\u201cThe Cold Shoulder allowed me to cut body fat while still gaining Lean Body Mass. It\u2019s easy to use and makes experimenting with cold exposure simple.\u201d\u2013 Nick Hamilton\n\u201cAfter just 2 weeks wearing The Cold Shoulder, I lost approximately 5.5% of my body fat. A loss like this for effectively doing nothing is excellent.\u201d\u2013 Robert Camille\n\u201cIn addition to the extra 1.5 lbs I lost using The Cold Shoulder, my second favorite benefit was that my sleep improved. I wore it for a few minutes before bed every night and slept much more soundly than I had done for months.\u201d\u2013 Mike Sirak\n\u201cThanks to The Cold Shoulder I was able to eat 6000 more calories over two weeks while having friends and family visit without any weight gain. It is great to be able to indulge a bit without losing precious progress.\u201d\u2013 Kyle Timblin\n\u201cI lost 5 lbs and an inch off my torso in just 3 weeks using The Cold Shoulder. I wore it only once or twice a day, and it was cool and comfortable.\u201d - Jocelyn Hayes\n\u201cI lost 15 lbs. in 3 weeks.  I lost much of my stomach flab and it was easy to use!\u201d - Anthony Peters\nTHANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nPlease take a look at the rewards - we hope you'll take advantage of our special early bird offer, but any contribution big or small helps lots!

[and what are they?]  AND, of course, ADDING RFID BLOCKING!\nBig Skinny Solves the Top 5 Wallet Problems!\nIn-house designing... all models are based on customer feedback, and the collection evolves over time based on reported functionality and requests. Catherine can really sew; she and her mother Linda sewed our World's Largest Wallet that set a new Guinness World Record at 21 feet long and 10 feet high and it was on wheels!\n  RFID material\nUltra-thin at .08 mm, it's pretty cool looking with a metallic gold/silvery sheen because of the copper and nickel, and it is building a Faraday cage within your Big Skinny wallet to trap those RFID signals! You'll never see it because it is between our layers of nylon or leather/nylon which are almost as thin! Thin is always In and now you can be thin and safe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only major risk that we see is that the factory creating the special RFID layer might delay production in order to fit our small order into their schedule because we are only making one special custom roll of material, so we are only a small customer to them. But by the same token, it could work the other way; they could fit us into their schedule between larger customers orders too.\n\nWe think we have other production risks under control as we have worked already with our very reliable wallet factory and they are very familiar with our previous designs. Incorporating this extra .08 mm RFID layer should not be difficult judging by the prototypes we have created and are out in the world being tested for the past few months.\n\nThe major challenges in this project were creating the right metallic mix and combination of material so that this RFID layer was flexible, ultra-thin, and technologically effective in protecting most RFID frequencies. Balancing thinness and the needed RFID technological efficacy within our functional design aesthetic are the toughest parts of this project. Also, having fun was a must but I think we overcame that challenge in spades.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Good News-Shipping started last week!", "update_content": "happy Spring everyone,\nJust a quick confirmation: shipping from our Reno, Nevada warehouse started last week for domestic orders, and international orders are starting to ship this week.

Despite not making our funding goal, we are continuing the development of the Andromium Platform, and is launching a free public beta at the end of January.\n=========================================================\nToday\u2019s smartphones have power.\nA lot of power. \nThe Snapdragon CPU inside many of your devices is faster than the number one supercomputer in the world in 1996! And it could be just sitting idly in your pocket right now, as you browse Kickstarter on a clunky desktop computer.\nHowever, while smartphones have become incredibly powerful, they still lack the functionality of a desktop.\n\u2026 That\u2019s why we built Andromium.\nOur mission is to democratize the desktop: making it affordable and highly accessible. \nAndromium seamlessly turns your Android device into a desktop computer. It\u2019s affordable, and devilishly easy to use; simply install the app, and plug your phone into the dock.\nAndromium dock charging the smarthphone\nHardware: \nThe Andromium dock embodies sleek, clean design. It\u2019s a combination of the best aesthetics: beautiful, ergonomic, and pleasing to use. We built the Andromium dock with you in mind. We included three full-sized USB ports for all the accessories you would need on a desktop computer, including gaming devices. We\u2019ve also integrated a port for a power cord, so your phone is always charged. \nWe specifically designed the dock with portability in mind. We\u2019ve given it a light, durable, travel friendly design with a flip cover to protect it during transport. On top of this, the dock has been designed so to fit your device without having to remove its slim, protective case.\nAnd Andromium comes in any color. So long as it\u2019s white. \n(We\u2019re incorporating new colors as stretch goals!)\nWireless Keyboard and Bluetooth Mouse\nSoftware:\nMuch of Andromium\u2019s appeal is its software. Gordon \u2013 previously a Senior Engineer at Google \u2013 left the company to pursue his dream of making handheld desktops a reality. He built an incredibly sophisticated Android application and complete Operating System, that has turned this dream a reality. The Andromium OS works in synergy with the dock to turn your phone into a full-fledged desktop computer.  \nThe application integrates seamlessly with your phone, and can be entered and exited simply. While in desktop mode, your phone can still receive calls, text messages and push notifications - so you keep its complete original functionality.\nThe User Interface is receiving a completely updated redesign to make it even friendlier. We\u2019ve built out all the functionality, and we\u2019re ecstatic with how it works. We\u2019ve teamed up with some of the best User Interface and User Experience designers in the industry to take Andromium\u2019s aesthetics up to the quality of its performance. Adopting the best elements of Windows 7 and OSX UI paradigms, we\u2019re creating a sleek, intuitive experience that highlights Andromium\u2019s functionality and power.\nGame Time!\nWhy Andromium is perfect for you:\nIn our modern world, many people own multiple computers. It\u2019s not uncommon for someone to have a work laptop, a home desktop, a home entertainment system, and a smartphone. Up until now, this may have been necessary. However, with the power of Andromium, everything changes. \nYou can now watch movies, edit spreadsheets, create PowerPoints, and do your work, all from your phone! And, you can do all of this without sacrificing the efficiency and usability of a full screen desktop interface, or wasting money on buying extra computing hardware. As the power of smartphones evolve, the home is evolving with it.\n\u201cWith the power of Andromium, everything changes\u201d.'\nAndromium enables TRUE multitasking with a desktop browser\nWhat you can do on Andromium:\nAndromium turns your smartphone into a personal desktop computer. No catch. Play your favorite games with friends \u2013 Super Smash Bros, GTA, or Legend of Zelda. We can\u2019t promise Andromium will get you past the water temple in OOT, but it will certainly allow you to try. \nMake your work entirely mobile. Any time, anywhere there\u2019s a TV/Monitor and your smartphone, you have your entire desktop, OS, and files there with you. Create, edit, or collaborate using all of the programs of the Office suite. Andromium is optimized to allow you to use powerful and sophisticated programs without a worry, and without the limitations of a five inch screen. \nAndromium desktop UI\nDevices compatible with Andromium:\nAndromium is designed for the most popular series in Android phones, the Samsung Galaxy. It works with both the Galaxy S and Note series (S3 - 2GB RAM version, S4, Note2, Note3, Note4). Currently S5 does not fit in the dock due to the USB port cover, but rest assured - we are supporting S5 also, via Chromecast.\nUpdate (12/20/2014): To our backers, we heard you! We are expending our supported devices list: HTC One M8, LG N5/G3, Motorola Nexus 6, and One Plus One will be supported via Chromecast (see http://andromiumos.blogspot.com/2014/12/andromium-os-chromecast-nexus-6-support.html for more information on Chromecast support). We are also in the process of designing a new docking station for LG N4, HTC One M7 phones that can also be used for the devices listed above. (We are designing a new docking station because Samsung HTC/LG/Moto devices all uses different and incompatible USB video-out connectors, so 2 new dock design is required). Andromium OS will be Chromecast ready for our Late Jan 2015 Andromium OS Playstore release. We are targeting summer 2015 (July timeframe) to ship out the new docking stations for the LG and HTC devices, for user who want to use docking station instead of Chromecast.\nAndromium Lockscreen\nProject Inspiration\nIn part, Andromium is built on the legacy of Motorola\u2019s \u2018Webtop\u2019, and Ubuntu Edge. However, these projects were heavily governed by brand exclusivity, and non-modular software; meaning they would likely only ever be compatible with the specific device they were built for. Unlike these projects, our dream at Andromium is to develop this hybrid platform and make it ubiquitous, bringing it to as many models of Android smartphones as possible. We want to provide the option of a portable desktop from your smartphone, while still allowing users to choose their favorite phone. We want to break down the asymmetries between technological access in the developing and developed world, and the best place to start is maximizing compatibility.\nFuture Goals\nInternet is the great equalizer of the modern world. \nOur driving motivation and key medium term goal is to bring Andromium to developing nations where it can have the largest impact. This year, an estimated 224 million smartphones were sold in India alone. 92% of those sales were made to people who had never owned any computing devices before. Due to their relatively low cost, broad distribution and multi-purpose functionality, smartphones have proliferated throughout the developing world at rates much faster than traditional computers. \nMost families in these nations share a single entry level smartphone for their internet access. Their children are at an educational disadvantage. We want to empower those families to access a higher grade of technological opportunity at marginal costs. By making it possible for families to hook up their device to existing TVs, Andromium unlocks the full power of the Internet, computers and the opportunities these provide.\nWe hope we can extend this equality to families, providing them with access to powerful platforms to work, learn and play; natural extensions of desktop computing that the developed world takes for granted. We want to empower the billions of people who will own entry-level smartphones to access a higher grade of technological access at marginal costs. \nThe power of Smartphone\nThe Team\nGordon Zheng\nGordon has over 12 years of software development experience. With a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and an MBA from Georgetown University, Gordon has the technical and business acumen to make Andromium a success. Before leaving to start Andromium, he was a Senior Engineer at Google, developing their global payment security and monitoring system. This is on top of being part of their Tier 3 Crisis Support team, where he helped handle emergency payment errors, and even combat malicious fraud. Unlocking the power of the smartphone is Gordon\u2019s passion. As the Head Developer of the Andromium project, he has realized the potential of the hardware we take for granted. Drawing on his years of experience at the top of his field, he has created a powerful OS application, and is excited to release his work to the world.\nAlejandro Zuccolillo\nMeet Alejandro Zuccolillo, our Director of Communication and Design. Graduating Cum Laude in Business Administration from Lynn University, Boca Raton, and with an extensive personal background in angel investment and entrepreneurship, he brings a wealth of clinical expertise and passion to Andromium. He has spent years doing philanthropic work with public schools in the Favelas of Paraguay, his home country, where he helped improve school infrastructure and taught English to students. These experiences cemented his belief in the capacity for Andromium to upskill and empower youth education and employment opportunities in developing nations. He believes Andromium could democratize the desktop, enfranchising his students \u2013 and many more - into the global economy.\nLydia Sugarman\nLydia is our Director of Marketing, and is bringing Andromium to the world. She founded her own marketing company, PrivateLabel Interactive, at the beginning of 2001. The mission has been to empower organisations, for profit and non-profit with smart online marketing to build engaged communities. She has managed sales and marketing and business development for entrepreneurial ventures in diverse business verticals, both in the US and internationally that provides broad-based insights.  Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up environment shaped her unique marketing perspective and we are ecstatic to have someone with her experience on our team, ensuring the power of Andromium reaches as many people as possible.\nProject Update:\nAs requested by few supports, we have included a video to provide a more details look of the Andromium Platform as well as OS walkthrough", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn terms of hardware, the Andromium device is already built and completely functional. We are counting on your support to enable production on a larger scale. \n\nOur software and UI are presently ready for Andromium users.

Once we\u2019ve launched, we look forward to working with more developers as they create applications for the platform. We\u2019ve created this powerful OS and we\u2019re really excited to see what people can build on it. \n\nWe\u2019ve worked hard, and we\u2019ve been cautious to not release this project for funding prematurely. Our meticulous attention to the technical aspects of this project, extensive testing, and knowledge of the entrepreneurial process have allowed us to minimize risks and prepare for inevitable challenges. \n\nWe hope you\u2019ll share in our excitement, our mission, and support Andromium in any way you feel appropriate.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Andromium Inc.\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nSentio (formerly Andromium) is building a future where the only computer you'll need is your smartphone.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Andromium Platform Post Kickstarter Campaign", "update_content": "Hi Andromium supporters and backers.

All interactions within Andromium apps are desktop style. Meaning double right click opens folders or apps, right selects and left click menu, app bar buttons to resize, maximize, minimize and close windows for each app, etc. With the completion of our SDK we can say that Andromium is an entire linux based desktop operating system that, while still running native android apps, takes over the phone when it detects a keyboard, mouse and video out (even via wireless, bluetooth or infrared--who uses THAT anymore!

X-Y Pad Mode for Intuitive Sound Creation! Use your finger as an instrument! Utilizing the touch panel, we will create a X-Y pad mode where users can generate sounds intuitively using their fingers.\nCheck out this KDJ-ONE walkthrough video by one of our developers.\n\nPLAY\n\n\n1. Everything you need for music production is already included\nThe KDJ-ONE includes a synthesizer, sequencer, and sampler.\nYou have 6 tracks for any combination of instruments or sounds you wish to use.\nChoose your sounds\nUse the synthesizer to change and mix wave forms, toggle ADSR parameters, select effectors to use, and add LFOs to spice things up.\nIf that doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry. You can use any of the several hundred preset instruments as-is. Each was created by industry leading sound designers Davide Carbone and Josh Abrahams, plus the synth master Katsunori Ujiie.\nSynthesizer editing the ADSR\nOnce you've selected a sound, you can lay notes down on an intuitive piano roll using the sequencer. There are various ways to record your sound; real time recording, step recording, or by just tapping on the touchscreen as if using a pen. Use whichever method you're most comfortable with to make the music that you want to make.\nSequencer with a piano roll\nIf you need to change the sound parameters at a particular time, you can use automation. Various parameters including volume, pan, and more may be changed according to the timing you want.\nNeed vocals on your track? Attach an audio interface via the USB port, connect your microphone, and turn on the sampler. You will get the vocal audio data, and you can even change the pitch or tempo without affecting the actual data, thanks to the ACIDized wav format.\n2. Create sound continuously for 10 hours\nWith its small size, light weight, and 10 hour battery life, you can bring it along with you anywhere you go. Whether you want to kill time during that long flight or you're overcome by sudden inspiration, the KDJ-ONE will be there for you.\n\n3. Intuitive controls with the Touch Panel, Jog Dial, Keypads,  Analog Stick, and D-Pad\nWhen it comes to making music, there's nothing like having a good set of keys in front of you. That's why the KDJ-ONE was designed with a velocity-sensitive keyboard, allowing for unparalleled precision when recording or performing live. Of course, there's no need to limit yourself to a single interface; the touchscreen, jog dial, and d-pad are all there to help you control your notes in a manner that's comfortable for you. For example, you can start out by laying down your notes with the keypad and then use the touchscreen or d-pad to shift them around. Select individual notes or a sequence and lengthen them or copy the pattern and have it repeat. No matter how you work, the KDJ-ONE aims to accommodate you.\n\n4. USB enables Wi-Fi, MIDI controllers, Audio Interface, PC, and storage connections\nThe KDJ-ONE is able to connect to various devices and networks via USB. Plugging in a Wi-Fi card will get you online to share your pattern data with others using SoundCloud, Facebook or Twitter, or download samples. While connecting a MIDI controller will allow you to control the KDJ-ONE with your favorite device. Audio interfaces can be connected to record from an external audio sources such as guitars or microphones. The KDJ-ONE also uses a USB connection to connect to your PC or storage device, allowing you to backup and secure your work or import/export samples and audio data such as vocals, guitar, or recordings of other live instruments.\n\n5. Win/Mac App & VSTi/AU Plugin support\nThe KDJ-ONE can be used in conjunction with DAWs such as ProTools or Cubase as a VSTi Plugin, or with Logic as an AU Plugin.\n\nComputer App - Plays nice with others\nIncluded with every purchase of a KDJ-ONE device is a copy of the KDJ PC application, which serves as an interface between your computer and the device. Using this tool you will be able to save and back up any work you've done onto your computer and, if you so desire, export the music to any other DAW you may own.\n\nThe PC application also features its own editing mode with a user interface optimized for keyboard & mouse control. For those of you experienced in creating music on your computers, we are confident that this solution will give you the tools you need.\n\n6. Perform live as a DJ!\nIf your creativity needs an output and you're no stranger to performing in front of crowds, hook up your KDJ-ONE to some speakers and try your hand at the (currently in-development) live performance mode. We're looking into using all of those handy buttons and dials to give you a device that can emulate common functions assigned to MIDI controllers. Some features on the drawing board include the ability to assign samples and loops to each key on the keypad.\n\nYou can program your sounds too\n\n7. SDK to create your own Apps\nCode-savvy musicians will be able to take advantage of the KDJ-ONE's open-platform SDK, which will allow them to modify the KDJ-ONE to their liking. Write and add apps as you need them or share them with friends!\n\n\nThe KDJ-ONE is the brainchild of Rui Sato, Yutaka Oowada, and Shinnosuke Asahara; the founding members of CyberStep and college buddies from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. To make their project into reality, they've gathered excellent illustrators and designers from across Japan and taken on an international team of community relation managers and support staff.  \n\nMeet our staffs:\n\nRui Sato - CEO of CyberStep  \nYutaka Owada - CTO of CyberStep\nShinnosuke Asahara - R&D Director of CyberStep\nMasashi Futada - Hardware Engineer  \nMichitaka Kawabe - Hardware Engineer  \nKeizo Maeda - Former tutor of TIOT, Hardware/Software Engineer\nShigeru Hiraki - Head of the System Engineering Department\nRyota Takahashi - Global Sales and Support\nAaron Hearn - Composer & Programmer\nByron Blakeman - US Sales and Support\nKeiichi Sueta - Designer\nYumi Tsukuda - Designer\nYasutomo Morita - Designer\nAnna Morozova - Web Designer\n\n\nCyberStep is a Japanese publicly traded company established in 2000. While the KDJ-ONE is CyberStep's first foray into developing commercial electronics, we have the personnel and connections to make this project into reality. To ensure that our supporters receive a device that they\u2019ll be satisfied with, we will oversee the setup and maintenance of the infrastructure from start to finish before starting production. All funds put towards the KDJ-ONE will be devoted to securing the proper facilities and materials required to ensure that the KDJ-ONE project is a success.

As the KDJ-ONE is CyberStep\u2019s first commercial electronic device, we are new to the process and are faced with a seemingly endless list of suppliers and parts, with no assurance concerning quality or reliability. CyberStep has already begun correspondence with factories in these regions in order to ensure a swift transition from parts selection, to manufacturing & assembly, and finally to distribution. \n\nCurrently, there is a possibility that some of the necessary parts may take up to 6 months to ship, which is why the shipment date has been tentatively established at July 2015. We will be providing our backers with updates as we progress through each step of the development process.\n\nCyberStep prides itself on embracing innovative ideas and looks forward to seeing the KDJ-ONE project become reality. A lot of resources have been invested into redeveloping the device, and with your help, we\u2019d like to make the final drive to bring these long-held dreams to fruition. Thank you for your support.

Whether he is on your desk in his Pixel Power board or in an Arduino, his big LED eyes draw you in. His large size makes him easy for makers of all ages and skills to build. \nEveryone Loves Chip!\nChip is easy to build for all skill levels, especially beginners. \nChip encourages exploration and play. \nChip can be used to learn other skills, such as programming. \nChip is fun. \nChip is educational and builds S.T.E.A.M. Skills.\nMany soldering kits do not offer anything more than a battery and a LED. Once completed, those kits end up in a drawer, never to be used again. At the other end of the spectrum, there are electronic kits that are really interesting but have so many parts that they are intimidating for beginners. That is why we designed Chip to be simple to assemble and interactive when complete. \nChip Builds S.T.E.M / S.T.E.A.M Skills\nSTEAM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math education. STEAM is about developing innovators and critical thinkers. It is about real world learning. \nIn the real world, content knowledge is interwoven and layered, not isolated.  STEAM curriculum focuses on collaboration, cooperation, and communication through project-based cross subject learning. In the real world, for example, baking a cake requires one to use math, science, and art to accomplish the task. \nChip, is designed with these STEAM foundations in mind. Chip builds on skills sets and grows from an instructional electronics kit, to a soldering skill builder,  to a tool to teach and learn programming with.   \n\"Personal-Eyes\"\nEach kit comes with four sets of LEDS so that you can make your Chip your very own. Will you choose Buddy Blue, Radiant Red, Glowing Green, or Yummy Yellow?\nPixel Power \nEach Chip comes with it's own Pixel Power.  It is Chip's stand and battery power.  Like Chip, the Pixel Power is a cross-medium, multifunctional board and skill builder. \nThe Pixel Power starts as a kit, but when assembled it can be used for other projects. For example, it can be used with conductive thread as a sewable battery and switch for e-craft and e-textile projects. \nKit Contents\nEach Chip Kit Includes: CHIP PCB, Pixel Power PCB, (2) Buttons, Slide Switch, Male Right Angle Header, Female Header, (2) 220Ohm Resistors, Battery Clip, (2) 10mm Blue LEDS, (2) 10mm Red LEDS, (2) 10mm Green LEDS, (2) 10mm Yellow LEDs, (1) 3-volt Coin-cell Battery\n An Hour of Code\nWhen you plug Chip into an Arduino, you can control Chip's eyes with programming. Chip is an excellent way to get kids involved in Computer Science and take part in the Hour of Code initiative.  \nWhat is an Arduino? Arduino.cc\nSALDUINO UNO R3\nWe love the Arduino Uno R3.  It is one of the best boards for beginners and advanced makers.  We just wanted a few more features so we worked with Tully Gehan of Factory For All to create the SALDUINO UNO R3.  100% Arduino compatible and Chip fits perfectly. We include a USB cable to connect to your PC or MAC. As a special Kickstarter reward we have CHIP and a SALDUINO combo. \nWe need your support.\nPlease select a reward to help us make Chip a reality. \n\nYour pledges not only fund the mass production of Chip to an affordable price but helps us to continue developing more kits that makes learning electronics more accessible to all skill types, young and old.\n\nSo, please support us and spread the word.  \n\nEvery little bit counts and we are eternally grateful.\n\n\nThe design is done. The prototypes have been checked.  We have lined up our suppliers and have funded the early-bird rewards out of our own pocket so they can ship immediately in December. All we need now is your support, please choose your reward.\nThe Pixel Pals - a little history of Chip\nChip is a part of the Pixel Pals. He and his friends live on Planet M and they love making, tinkering, and inventing.  Through their adventures, they learn about different materials and technologies, solve problems, and explore new ideas. \nWe have plans for all the Pixel Pals. Each Pixel Pal has their own personality and functionality. Like Chip, they work as a standalone character or they can plug into Arduino.\nWe see the Pixel Pals as a way to connect with young makers and encourage them to explore and create.\nThe Pixel Pals journey started almost two years ago. We wanted characters that would be fun, have personality, and could be used to build STEAM and Maker skills. After many trials, we commissioned an artist who drew us the sketch below. When we saw it, we knew instantly that these were the Pixel Pals we envisioned. We have expanded the Pixel Pals to include eight characters and we plan to release each of them. \nPixel Pals Original Sketch\nThe Pixel Pals are not just electronics, but rather a set of characters that cross physical and digital mediums from electronics, e-crafts, 3D printing, programing, and digital design. Chip already has an adventure workbook.\nAt the Greater Newark Area Mini Maker Faire we introduced the very first Pixel Pal adventure - PIXEL PALS RESCUE MISSION: HELP CHIP FIX HIS CIRCUITS. The book is an introduction to paper circuits where you have to help Chip repair his ship. Geared towards the youngest makers, the activities in the book use everyday materials to create circuits. This and our current Kickstarter are just the tip of the iceberg of how we see the Pixel Pals can be used to build STEAM skills. \nAbout Soldering Sunday\nSoldering Sunday Team: Jean, Paul, Lee\nAn Adventure in Making Makers\nThe most import thing we make at Soldering Sunday is more makers. We believe that tinkering and making are part of who we are as humans and that the things makers make can change the world. It does not mater if you are an engineer, an artist, a mom, a dad, an educator, a student, a hobbyist, or a professional maker. We want to help you explore new ideas, connect with fellow makers, and create the things that you are passionate about.  \nKicking it Forward\nWe believe in the concept of Kicking it Forward, and it makes sense for us as creators to support other creators. http://kickingitforward.org\nI Want One But I Don't Know How To Solder\nNo problem. Soldering is not magic and it is not hard. It is a learned skill and with a little guidance anyone can do it.  Chip will come with a full set of detailed instructions, as well as a video how-to guide. For those teaching soldering, we will have curriculum for you as well. \n\nOne of our inspirations, and still the best soldering resource around, comes from Mitch Altman. Mitch Altman, Andie Nordfren, and Jeff Keyzer put together a 7-page comic book on just how to solder.  it is translated into numerous languages and is available for free.  (click on it to go to the Might Ohm download page)\n\nIf you are looking for personal help on how to solder and are local to New Jersey, you are always welcome to come to FUBAR Labs.  Every Sunday at FUBAR is open to the public for Soldering Sunday (yes, this is where we got our name from). Check the FUBAR Meetup Group for times and other classes. \nNot local to New Jersey, there are plenty of Makerspaces, Hackerspaces,  and Fab Labs around the globe where you can learn. \n\nThank you again for your support. You can always find us at SolderingSunday.com or on Tindie.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk the project has is a delay in production. We have worked with our suppliers for several years now and are confident with their track record that this is not a big risk at all. With that said, anything can happen, so we took additional steps to minimize any risk.\n\nFirst, we have gone through several small scale runs of prototypes and worked out any issues. Second, and most importantly, we have already ordered and funded the early bird rewards with our own money. We believe in this and we are in this with all of you. The early bird rewards are scheduled to arrive just before the completion of the campaign and will ship to backers as soon as payment is received. \n\nAdditional rewards will be ordered right at the completion of the campaign.

The most successful people in all industries have a sharp eye for analyzing information but yet have a very visually fluid process of thinking. We are all born with these latent capabilities. These features are inside each and every one of us but need to be nurtured for them to strengthen.\n\nWe think programmatic animation is one of the most fun, creative and powerful ways to engage your mind and at the same time create content that will stand out on the web.\nOne of our most popular courses is our HTML with Mom \u2013 where I grabbed my mom that barely know how to check her emails and taught her HTML. Check out some of our other projects on 02skills.com\nWe think learning should be fun and engaging for example our project from last year when My mom joined me to learn HTML \u2013 Check that intro out to see our style.\nWhy learn with us?\nLearning is about being part of a community\nWe know that learning a new skill is hard so we make it easier by making it easier for you to connect with other students learning the same thing at the same time. We integrated commenting in every area of the site to make it easier for you to interact with other students and with us. We have unlimited live support. We will never give up on you, we will be with you until you get it.\nOur motto is \u201clearning better is better\u201d. In the age of twitter and social media most modern online education content assumes a lot about the user. We do our best to simplify and make complex topics really simple and fun. So far we created 103 courses over the last 3 years. Our videos have been viewed over 1,000,000 times, we have 15,000 students and just crossed our 1000 4-5 star review line.\nOver the years we created many topics but most of them have never been published and are only available for our 02GEEK members. We didn't publish them because the costs associated with publishing content on the web: creating the art work, editing, promos, networking, ads and so forth. As such until now we only published courses we knew would sell well while courses we couldn't invest the capital in promoting them we kept as exclusive content for our members.Our goal is to publish our content and have it  on 02skills.\nThanks & giving 5% back\nThanks for believing in us and helping us cross our goal as our way to thank back the KickStarter community we will be kicking it foreword and investing 5% of our income back to projects of the community.  We want to thank KickStarter as well for making us a Staff Pick.\nAbout us:\nWe are not funded by any large cooperation nor do we have ambitions to take over the world.

It\u2019s really amazing that we've received pledges beyond our initial funding goal. Because of all of your support, we can make our dream come true. And now, we can offer you even more cool things.\nThere are 4 stretch goals. When the goals are met, the following additional rewards will be added to the rewards of every backer who get a machine (i.e. backers who pledge $499 or more). The rewards are all consistent with our 3 core ideas: UNLIMITED, ELEGANT, and SIMPLE. All of them will enhance the FLUX for every user.\nA Difficult Choice Made Easy\nWith so many 3D printer options, it can be difficult to decide on the right model. Luckily, FLUX makes the choice easy by combining printing, scanning, laser engraving, and more modular functions. It is the only 3D printer you will ever need \u2013 for work or at home.\nThe Right Choice for Everyone\nUnlimited, elegant, and simple \u2014 FLUX is the right choice for everyone because it is simple to set up, elegantly designed, and has an unlimited capacity for expansion. In addition to the basic FFF (fused filament fabrication) 3D printing, FLUX is equipped with a built-in 3D scanner and supports an ever-increasing array of interchangeable modules. FLUX is the everything 3D printer that grows with you\u2014 meeting not only your 3D printing needs today, but also of all your tomorrows.\nWith FLUX\u2019s modular design, customizing your FLUX experience to meet your specific needs is a cinch. Modules come with magnets for effortless interchangeability\u2013no tools needed.\n3D Printing\nFLUX\u2019s 3D printer uses high resolution stepper motors to print objects of stunning quality. The 3D printer comes with three efficient cooling fans that enable printing with precision at top speed while minimizing the risk of malfunction due to overheating.\n3D Scanning\nNot everyone can make 3D models. FLUX has a built-in 3D scanner that allows you to clone 3D objects effortlessly \u2013 just like using a copy machine. No need to learn complicated software! The only limit is your imagination.\nLaser Engraving (Expandable Option)\nPersonalize your creation with FLUX\u2019s laser engraver. FLUX\u2019s first interchangeable module is a 200mW laser head that allows you to take your creativity to the next level.\nAnd MORE!\nThe laser engraving module is only the beginning. Many other modules are under development, including a dual extruder, a ceramics extruder, and a pastry extruder (for chocolate, jam, and many other edibles).\nFLUX has an open module SDK. Besides developing our own new modules, we have also invited other talented engineers to create more modules and to share their ideas with the user community. We are collaborating with several promising startups to develop innovative toolheads for special materials and applications!\nFLUX is the most elegant 3D printer on the market. Enjoy watching your creativity take center stage!\nPerfect for Any Setting\nFLUX is extremely compact. Unruly wires are hidden from sight. Its elegant look fits any setting or decor. It is small enough to blend in with your living space but large enough to satisfy your creativity.\nFLUX is not only just another gadget \u2013 it will change how you see the world. Imagine this: you want to prepare a special gift for your significant other. She adores chocolate \u2013 and elephants. If only you could give her a chocolate elephant. \nWith FLUX, you can! Simply choose an elephant model from the open source files or scan your own model, swap in the chocolate-printing module, and press print! Why settle for a generic gift when you can customize the perfect present every time?\nSimple Setup \nGo from unboxing to printing in just a few minutes. FLUX is built with several easy-to-assemble modular components. When FLUX needs repair, just replace specific parts instead of the entire machine.\nWi-Fi Operation\nOperate FLUX with ease from your smartphone! FLUX is designed to connect wirelessly to your smartphone, tablet, or other devices via Wi-Fi. \nFLUX Studio: User-friendly Interface\nFLUX Studio (currently in development) provides user-friendly softwares for more sophisticated design needs. FLUX Studio simplifies the process of 3D modeling, hardware control, and system configuration. \nWhile FLUX Studio is extremely intuitive and easy for beginners, the advanced settings also provide a robust tool for professional users.\nFLUX was built from scratch. We gathered the team and each member wrote down all the functions and capabilities we wanted in FLUX. Some were attainable while some were just fantasy, but that\u2019s where our dream started.\nWe took the best parts of open source designs and infused them with our own ideas. Our dream took shape with the rotatable base for the scanner, interchangeable modules, and seamless integration of software and hardware.\nWe have been through 4 different prototype versions and built over 30 working units. We showcased our creation at Maker Faire. We are now ready to take the next step of mass production.\nWe want to create a 3D printing lifestyle where everyone can explore his or her creativity. To enable this lifestyle, FLUX is priced within the reach of most households.  \nOur machine is fully functional as demonstrated by our video. Our current main priority is to begin mass production. Building a single prototype and producing in large quantities are two different things. We are doing everything we can to provide you the best product, but we will need your support for our project and our dream.\nWhile we prepare for mass production, we are putting on the final touches to refine the existing integration of the software and hardware. \nWe are a young, but professional team from Taiwan. We have recruited top talent who share the same passion for 3D printing and the dream to bring 3D printing into everyone\u2019s lives.\nOur team includes specialists in industrial design, software programming, hardware engineering, marketing, and operations. Our team slowly came together through previous business projects, where we not only acquired knowledge and experience in a range of fields, but also learned how to work seamlessly as a team. Now is the time for us to combine our talent and passion to build FLUX through mass production.\nWe also have many experienced mentors, advisors, and motivators behind the scenes. Of course, that includes our backers on Kickstarter! We believe that our team will get bigger and stronger with your support!\nWe are honored to announce that the team of Discov3ry (www.structur3d.io) has collaborated with us as our first partner in technological development in early October this year. With their outstanding input, we believe that all modules of FLUX can be developed sooner and work better!\nThe Last Magical Ingredient: You\nWe are dedicated to beautify all that is around us by promoting the use of 3D printers. We believe that this will lead to improving the quality of people\u2019s lives, and our ultimate dream of changing the world.\nAppreciation is extended to every open-sourcer that has made this product possible. This is just the beginning of our journey, and we are inviting you to join us. If you are interested in our product, we look forward to hearing from you. Whether you make an actual purchase or simply offer a piece of advice, your feedback is extremely valuable to us.\nWe are grateful to everyone who has helped us out along the way, and that includes you. Thanks for reading about our project and hopefully we can hand over our FLUX to you in the near future.\nAnd Creators Of Magical 3D Models!\nJulia Vase #011 by Virtox\nLow-Poly Totodile by Flowalistik\nMarble Head by Bdipaolo\nWith Creative Commons - Attribution License", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to prepare this product for manufacturing, but we still face several challenges.\n\nINJECTION MOLDING\nFor a high quality machine, we require precise parts. Therefore, we decided to produce our parts with injection molding. Injection molding requires large capital expenses, which means that we need to secure a very reliable manufacture partner that will deliver great quality. We have talked to many reliable manufacturers in Taiwan who would like to support our production. All we need is the capital to execute mass production. There is typically a 60-day lead time to fabricate the molds, and this is where delays may occur because we strictly demand the best quality for our parts. To prevent this delay, we have also been working hard with mold design specialists.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS \nOur components can be divided into two categories: injection molding parts and other parts. We have already secured some of the suppliers for the other components. The remaining issue is setting up warehouses for the production line. This is why we are constantly working with supply chain specialists to establish an efficient and reliable production line \u2013 so that we can deliver this amazing product to you as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "FLUX Delta Family Warranty Policy", "update_content": "Hello, FLUX Delta and FLUX Delta+ users!\nAfter busy months of production and shipping of our new product, FLUX Delta+, our community is growing stronger and more people are enjoying the fun of digital creation. \nTo provide better customer support, we will update the FLUX Delta Family (FLUX Delta / FLUX Delta+) warranty policy, the new policy will be effective in one week (2017/5/5).\n[ FLUX Delta Warranty Policy Update ]"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "To Enter the 4th Year of FLUX!", "update_content": "Hi backers,\nIt's been a while since the last Kickstarter update.

But Google hasn\u2019t built an app for Gmail on the desktop like it has on iOS and Android.\nApps like Outlook and Mail wipe away all the unique power of Gmail, leaving many of us to do on the desktop what we\u2019d never want to do on our phones - use it in the browser, buried in the chaos of web browsing.\nWe\u2019d dreamed of turning Gmail into a powerful, fluid email client that not only makes Gmail easier to use, but goes way beyond and makes a beautiful statement about what email itself could be like.\nAfter 18 months, it\u2019s now almost here. We just need your help to launch.\nIn building a humanized email client, we wanted to acknowledge basic truths -- like that many of us have more than one Gmail account (personal, school, work, etc). We wanted you to avoid having to sign in over and over every time you close your browser or restart your computer, and we wanted it to work all the time, flawlessly.\nGoogle has struggled to make this work well at all in the browser, where you frequently get signed out at random and generally have a poor experience. We spent months developing and refining a new technology that allows it to \"just work\" work all the time, without sign-ins or typing or any extra effort on your part. \nUSE YOUR EMAIL WITHOUT BEING BURIED BY IT\nA huge piece of what we wanted to do with Gmail for Mac was to radically simplify the effort and \"cognitive burden\" of using your email. It's something we do all day long, all the time, and it should be as easy as breathing. \nWe've made radical new ways - entirely unique to our client - for filtering out the noise of email alerts and unread counts that come at you all day long. We've also honed the user experience so that nearly everything you do constantly can be reached in a single click or gesture (navigating your email, writing a new message, opening your inbox, etc). This is the kind of iOS-like focus & simplicity that has liberated us all on mobile. We wanted to do that for email on the desktop. \nAND...\nSIMPLE. POWERFUL. BEAUTIFUL.\nThe difference between using Gmail in the browser and Gmail in our streamlined and powerful app is enormous, and ultimately one we feel will make your email life easier and more friendly. \nMore Details\nABOUT US\nThe guys behind Zive are Eric Shashoua and Ryan Shetley, but we've been joined by an amazing team of designers and developers who share the same idealistic dream of beautiful, simple, and obsessively designed software. We believed we could make a real difference in some of the tools people use most often by making them beautiful, seamless, and effortless on a level that\u2019s encountered too seldomly outside of Apple. We wanted to build a company where the work itself mattered more to us than the bottom line or any traditional goal of business. And ... we wanted it to be human. \nOur team brings to Zive 10+ years of experience designing and developing software and consumer electronics, as well as developing for iOS and the Mac. As the former CEO / Co-Founder of Zeo, Inc., Eric raised $14M in venture funding and had a chance to work with the leaders of Bose and iRobot in learning how to design products that are truly focused on the user. Zeo\u2019s products have been marketed and sold throughout the US and Europe, and have led to being called out to Cupertino in connection with being featured in Apple Stores. Ryan brings to our bold and scrappy team a novel approach to technology, where engineering effort is focused intensely on the user experience rather than the usual product development approach. The rest of our team consists of awesome and intensely passionate designers, a couple artists, and folks who've spent years developing for and falling madly in love with the Mac.  \nDisclaimer: Though we love Gmail and we love the Mac, Zive is not affiliated in any way with either Google nor Apple and is an independent third party. Gmail for Mac, by Zive, is a product made entirely by Zive, Inc. and no other company. \nWe need your help! Where the funds go:\nWe already have a polished alpha, but we've started this Kickstarter to get to launch. What that means:\nBeta testing phase before launch\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite upgrade completion\nPossible Inbox by Google integration\nCommunity to help us test, give feedback, and ... well, we just think you guys would be awesome even if you do none of that. \nMarketing funding to help get the word out at launch\nSo, we're after supporters, a few enthusiastic folks to help us beta test, and launch funding to help kick off the product launch. Please join us and become a part of our bold dream to elevate Gmail to a whole new level!\nFor your support of us, we've lined up what we think would be really great rewards for anyone who joins on -- starting with a copy of the full version of Gmail for Mac! Take a look at our rewards right on this page!\nAnd thank you for supporting Gmail for Mac, by Zive!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile most kickstarters launch with a concept or prototype, we feel that most of the risk in our project has already been mitigated by having moved far beyond that stage to an alpha version of Gmail for Mac, by Zive. \n\nLaunch Timing: With any software development, there are potential risks in unforeseen variables causing delays in launch. While this is always a possibility, we don't expect this to play a significant role given the stage we're at. We have already made a tremendously detailed effort to create a streamlined and extremely reliable application. \n\nWe feel confident that we could launch Gmail for Mac not long after the conclusion of our Kickstarter. \n\nExperience: We've done this before successfully a few times over, and our team has extensive experience designing, building, and selling software through Apple's app and retail stores. \n\nThis is the only project we are running, and has the undivided attention of our team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 414, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1919581657/gmail-for-mac-finally-gmail-is-a-true-desktop-emai", "project_name": "Gmail for Mac: Finally, Gmail is a true desktop email client"}}, {"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Don't have time to see the full 7 minute video?Jump to the section most interesting for you:\nBITalino Introduction (2:46) | What's New (1:05) | Meet the Team (0:34)\nExamples:\nMotionBIT (0:45) | ArousalBIT (0:50) | MuscleBIT (0:44) | BITalino in Education (0:59)\nFollow us on:\n                 BITalino is a low-cost, purpose-built, all-in-one hardware and software toolkit designed for quick and easy creation of cool projects with body signals, development of quantified self wearable devices or apps, and/or learning how to build medical devices. Comparative professional-grade tools for this purpose can easily cost in excess of $10,000; our vision is to make them available for anyone, and harness the power and creative thinking of the open-source movement to boost innovation in biosignal-based applications in unprecedented ways.\nOut-of-the-box, BITalino provides a set of versatile, Arduino-compatible software and hardware blocks with sensors for Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Accelerometry (ACC), and Ambient Light (LUX), including Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication to a software toolkit to see the signals in real time or replay offline. What\u2019s next? Ever since we launched, our dream has been to make BITalino more affordable, more capable, and packed with much-sought features our amazing community has been asking for. Your pledge will help us trigger a true BITalino (r)evolution!\nBITalino (r)evolution board\nBody signals have hundreds of applications; assistive technologies for people with disabilities, biofeedback for stroke and muscle disorders rehabilitation, or self-management of psychological disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADHD) are just a few examples. Still, BITalino is an unique DiY toolkit, which can be used by virtually anyone interested in creating projects ranging from muscle activated air drones to heart-rate monitoring bicycle handlebars, smart / enchanted objects, interactive installations, or affordable medical devices and personal diagnostics apps.\nBy supporting our Kickstarter campaign, you can potentially be contributing to revolutionise healthcare and biomedical engineering around the world. BITalino has grown to become the platform of choice for hundreds of people worldwide already, but it wasn\u2019t designed with financial profits in mind, hence the reason we need your help now.\nHeart rate monitoring bicycle handlebars\nBITalino armband controller using muscle & gestures\nLow-cost ECG data acquisition device with 3D-printed enclosure\nMakers: Whether you\u2019re looking for the next challenge or invention, or seeking to enhance an existing prototype, BITalino can open new and exciting pathways for your work.\nStudents: Pursuing a degree in areas related with body signals (e.g. medical, biomedical, psychophysiology)? Looking for a forward-thinking engineering or computer science project? Then BITalino is the right tool for you!\nDevelopers: Want to do quick and easy prototyping of wellbeing and quality of life wearable devices or apps? BITalino can greatly help you in cutting development costs and time.\nProfessors: Enrich your lab activities and student projects with BITalino; the modular hardware and software, makes it a convenient personal companion for your students, and the ideal tool to demonstrate theoretical concepts in practice.\nResearchers: Looking to quickly validate hypothesis, jumpstart your research on a budget, or collect data on dozens of users at once? BITalino can definitely give you a hand.\nQuantified-Selfers: If you\u2019d like to learn more about your body, keep track of your vitals, or create an affordable medical device, BITalino provides you professional-grade quality at DiY costs.\nOver the past year we proved the potential of BITalino, which is perfectly tried and tested and have sold over 1200 units; now we would like to take it to the next level. Our goal is to empower more people to learn, prototype, and build innovative projects with sensors for body signals acquisition both for serious and quirky applications alike. Any help counts and here\u2019s what we can accomplish with you as our backer:\nBITalino (r)evolution kits: That\u2019s right\u2026 our signature hardware base will be fully redesigned to have an incredibly smaller form factor, improved signal quality, Bluetooth Low Energy, digital-to-analog control, reprogrammable firmware, SPI interface for enhanced expansibility, and many other cool features. As before, it will come in the BOARD, FREESTYLE, and PLUGGED flavour, but this time even more affordable!\nBITalino (r)evolution BOARD, PLUGGED and FREESTYLE prototypes\nApplication-specific boards: Can\u2019t find a use for all of the sensors bundled with the kit? Not a problem anymore\u2026 make a pledge to us and we\u2019ll create a series of simpler and more affordable application-specific kits, namely, HeartBIT (1x ECG + 1x BVP), MuscleBIT (1x EMG + 1x ACC), ArousalBIT (1x EDA + 1x BVP), MotionBIT (1x ACC + 1x MAG), BrainBIT (2x EEG), FlowerBIT (1x LUX + 1x TMP + 1x IMP).\nBlocks available as individual components: Until now we haven\u2019t been able to make the different blocks available as individual components. Back us up and we\u2019ll be able to support the production setup costs needed to make batches with the sensor blocks and peripherals found on BITalino (and on the application-specific boards), enabling us to provide them as individual components.\nSensors and peripherals will become available as individual blocks\nAdditional sensors: Users have seen what we can do, and now they\u2019re asking for more; with your help, we\u2019ll be able to expand the possibilities of BITalino with additional sensors. Electroencephalography (EEG), Respiration (RSP), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Skin Temperature (TMP), Force (FSR), Load Cells, and many others.\nImproved cable quality: BITalino is completely rooted in DiY; for that, in the original version we focused on using cables and plugs that would be easily available for anyone, which have shown to have tradeoffs in terms of signal quality and robustness. BITalino (r)evolution will provide you the same DiY capabilities as our previous unit, with the advantage of offering professional-grade plugs and cables as a standard as well.\nBesides DiY cables and plugs, BITalino (r)evolution will have professional-grade counterparts\nMemory card accessory: The ability to roam around freely while recording your data for later inspection is an all time favorite\u2026 up until now you\u2019d need either a computer or smartphone to log your BITalino data. By backing us, you will be contributing to the development of an accessory interchangeable with the Bluetooth module, that has the ability to log the data collected by your BITalino and control it as well.\nGalvanically isolated USB: So, you\u2019re one of those people who would rather hook up a BITalino to a USB port rather than dealing with all the battery recharging fuss. The thing is that our computers are often either directly or indirectly connected to a mains. Most devices, and in particular the USB, have a few built-in safety features, however there\u2019s nothing like removing any electrical connection between the BITalino and any other circuits. With your help, we\u2019ll be able to create an accessory just for that.\nPrintoo paper-thin flexible technology: You know all too well how stiff PCBs and body curves don\u2019t always add up, and that\u2019s where your pledge come in... BIG TIME! We\u2019ve teamed up with our friends at Printoo to make both platforms compatible, but with your help, we can crank it up to outer space by creating a production version of BITalino based on Printoo\u2019s paper-thin, flexible technology! You\u2019ve read it well\u2026 all the BITalino (r)evolution coolness, in an awesome bendable, twistable, and anatomical form factor. Printoo mentioned in their Kickstarter campaign that it would be possible\u2026 we are making it happen!\nImagine a BITalino like this\u2026 with your help it can be possible!\nThe latest global trends such as the affordable care act from the Obama administration are geared towards making healthcare more accessible for everyone, and towards putting the users back in charge of their healthcare. Technology is a keystone in such change, and our vision is to make BITalino and the DiY body signals community unavoidable references by seeking to make body signals more affordable and accessible to the world.\nThe MakerNurse initiative led by MIT\u2019s Little Devices Lab is one compelling example of this vision. Our goal with BITalino is to get this expertise out of the hands of a few medical device companies and use your pledge to empower millions of students, researchers, makers and developers around the world. By providing low-cost, open-source, and easy-to-use hardware and software tools, more people will be able to learn and build novel applications using body signals, contributing to the creation of next-generation quantified self devices and applications.\nTo top it all up, BITalino is on the epicentre of the S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) movement. Imagine how having BITalino in classrooms can contribute to gear young minds all around the world towards finding novel and innovative ways of addressing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. BITalino gathers the features and functionalities we would like to have had during our education; your support will help us make these technologies more accessible for youth everywhere.\nMoreover, we believe that there are other options beyond wearables, and BITalino has also been positively contributing to transition to a new generation of body signals acquisition technologies that are embedded into your surrounding environment. Some people call these \u201cenchanted objects\u201d, others call them\u201canti-wearables\u201d; the truth is that BITalino is enabling the creation of things like heart rate monitoring bicycle handlebars (as previously shown) and other devices alike. Whether you\u2019re into wearables or anti-wearables, BITalino is the right tool for you.\nResearch-grade body signal acquisition equipment is typically very cumbersome, prohibitively expensive, and with proprietary algorithms and hardware designs. On the other end of the price spectrum you either find affordable devices designed for leisure and quality of life applications but with fixed and unadaptable features and form factors, or DiY projects with a high overhead in terms of electrical engineering and programming skills.\nBITalino brings research-grade technologies to the masses, in the form of a complete DiY hardware and software toolkit accessible to any skill set, and that can be used for prototyping of wearable and quantified self applications in unprecedented ways. This is one kit with a world of possibilities... just take a look at some of the things you can do:\nSurf\u2019s up with MotionBIT\u2026 log your data while riding those awesome waves and share the stats with your friends\nLiving with ALS; use MuscleBIT to control a keyboard and mouse using residual muscle activity.\nArousalBIT allows you to check out your date in new and different ways ;)\nPractitioners can now create their own unique and affordable medical devices; imagine the difference your pledge can make for people in low-income and developing countries!\n  \u2026 but there\u2019s more!\nBITalino is community-driven: One of the strengths of BITalino is the vibrant community; from box designs for 3D printing, to accessories and APIs, this project is bringing together people around body signals. With your pledge we\u2019ll be able to take this BITalino (r)evolution even further\nBITalino gives power to the people: With it\u2019s a convenient all-in-one modular design, BITalino was already in a league of its own, by providing seamless access to tools that typically come with a hefty price tag! Back us, and your contribution will be used to make BITalino even more affordable both as a kit and through the application-specific boards.\nBITalino lets your imagination set the limit: Each individual block can be snapped off and easily combined to prototype anything. You can connect other sensors or interfaces, including your own custom designs.\nBITalino has an open-source friendly design: The hardware uses standard interfaces (UART, Bluetooth, SPI, ...); our software is open-source and fully supported by web-based technologies for maximum flexibility (HTML, CSS, JS).\nBITalino has two main components; the hardware and the software. Below is the main technical information for the full-spec kit:\nSampling Rate: up to 1000Hz\nAnalog Inputs: 4 @ 10-bit + 2 @ 6-bit + 1 @ 6-bit dedicated to the battery level\nAnalog Outputs: 1 @ 8-bit\nDigital Ports: 4 @ 1-bit\nSensors: EMG + ECG + EDA + ACC + LUX (interchangeable and expandable with future sensors)\nActuators: LED + PWM driver\nConnectivity: Bluetooth Low Energy (interchangeable with other interfaces)\nInterfaces: UART + SPI\nBattery: 500mAh 3.7V LiPo single cell (interchangeable with higher capacity alternatives)\nWeight: 20 g\nSize: 60 mm x 50 mm\nSoftware: Multiplatform APIs & SDKs, Firmware, Real-time visualisation & recording, and many other useful tools\nAnatomy of a BITalino (r)evolution\nLaunch: We embark on a global BITalino (r)evolution to take the creation of wearables, quantified self apps, or medical devices to the next level\n$50K: This is our primary goal... back us and help make the BITalino (r)evolution kits, Application-specific boards, Blocks available as individual components, and Improved cabling.\n$75K: Help us go beyond our 1st stretch goal, and you\u2019ll enable the release of the Memory card accessory, Additional sensors, Body signal processing algorithms, and Learning materials.\n$100K: Show your love by helping us reach our 2nd stretch goal, and you\u2019ll be making BITalino history by enabling us to create a version in Printoo\u2019s Arduino based paper-thin flexible technology, as well as a Galvanically isolated USB accessory.\nDo-it-yourself (DiY) hardware toolkits have created a global revolution in the way that digital interfaces interact with the physical world. From twitter-controlled Christmas trees to bicycle jacket turn signal lights, this movement is driving endless innovations and stimulating an age of creative engineering and innovative disruption. \u201cBody signals\u201d largely remain unexplored within this domain\u2026 at least with the attention and focused effort we believe they deserve.\nBITalino seeks to extend the principles of physical computing to the domain of body signals, and forever change the way projects and applications in this space are made. The team behind the project has a combined total of 60+ years of experience in the field of body signal hardware and software tools, together with an extensive track record in the successful launch of award-winning products in the professional segment (e.g. physioplux and ergoplux).\nBITalino (r)evolution is the brainchild of PLUX - Wireless Biosignals, S.A. and joint work with IT - Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es. Established in 2007, PLUX is a multidisciplinary company specialised in creating innovative biomedical hardware and software technologies for healthcare and research professionals.

Despite all the marketing hype, 99% of ordinary sunglasses \u2013 regardless of price \u2013 are nothing more than colored lenses in frames.  Those frames can be fancy \u2013 or sexy \u2013 or branded with some famous name \u2013 or they might be very ordinary frames from WallyWorld or CheapCo.  But when it comes to the lenses, they are basically all the same.  Generally speaking, there is no performance difference that matters in any meaningful way.  However, now you will have the chance to own sunglasses with a proven, unique and patent-powered performance difference that can actually be experienced.    \nIntroducing ORION4Sight \"Sunglasses on Steroids.\"\nOur ORION4Sight sunglasses are a spin-off version of patented ORION Optical Eyewear Filters used by the U.S. Military and are specifically formulated to provide an enhanced vision experience that has been independently evaluated \u2013 and which easily surpass polarized lenses or anything else available anywhere.    \nWhat is the PROOF that ORION4Sight Sunglasses are so special?\nThe proof that ORION4Sight sunglasses are something different, unique and special is firmly anchored in their American military heritage.    \nOur Company has been successfully selling products using our patented ORION Vision Technologies to elite U.S. Special Operations Commands for almost two decades.  We have 4 patents issued and are \u201cRegistered\u201d to sell ORION Technologies to the U.S. Government.\nNavy Seals and other Special Force Operators regularly use our ORION Optical Filter Eyewear.  If you knew the details about the missions on which our eyewear has accompanied them, your hair would literally stand on end!  We have stacks of personal testimonials.  Here is just one example.\n\u201cThe main thing I was doing was small boat operations in the bay during bright and sunny weather.  The ORIONs worked great!  Even in direct sunlight, I never had to squint and thus never got a headache.  This is an awesome advantage in my line of work.\u201d (Navy Seal Name With-Held To Protect Confidentiality)\nAnd here is another testimonial from a former Marine with personal experience using the ORION technology:\nFinally, we have a testimonial from John Hanson, an experienced sailor who publishes a well-regarded nautically-oriented magazine.\nWho can BENEFIT from using ORION4Sight Sunglasses?   \nAlmost everyone who goes outside in bright sunlight wears sunglasses.  So ORION4Sight Sunglasses are for EVERYONE.  They are specifically designed for people who engage in outdoor leisure activities and sports \u2013 and would like to experience a higher level of enjoyment and performance.  Here is just a partial list of sports and activities where ORION4Sight can improve that enjoyment and performance \u2013 driving, cycling, hiking, fishing, sailing, flying, boating, tennis, golf and all forms of sport-shooting.  The potential list is really endless and limited only by your imagination.    \nHere are the BENEFITS of ORION4Sight Sunglasses\nDistinct Image Contrast\nImproved Image Crispness\nProvides accurate and improved color saturation\nReduces eyestrain\nUnisex wrap-around frames which block unfiltered light from reaching the eye\nPowered by patents proven to improve human vision under extreme lighting conditions\nThese pictures show persons wearing the military version of Orion eyewear.  \nORION Eyewear benefits cannot be replicated with traditional dark lenses.  The bottom line BENEFIT is that ANYONE who wears ORION4Sight \u201cSunglasses On Steroids\u201d will experience enhanced vision designed to increase their performance and enjoyment of outdoor activities and sports.  We are confident that ORION4Sight Eyewear will outperform any traditional sunglasses.\nHOW Does It Work?\nWell that\u2019s sort of a secret, isn\u2019t it?  That is why we have important patents in place.  We are not unlike the famous Coca-Cola Formula.   Many have tried to \u201ccrack our code\u201d, but none have succeeded \u2013 and we\u2019re not talking!\nWHY Does It Work?\nThe diagram below tells that story.\n WHY are we asking for your support?\nWe are honoring requests from our American Soldiers NOT to provide the Military ORION Technology to foreign countries and/or consumer markets. However, we have made certain changes to the core ORION Technology which makes the new ORION4Sight sunglasses vision technology available to you.  We will also have legal expenses as we acquire a necessary new patent. This all costs money \u2013 and we need to keep some capital reserves available for an important new Project we are working on for our military.\nRather than borrow money, we have initiated this Crowdfunding Campaign on Kickstarter to raise the necessary capital to make the ORION4Sight project possible right now.    \nWHY should you support our Campaign?\nWe have something uniquely special, different, and better \u2013 and we know it.  And our American Soldiers know it.  Because of our decades-long commitment to their welfare and the new upcoming Project we mentioned above, we could put our ORION4Sight project on the back-burner \u2013 and delay this Goal.  But no one will benefit from that.  You can play an instrumental role in bringing these ground-breaking \u201cSunglasses On Steroids\u201d to the consumer marketplace NOW by supporting our Campaign.\nWhat do you receive for supporting our Kickstarter Campaign?\nAs the \u201creward\u201d for your support, you can effectively acquire a single or multiple pairs of ORION4Sight sunglasses for a price that will NEVER BE LOWER or repeated again ANYWHERE.  When these sunglasses become commercially available, their price will be significantly higher \u2013 as is appropriate for a product with such a proven performance difference.\nAnd you will be among the first to own these extraordinary, \u201cBest In Class\u201d sunglasses.  People will say to you, \u201cThose look interesting.  Let me try them.\u201d  And when they do, they will ask, \u201cWHERE did you get those?!  I want a pair!\u201d  (Be careful about lending them out.  You may have trouble getting them back!  We\u2019ve learned this the hard way.)\nIf you choose a pair of the ORION4Sight sunglasses as your reward, you will receive the sunglasses themselves, a protective case to keep them safe, a brief Instruction booklet telling you how best to use and enjoy your Orions, and a box to keep everything in.\nThe result of your support is \u2013 you will own The Best Darn Sunglasses Ever \u2013 and you will have played an important role in helping to make that possible for yourself and others.  This is WIN - WIN for everyone    \nA WORD to those who wear prescription eyewear. \nWe do not offer prescription lenses, fit-overs, or clip-ons at this time. It is not possible to address this issue within the parameters of this Kickstarter Campaign. We will be working on this in the future. However meanwhile, consider that you may have family and friends who can benefit from our sunglasses - and enjoy them.\nA SPECIAL NOTE to our supporters in the community of Amazon Sellers.\nAt the end of our Campaign, we will prepare a detailed Report on our Kickstarter Campaign.  It will cover all the relevant details and lessons-learned from our Campaign.  This will be made available to any Amazon Seller who would like to have a Copy.    \nYou can help to insure the success of our Campaign and thus insure delivery of YOUR ORION4Sight sunglasses.   \nLike you, your family and friends wear sunglasses when they go outside. You might want to think of getting an extra pair or two as gifts for someone special.  But either way, you can help insure the success of the Campaign by telling others about it \u2013 and that success will insure delivery of your own ORION4Sight sunglasses.  Pass this web \u201clink\u201d on to others.  Just like you, they can benefit from owning the best sunglasses they will ever wear.  Tweet (#SunglassesOnSteroids), text, phone, post on Facebook and other Social Media you use, email \u2013 and basically communicate this to others in whatever way works best for you.  Help knowledge of these \u201cSunglasses On Steroids and this great offer to go \u201cVIRAL\u201d in all the communities to which you belong.\nWe also encourage you to follow our Kickstarter Campaign by going to our Facebook Page:  www.facebook.com/orion4sight.  By clicking the \u201clike\u201d button there, and interacting with the Page, you can further help to \u201cspread the word\u201d.    \nThe choice is yours. \nYou can continue to use ordinary sunglasses that have NO performance difference.  And you could choose to over-pay for nothing more than \u201ccolored lenses in fancy frames\u201d.  OR you can play an instrumental role in bringing these revolutionary sunglasses to the marketplace \u2013 and experience documented vision enhancement powered by patented technology like Navy Seals use.  When you own a pair of ORION4Sight \u201cSunglasses On Steroids\u201d, you will see things you never saw before.\nChoose your \u201creward\u201d for supporting us from the choices to the right of the screen and be among the first to experience the benefits of this revolutionary technology.  We Guarantee your satisfaction (see below) so you have nothing to lose and better vision performance and enjoyment to gain.

WE MADE IT!\nHooray!\n********************\nWhat is BEHS Tech? \nBrookfield East High School Technology Club is an extracurricular initiative to inspire, educate, and support students interested in STEAM (STEM + Art). We provide a wide range of opportunities for students of any skill level to jump-start their STEAM education, or even simply discover if their interests lie in any of the STEAM fields. These opportunities include:\nBrainstorming and think tanks\nSkill building (metalworking to PCB design) \nTeam projects (electric go-kart, autonomous quadcopter) \nCareer exploration (through hands-on experience and introductions to employees in STEAM fields) \nInternships\nWhat is this Kick Starter for? (And why should I back it?)\nSchool funding is often limited or unavailable for extracurricular activities. In addition we have seen an explosion in the number of students interested in what we have to offer in the past couple of years especially. Because of this, we have decided to utilize crowd-sourced funding to help support our activities. We need your assistance to support our growing number of students, and each pledge will make us more successful. Spread the word! The more we raise the larger the number of students we can begin to support, and the more skilled and productive they will become.\nOur club fills a major gap in technology education. Many summer camps, science fairs, and school activities boast about \u201cgetting kids interested in technology and engineering.\u201d However, this is never followed up with real world, engineering education until college or in the workplace. As a result, many students start their college engineering studies without any useful experience. This club is able to bridge the gap by providing the resources and experience for self-directed education.\nThe funding goal for this project is low by Kickstarter standards. We picked this goal because we wanted to give ourselves the best possible chances of success. $1000 would let us reward our backers and help to budget for the coming year. But by no means is our project goal a cap on the money we could make use of. We hope, that with the support of the community, we can support our club throughout the coming years.\nPast Student Achievements \nThis club has helped to enable students to turn their dreams into real world projects. Some of these projects are visible in video above. These projects are ongoing and are often tools that aid other students projects. A few examples include: \nQuadcopter \nElectric Go-Kart \nKeypad/Solenoid Door locking system\nRC Airplane Drone (work in progress) \nPirateBox WiFi HotSpot\nRockets for Schools Champions (2013) and 2nd Place (2014)\nArduino Rocket Launcher \nTaught 7th Grade Class on Embedded Electronics and Arduino\nBudget\nStudents control most functions of this club. They will decide (with adult guidance) what projects and ideas they wish to pursue. But their decision will likely include: \nSome type of 3D printer (or printer upgrade) \nFurther development of our 3D-Robotics Quadcopter \nAnd may include:\nRaspberry Pi\u2019s\nUpgraded revision of the electric go-kart \nBuild a DIY Laptop (from desktop parts) \nLaser Death Ray Jet Car (can\u2019t go wrong with lasers)\nVoting Reward: Every backer gets one vote per dollar they back in deciding a project (from a list assembled from your suggestions).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you might have noticed, the rewards for this campaign are limited mostly to our appreciation and advertising space on our projects.

Keep in mind that with your help, our students have the opportunity to pioneer a new generation of technology.\n As far as risks go, there\u2019s not much to discuss. If you backed high enough to get advertising space (for which we thank you again!), there is the highly unlikely chance that each and every one of our projects spontaneously combusts, meaning we wont have anywhere to put your advertisements.

When iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite are released this fall, you can submit apps that use Swift to the App Store and Mac App Store. \nAccording to Apple, writing code in Swift is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast.   That sounds pretty good to me!  \nSo how are you going to learn Swift?  So far, there is only one book available on the topic, and it's published by Apple.   Unfortunately for beginners, it is full of sentences like this one: \n\u201cWhen a closure\u2019s type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both.\u201d\nExcerpt From: Apple Inc. \u201cThe Swift Programming Language.\u201d iBooks. https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l\nThat might be perfectly concise for the advanced developer, but I think most of the book is just too advanced for most beginners. \nI'm confident I can write a book that's easier to understand for most people.  \nBe Ahead of the Crowd\nYou want to be ahead of the crowd, not behind it, when Swift is officially released. You want to learn all you can and be ready to leverage Apple's latest and greatest.  Let's get started!\nAnnouncing Swift\n Book, Source Code, Videos\nThis project will produce a book in Kindle, PDF, ePub, and paperback formats, and an associated website \"www.joyofswift.com\" (not yet live) featuring instructional videos showing how some of the code works.\nThis book with be the 4th book in the \"Joy\" series, which are designed to put some joy in the task of learning to program.   My other published books are \"The Joy of PHP\" and \"The Joy of jQuery\".\nTop-Rated Author\nMy book The Joy of PHP has 50 reviews on Amazon as I post this project.

A CNC machine is a computer controlled router that can cut shapes out of whatever material is placed in it. The Creation Station is a low cost CNC router kit designed to be high performance and high quality as well as simple to use. \nWe've reached our goal!  Thank you!\nWe've updated our stretch goals because we want to give them to you!\n$100,000 - 3-LED Work Area Light:  Mounts on the bottom of the spindle holder and lights up the work area - very useful. *** UNLOCKED ***\n$150,000 - 'Soft' Emergency Stop Button: In addition to the 'full' emergency stop button which kills power to the Creation Station, we will provide a \"soft emergency stop button\" that will stop the machine through software which will preserve the machine's coordinate space and will allow you to easily continue your job without the need to reset the machine. This is useful if you detected a problem and need to stop the machine quickly but it's not a full emergency - huge time saver.\n$200,000 - Electronic Touch Off Strip: We will include a precisely machined stainless steel strip and connections to the Creation Station for easily setting the cutter depth.\nThe High Performance CNC For The Rest of Us!\nThe Creation Station fits a huge 24\" x 24\" x 5\" work area into a compact design that is at home on any workbench.\nThick 20mm hardened and chromed rails and precision linear bearings for exceptionally high accuracy. Optional 1HP router can cut though the toughest jobs.\nHigh torque stepper motors, advanced motor drivers and ball bearing lead screws mean high speed cutting - up to 80\"/min with plenty of torque.\nWe cut this 1\" square from 1/8\" thick aluminum to test accuracy.\nWe developed the Creation Station for makers like you - like us.  We are makers \u2014 we developed the Creation Station with all the features and capabilities that we wanted to see in the CNC machine on our workbench.  We made a tool that we love and now we want to share it with you \u2014 we know you'll love it too. \nOur goal was simple: create a high performance, high quality CNC machine that the average person could afford.  After over a year of research, development and testing, we did it. The Creation Station is loaded with features usually only found on machines costing thousands of dollars, but costs less than a good laptop. We are sure this will become the most useful tool in your workshop!\nWe have over 20 years of experience in engineering, development and product testing.  We've studied every part of the Creation Station to ensure durability, reliability and performance while making it one of the most affordable CNC machines on the market.  Hundreds of hours were spent sourcing components and studying samples so we could make the Creation Station the best CNC machine in its class. \nWe designed and tested many different combinations of controllers, motors and drive systems until we came up with the best combination for speed, power and accuracy.\nWhat can you do with the Creation Station?\nAs a full function, 3-axis CNC machine, there are very few limitations to what you can do with the Creation Station.  If the router bit can reach it, the Creation Station can cut whatever shape you can dream up.  The Creation Station can cut foam, wood, plastic, aluminum, brass, stone, ceramic, tile, glass - anything softer than steel!  We made the Creation Station as versatile as possible so that it will be limited only by your imagination.\nPLAY\n\n* not actual speed.  This image was cut from a 6\" x 12\" x 1\" piece of oak and took 1.5 hours. Artwork provided by vectorart3d.com.\nSome of the things you can create with the Creation Station.\nEasy to Build:\nThe Creation Station comes as a kit, but don't let that put you off.  The Creation Station is easy to assemble and can be put together in a few hours.  Only simple hand tools are needed - the kind that everyone has in their tool drawer.  Each part is labeled and detailed instructions (including video instructions) on how to assemble the Creation Station will be provided.\nWorld Class Software:\nMaking things on your Creation Station (or any CNC machine) takes three steps: 1) design something to make, 2) convert that design to G-code and 3) run the G-code on your Creation Station.\nFor the first two steps, we've partnered with world class CNC software maker, Vectric.  Our Maker Bundle includes the versatile Vectric Cut2D software (a $149 value), while our Creator bundle include the powerful Vectric VCarvePro software (a $599 value).  These applications allow you to design your creation (or import designs from other design applications) and specify the cutting tool paths that the Creation Station will use to cut the shape.  Finally, this software will generate the G-code needed to run the Creation Station.\nCut2D Features include:\nAutomatically converts CAD drawings and Graphic designs to G-Code / CNC Toolpaths. \nAccepts most industry standard 2D vector drawing formats DXF, EPS, AI & PDF file formats. \nPocket Machining with either raster or offset machining patterns, plus the option to ramp the cutter into the material. \nProfile Machining-running the cutter around the outside, inside or on the selected geometry, with the option to ramp the cutter into the material. \nAutomatic cutter diameter compensation for toolpaths ensures parts are cut to the required size. Simply select the shapes and Cut2D compensates for the cutter diameter and shape. \nInteractive Tab / Bridge placement to ensure parts are securely held in place when cutting from sheet material. \nAutomatic calculation for Outside and Inside cutting when multiple shapes are selected. \nThe option to Ramp the cutter into the job is very important when cutting hard materials because it reduces the load on the bottom of the cutter. \nDrilling with option for Peck drilling cycle. \n3D Colour and 2D wireframe toolpaths Previews shows exactly what the part will look like when machined\nVCarve Pro Features include:\nComplete set of 2D Design and Layout Tools\nLayer control, Guide lines, Snap Grid\nTrue Shape Nesting maximizes material usage minimizing waste\nText Editing + Single Line Engraving Fonts\nFile Import - DWG, DXF, EPS, AI, PDF\nImage File Import - BMP, JPG, TIF, GIF\nVectorize images to create vectors for machining\nRobust V-Carving\nRaised 3D Prism machining\nAuto-Inlays with multiple options\n3D Random Texturing Toolpath\n2D Profiling with Interactive Tabs / Bridges, Lead and Ramp options\nPocketing with optimization for 2 cutters\nDrilling with option for Peck Drilling\nBeveled Letters\nCustom Molding and Form Cutters\nWrapped Rotary Axis Machining\nMulti-color Toolpath Previews\nFor more information on Vectric products along with a complete set of training videos and sample projects, visit www.vectric.com.\nThe last step requires \"machine controller\" software to actually run the G-code and control the Creation Station.  We recommend LinuxCNC on a dedicated computer to act as the \"machine controller\".  The requirements for LinuxCNC are very low so it's easy to find a computer - very likely for free - from friends, your local MakerSpace or craigslist that will do the job - see www.creationstationcnc.com for details.  LinuxCNC, is free, open source and very easy to install; no unix/linux experience needed! We will include complete instructions on how to install, set up and use LinuxCNC.\nVideo Examples: In addition to the massive video training library provided by Vectric, we will produce one \"sample project\" video per week demonstrating how to use the Creation Station throughout this project.  If there's a particular project you'd like to create on the Creation Station, send us a note at info@creationstationcnc.com. Feel free to send us your original design files too, and if we like it, we'll make a how-to video! \nOther software options:  We offer a Creation Station option without software.  This option is perfect for someone on a tight budget, who prefers to use any of a multitude of free, open source software: e.g. Inkscape for making 2D designs and makercam.com for generating G-code from those designs.  Or Blender, which is a powerful 3D design package, and is also free and open source.  There is even a CAM version design specifically for CNC that can generate G-code directly.  As for machine controllers, we love LinuxCNC. There are a limited number of other free options but there are also commercial options such as Mach3.  We will provide a moderated forum at www.creationstationcnc.com for users who have chosen this route to exchange how to's and answer questions.\nOur Production Schedule:\nAll design and sourcing work for the Creation Station is done and a production plan is in place \u2014 all we need to do is pull the trigger.  As soon as we hit our goal we will start placing orders for long lead-time parts and order the remaining parts at the end of the campaign to ensure we hit our shipping targets.\nWhat You Get:\nYou get a complete Creation Station Kit which includes all parts and electronics along with detailed instructions and a video assembly guide.  The kit will take just a few hours to put together.  If you selected the option with a spindle (router), you will also get a Bosch Colt 1HP router and world class Vectric, Inc. software. If you opted to go without a spindle, we will include a spindle holder designed for a rotary tool, which you can then use to cut a holder for whatever spindle you choose. \nBonus:\nWith each Creation Station you will receive a 25% off coupon for the purchase of 3D art from vectorart3d.com. \nVector Art 3D provides relief-style clip-art for computer controlled routing and engraving", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are determined that our project not become another \"really late\" Kickstarter project and that it ship on time.

With InstaSwitch, WindowFlinger, Hundreds of Features & Free Upgrades for Life!\nAndroid on the PC. Android taking on the desktop. Lots of people have talked about it - we\u2019re delivering.\nWe\u2019ve taken Android apart, and put it back together for your PC. Console OS is a fork of Android designed to take everything that has made mobile awesome and bring it back to your PC.\nThis isn\u2019t an emulator and this isn\u2019t homebrew. Console OS is real, native Android that can really toggle with Windows on your PC.\nHow Console OS stacks up to the emulators and other Android PC initiatives\nOur Vision\nWhat if you could toggle between native Android, and native Windows?\nAndroid is the most popular operating system in the world today. More new devices are born with Android, than anything else. We're taking the next step, and bringing Android back to the desktop.\nThat\u2019s what this Kickstarter is raising money to pull off.\nProduction-grade Android on the Desktop\nTeam iConsole has worked for the past 18 months to make sure everything from (optional) multi-touch to Miracast\u2122 works great.\nWe fully support many popular multi-touch displays that can turn the smallest to the largest desktops into giant multi-touch Android devices. And no, you don\u2019t need a multi-touch display for Android to be awesome on your PC - we\u2019ve made the UX both multi-touch and non-touch friendly.\nConsole OS is painless to install - for end-users and system builders alike.\nThis is what makes Console OS so great. You can either install it on your PC's internal drive, or run it entirely from a USB external hard disk.\nWe\u2019re not talking a demo (or \"live\") version either; all your apps, documents, even encryption can work booting directly from a USB hard disk.\nWant to boot Windows alongside Android from your internal drive? No problem - we think that's what most will do, and we fully support that. Our installer takes less than five minutes to pull that off, automagically.\nBuilt for the Mainstream\nEvery thing in Console OS is built for a mainstream audience. It is designed to provide OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) with a drop-in, native Android solution for their PCs. Console OS will be both Secure Boot and dm-verify - which means trusted computing that OEMs can ship alongside Windows.\nFor Tablets Too\nTablets today come on x86 and ARM. But, they only run Windows. Or, they only run Android. You shouldn\u2019t have to buy two identical tablets to do one job.\nConsole OS is the solution. We\u2019ve built a version of Android that we completely control. So, we can drop it in and run Windows and Android side-by-side.\nThe benefit? Say you have an x86 tablet or device that doubles as a tablet and a laptop. You can rock through the workday with Microsoft Office, then play your favorite Android game all night long. Same hardware, different operating systems, living in harmony.\nBut we\u2019re doing more, including enabling Android apps to run side-by-side, baking in a familiar app launcher, and swipe motions that are more natural.\nFor Gamers Too\nPeople don\u2019t think of Android today as a true console-quality gaming experience. But that\u2019s changing. Live at GDC, we showed off how OpenGL ES 3.1 (and eventually the full OpenGL 4 stack) will enable Console OS and Android to become a mainstream gaming platform.\nAnd we do expect Console OS to support OpenGL 4. Why would you need another gaming OS when Android is already the most popular OS in the world.\nFrom the application store process to the user experience, we\u2019ve been working for the past year and a half to remaster Android for the desktop. Now, we need your help to make it a revolution.\nBe an early backer and get all the benefits of Console OS Pro - free for life!\nConsole OS Pro - Taking Android Even Farther\nConsole OS Pro will add over twenty killer premium features, including InstaSwitch. InstaSwitch will eventually facilitate switching instantaneously between native Windows and native Android, on your x86-based tablet or PC.\nTypically $20/year, we\u2019re going to make Console OS Pro free for life for select Kickstarter backers! That\u2019s right, back us now, get free upgrades for life to Console OS Pro.\nInstaSwitch will leverage cutting-edge XenGT technology. It's the one feature that we know will be the most challenging, but will eventually deliver instant toggling between native Android and other operating systems. Imagine editing a document in Microsoft Office\u00ae, playing Half-Life 3\u2122 in SteamOS\u2122, and reviewing your Gmail\u2122 inside Android... all from the same tablet or gaming rig.\nConsole OS Pro, more specifically, is set to include the following:\nWindowFlinger \u2013 A true window manager for Android \u2013 run Android apps in windows (Console OS - standard version - will run two apps side-by-side) \nInstaSwitch \u2013 Building a new hypervisor to instantly toggle between native Android and native Windows \nConsole Remote Access -> Remotely access your Console OS device from any old Android \nAdditional codecs and media playback support \nNative DVR support (planned ATSC, DVB, QAM/CableCARD, & DTCP-IP) \nBuilt-in media serving (UPnP and DLNA) \nConsole Files \u2013 A new file manager we\u2019re building in to the desktop\nConsole Maps Pro \u2013 Premium Maps with Enhanced Turn-by-Turn\nRequirements\nAndroid is built differently from Windows, OS X, and even traditional Linux platforms. So, we have to build Android for one device at a time to make sure it always works awesomely. That\u2019s a huge chunk of the benefit behind Console OS - you get Android built just for your PC.\nWe support Android for devices based on demand - and when you back the Kickstarter, you\u2019ll help tell us which devices Console OS with Android Inside should land on.\nIt's important to note that Console OS will work just fine with gazillions of other PCs too - but we're providing official targeted devices, because we want to point customers to PCs and PC Tablets that we are confident that everything will \"just work\" out of the box.\nOut of the gates, we will support (over!) 25 iconic Laptops, PCs, x86 tablets and convertible devices with Console OS. And, here they are:\nAcer: Aspire S7\nASUS: Transformer Book T100, T300\nCircuitCo: Minnowboard MAX\nDell: XPS 11, XPS 12, XPS 13, and XPS 15, Venue 8 Pro, Venue 11 Pro\nGigabyte: Most BRIX Models, H87-ITX, Z87-ITX\nIntel: Next Unit of Computing (all NUC models except for Celeron 847)\nLenovo: Miix 2 8-inch, Miix 2 10-inch, IdeaPad U430p, ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Yoga 2, Yoga 2 Pro\nSager: NP2740\nSony: VAIO Tap 11, VAIO Pro 11 & 13 \nSystem76: Galago UltraPro\nToshiba: Port\u00e9g\u00e9 R30 & Z30, Satellite L55, Tecra A50, Z50 & Z40\nMost Portable All-in-One Systems\nAnd, of course, all of our own iConsole-branded hardware like the iConsole Developer Kit\nSupport for additional systems will be steered by OEM backing and by the community.\nWant to see your PC up there? Back the Kickstarter \u2013 and your vote will count in telling us which PCs to support next.\nAs to Macintosh, and Surface Pro, see above. We\u2019ll support them if we get enough backing to do so.\nIndustry-licensed Technology\nAs a stealth startup, we didn\u2019t get asked by anyone to do this. Console OS is our product, and we're fiercely independent. We relied on Intel\u2019s promise to work with disruptive startups \u2013 and they made good on that commitment.\nWe\u2019re the first startup to successfully license all the key bits that make Android rock on PC hardware, a testament to Intel\u2019s promise to keep startups on a fair, level playing field with the big guys.\nWe\u2019re featuring support for all the innovative hardware that x86 systems rock on the desktop, even advanced features like Miracast, HDCP, HDMI mirroring, dual-display, 4K with DisplayPort, ARM NDK app compatibility, and native hardware-accelerated H.264 decoding.\nOur App Store, Our UX, Our Android\u2122\nOne of the reasons homebrew versions of Android have failed, is the lack of Google Play. Google doesn\u2019t let you install Google Play on Android without the device being certified. So, over the past year, we\u2019ve lined up all the apps and tools needed to make you not miss Google Play.\nWe\u2019re going to stay true to the Android code, we\u2019re 100% Android compatible, with strict adherence to the Android API stack - Dalvik, Bionic, and ART, and even RenderScript.\nWe\u2019re only forking the user experience to make Android awesome on the desktop.\nBut, we know you probably own a lot of apps on Google Play\u2122. So, we\u2019re going to support the following:\nThe Console Store - Our upcoming application store for Console OS-enhanced Android apps (un-modified Android apps typically work great - even with a keyboard and mouse!) \nImporting App Purchases (since we\u2019re Android-compatible) \u2013 via Console OS Import Apps tool for your phone or tablet. Copies licensed apps to your Console OS PC or PC Tablet.\nAmazon Appstore for Android\nHow\u2019d we pull all this off?\nWe\u2019ve been working in stealth mode for the past 18 months. We quietly shipped iConsole.tv Unit 00, a developer kit for our upcoming Android gaming console. It\u2019s the fastest Android ever built, and it was already using Intel\u00ae Core processors inside.\nUnit 00 is out of stock right now, but as we mentioned earlier we'll have more hardware to share later this month!\nWhen we realized people really want to instantly switch between Windows and Android, we started taking what we learned with iConsole.tv, and built it out into Console OS today.\nWhen will it be ready?\nWe're aiming to ship Console OS Developer Release 1 within about 30 days of the Kickstarter\u2019s conclusion.\nFrom there, we\u2019ll use Kickstarter funds to build out support for the devices that you vote for.\nOur goal is to implement all of the features listed here over the next year, but we may ship Console OS 1.0 before that depending on the challenges that we encounter. Our goal is to give the OEMs something to ship in time for compelling new x86 tablets and convertibles this winter to ship in stores.\nOkay, I\u2019m sold. What\u2019s in it for me?\nIn summary, you\u2019re helping us make Android awesome, and fiercely independent on the PC. We\u2019d much rather you keep us honest and focused than alternatives.\nOn most backer tiers, you\u2019ll get Console OS Pro free for life. And, you\u2019ll vote on what PCs and tablets with x86 processors that we should branch out to next with officially-supported Console OS builds.\nThe first 10,000 backers can get Console OS Pro for life for only $9.99. After that, $14.99. That\u2019s still less the cost of one release of Console OS Pro for all the PCs in your family.\nThanks for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have most of Developer Release 1 done. It'll include a starter version of our user experience and should work on all 25 devices we listed in the initial supported device list.\n\nThe Console OS Pro feature set is largely what funds will go toward (in addition to expanding device support, based largely on Kickstarter backer votes).\n\nWe expect Console OS (Pro) 1.0 around December, 2014. We can't promise each and every device/feature/item will make the cut, as with any operating system, some features will get added, and some delayed.\n\nWe hope that ecosystem players (here's looking at you, Google) embrace and support our innovation. We don't expect too much push back, but it is a potential risk when doing anything with Android. The beauty of Console OS being so disruptive, is there's potential for all kinds of interesting relationships.\n\nA lot of people ask about Android and Chrome OS\u2122. We think native Android will be totally awesome even if the two were to merge. If something crazy like that were to happen (and Google has said it won't), our feature set may change - but it won't hurt our efforts.\n\nMore generally, however, major changes to Android may cause us to have to rewrite portions of our code. We're ready for that.\n\nFinally, as to open-source challenges, we plan to contribute all direct AOSP improvements back to AOSP. How much of that Google will accept or allow us to submit, is up to Google, not us.\n\nConsole OS is an operating system - the contents and features of which may change, shift, or move around the cabin during delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "An Update on ConsoleTab", "update_content": "Happy new year everyone, we have an update on our new blog, at our new URL - Console.enterprises\nYou can read more about the name change, spec bump for ConsoleTab, and more at the blog post."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "New Year, New Update", "update_content": "We apologize for the repeated delays.

We developed the GeckoTek Build Plate to be high performance, versatile, cost-effective, and super simple to use. It\u2019s the perfect product for anyone who is tired of using tape or glue to get their parts to stick to the print bed. \nWe have spent over a year developing the GeckoTek Build Plate. With our backgrounds in Polymer Science and Nanotechnology we have been able to develop a coating material that has the perfect level of adhesion to your printed parts while remaining extremely durable. It is available in any size or shape up to 12\u201d x 12\u201d (300mm x 300mm) as well as in a variety of specialized magnetic bases for the most popular 3D printers. \nThe GeckoTek Plates shown in the video above are hand made functional prototypes. We need your help so that we can scale up production and reduce the cost. \nHow Does It Work? \nInsert the GeckoTek Build plate into your 3D printer. If you don\u2019t have one of our magnetic bases then use binder clips or tape to secure it in place. If you received a magnetic base it will come with its own installation instructions \nIf it's your first time using the GeckoTek Build plate, follow your printer\u2019s procedure to level the build plate. It is critical keep your 3d printer bed level and z-axis set correctly at all times. \nPrint your part! For PLA there is no need for heating the bed. For ABS, Nylon and HIPS its recommended to heat to 90-100C. \nIf the bed is hot, let it cool. Then remove the GeckoTek Plate with the finished part. If needed, the plate can be gently flexed to pop the part off. \nRepeat! GeckoTek has a permanent coating so there is now need to re-apply anything. You won\u2019t need to re level the bed after the first print. You will be good to go for many more prints to come. \nMagnetic Base Combo \nIn order to get maximum value from your GeckoTek Plate we recommend getting a Magnetic Base Combo. This provides one GeckoTek Build Plate and a precision machined aluminum base with embedded magnets. \nThis provides the simplest, cleanest, and the most reliable option for securing the build plate to the Printer. When removing and attaching binder clips it is easy to apply to much force and knock the print bed out of level. Having a GeckoTek with a magnetic base eliminates this issue. \nWe currently have specialized magnetic bases for the following printers: \nRepRaps (any printer that uses a MK1 or MK2 214 x 214mm heated bed) \nMakerbot Replicator 2 and 2X \nPrinterBot simple \nSolidoodle 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Gen \nUltimaker 1 and 2\nMakerBot Replicator 1\nFlash Forge Creator and CreatorX\nWanhao Duplicator 4x.\nRobo 3D R1\n (If you would like us to offer a magnetic base for your printer let us know!) \nStretch Goal 1:  $30,000 - Cheap Filament.

(1Kg /2.2lb spool) One of our partners, Additive Manufacturing Solutions (AMS) (www.additivems.com) is allowing us to offer rolls at a significant discount to our Kickstarter backers. We do the thermal and physical testing for all AMS products in our lab, so we know it is high quality filament. You will be able to choose between PLA and ABS in a range of colors.

The rolls and color choices will be first come first serve. if we sell out then any extra pledges will be refunded at the end of the kickstarter.  \nShipping\nWe have tried to include the price of domestic shipping in the pledge amounts. International shipping rates will be determined after the conclusion of the campaign. The actual shipping rates will depend on the quantity of plates sold. We hope that there will be no extra shipping charges but we may need to charge a small amount to cover our expenses.

Instead of using Spartan 6 LX9 with TQFP144 package we are going to use Spartan 6 LX9 with FBGA256.\nWhat does this mean? It means more GPIOs. We will have around 64 GPIOs without any multiplexing. In addition to that we will have 8 LEDs, 4 Switches and 2 HDMI connectors.\n3D model for miniSpartan6+ $65k stretch goal\nPlease check update#8 \nStretch Goal: $50,000- Reached\nWe reached our stretch goal of $30k and we will add all the upgrades we mentioned before.\nFor the $50K, we will upgrade our hardware again based on discussions with our backers.\nWe will keep 4 LEDs for debugging and add 2 Push-button Switches.\nWe will add additional an HDMI connector, which means the miniSpartan6+ will have 2 HDMI connectors. By default one of the connectors will be input and the other one will be output. The user can add/remove some resistors to configure any of the two connectors as input or output.\nWe will increase the number of available GPIOs by giving the user access to the IOs used in different circuits on the board.\n\nStretch Goal: $30,000 - Reached.\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $30,000, we will make some upgrades to the hardware, based on feedback from our backers.\nA Faster Spartan 6 LX9: We will be able to ensure that we procure a faster version of the Spartan 6 LX9 chip, with speed grade -3. This increases the maximum I/O speed, the PLL speed, and the TMDS I/O. For example, the TMDS I/O will be increased, to throughput up to 1050 Mbps. With speed grade -3, you can potentially capture and output signals faster.\nA higher resolution analog to digital converter: We will use a 12-bit analog to digital converter, with 8 channels, instead of the 8-bit one we had in the original design, so you can have higher resolution inputs for better quality.\nSupport for HDMI input and output: Our current HDMI port was designed to work as an HDMI output only, so we are going to redesign it, adding an EDID chip, so it can work as an HDMI input and output port. Now you will be able to process HDMI input.\nMeet the miniSpartan6+ and the Scarab IDE:\nWhen we came up with our board's design, we looked at what was available in other boards on the market and enhanced it.\nOur kit is small, much smaller than the closest thing on the market,it's smaller than a credit card at only 1.8 in x 3.0 in. That means you can put it inside some pretty small projects. (Here's something to get you thinking, by 2025 the cost of putting one pound into space is expected to be just $100.)\nAnd our kit is bread board friendly, so you can quickly connect it to a shield or to a bread board.\nNow, there\u2019s a handful of other broads with many of these features on the market, but our miniSpartan6+ costs around half of what its closest competitor does.\nThe miniSpartan6+:\nThe Spartan6 LX9 FPGA from Xilinx, one of the best FPGAs on the market.\nAn on-board USB JTAG Programmer to power and program your FPGA with any open source programmer, like the one inside our own Scarab IDE.  \nAn on board USB interface that powers the board and allows communication with the PC at speeds up to 480Mbps. (That's fast enough to make a logic analyzer. Check our website for updates on projects and tutorials).\nAn on-board HDMI port. Instead of using VGA output on your projects, now you can go HDMI.\nAn 8-channel analog to digital converter running at 1 MSPS with 8 bit resolution. So you can start connecting real world sensors to your FPGA kit.\nMemory: 32MB of SDRAM, 64Mbit of SPI Flash and a microSD card interface.\nA stereo audio output jack using 1-bit sigma-delta DAC to start playing your music.\n24 Digital I/O pins.\n8 LEDs.\nA screenshot of the Scarab IDE.\nThe Scarab IDE:\nWe took existing IDEs in the embedded systems community, like the Mojo IDE, and improved on them, coming up with the Scarab IDE, an easy to use GUI that allows you to develop, compile, and download programs to your FPGA (through the on board USB JTAG Programmer) with the click of a button. The Scarab IDE only requires the Xilinix ISE Design Tool to be instlalled on your machine.\nIt comes with our well documented Verilog/VHDL libraries and .bit files to easily program the FPGA for common tasks. Need the HDMI output? Maybe a logic analyzer? It\u2019s all there.\nOf course, your project might be more complicated to build, but you can start with a solid foundation that lets you focus on the heart of the software, not on how the FPGA can talk to your TV.\nAnd you are not locked into our Scarab IDE. You can use the Xilinx ISE Design Tool to program your miniSpartan6+. Also Scarab IDE can be used to program any Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA, no matter which kit it is a part of.\nWhy would you want an FPGA?\nBecause you want speed and flexibility.\nYou can divide the field of embedded systems into microcontroller based systems or FPGA systems.\nMicrocontroller kits - like the Arduino - have been more popular for a long time because they are easier to program -- you can write code in a familiar language like C++, and quickly talk to other hardware through whatever ports your board happens to come with. But microcontrollers have some big limitations: they are essentially small specialized computers that can only talk to the outside world in a few ways. They can't multitask, and are slow.\nA Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is like a digital circuit you can re-wire as many times as you like with the click of a button. FPGA's can be used to prototype a great idea for a device, or actually drive an amazing project you want to build. For applications where you want speed and full control over your hardware, you want an FPGA.\nWith an FPGA, you can program your logic gates into powerful blocks that can do different tasks at the same time. Even the microcontroller at the heart of the Arduino is easily emulated in an FPGA.\nHere are a few projects you can make right away with the miniSpartan6+ and the Scarab IDE:\nLogic Analyzer.\nMultimedia Player.\nGame Console Emulator.\nArduino Emulator.\nStereo Vision Camera.\nWhat made us want to create the miniSpartan6+ and the Scarab IDE?\nWe believe it's time for the hackers community to get an easy to use FPGA kit. So we have put together a powerful, affordable hardware package, and are making available our own open source IDE to make programming a breeze.\nWe got our ideas from years of using FPGA's for commercial applications, and teaching engineering students about them.\nOn the hardware side, we wanted to make a powerful low-cost FPGA kit with the latest peripherals to let you build your project right away. The miniSpartan6+ is the third version of the board.\nThe first prototype, the second prototype, and the miniSpartan6+\nAnd we noticed how many hobbyists are put off by the complexity involved in programming FPGAs, so we took a cue from the microcontroller industry, which has advanced because of open source collaboration on the libraries driving kits like the Arduino.\nThere are many open source libraries for the FPGA, but they are not organized in a beginner-friendly way. So we came up with the Scarab IDE, which we hope will be the seed for fruitful collaboration between our users.\nOur Scarab IDE comes chock full of the libraries you need -- everything from outputting HDMI video, to a complete logic analyzer -- to get your projects up and running with a few clicks.\nOf course, we have documented those libraries well so you can hack them, and share what you come up with.\nWith room to grow, our kit is great for beginners and experts alike.\nIf you are an expert with FPGAs, the miniSartan6+ is perfect for your complex projects, and comes at an affordable price and in a small form factor.\nIf you are a beginner, you have everything you need to start a Hello World project. You even have 8 LEDs to play with. Of course, we hope you move on to more complicated projects, and with the miniSpartan6+ you will have plenty of room to grow.\nThe miniSpartan6+ layout.\nA commitment to remaining open source\nWe are in the business of getting hardware into the hands of folks who can build on it, and make something that can make the world a more interesting place to live.\nSo everything about our product is open source.  The schematics, the source code, all the libraries for making our projects -- it's all going to available for you to download.\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $30,000, we will make some upgrades to the hardware, based on feedback from our backers.\nA Faster Spartan 6 LX9:\nWe will be able to ensure that we procure a faster version of the Spartan 6 LX9 chip, with speed grade -3. This increases the maximum I/O speed, the PLL speed, and the TMDS I/O. For example, the TMDS I/O will be increased, to throughput up to 1050 Mbps.

If we can get there, a new $90 pledge level is added. Backers at that level and above receive a USB card reader (SD and CF supported) which simply plugs into the dock.\nWe released a demo video on YouTube last November showcasing the Dell Venue 8 Pro with our flagship UD-3900 USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Docking station, essentially turning the tablet into a full desktop workstation. We received an extremely warm welcome from the Dell Venue 8 Pro user community and even caught the attention of Michael Dell (CEO, Dell Inc.) himself who retweeted our video. To this date we have over 150,000 views and almost 400 user comments. The majority of comments were all asking one question: \u201cCan it charge?\u201d This Kickstarter is the culmination of our work to make that happen!\nThe newly released Dell Venue 8 Pro and Lenovo Miix 2 8\" tablets both run full desktop Windows 8.1 which allows them to be used with almost any USB device including those that require drivers. The only extra hardware needed is a standard USB On-The-Go (OTG) cable. This allows them to be linked with multiple monitors and USB devices such as a keyboard, mouse, flash drive, etc. For home or office work not demanding heavy 3D performance, these small and inexpensive tablets are a great value to consumers. These 8\" tablets are even preloaded with Microsoft Office. Having the ability to purchase a docking station and convert a tablet into a full computer makes it an even greater value.\nThe main flaw with these tablets is that they each feature only one USB port for both charging and data connectivity. This is an issue because the user cannot charge at the same time while using USB devices. The tablets are not capable of remaining charged throughout a full workday, forcing the user to disconnect their tablet from the dock to charge it.\nOur Dock Connected to a Dell Venue 8 Pro with a Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Ethernet Connection, & Headset Attached! All that with 2 USB ports to spare!\n                 To solve this problem the team at Plugable Technologies have created the Plugable Pro8 docking station. When connected to our Pro8 dock, the dock simulates the signal of the stock charger needed to trigger the tablets charging cycle. It then flips the port over to host mode so devices can be used while the tablet continues to charge. We prototyped this first with a breadboard solution and several of our Plugable USB devices.\nSome of Our Early Prototypes\nOur integrated Pro8 Docking Station, as delivered for the Kickstarter, provides several important features over USB 2.0, including a DisplayLink based video connection to a single additional monitor (up to 1920x1080 (1080p) via DVI, VGA, or HDMI (HDMI audio not supported) with adapters included with the Kickstarter reward), front audio output and input, wired 10/100 network connection (typically much faster than wireless), and four additional USB 2.0 ports. It has been designed to offer full speed charging and USB On-The-Go (OTG) data connectivity simultaneously to the tablet. It has also been designed to still be able to function with a normal computer such as a laptop, using a separate cable (included with the Kickstarter reward).\nThe custom circuitry in our docking station that allows the dual functionality of charging and USB data connectivity to be possible was designed in-house and brought to production by our manufacturing partners. \nCustom PCB Prototype\nThe method of charging and supporting USB devices is only compatible with the Dell Venue 8 Pro (The Dell Venue 8 *non pro* Android version is not supported) and the Lenovo Miix 2 8 tablets. There have been several do-it-yourself hacks but none have been integrated into this kind of all-in one solution with true plug and play functionality. We have created a truly hassle free solution with no complicated procedures or compromises to tablet charging rates. This is the ultimate all-in-one solution.\nWe need your help to make it happen, especially all existing Dell Venue 8 Pro and Lenovo Miix 2 8 owners. Thanks for considering the backing level that's right for you. And thanks so much for your support!\nthe rewards.\nIn our video and pictures you can see a fully working prototype for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the Lenovo Miix 2 8. The final production units will be in a slightly different enclosure, a rectangular design in all black. They will also have a detachable USB Micro B to USB Micro B cable for tablet connectivity and can use a standard USB Micro B to USB A cable (like the stock cable included with the tablet for charging) to connect the docking station to a laptop or desktop computer for maximum compatibility.\nDell Venue 8 Pro Connected (USB Micro B to USB Micro B Cable)\nThe Pro8 Connects to Your Laptop!

Our goal has always been to miniaturize the required hardware so that it fits into a portable package and would be easy to carry around in a purse or on a key ring.\nThe software simulates the function, look, and feel of a high-end digital multimeter.\nHow we came up with the project\nWe've got a few physicists, engineers and programmers on staff. Mostly we work as consultants solving problems in optical analysis, lighting and lens design. We designed a hand-held color analyzer as part of our usual business. Here's an image of what the product looked like:\nOur Colorwand in action\nL-a-b are the color coordinates. In designing the analyzer, we realized that most of the space and parts cost were related to the display. We concluded that we could use a smart phone as the display element and communicate via wireless protocol between the analyzer and the phone. We went so far as to breadboard it. But our customer didn't jump at it. (If someone reads and appreciates this, we still think it's great!)\nThis gave Simon, our chief scientist, an idea. Why have bulky and pricy displays when everyone carries a display with them at all times. Let's take the display out of every common design. Because we are measurement people, the common digital multimeter was a natural for us.\nWithout giving away all the project design details, we did to DMM's here what we did for color analyzers there. Take the engine (the color analysis hardware or the digital multimeter hardware) and marry it to wireless hardware and substitute an app with a nice user interface in place of mechanical switches and video hardware.\nNow here's Jonathan of our team with a real time measurement using our most recent prototype.\nPLAY\n\nThe prototype here was a real bear to make. We wanted it fully functional and we couldn't use any wire wrap because of the space limitations.\nPrototype 3 used in the video\nHere are a couple of images of the device at work using a smartphone\nTesting the power at the fuse box becomes a one man job--This is prototype 1 shown at the outlet of a house.\nDemonstrating the wirelss function which works up to 30 feet away--Checking the voltage of a car battery\nWe think this device will work for contractors, hobbyists, technicians, travelers, and those who always like to be prepared.\nInstalling outdoor lights--Measuring the voltage drop\nWe've created two hardware prototypes - the first is a rather cumbersome wirewrap/point to point solder that we used for software development and to prove that our design worked.\nOur first prototype--Testing a power supply\n We also crammed the parts into a portable handmade box and potted it and you can see that in the video. But neither of these is production level. The Kickstarter campaign will allow us to complete three outstanding project items. We will complete the PCB layout. We will tool the custom compact probes that we need. We will tool our little measurement module case.\nWireless measurement module 2.2\" by 1.1\" by .7\"\nHere is the wireless measurement module. It comes complete with probes. But you can also use your own standard probes when you want to. We want to stress that the case is only 2.2\" by 1.1\" by .7\" so it is very portable!\nThe small module is self--contained and the probes nest into the case when the meter is not in use.\nInside view of the case - probe storage\nAll of the other design activities are done or will be shortly completed irrespective of the Kickstarter campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of our engineering and software is done by Coloratura Systems staff. The highest risk, in our estimation, is the work we have outstanding that has to be done by third parties. The PCB artwork is simple and we cannot foresee any significant issues there. We've done more complex stuff dozens of times. We wanted to use off-the -shelf probes but we just couldn't get what we wanted so we're having them tooled and made by a third party. We need slender leads and shorter probes than you usually see on a meter. There is always some degree of risk, in the form of time delay, there. They have to be done just right because they are over-molding the test leads on the probe end. The case tool is pretty simple but there is always a delay possible even though we built in a few weeks of slack into the delivery.\n\nThe software app is very far along in Object C for the Apple market. We have working software for Droid but it hasn't been tested nearly as much. But we really don't foresee the potential for problems there.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Coloratura Systems\n2 created \u00b7 3 backed\nColoratura Systems was started as a scientific testing and design consulting company.

It polishes ABS and PLA prints to a glassy smooth finish in almost no time at all! \nThe magician\u2019s greatest secret. \nDo you want beautiful, finished prints that wow your audience, but don\u2019t want to spend so much time, effort, and money to get them? Then you need an elegant solution that polishes your creations effortlessly. You need the MagicBox!\nThe magicbox in all its glory!\nThe MagicBox uses an acetone vapor bath to smooth the lines normally present on FDM prints. It\u2019s simple, easy-to-use settings give you control over the look and feel of your creations. Polish out rough edges or preserve detail, it\u2019s up to you.\nOn the right is a duck before being polished. On the left is a duck after being polished by the MagicBox. This is ABS duck.\nABS material made by MagicBox\nThis is ABS secret-head who's file we download from internet.\nMagicbox for PLA prints result.\nThis is our filament that we use on our MagicBox experiment.\n                                          Our filament picture.\n  Ready to witness the magic on your desktop?\nWe\u2019ve designed and built a few functional prototypes of the MagicBox, and we are almost ready to start manufacturing. We need your help to make it happen. By backing our project, you could be first in line to get a MagicBox, and be one step closer to simplifying your workflow, or making your hobby even more enjoyable.  So pick a reward, any reward, and help us make your life much easier, and a whole lot more magical!\nWe need a volunteer from the audience\nTo begin using the MagicBox just follow these simple directions:\nFill the reservoir with acetone.\nPlace a clean print into the chamber.\nAdjust the settings and press start.\nAutomation Control: For the sake of the safety, we control between inside and outside pressure, we need to keep the pressure  balance,because this is why  vapor always inside and smell nothing.\nThe clean fan will run after the magical process done.\nTA-DA!\nStage magic, meet street magic.\nAt Sky-Tech we believe that everything about 3D printing should be fun and inspiring. When we were looking for a solution to polish our own creations, we found that everything else on the market was too big, too expensive, and too difficult to use. So we decided to create our own solution; something that would be small enough to fit on our desks, something that doesn\u2019t require us to pawn our hats and rabbits or buy expensive chemical refills, and something that would be easy for anyone to use. So we designed and built the MagicBox.\nThe secrets revealed.\nThe MagicBox uses a patent pending process to quickly evaporate acetone. The vapor fills the chamber and begins to smooth out the surface lines from of your FDM prints. After you\u2019re finished, the exhaust fan and filter will capture the excess vapor to ensure that the air in your room stays clean and fresh.\nSuper secret: We have made a compact design to our customers, please note that we design a  vapor switch on control pannel, with the steam setting time, you can control the acetone vapor make different fineness, for example, we can make the surface is very slippery, but the details would lose more, you can make the surface smooth surface only a little, but the details can be preserved.This is called Magicbox customize function.\nThe MagicBox will be manufactured using the highest-quality components available. Here are some general specifications:\nTotal Size: 30cm x 30cm x 29cm\nChamber Size: 25cm x 25cm x 20cm\nWeight: 5kg\nPower: 100-240V A/C, 50/60HZ\nWorks with ABS, PLA\nProject background\n1. After using a beaker filled with acetone over an induction cooker to finish our 3D prints, we began brainstorming a better way and came up with the concept of the MagicBox. We wanted to make the whole process simpler.\n2. Then we began to design a basic controller and chipset to test with.  \n3. We wanted the MagicBox to be used right next to your 3D printer, so we designed it to be small; about the size of a 17 inch monitor. Our first concept drawings. Our first design draft. 3D CAD models of the functional prototype. \nOur design draw.\nMagicBox Control Pannel\nMagicbox Specification\n3D CAD models of the functional prototype.\n4. We were all excited about the prototype when it was finally ready to test, and after we tested it with a few prints we realized we had made something truly magical. And that is how the MagicBox was born! \nProduction and fulfillment plan \nDuring the campaign, we\u2019ll finalize the design of the MagicBox and prepare for manufacturing with the same manufacturer that produces our high performance 3D printers. Once the campaign is successful, we\u2019ll start mass production for the backers and form a marketing strategy for global sales. At Sky-Tech we have lots of experience manufacturing 3D printers and our customers include product design companies, architecture design companies, colleges, educational institutions, etc. The engineering magic inside the MagicBox is considerably simpler than the mechanisms and electronics in our 3D printers, so you can rest assured that we have the skills and capacity to promptly fulfill our rewards.

While the machines and software keep getting better, the materials available for printing have remained more or less unchanged. The low quality and limited choices of printing materials are increasingly becoming the limiting factor for the future expansion of desktop 3D printers.\nAs a group of materials scientists, engineers and designers who are very passionate about 3D printing, Polymakr wants to change this, by continuously developing the best the most innovative printing materials for the maker community.\nThree entirely new materials for your desktop 3D printer\nThe goal of this KickStarter project is to bring to you 3 entirely new materials that are designed specifically for FDM/FFF based desktop 3D printers. \nPolyMax PLA: Completely re-engineered PLA with superb mechanical strength\nPolyMax PLA vs. Regular PLA\nPoly(lactic acid) or PLA is probably the most widely used material for desktop 3D printers nowadays. However one of the largest disadvantages of PLA is its poor mechanical properties, especially the tendency to brittle fracture. This renders regular PLA limited applicability for functional parts that are used in mechanically demanding situations.\nPolyMax PLA is an entirely new PLA that is designed to solve this problem. The material exhibits over 8 times better impact strength and toughness than regular PLA.\nComparison of impact strength of 3D printed parts made from ABS, PLA and PolyMax PLA\nPolyMax PLA is compatible with almost all FDM-based desktop 3D printers, including many \u201cABS-only\u201d printers such as MakerBot Replicator 2X (yes you are not mistaken!). It prints under identical conditions as regular PLA \u2013 so you can simply \u201cswap and go\u201d.\nPolyMax PLA vs. ABS\nMechanical properties of 3D printed parts made from ABS and PolyMax PLA\n How about ABS, as you may ask, since ABS is an engineering plastic that is both tough and strong? Well, PolyMax PLA outperforms ABS in terms of almost all mechanical properties, yet has the advantages of less unpleasant (even toxic) odor, less tendency to warp, and many others, as we summarize in the table below.\nComparison between ABS and PolyMax PLA\nPolyFlex: soft and flexible filament with uncompromised printing quality\nExcellent Printer Compatibility\nYes, there are already a few flexible filaments out there. However one thing we notice about those materials is their poor compatibility with different 3D printers. Many of them only work on one specific printer model or extruder type \u2013 and you have to bet on your luck that it works on the one you have. Some of them only work on 3 mm printers \u2013 to our knowledge there has not been a flexible filament that works consistently on 1.75 mm 3D printers. \nTherefore we had a clear goal in mind: to develop a soft and flexible filament that is compatible with most desktop 3D printers - a material that everyone can use. That goal was achieved by carefully designing and optimizing the melt-flow properties of the material, and thoroughly testing the material on a large variety of printers. We are proud to announce that our PolyFlex is available in both 1.75 and 3 mm, and is compatible with most (if not all) desktop FDM/FFF 3D printers, including: MakerBot Replicator 2, Replicator 2X, Ultimaker (and several of its variations), RepRap Prusa Mendel, MakerGear M2, Afinia / Up! Plus , and many more as we can\u2019t list everything here.   \nFast Printing Speed\nThe biggest challenge with soft filaments is that they often lead to problems with feeding, as the material can be too soft to generate enough pressure. One compromise one often times has to make is slowing down the printing speed significantly. However this is almost not necessary for PolyFlex \u2013 for example our normal printing speed is in the range of 60 \u2013 90 mm/min. Furthermore, PolyFlex requires no heated build plate and has very little tendency to warp (better than PLA and ABS).\nEndless Possibilities\nParts made from PolyFlex\nThe soft and flexible nature of PolyFlex offers a new dimension of what one can do with desktop 3D printers. We showed a couple examples in our video, but you can do much more with PolyFlex: toys, seals, prosthetics, shoes, belts\u2026the possibilities are really limitless. PolyFlex also features very high printing quality and gives great details. We wish you will start making with PolyFlex soon!\nPolyWood: wood-like printing material with no actual wood\nWood-like appearance from its pre-foamed structure\nPolyWood is a wood-mimic printing material that contains no actual wood. So, how does PolyWood acquire this wood-like appearance? Unlike any other 3D printing filament, PolyWood has a porous microstructure, similar to natural wood. Prints made with PolyWood feature a rough surface that both looks and feels much like raw, carved wood.\nPrints made using PolyWood\nAs you probably are aware, there are a few commercially available wood-powder based filaments, but we think our approach is better for the following reasons:\nWood powder (often present in large amounts) tends mess up the flow properties of the polymer melt, resulting in poor printing quality. You can check out the comparison in the photo below \u2013 the difference is quite dramatic!\nWhat\u2019s worse, poorly dispersed wood powder can even jam the extruder on your printer, which will never happen for PolyWood.\nComparison of parts made from PolyWood and a wood-powder based filament\nThe first 3D-printable foam\nAs mentioned above, PolyWood has a porous structure. In other words it is a foam. In fact it is the first 3D printable foam that has ever been developed to our knowledge. We used a unique foaming technology that stabilizes the air bubbles inside the material (imagine tiny micro-balloons) \u2013 so you can maintain the porous structure during and after the printing. Besides making stuff that looks like wood carvings, you can also think about applications that utilizes its intrinsic foamy structure \u2013 heat insulation, sound insulation, anti-vibration, just to name a few.\nThe Polymakr logo printed with PolyWood\nPrinting conditions\nIn our current version of PolyWood, the base material is PLA. We recommend slightly higher printing temperature and slower printing speed than your typical PLA printing conditions. Heated build plate is not required but use it if your printer is equipped with one.\nMaterials Packaging\nAll filaments are spooled and vacuum sealed in reusable plastic bags. You can check out the picture below for what you will expect to see when you open the box.\nStandard materials packaging\nTo sum it up \u2013 what we are offering\nWhere we are right now\nWe have finished most of our R&D work. That is, all the materials have been developed and thoroughly tested in our lab. We have also developed the manufacturing processes for PolyMax PLA and PolyFlex; the only technical work that remains to be done is to develop the manufacturing process for PolyWood, which we estimate would take another 2-3 months as the extrusion of foamed materials takes more effort, and we need to acquire some additional equipment. With everything said, we will be able to deliver PolyMax PLA and PolyFlex in reasonable quantities (1000 kg each per month) in 1-3 months, and PolyWood in about 3-5 months.\nWhy we need your support (and how the money will be spent)\nOur project started back in mid-2012. It took us one year and a half to reach where we are right now. The intense R&D work has depleted most of our resources and we need some extra help in order to take those products to market. It has been a wonderful journey and we hope we can continue it, with your support!  \nThis is what the money raised in this KickStarter campaign will be spent on, specifically:\nTo acquire necessary manufacturing equipment so we can start producing the filaments in large quantities. We currently have one pilot line on which we have developed the manufacturing processes for PolyMax PLA and PolyFlex, but the line will not be capable to handle the manufacturing of all the 3 materials.\nTo purchase raw materials in large quantities to drive the cost down \u2013 this is to ensure that we deliver to you not just the best products in terms of quality and performance, but also in terms of cost-effectiveness.\nTo support our continual effort to further improve our materials.\nSpecial thanks to KickStarter supporters\nAs our special thanks to all the KickStarter supporters, we will create a special page on our website to list all the supporters\u2019 names. Additionally, those who pledge $60 or above will be given exclusive first access to any future materials that Polymakr develops in the next two years (check out what other things we are currently working on in the \u201cWhat\u2019s Up Next\u201d section). You will be notified via email before we release the products to market so you can get them before anybody else! You will also enjoy a special, lower price, as we guarantee!\nWhat\u2019s Up Next\nBesides the three materials we are offering in this KickStarter campaign, we are also developing a number of other new materials in our lab, including:\nSpecial PLA-based material optimized for support structure; \nStimuli-responsive printing materials (imagine printing things that can change shapes when you heat them)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs mentioned earlier, most of the R&D work has been completed (which took us 1.5 years).

I was instantly amazed by the fascinating concept of compliant mechanisms. To explain this, we should first see what a mechanism is. By definition, a mechanism is \"a mechanical device used to transfer or transform motion, force, or energy\". Traditional mechanisms are mostly rigid-body mechanisms that consist of rigid links connected at movable joints.

Capacitive sensing gives the Kyub extremely sensitive action and an internal accelerometer allows the volume of each note to be precisely controlled for versatile musical expression. You can attach multiple Kyubs to a computer synthesizer or digital audio workstation for solo play, jamming with friends, or composition. A computer with a synthesizer program is required to make music,  Almost any computer-based synthesizer can be used--we provide information on connecting the Kyub to the free demo version of Propellerhead Reason which provides access to hundreds of high quality sounds.  Check the hardware requirements here: http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/new/faq/\nPLAY\n\nThe Kyub assumes the avatar of drums\nLike programming?  \nThe Kyub program can be easily modified to: change the notes assigned to each pad, change the MIDI channel and change the chords assigned to the chord pads in the chord mode, move notes to make them easy to play, change your instrument from guitar to klaxon, play almost any chord progression. \nWe give you super-documented source code using the popular Arduino programming environment (simple C personalized for the Teensy) that will let you set the scale, tweak the note velocity curves, even map different instruments to different pads (say, drums and fife) to get exactly the musical experience you're looking for. \nCertified code jockey? Our hyper commented source code should give you the tools you need to completely change the Kyub DNA. Make a loop recorder, a drum machine, an arpeggiator, assign pads to play musical phrases, tap into the accelerometer for after touch, pitch bending, or scale changes, squeeze the final bit of latency out. We'd love to see where you can take this.\nFully Assembled Kits in Rotwood, Sangria, and Green Tea\nNote on the Kits\nThe kits require soldering and some assembly skills.  You can see what is involved at this link http://www.servoelectricguitar.com/Kyub_build_log.pdf.  The kits are probably not a good choice if you have never worked in electronics or programming unless you have some local support.  The entire assembly takes around 5 hours plus the time it takes you take to decorate the housing. All the parts are included in the full kits, a Teensy 2.0, a printed circuit board with a surface mount accelerometer, all of the electronic components, pads, laser cut housing, and bolts & screws.  \nWhat tools and materials are needed to build a Kyub? A soldering iron and solder, a wire stripper, screw drivers, needle nose pliers, wood glue. \nHow did the Kyub come about?\nI've been working on electronic musical devices for about 10 years. My servoelectric guitar was featured in Popular Science here: http://www.popsci.com/entertainment-amp-gaming/article/2009-03/homemade-guitar-hero?page=0%2C1    Since then I've been working on providing a more intimate and performance friendly interface to electronic synthesizers and digital audio workstations. In particular, I wanted an open source platform constructed of standard components anyone could tailor to particular demands. I teamed up with Petyr Stretz a hacker and electronic music expert and Peggy Brown an industrial designer to see if I couldn't create a design that was functional, innovative and beautiful. We've been working in the last four months to perfect this vision and bring it out in an easy to use kit form.\n What are the features of the Kyub? \n11 fully programmable feather touch keypads on five surfaces of a 3 inch wooden cube. \u00b7\nThree axis 3G accelerometer usable to control note volume, after touch or pitch bending \u00b7\nA Teensy AVR microcontroller with native USB MIDI support programmable with the Arduino tool chain. \u00b7\nThree open source programs for immediate experimentation and playing providing major minor scales pentatonic, blues scale and Japanese scales, chord mode playing, string mode playing and percussion mode playing. \u00b7\nCompatible with most software synthesizers including the free demo of  Propellerhead Reason Essentials providing access to hundreds of high quality synthesized instruments. Works with iPad-based synthesizers as well using the camera adapter accessory \u00b7\nEasy to assemble laser cut wood housing that will accept a variety of finishes.  \nHow does the Kyub work?\nThe internal circuitry monitors each of the keypads to immediately detect even the lightest finger touch reflected in a capacitive disturbance. Acceleration of the Kyub housing associated with a finger touch is converted to a note loudness which together with a pitch determined by the keypad is transmitted over a USB cable in standard MIDI format. The Kyub has low latency on the order of 3 ms providing a highly responsive musical experience.\nRewards \nReward level 1 ($5): Complete electronic documentation\nReward Level 1: Pledge $5 or more and get all the documentation you need to build your own Kyub. Save days of design work with the Eagle files needed to create the printed circuit board, SVG files compatible with Ponoko to laser cut a housing; source code files, a complete build log, instruction manual and more.\nReward level 2 ($26) small kit\nReward Level 2: Pledge $26 or more and get all of the above plus a printed circuit board with a professionally installed three axis accelerometer, a reusable Teensy ($16 value) and printed circuit board parts. Add some pads, switches, and wires (oh yeah, and a housing) and you're in business. Thinking dried gourds? Go for it!   \nReward level 3 ($65): full kit\nReward Level 3: Pledge $65 or more and get all of the above plus the rest of the parts and housing and USB cable needed to build a complete Kyub as shown on this page. Assemble and finish the housing (try crazy paisley) and you can have a one-of-a-kind musical parallelpiped. \nReward levels 4 & 5 ($199 early, $250): fully assembled Kyub\nReward Levels 4 & 5: Pledge $250 or more ($199 for early buyers) and get all of the above but assembled for you. You can be jamming on your USB using synthesizer before you've even unpacked it. Select a color from Sangria, Green Tea, Rotwood, or Natural finish with smoke accents. Fully tested and musically infused. \nHow are we going to use the money?\nThe money from this campaign will let us get volume pricing on the various parts so we can offer the kits for a price far below what it would cost an individual to purchase the necessary components.  We will also purchase an Eagle license that lets us provide printed circuit Eagle files on a commercial basis. Hopefully we will have some left over to start a web site for more info for Kyub users.\nWhat's the status of the design?\nWe are now on our fifth iteration on the design and have final PC board artwork, final laser cutting artwork and a full tested bill of materials. All that's needed is to make a bulk order for parts, and, in the case of the fully constructed Kyubs, fabricate the Kyubs themselves. We have made and tested about six of the final design already and don't see any problem in making the offered 70.\nmore than 6 months of prototypes and testing\nHere is our anticipated fullfillment schedule.  We have considerable experience in assembling the completed Kyubs and the driving factor of the schedule is the time taken to receive the parts from the vendors.

Also I plan to release the screencasts for anyone, probably by publishing them on Youtube.\nFirst Stretch Goal ($10,000):\nACHIEVED!!\nAdd a 5th section to the book that's only on intermediate topics. It will cover the following:\nlambda\ndecorators\nproperties\ndebugging\ntesting\nprofiling\nPart One\nThe first part is the beginner section. In it you will learn all the basics of Python. From Python types (strings, lists, dictionaries) to conditional statements to loops. You will also learn about comprehensions, functions and classes and everything in between! Note: This section has been completed and is in the editing phase.\nPart Two\nThis section will be a curated tour of the Python Standard Library. The intent isn't to cover everything in it, but instead it is to show the reader that you can do a lot with Python right out of the box. We'll be covering the modules I find the most useful in day-to-day programming tasks, such as os, sys, logging, threads, and more.\nPart Three\nNow things get really interesting! In part three, we will be learning how to install 3rd party libraries (i.e. packages) from the Python Package Index and other locations. We will cover easy_install  and pip. This section will also be a series  of tutorials where you will learn how to use the packages you download. For example, you will learn how to download a file, parse  XML, use an Object Relational Mapper to work with a database, etc.\nPart Four\nThe last section of the book will cover how to share your code with your friends and the world! You will learn how to package it up and share it on the Python Package Index (i.e. how to create an egg or wheel). You will also learn how to create executables using py2exe, bb_freeze, cx_freeze and PyInstaller. Finally you will learn how to create an installer using Inno Setup.\nWriting Style\nThis book will be written using my original blogging style. This means that the chapters will be shorter than your usual programming textbook. Most chapters will most likely be less than 10 pages! The idea here is to get the reader up to speed on the subject, not to beat them over the head with it.\nWho should read this book?\nThis book is for beginners, but I believe people with intermediate skills will also find its contents valuable.\nWhat's the money for?\nI need to buy an ISBN for every version of the book, so if I have different eBook formats, the money starts to add up. I have a volunteer editor that I would like to pay. I'm also planning to hire  an illustrator to add some artwork to the pages of the book. I'm looking forward to working with my backers to make the best Python book possible!\nAbout the Author\nI'm a professional full time Python programmer by day and Python blogger by night. I've been programming almost exclusively in Python for almost 8 years. I write for the Python Software Foundation from time to time. I also write articles for DZone and i-programmer every now and then.

It's easy for anyone to use, and it works on iOS, Android and Windows platforms. Use it with a variety of highly-rated apps that enable you to connect with your car like never before. OBDLink MX WiFi is like a swiss army knife for your car!\nDon\u2019t let its modest looks fool you: it is absolutely the awesomest device of its kind, for the following reasons:\nDozens of compatible apps, and more added all the time!\nIntelligent sleep mode: plug it in, and forget about it -- it won't drain your car's battery\nLightning-fast performance, MX WiFi runs circles around the competition\nEasy setup. Yes, even a caveman can do it.\nUncompromising quality, backed by the best warranty in the industry\nFirmware updates. Update MX WiFi with newly developed features.\nOBDLink MX WiFi's functionality is limited only by the imagination of the programmers that write the apps. Apps that exist on the market today, can be used to:\nImprove your gas mileage\nRemote start your car (on select vehicles)\nCreate a digital dashboard or a heads-up display\nBuy a used car with confidence\nLock/unlock doors (on select vehicles)\nClear the \u2018Check Engine\u2019 light, and investigate its cause\nMake your phone go \u201cVroom! Vroom!\u201d, in sync with the gas pedal\nImpress your friends, family, and significant others\nWhen you're checking out a used car, use OBDLink MX WiFi to see if the Check Engine light has recently been cleared, and see if any new trouble codes are pending.\nThe obdCANex app uses MX's advanced network support,.enabling you to control door locks and remotely start the engine on select GM vehicles.\nUse OBDLink MX with the Dash app and unlock enhanced performance, cost savings, and social driving.\nSadly, MX WiFi is not in production yet, and we only shipped a dozen of prototypes to our most trusted beta testers. However, to give you a taste of what to expect, here is what real people posted on Amazon after trying out its cousin, the OBDLink MX Bluetooth:\n\u201cThe greatest thing since sliced bread! ... This is SLICK!\u201d\n\u201cMy favorite feature by far is the auto shutoff, and this adapter is the only one I'm aware of which has it. I leave it plugged in 24/7 in my car and it automatically shuts off after I turn off the car, and comes right back on when I start the engine.\"\n\u201cThis adapter has the fastest response times and supports the largest amount of data out of any of the OBD/Bluetooth adapters. If you're using a program like Torque, you'll want the extra data capacity/speed, as each gauge you add to Torque uses more bandwidth.\u201d\n\u201cDevice worked great and paired with my windows laptop and android phone with no issues. I leave it plugged in all the time and have not had any battery drain issues.\u201d\n\u201cI've used cheapo adapters before, but this one blows them out of the water. This one from Scan Tool provides information at (according to my Torque) at around 40-50 PIDs/second, at least five times that of the old adapter.\u201d\n\u201cAfter reading through a roller coaster of reviews of the Chinese knock offs, I went with the most expensive option but I think I made the right decision. This thing reads PIDs at blazing speeds, it is claimed to be the fastest on the market and I believe it. I never have to worry about a dead battery because it automatically shuts off when the OBD signal stops. It took about 10 seconds to set up on my EVO 4g.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an excellent tool that I am very pleased with. It is fast, accurate, and very useful. It is faster and easier to use than the high dollar scan tools we have in the shop! For about $150, I grab it before the shop one ($2000)! That one is left on the bench!\u201d\n \u201cThis has saved me lots of money and worry. I run a small car lot where I do most everything. Being able to know what\u2019s going on with a car before I buy it is priceless. And knowing what my mechanic told me was true or not keeps him honest.\u201d\n\u201cOBD\u201d stands for \u201cOn-Board Diagnostics\u201d, a network of small rugged computers that control everything in a modern vehicle, from engine and transmission, to anti-lock brakes and climate control. You are likely familiar with one element of the OBD system, the \u201cCheck Engine\u201d light. Another element of the system, the OBD port, allows you to access the network for troubleshooting or other purposes.\nOBDLink MX WiFi is a pocket-sized, wireless device that enables you to access the data available on the OBD network with your smart phone, tablet, or PC. The device plugs into the standard OBD port found in all modern vehicles, and requires no tools to install.\n  The average installation time is 3 minutes, including the OBDLink app download. You can safely leave it plugged in: the unique BatterySaver technology will automatically put the device to sleep. Once you plug it in, MX will appear in the list of available networks as a secure WiFi Access Point.\nThe OBD port is standard on all 1996 and newer vehicles sold in the USA. Manufacturers typically locate the OBD port in the area below the dash, as shown.\nMX supports all legislated OBD-II protocols, plus advanced Ford & GM vehicle networks (Ford MSC and GMLAN). It works with all 1996 & newer cars and light trucks sold in the United States, and also supports EOBD, JOBD, and all other international variants of OBD-II.\nWith OBDLink MX Wifi, you can use your phone or tablet as a diagnostic scan tool, trip computer, heads-up display, and even as a remote control (on select vehicles).\n\n  Create custom digital dashboards\nMeasure and display fuel economy\nDisplay, graph, and log 90+ real-time parameters\nTurn off the \u2018Check Engine\u2019 light\nRead and erase stored, pending, and permanent trouble codes (both generic and manufacturer-specific)\nAccess freeze frame information\nYou'll also get our OBDwiz software, which offers the same functionality on Windows computers.\n  Compatible third party apps offer you a wide assortment of awesome functionality, including:\nControlling windows and door locks on newer GM vehicles\nDisplaying auxiliary gauges on Google Glass\nImproving driving habits, saving money on gas, and remembering where you parked\nAnd of course, making your Honda sound like a Ferrari\nMost WiFi-enabled OBD adapters only work in so-called \u201cAd Hoc\u201d mode. With Ad-Hoc, you have to manually configure your IP settings every time you want to connect to the adapter. To make matters worse, Android users have to root their phone for Ad-Hoc adapters to work.\nOBDLink MX WiFi dispenses with the Ad Hoc mode altogether, and provides you with 3 useful modes:\nAP (Server) mode\nInfrastructure (Client) mode\nWeb Configuration\nJust select 'OBDLink MX' from the list of available WiFi networks, and enter the supplied unique passphrase. Your phone can still use 3G/4G for Internet connectivity.\nIn infrastructure mode, MX connects to an existing WiFi network. The pairing process is simple: push the WPS button on the router, then press MX\u2019s multi-function button. MX broadcasts its presence on the network, allowing compatible apps to automatically\nOBDLink MX WiFi has a built-in web interface for editing connection settings from your phone, tablet, or PC.\nProven Technology\nOBDLink MX WiFi is based on the hugely successful OBDLink MX Bluetooth, launched in 2011. It has overvoltage protection, doesn\u2019t get hot, and reliably connects to all OBD-II compliant vehicles.\n\nUnmatched Software Support\nIn addition to the included OBDLink apps and OBDwiz software, OBDLink MX WiFi will work, out-of-the-box, with dozens of existing third-party applications, across multiple mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nOpen Architecture\nWe don\u2019t use a proprietary protocol in an effort to create a closed ecosystem. In fact, we published the programming manual and designed an inexpensive OBD simulator to promote the creation of new apps. If you\u2019re interested in developing OBD applications, contact us for help getting started.\n\nPrivacy\nLast year saw the launch of a number of OBD adapters that have a cellular radio, and save user data in the cloud as part of their normal operation. We encourage you to read their user agreements before you sign up. As for our part, we promise that when you use OBDLink MX WiFi, your data will not be analyzed, used for surveillance/tracking, or sold to advertising and insurance companies. And since the data isn\u2019t automatically saved, hackers won\u2019t be able to get at it, either. With OBDLink MX, you truly have full control over your information.\n\nNo Monthly Fees\nThere\u2019s no data plan, no subscription fees, and no hidden costs.\n\nSuperior Design\nYou don't have to look hard to find cheap wireless OBD adapters of all shapes and sizes. The vast majority of them are clones of our hugely popular, but by now largely obsolete ElmScan 5 ELM327-based design. Besides getting hot and sometimes catching on fire due to questionable workmanship, these clones have a number of inherent design flaws: excessive car battery drain, lack of security, difficulty establishing and maintaining a connection, complicated setup, and disappointing data performance. OBDLink MX has been designed from the ground up to address these shortcomings.\n\n\nUNLOCKED! Thank you for your incredible support!\n  OBDLink MX supports all model year 1996+ cars and light trucks sold in the United States, as well as vehicles based on EOBD (Europe), JOBD (Japan), and all other international variants of OBD-II.\nOBDLink MX WiFi is compatible with vehicles in the above countries. For imports, compatibility is determined by the country of origin. All-electric vehicles are not required to be compliant with OBD, but hybrids are.\nOBDLink MX WiFi can work with any WiFi-enabled smart phone, tablet, or PC. Officially supported platforms (this means, we verified that MX WiFi works with apps running under these operating systems) include:\niOS (iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch)\nAndroid phones & tablets\nWindows Phone\nWindows 2000 and later PCs\nGiven MX\u2019s open architecture and strict adherence to the 802.11 standard, we anticipate apps to be developed for other platforms as well. In fact, compatible third party applications are already popping up for several other platforms, including Blackberry and Linux.\nOBDLink MX works with Android, iOS, & Windows operating systems. Use it with any WiFi-enabled phone, tablet, or laptop.\n\nYou'll have lots of app and software options, as OBDLink MX is backwards-compatible with the popular ELM327 command set.

Vitaliy graduated from DeVry University with a degree in Computer Engineering Technology.\nJason Smith, Senior Engineer\nJason is responsible for creating the assembly-line tester, which will be used by the factory to program and stress-test the devices to make sure they will long outlast our 3-year warranty. Jason earned his degree in Electronic Engineering Technology from DeVry University.\nIt\u2019s been a long journey, but we are nearing the finish line: the prototypes are meeting our expectations, and as soon as the remaining WiFi glitches are fixed, we will be ready to begin production. All we need, is one last push. Your pledges will be used to cover the cost of manufacturing the first batch of OBDLink MX WiFi\u2019s.\nDon\u2019t wait to make your pledge: we are practically giving away the first 100 units, and once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.

While testing the prototypes, engineers discovered several elusive glitches that may negatively affect user experience. The engineers created a suite of automated tests, and are working with the vendor on tracking down the remaining bugs. If worst comes to worst, our contingency plan calls for implementing workarounds in the driver code.\n\n* New assembly-line tester. Using lessons learned from the previous generation testers, we designed a new tester to drastically reduce the time necessary to test each unit, and provide more details about the failures, which will enable the production manager to quickly identify and correct manufacturing problems. There is a small chance that it may not be ready in time for production, forcing the factory to fall back to using the slower old testers.\n\n* Unforeseen manufacturing difficulties. Over our 12 years in business, we\u2019ve seen projects get delayed for all sorts of reasons: from being unable to buy a particular transistor, to floods that keep delivery trucks from reaching the factory. To minimize this risk, we followed a stringent, proven pre-production checklist. Barring natural disasters, there should not be any delays due to manufacturing.\n\nOBDLink MX WiFi was designed by the same team of engineers that designed the hugely successful OBDLink MX Bluetooth, and will be manufactured at the same facility.

We wanted to learn by doing \u2013 so that when it came time to make the kit and get it to your door, we wouldn't slip on a banana peel. \n(We also folded and packed the boxes in our apartment \u2013 but that was just for fun.)\nWhat's inside?\n1 \u2013 Kano Books, illustrated and intuitive\n2 \u2013 Kano OS and Levels on 8GB SD card\n3 \u2013 DIY Speaker\n4 \u2013 Raspberry Pi Model B\n5 \u2013 Kano Keyboard Combo\n6 \u2013 Custom case\n7 \u2013 Card mods and stencils\n8 \u2013 Stickers!\n9 \u2013 Cables: HDMI*, Mini-USB\n10 \u2013 Smart power plug (all region pins available)\n11 \u2013 WiFi powerup\nThe Kano box is light, recyclable, repackable, and fits through 85% of urban mailboxes.\nOur favorite pledges\nWe'd love to send you these rewards for supporting us, and there are even more at right.\nWhy?\n99% of the world is designed by and for a tech-literate 1%. That's a problem, caused by:\nClosed devices\nUn-fun, top-down teaching\nThe intimidation factor \u2013 \"geeks\" vs \"noobs\"\nWe often draw lines between things: art and science, code and design, STEM and the humanities. It makes \u201cdigital literacy\u201d seem like brussels sprouts \u2013 good for you, but hard to chew.\nIt shouldn't be so hard to get started \u2013 to make, play and experiment right out of the box.\nStart coding\nKano is a toolkit for anyone to start coding right away. \nWe think you learn faster and better when you have control and freedom, like in a good videogame. Then, when you can bend the rules, things get kung fu.\nWe love visual programming languages, especially Scratch, and wanted to hook them up to our favorite games. We came up with Kano Blocks, inspired by Google's Blockly and many hours of button-mashing. \nConnect blocks, output Python or Javascript, and see games change before your eyes, with live code updating. Make your own power-ups (two-player-mode, teleportation) then earn new ones. Huge Pong balls! Massive TNT towers! Code cheats, beat your friends.\nOur software combines Kano OS, a distribution of Debian Linux, with an interface that feels a bit like a console game. It runs six Kano Levels, software projects to make Pong, Snake, Minecraft, videos, and music \u2013 with (inshallah) more to come.\nWe're also loaded with Scratch, Codecademy, and \"Hacking Fundamentals,\" an introduction to the world of the Linux shell, where you can join the free software movement worldwide (and go on spy missions).\nSimple steps, fantastic projects \nA year ago, we started with a book \u2013 Lego-inspired, with a hint of our favorite manga. It's beautifully illustrated, instructional, with an achievement on every page. Our narrative (and name) is inspired by judo, and its creator, Kano Jigoro, a lifelong schoolteacher.\nIn the Bronx or Beijing \nKano is for everyone, so you can get our books in English, Spanish, Arabic, or Mandarin, and we're working on more languages. We deliver around the world with flat shipping costs. (See rewards at right.)\nWe'd love to make you a $99 kit. But any pledge, any size, will go toward building the first computer made by and for the majority world, and end-to-end with open source software.\nPlug and play your own way \nWe designed the Kano Kit to be a bit like our favorite boardgames growing up. It's vibrant, repackable, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Trick out your computer with stickers, decals, and your own designs. Or turn your computer into a mini-boombox with a D.I.Y. speaker, powered by an amp and the Pi's own GPIO pins.\nAt school and at work\nMake Kano with your cousin, your Dad, your friends, or your dog. (Caution: do not put stickers on dog.) The kit is also great for schools, clubs, companies, and places where people ponder. It introduces computing and code in simple, tactile ways.\nMake hardware\nHack games\nShare projects\nOnboard Scratch, Codecademy, Minecraft, and more\nKano provides pedagogy, exercises, and tools for each key stage rubric in the new UK computing curriculum \u2013 it's great for small groups (a semester project) or a take-home project.\nGet the projects and books\nWe want to get our content and software into your hands as soon as we can. Support us with more than $9, and you'll be an Alpha hero \u2013 you'll get early downloads of our books and software before our full release. $9 is a great pledge for anyone who has a Pi in their drawer and wants a cool way to get started (or teach it!).\n(Pledge more than $19, and we'll send you a t-shirt and stickers too!)\nSupport computer kits for kids\nKano Academy is our not-for-profit project. Through it, we're working to get low-cost, homebrew tech into the hands of smart young people woldwide. We need your help to keep it going. So far, we:\nSupported a scholarship for the 16-year-old inventor Kelvin Doe \u2013 Freetown, Sierra Leon\nSupported the Caine's Arcade scholarship fund in Los Angeles, USA\nSponsored the Learning Inventions team to workshop RPi robotics with fifty kids in Chiang Mai, Thailand \nThirty gratis 'make a computer' workshops in Primary & Secondary Schools around the UK\nCommitted to sponsor Kano kits to Martha Chumo, who's setting up a non-profit Dev School in Nairobi, Kenya \nCommitted to donate 25 Kano kits to a new Innovation Lab in Freetown, Sierra Leon\nSponsored the first Codemakers camp in Newcastle, UK\nSupported the Internet Archive to rebuild its fire-damaged scanning center in San Francisco, CA\nWe want to get kits to those who have been excluded \u2013 by economics or geography. Your pledge helps us make it possible. \nPledge $229, get a kit for yourself, and give one to a kid\nIf you want a kit and you're feeling the holiday warmth, consider pledging on behalf of a smart kid who can't afford one. Just email us at rewards@kano.me to let us know you want to Give-One-Get-One, and we'll pledge the kit in your name, to whomever you want, after the campaign.\nOr, if you're feeling extra magnanimous, you can bump up to a Kano Lab pledge. You'll utterly transform a classroom, makespace, or institution with DIY computers and a hands-on introduction from us. (Details at right.) Oh and you get a Kano kit too which is sweet.\nProudly Pi\nWe love building on top of the Raspberry Pi board, and alongside the foundation and community. We're working open up the device's promise and power to everyone, and expand the ecosystem. \nWe've designed brand new hardware and new hacks, and fixed dozens of known issues on the Pi \u2013 they'll be open, so anyone can have at them and improve. \nWho are you people?\nWe're a group of eight from six different countries. We've been around for a year now, making things we think are cool and shipping kits around the world. \nIf we were a collective animal, it would be an octopus.\npizza, beer, sidewalk, kano\nThe Challenge\nLast November, Alex, Yonatan, and Saul were trying to imagine what a computer for the next generation would look like. \nthe aforementioned\nIn the end, it came down to a challenge from Micah, a smart seven-year-old \u2013 Saul's boychik, Alex's cousin.\nMicah wanted to make his own computer. But he had two rules:\nIt had to be as simple and fun \"as Lego.\"\nNo one \"teaches me\" how to do it (zzz)\nSaul introduced Yonatan (who loves big challenges) to Alex (who likes beautiful things and good stories.)\nThen this happened (*whooosh flashback*)\nHey Kickstarter!\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year making, playing, and remaking the kit around the world with \nhundreds of young people\ntech educators\nmusicians\nteachers\ngamers\nand the open-source community. \nThe prototype works beautifully, we\u2019ve nailed suppliers and production, and we know we can make it at $99 \u2013 so it can reach everyone. \nBut we need your help to make it happen\nWe always knew that Kano was something we wanted to take directly to Kickstarter for a first run. It's a place that blurs those lines from earlier \u2013 art, science, etc. \u2013 and thus can make really audacious dreams come true. \n$100,000 will allow us to make up to 1000 more kits, keep the lights on, and work on new hardware expansions. With your help, we can continue to make \"making\" even more accessible and fun.\nA bonus!\nKickstarter backers will be the first to get the new Kano Kit, and also to play with the new Kano OS as treasured Alpha testers. \nPlus, just for here, we're offering the Kano keyboard as a separate accessory \u2013 wireless, independent mouse buttons, multitouch trackpad, awesome, orange. Just pledge more than $49 to get it.\n(Smaller than a Subway sandwich.)\nEverything is a prototype\nWe want to keep designing projects, books, software levels, hardware, and experiences that you want \u2013 then releasing and open-sourcing them as soon as they're working. It's messy but fun, and keeps us thinking.\nEarly book sketch (boom!)\nEarly case rapid prototype\nKit starts to take shape\nIt fits!\nOrigin of species\nProduction timeline\nPledge promise\nBefore Kickstarting, we wanted to ensure we could make good on our promises. So we started early \u2013 we designed, developed and released 200 prototype kits (white box), and brought them to market. \nA year later, we\u2019ve sourced hundreds of components from dozens of suppliers, completed product assembly and order fulfillment ourselves (at first from Yonatan and Alex\u2019s apartment), and pulled off operations for our early adopters. If you join us with a pledge, we'll be able to go the last mile.\nIt\u2019s been an adventure, and we\u2019re ready for larger volumes and new expansions. Our prototypes are up, running, and ready for next summer \u2013 all we need is you.\nWe hope we can get you started with Kano.

We've also built on top of the work of fine Pi hackers like Sam Aaron, Rich Wareham, and Alex Bradbury, and are pushing all our own code back into the community. We are also grateful for the Debian community, who have been huge assets as we try and create a new generation of open-source engineers and creators by making Linux fun. We're also grateful to Mojang for Minecraft and the Pi Edition. \nFor the new hardware and packaging, we worked with the geniuses at MAP, industrial designers who make mindblowing classroom chairs and watering cans. They've pioneered a process called \"informed creativity\" and were founded by the guys who did the London Olympic Torch. We collaborated with Jon Marshall, Scott Barwick, and Jacky Chung, mould-breaking thinkers and artists.\nWe started this a year ago with the thought that anyone should be able to make and change technology. We're just one group of people working in a broader movement to bring technological creativity to the masses (Codecademy, Code.org, Raspberry Pi). Hope you can be, like us, a small part.\nSome things we're glad people said\n\"There's enormous value to platforms like Kano which add hardware, software, peripherals and documentation to the Pi to make it more appealing to users who are under-served by the standard offering. I've had a play with early versions of the Kano software environment, and I think Alex and the team are doing great work making the Pi more accessible to younger and less technical audiences.\"\n-Eben Upton, Founder, CEO, Inventor, Raspberry Pi\n\"The Kano Kit was really inspirational to young people in Freetown.\" -Kelvin Doe, inventor, aka \"DJ Focus,\"\n\u201cAdults think we're incapable, but we made a computer with this like, Matrix code.

During that time we noticed that the storage of filament material was an area where consumer printing was lacking.\nWe started by leaving our material on the printer or on the desk while not in use. However, over time we noticed reduced print quality as a result of moisture being absorbed into the material before printing. Next, we began placing all material in a plastic bag, this proved inadequate and we were continually ripping the plastic bags as we removed the material to be used, while still struggling with inconsistent prints. The second issue that we were confronted with during a material change on our printer was the time and frustration accompanied it.\nLooking to solve both of these problems with the current state of consumer 3D printing we designed and built The Filament Safe.  \nThe Design\nThe Filament Safe is built with high quality materials that are both functional in this application and also eye appealing. The clear Acrylic case helps you determine what color and how much material you have remaining without opening the safe. This not only is quick and easy, but also reduces the need to unnecessarily expose your material to a high moisture environment. A large amount of testing has gone into this enclosure to ensure each Filament Safe manufactured meets quality requirements.\nThe Filament Safe is an airtight container that not only ensures that excessive moisture does not enter your material between prints but can also shorten the material change over time required. 3D printing materials such as ABS, PLA and Nylon are greatly affected by moisture from the environment by which they are stored. Simply leaving a spool of material out overnight in an unsealed container causes the material to absorb moisture and increase the potential for delamination or bubbles in your material. These issues cause inconsistent extrusion widths reducing the finish quality of your prints. Some people have found a solution for this problem by drying their material in an oven or clothes dryer for hours before use, but this is a time consuming process that if not done correctly can cause more harm than good.\nPLAY\n\nWe have designed The Filament Safe to have a capacity of up to three filament spools. These are shown below:\nSingle Stall Filament Safe\nDouble Stall Filament Safe\nTriple Stall Filament Safe\nFor your appreciated support we have set up the rewards that are located to the right. These include one, two and three stall Filament Safes, as well Perception Engineering filament in your choice of color. There are also other rewards including a 3D printed moving gear cube designed by Emmett on www.thingivers.com, pictured below. Each of the reward levels include packaging and shipping.\n3D Printed Gear Cube Reward\nTimeline\nThe manufacturing of all of the components that go into The Filament Safe are lined up and prepared for the work load that will be present. Each reward level is set with enough time for our team to line up all logistics with purchased parts to ensure that we meet or beat the estimated delivery date on each reward. We will also be providing updates on the status of each reward through email, where we will also be available for questions or concerns regarding when you will be receiving your product. We are excited to get this rolling and start shipping out the production Filament Safe's!\nWhy We Need Your Help\nWe have tested and verified this concept by prototyping our one stall safe (dim. 9\"x9\"x4\"). With your help we will be able to purchase bulk quantities of the materials required to make The Filament Safe at a competitive price. As well as set up the necessary assembly fixtures and team to ensure a top quality product. Thank you in advance for all of your help!\nThe Team\nThe design team of this project consisted of Stephen Wierenga and Dan Koster, both are degreed engineers with years of product design and manufacturing experience in both plastics and sheet metal.

It offers something for every train fan - from the tools to create your own rail line, commands to operate multiple trains, and a choice of simple or realistic cab controls to hop inside the cab and become a driver in charge a 3,000 tonne freight train or a high speed passenger service.\nTrainz: A New Era - more realism, more features, more tools, more content, and of course, the amazing graphics that you have been asking for.\nWith the support of our fans from all around the world, here are our plans that will deliver the best ever version of Trainz - Trainz Simulator: A New Era.\nWe've been busy working behind the scenes designing and creating an all new custom-built game engine, code-named \"E2\". This new engine will deliver a major upgrade in graphics capabilities and performance.\nE2 features the latest technology including HDR (High Dynamic Range) rendering, whole-world real-time per-pixel lighting, native multi-threading support, 64-bit processing support and unlimited seamless streaming. With customized \"graphics shaders\" a huge new range of special effects will be possible such as reflective surfaces, heat haze effects, depth-of-field effects and atmospheric fog. \nBy offloading major systems to separate CPU cores and maximising performance, E2 will support additional physical effects. For example smoke will be affected by local wind conditions or hitting an overpass, and weather (rain, snow, even autumn leaves) that will collide against solid objects.\nVIDEO: Comparison of Trainz today and \"tomorrow\"\nPLAY\n\nSo what does that all mean in layman's terms? It means E2 will support:\nlarger, more detailed routes/environments;\nlighting which automatically casts shadows from all solid objects including terrain;\nfully detailed and animated pedestrians, passengers, wildlife, cars, trucks and trains;\nrealistic environmental effects such as locally modelled environmental conditions including cloud formation, volumetric fogging, localised rain and snow effects, wind-blown trees and grass;\nsmoke billowing out of a tunnel or rain splashing in a puddle;\nheat shimmer from hot diesel engines;\nsubstantially improved in-editor performance.\nIn one sentence, E2 will provide a huge boost in power and performance to make routes more realistic and perform better than ever before.\nVIDEO: Find out more about our new E2 Simulation Engine from our Lead Programmer:\nPLAY\n\nIf you haven't seen what Trainz is all about, watch the following video which shows the \"current generation\" of Trainz using the previous game engine.\nVIDEO: Trainz Simulator 12 - Released April 2011\nIn railroad terms, a manifest is a list of cars in a mixed freight train. In terms of our four-track plan, the manifest is the list of features that we will be including in our 'Initial Goal' release. In other words, the feature set that we will deliver in December 2014 as a result of this Kickstarter project. \nWe have chosen a set of features that will provide a fantastic user experience, while keeping the scope of the project manageable (i.e. delivery within a year). \nDRIVING PHYSICS ENHANCEMENTS\nFrom your feedback over the years, the most significant feature for many people is the accuracy of the simulation. This is why enhancements to the driving experience are at the very top of our T2 feature list.\nFor the technically-minded, our physics model uses a variety of configurable inputs such as engine power, train weight and rolling resistance, then takes into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each car in the train. We then calculate the forces at work 30 times a second and as a result, the train accelerates or decelerates and moves along the track accordingly.\nT2 introduces brand new Real-time Physics Editing tools enabling users to enter known specifications then accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted \u201con-the-fly\u201d. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).\nGrade resistance intersection with power curve shows balancing speed\nIf physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite loco performance to the experts and you will still have the choice of 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.\nInitial Goal Features\nOf course Trainz is not all about driving and physics. As part of our Initial Goal Features, we will also be updating a large number of our existing systems as well as adding new tools and functionality. Continual improvement has been and always will be a big part of our development process.\nIn addition to the new engine, new physics and a general system upgrade, we have sufficient time in our schedule to add two more major systems. By pledging at the Engineer Reward Level or higher you will earn a vote to help determine which two of the following four features will be included in our initial release. The remaining two features will then be moved to the top of our Stretch Goal list.\nUpdate Dec 18th: $190,000 target reached! The 3rd feature will be included at release. If we reach $215,000 prior to Pre-Beta release, all four of these features will be included at release. \nLatecomers: You can still pledge in 2014 through our online store.\nCheck the FAQ section below for more details\nPlease note, we will also be releasing a feature-limited \"Driver Edition\" available through the Track Crew and Guard Reward Levels. This version is the same as the Full Version, excluding the Surveyor module. Surveyor includes all the world and session creation tools and physics editing tools. It will be possible to unlock the Surveyor Module via an in-game purchase option should you wish to upgrade in the future.\nREAD UPDATE #10: Discover how to become part of Trainz history!\nTrainz is a project which can be continually extended by adding new systems and updating existing features. As one new system is completed, another system becomes the next \"must-have\" feature. With the success of this Kickstarter project, we will be able to add the additional resources to ensure those systems are implemented sooner rather than later. \nIf our Initial Goal funding target is reached, we will then be ready for the even more exciting Stretch Goal phase. Every additional $50,000 raised will add new features into the schedule. By expanding the team and/or outsourcing we will be able to make the product even bigger and better and achieve all this sooner.\nUpdate Dec 2nd: Reaching $215,000 will result in the 3rd and 4th \"Initial Goal\" features being included at release. The next $50,000 milestone will result in the first from the following list of 25 features being added.\nWe have prepared the following list based upon your feedback and categorized the list into Stretch Goals of similar size and scope. The priority order of the Stretch Goal Feature Sets will then be determined in conjunction with the Trainz Pioneer Council and pledges from Senior Engineer Reward Level and above.\nCheck the FAQ section below for more details\nRemember, the higher your pledge level, the better chance we have of reaching our Stretch Goal targets, and the sooner your favourite feature can be implemented.\nIn addition to the \"New Era\" product, most reward tiers offer a selection of existing products to keep you occupied while you await delivery.\nGet-Trainz-Now Selection  \nWith most of the reward options, you also receive the Get-Trainz-Now Selection. This provides you a choice from the following list of existing Trainz products and will be awarded in January 2014. Your selection will be made via the completion survey sent to you when the Kickstarter project is successful.\nTrain fans love to travel the world and with Trainz they can do it all without leaving home!\nThird party content creators from every corner of the globe have been collaborating to provide fantastic routes, sessions and content for Trainz for many years. Thanks to tireless efforts by a number of teams, we are aiming to have up to 16 new routes available by release date. The list of content that will be included in the initial release will be determined as the routes are finalized.\nAt the Trainz Crew Reward Level you become part of the beta testing community including access to each of these routes. At the Engineer Level, you receive pre-beta access enabling you to assist these teams with early stage testing, research, photographs, session design and more. \nMore detailed information on the routes, sessions and rolling stock to be included will be confirmed once the 3rd party content creators begin to finalize their content sets.   \nHaving a great plan, a great product and a great team are all important, but there's one element that is required for the success of this Kickstarter project. This is where you become the vital part of the operation to drive us to our initial fundraising Goal. \nKickstarter is \u201call or nothing\u201d funding. To make this project a reality, the equation is simple; we need approximately 3,300 people to pledge $50 or 5,500 people to pledge $30, or any other combination that hits the Initial Goal target.\nIf we don't reach our target, no money changes hands and no rewards are issued. (i.e. your credit card is only charged if the project is successful).\nYou now have the power to help us build the best ever version of Trainz.\nThere's a variety of rewards on offer - game versions, digital artworks, collector's items and of course various levels of voting, pre-beta and beta testing access, or even deeper involvement in the design phase. \nIt is time to review the rewards, choose your pledge level and make this project happen. \nJust as importantly, we need you to spread the word about Trainz on Kickstarter. More people means more pledges means more features - it's a win-win. \nClick on the Share link, talk about the project with friends and family, spread the word on your favourite forums and convince others how much they will enjoy the Trainz experience. With your help we will be sure to reach our target.\nScroll through the reward options below, then find and click on your chosen reward level in the right hand column to pledge your support.\nUPDATE: REWARDS STILL AVAILABLE\nAlthough Kickstarter has ended, you can still choose most rewards through our online Store - just click on the 'Make a Pledge' button below then choose your reward. \nRemember, the higher the tier you choose, the more likely we are to reach our goal, and the more involvement you can have in helping steer the path of Trainz into the future.\nLatest Update:\nJoin history.

Rand\u2019s magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. Thirty-five years later, a Library of Congress survey reported that Atlas Shrugged was the second most influential book ever written - second only to the Bible.\nFor decades, her books have inspired millions while at the same time sparking vigorous debate in social, and at times, political circles.\nWhat has made Atlas Shrugged withstand the test of time, and continue to sell hundreds of thousands of books every year, is just how relevant people find the message of the book to what they\u2019re experiencing today. Amazingly, it is incredible word-of-mouth alone that continues to drive sales.\nAtlas Shrugged tells the compelling story of a Country whose economic system is on the brink of collapse. As the economy continues to spin out of control, brilliant men and women, from artists to industrialists, continue to mysteriously disappear at the hands of the unknown.\nSimilar to the history of our own country, Atlas Shrugged tells the story of real heroes amongst men and their entirely unique and inspiring battle for independence and freedom. And, as the story of Atlas Shrugged unfolds, we the readers come to learn the true meaning of integrity.\nAfter its initial publication, Ayn Rand aspired to produce Atlas Shrugged into a motion picture. Whatever the reason, fear of failure or lack of courage, Hollywood wasn\u2019t interested - until 2010 when John Aglialoro and Harmon Kaslow began production on the film trilogy.\nKickstarter gives us a great opportunity to reach out to a whole new audience as well as affording fans of the book a chance to participate and join us in being part of the celebration of Ayn Rand\u2019s ideas.\nAtlas Shrugged was written over 50 years ago as a warning to future generations. This movie is being produced to alert those same generations.\nAyn Rand on Johnny Carson in 1967\nA message from Producer John Aglialoro\n\"I purchased the rights to Atlas Shrugged back in 1992 because Atlas Shrugged touched my life - in more ways than I can count. If you too have been touched by Rand's work, if you feel an impact has made on your life as a direct result of reading her works, this is your moment to say 'thank you' and help spread the message of Atlas.\" - John Aglialoro, Producer  \nBe part of Atlas Shrugged Histoy\nTo become one of our backers, just click on the big green button to the right of our video.

Learn more here!\nUpdate 2: Haptix: both a mouse and a... keyboard? Check it out here!\nUpdate 3: Design in 3D or play first-person games with only your fingers! Check out some awesome videos of Haptix!\nWork or play, make life easier with Haptix.\nMultitouch is fun and natural to use, but it's only present on a few devices. Because tablets and smartphones are easy to use, they're also easy to enjoy. But as great as multitouch screens are, it's still hard to beat the mouse/keyboard combo when it comes to productivity. We wondered if it was possible to combine the best of both worlds -- introducing Haptix.\nHaptix turns ANY surface into a multitouch surface. It's a sleek bar that you can place flat or clip on something elevated to enable multitouch on any flat surface, such as a table, window, or screen. You can then control any computer by tapping, pinching to zoom, or swiping to scroll on that surface itself. It's as intuitive and natural as a multitouch screen, just without the actual screen.\nUsing the TV becomes natural again\nFor artists and engineers alike -- capture your pen/brush strokes with Haptix\nBut it's more than just multitouch - it's 3D multitouch. Even when your fingers are above the surface, you see them appear on the screen. This way, you know exactly what you're selecting when you tap the surface. To click on a link, simply move your finger over the link and tap down; it's so much faster than swiping on a trackpad. When you're touching what you see, it's just like reaching out and touching the screen itself, except your hands are well-rested right in front of you.\nSee your fingers before they touch the surface\nControlling anything becomes much easier. Whether you're using your laptop or your TV, you get to enjoy the intuitive multitouch experience we know and love. Tap on a link to open it? Pinch to zoom in on a picture? Swipe to get those falling fruits? Do it all from the comfort of resting your hands on a surface.\nHaptix is a mouse-killer.\nCan Haptix replace the mouse? We believe it can. Point it at your table, and bam, use your hands as your mouse and much more. Haptix can be used in 3 modes:\nMultitouch\nTrackpad\nMouse\nYou can either treat the surface like a multitouch screen or a trackpad, or define different functions for different fingers. For instance, you can use your middle finger as the cursor, your index finger to left click, and your ring finger to right click. We haven't used the mouse in a while, and we haven't found the need yet.\nMake Excel simpler with five-finger multitouch\nNo mouse? Use your hand instead.\nCreate two layers of interaction with 3D multitouch.\n3D multitouch adds a layer of 3D sensing on top of a layer of multitouch. These two forms of interaction complement each other perfectly and each makes up for what the other lacks. Your fingers' positions are captured even before they touch the surface, so you know what you're controlling when you tap or pinch on the surface.\n3D multitouch takes a completely different approach to 3D sensing that solves fundamental problems with 3D sensing today. Other solutions require you to hold your hands in the air, which can be awkward and makes precise control almost impossible. With Haptix, you get 3D sensing that:\nGives you tactile feedback (the satisfying feel of touch)\nAllows you to rest your hands on a surface\nLets you define the space of operation\nAllows you to control things on a surface with precision\nHas practical applications in improving productivity\n3D multitouch moves multitouch away from screens. Portable multitouch is one of the best things to happen to multitouch. If you have a tablet, you're looking down while using it and your neck might hurt over time. Or if you have an ultrabook, you're constantly reaching out and your arm hurts over time. And even in both these cases, your hands cover part of the screen (plus smudges). With 3D multitouch, these problems just go away.\nUsing a tablet/multitouch screen\nUsing Haptix\nHaptix is based on patent-pending breakthrough algorithms in computer vision and image processing. We've rejected virtually every conventional method of making such things possible and formulated better techniques to take their place. Haptix tracks the 3D coordinates of fingers and calculates their positions relative to the surface, and it works through the same principle as how our eyes see things (aka stereo vision). Since Haptix doesn't rely on infrared or thresholding, this makes Haptix the first affordable 3D sensing solution to be able to be used while looking down at a surface, under ANY lighting condition, and while on the go. \nA few ways we love using Haptix:\nClip it on top of your laptop. Turn your keyboard into a multitouch keyboard, and then control your computer ENTIRELY FROM your keyboard. The surface of your keyboard becomes a multitouch pad, so you glide your fingers across the top of the keys. Remember those pesky Excel sheets that make you keep going between mouse/trackpad and keyboard? Remember wanting to play a first-person shooter game but not having your mouse? With Haptix, those days are gone. To set it up, simply plug it in, do a quick four-point calibration, and you'll be up and running! Worried about typing? Don't worry, Haptix automatically deactivates when you type. \nHaptix works on Windows XP/Vista/7/8 and Ubuntu\nLeave Haptix on your laptop\nAt last, first-person games on the laptop\nPut it on your sofa while you watch TV. It's nice to have a personal multitouch remote in front of you while you're watching TV. Flipping through videos or apps becomes a breeze.\nWe're working hard on great hardware and production quality.\nHaptix has an anodized beadblasted aluminum casing for a great look and feel. Having tried various materials, we believe that nothing beats a sleek aluminum finish, and we hope you agree.\nAn anodized glass-bead-blasted aluminum finish\nWe want Haptix to be as high-quality as possible. Currently, Haptix's dimensions are 3 x 3 x 8 cm with a 120\u00b0 field of view. But we're moving to a 150\u00b0 angle with vastly better lenses, and are working hard to shrink the electronics without increasing costs. So you can bet that Haptix WILL get smaller.\nHaptix is basically a camera. Or more specifically, Haptix consists of two CMOS image sensors (those you find in your webcams), which capture the position of your hands in 640x360 resolution, attached to a microcontroller, which does most of the processing so your computer doesn't have to. It works with visible light, but employs infrared when environmental illumination is low, so it works in the dark too! Haptix connects to your computer through a USB 2.0 cable.\nA peek inside Haptix's electronics\nWe have great manufacturing partners. With the help of some of the most experienced veterans in the Chinese manufacturing scene, we're working closely (so close we're literally in the same city) with manufacturers to get the best quality product into your hands. \nAluminum factory: We've made molds for the aluminum and plastic parts.\nComponent suppliers: We've tested samples of image sensors and other components from suppliers, and have secured the best ones.\nContract manufacturers: We've gone back-and-forth over schematics, assembly, and packaging -- finalizing tooling will be our next step.\nUSPS: For when we're ready to ship!\nHere's our projected timeline:\nNovember: Perform a sample production run, then debug and test\nFebruary: Start shipping\nWhat's next?\nSupport for Android and OSX. We want you to be able to use Haptix with your Android smart TVs and MacBooks, and are hard at work on that. We'll make sure Haptix works on those platforms by the time it ships!\nDeveloper SDK. Haptix integrates with your system right out of the box, which means that you can use it with pretty much any program. But you may have ideas (the crazier the better) on how you'd like to manipulate tracking data from Haptix (from 3D motion sensing to gesture control), and we want you to try those out!\n360\u00b0 hinge. The front piece on Haptix's clip doesn't interfere when you close your laptop (it's as thin as a credit card), so our next step in making Haptix something you can leave on your laptop all the time is to design a cost-effective hinge for Haptix that allows you to bend it all the way back. This way, Haptix can sit unobtrusively on top of your laptop when you pack it in a bag. \nWe need you.\nWe can't wait to get Haptix into your hands. Our Kickstarter will fund refinement of the electronics and additional tooling for mass production. It'll also give us an idea how many to include in our first production orders, so it's your chance to be the first to enjoy interacting with your computer in an entirely different way. If we go over our Kickstarter goal, we'll be able to develop additional features for you such as different colors and other cool stuff we have planned. More on that later!\nJoin us! When you use Haptix for the first time, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you helped make it happen. Take part in this movement to change how YOU interact with your computer.\nLet 3D multitouch improve how you interact with computers - for good.\nA huge thanks to our friends and mentors from The Iron Yard startup accelerator, Zhexiong Manufacturing, and the Thiel Foundation!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuality is our biggest concern and our greatest emphasis while manufacturing in China. Haptix is composed of several different parts that is sourced from different suppliers. Managing the quality of these different parts, especially when they come together, will be difficult. But we have visited suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that Haptix can be manufactured with great quality, and we certainly won't let our standards stoop. This has given us enough confidence to know that we will be able to deliver Haptix as a great quality product, no matter what.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 1752, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/haptix/haptix-multitouch-reinvented", "project_name": "Haptix: Multitouch Reinvented"}}, {"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thanks for your amazing support of the Kickstarter campaign! The next chapter of Lightpack project is just beginning now.\nHere is a summary of updates and links you might find quite useful:\nGetLightpack.com our main website for news, pre-order and sales\nOur Facebook page full of news and kittens \nLightpack source-codes and tuts for DIY-guys \nLightpack with Android demo \nSynchronous work of several Lightpacks demo \nYou can use Lightpack with any of these devices\nAlso there are a lot of helpful things in the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\n  When we were kids, many of us were not allowed to watch TV at night because watching it in the darkness was harmful for the eyes (which is actually true). Many of us are still not following our parents\u2019 advice as it is a very good way to focus on what is going on on the screen (which is also true). Here we would like to share with you how you could continue watching TV or working on computer at night and stop bothering about the health of your eyes, and at the same time come to a new level of experience in gaming and watching movies.\nLightpack box without LED modules\nLightpack is an open-source device, which lightens your computer or TV screen to strengthen the presence effect. The device needs to be mounted on your TV or computer screen and to be connected to your PC, Mac or HTPC via USB. The software analyses what you currently have on the screen, be it a movie, a game, or anything else, and sends this information to the Lightpack device which in turn lightens the surface behind the screen with matching colours using the RGB-LEDs available within the Lightpack device. You can find basics about Lightpack working principles in our project wiki.\nTVs mounted Lightpack\nWe have not tried to revolutionize the industry but just wanted to provide you with a simple and cheap device which would give a new life to your TV or computer screen and bring you new colors and effects.\nTV screen is the only source of light in a dark room. Dark and bright scenes are switching very fast when you are watching a movie. Your pupil reacts to the level of light by changing its size, sometimes from 1 to 8 millimeters, and when it is switching from darkness to light, it takes about 5 sec for a pupil to narrow, and up to 5 mins to increase the size of a pupil when it gets darker. That's why the muscles of an eye are in constant tension which can lead to vision problems. This is exactly why your parents didn't allow you watching TV in a dark room \u2013 they were just trying to protect your eyes.\nLightpack can also level the intensity of light in your room by reducing the difference in lighting between dark and bright scenes or completely eliminating it (Prof. Dr. Ir. S.H.A. Begemann of TUe, Netherlands, scientific study for Philips).\n\nLightpack takes an advantage of another feature of human vision: only a very small part of the retina (which is called \u201cmacula\u201d) can actually distinguish all the smallest details of a picture, with the picture being fuzzy for the rest of the retina. In fact, the very small (0.2-0.4 mm) part of the macula (called \u201cfovea\u201d) and the farthest from the pupil can recognize the depth of field of a picture. This means that while watching TV you can only see in focus a very small part of the picture on the screen (its size depends on the distance between your eye and the screen). Your brain then works efficiently to combine this small focused part and the rest scene information into a coherent picture. Using the soft illumination of Lightpack which extends the actual picture on the screen, you see your 40-inch TV as if it were a 50-inch home theater.\nLightpack is an open-source project. This means we have published all PCB layouts and BOM under the GPL license. Besides that we have also disclosed all software and firmware source codes.\nIf you think we could not make the project more transparent, you are wrong! We have created a special PCB layout for DIY-enthusiasts and wrote manual for Lightpack do-it-yourselfers. We also to support the network API which helps you to add your own plugins or control the Lightpack device remotely by 3rd-party apps. Lightpack is fully open for users, hackers, makers or anyone else.\nThe device is a PCB with microcontroller and LED driver ICs, and set of electronic components in the small box with several connectors. The box needs to be mounted at the back side of your PC, laptop or TV screen. 10 LED-sets are then stuck to the back side of your screen (at the edges), and the LEDs are then connected to the Lightpack box with cables. There is also a power supply and a microUSB for the PC, Mac or HTPC. There is no way you can install something wrong. There is also no need to install any device drivers \u2013 just the Prismatik software. Lightpack is completely plug-n-play device.\nYou will need less than 10 mins to set everything up. Choose yourself the location of LED sets. Depending on the size of your computer or TV screen, you can stick them either only on the sides of the screen or make a full loop. The size of the screen can be up to 50 inches. For more details check our FAQ.\nLightpack components\nSomeone might argue that the device looks very simple and ordinary but the truth is that users will only see it during the installation process and the rest of the time it will be hidden behind the screen. Therefore, when we worked on the design of the device we have used the KISS principle (keep it simple stupid). What you currently see on the photo is a pre-production prototype, and the final version will be slightly juicier!\nThe Prismatik software has been developed for Lightpack. The cross-platform software analyzes picture from your desktop, movie or game.\nPrismatik works under Windows, Linux and OS X. The following features of the software are worth mentioning:\nWorks with multiple independent RGB channels (up to 255)\nSets the color balance for each LED\nSets custom color capturing areas for each LED\nCalculates the average color of the picture\nScene luminosity threshold for your eyes protection\nWorks as the background lamp (mood lamp)\nUses colors from games and video\nPlugins (download and play)\nOpen net API for external plugin development (including iOS and Android)\nXBMC integration\nIntegration with Dell Alienware LightFX (beta)\nSettings profiles, hotkeys, multiple language support and much more...\nWe find it important to mention again that the software has been designed to reflect the specifics of the human vision  (see \"Scientific background\"). We didn't aim to create the bright illumination which looks nice but harm your eyes. However under Scene luminosity threshold settings you can set up your own profile which would best meet your needs.\nThe Prismatik software has predefined settings for those who don\u2019t want to spent a lot of time setting your own lighting scheme. You can download and install the beta version of software right now.\nThe pre-production phase is already over. You can see that there are only few steps left to start the mass production and distribution.\nGantt chart (click to enlarge)\nThere are several improvements we plan to implement such as packaging design, logistics process definition, some software improvements, creation of more detailed user manual etc. We see these improvements as the minor ones \u2013 there is no significant impact on the functionality of the device. Also, don\u2019t forget to read the Risks and Challenges special section you can find below.\nMike Sannikov is a product designer who has developed the Russian open-hardware projects such as Pixelkit, Glitchy-sequencer, and Lo-res pixelator. Mike started the Lightpack project in 2011 and has been working on it up to now.\nTim Sattarov is a talented engineer who is responsible for the Lighpack R&D. He is very fast in bringing every new idea to the working prototype. \nDmitry Gorilovsky is a product innovator who likes to invent new things and bring them to life. His experience includes development of mobile phones, video games and mobile services for companies such Yota, Megafon, Andromeda, Creat Studios, etc. He covers all financial topics and consults on production process.\nThe Lightpack team is of course bigger! It includes production managers who are working in Asia, as well as other engineers and designers. We have been working on Lightpack development for about 2 years and within these 2 years have created a tons of prototypes with different functionality and level of readiness. Last year Russian users could already buy a fully functioning version of Lightpack which however was not yet ready for mass-market.\nWe have already sold over 1,000 batch-production optimized devices in Russia. Over 4K were assembled by the users themselves (as all firmware layouts and software source codes were open). 6 months ago we have finalized the design of the device and now are ready to start mass production which would also include product support, certification, etc.\nSex, drugs and open-source, of course :) Our goal is to make the Lightpack device cheap (which in turn makes it available to the users all over the World). This is only possible under the mass production, with at least thousands of devices being produced every month. To keep prices low we need to be involved in every production step, starting from cables up to packaging. The project target is \u201cmake it cheap or die\u201d.\nEach tooling used for the Lightpack enclosure production costs about 7-12K USD, and we need at least 3 of those (4 is better). The price does not include soft tooling for prototypes or even 3D-printed mock-up model. The mass production requires these things to be done first.\nWe also need to finance the international certification of the device (min 15K USD), which is a very important step to make sure the product is safe and legally ready for distribution in the US, EU and other countries. However as mentioned earlier we will spend most of the money we plan to collect here on production, packaging and distribution of the first batch of devices. Due to Kickstarter charges our goal is 261,000$ instead of 249,000$ specified in infographics.\nLightpack on a 42'' TV\nThe most difficult part of the whole process \u2014 product creation \u2014 is over, and now we need financial support to keep things rolling. After the pilot batch production you will see a report or infographic stating all costs & expenses we\u2019ve had. All backers will have full access to all info about the development and production processes. We are fully open for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLightpack (like any hardware project) has mechanical, electrical, software and firmware challenges. As mentioned earlier, the batch-production optimized version of the device, as well as the self-assembled devices, have been successfully installed and are being used by several thousands users. Therefore we do not expect any critical issues related to electronics. However, we will still test the pre-mass production sample device, which will be almost the same as the pilot batch device. If there are any mechanical issues, which we really doubt, we will still have a chance to detect and fix those. As for software and firmware issues, if any, they will be covered & fixed in new releases of software\\firmware. We will maintain an \u201copen-to-all\u201d bug-tracker where every user will be able to submit any issues. These issues will be treated with the highest priority, and you will then be able to download a software\\firmware update and fix the issue.\n\nProduction and shipping in time is another challenge. We are collaborating with well experienced and responsible Taiwan company which take care about production plan and whole supply chain building. Also we design Lightpack hardware and build BOM (bill of materials) according to famous mass-suppliers' capabilities for this. We plan to do things according our Gantt-chart you can see in \u201cproduction plan\u201d section. Nevertheless, if we are going out of date we will notice you with project update which contains all issue reasons and how we will fight them. Production plan compiled with risks-consider time-management rules, so it has some time-handicap as well. Once the production is over, we will send devices by batch to the warehouses in the US an in Europe for further delivery to our customers. The rest of the batch will be stored in the our international warehouse in China for shipments to our non-US/EU customers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Are you ready for tomorrow?

The tool is absolutely amazing. Looking forward to having Torque 2D utilizing Spine!\" -Michael Perry, GarageGames\n\"Spine is great! Finally a huge void in our 2D content creation process is filled; something no other animation tool on the market could do for us.\" -Moritz Voss, HandyGames\n\"Spine is the 2D skeletal animation tool that game devs have been hoping for. It's well designed and well engineered.\" -Matt Rix, Unity Futile\nSpine is a 2D skeletal animation tool for game development and other animation projects. It features an intuitive workflow to rig and animate skeletons, a multiple-timeline dopesheet for retiming and tweaking animations, and powerful exporting capabilities.\nSpine currently has all the features necessary to use it in production, except for loading and using the data in your games. For each game toolkit, we need to write a runtime library that loads the animation data and draws the animations. Currently this is only done for libgdx, and this is where we need your help.\n\nWe set out to build games, but instead we\u2019ve been working full time on Spine for many months. We would love to add Spine runtimes for Unity, cocos2d, Corona, and others, but we also need to move on and build our own games. Funding this KickStarter will allow us to postpone our games a little longer to add support for additional toolkits and enable Spine to be used in all kinds of games. With your help, we can build the runtimes to match the same level of quality as the rest of Spine, and official runtimes will be kept up to date as Spine evolves.\nOur Kickstarter has been funded! This means we will implement Spine runtimes for these game toolkits:\nUnity: Futile and 2D Toolkit\ncocos2d-iphone\nCorona\nYou can download Spine and give it a try right now for Windows, Mac, and Linux. All of the most important features have already been implemented and hopefully this gives you confidence that we can deliver the runtimes we promise.\nWe hit our goal for the four runtimes in just 3.5 days! The gaming community's response to Spine has been really fantastic! We've already added support for Corona and are working on the other three toolkits promised in the original goal: Unity Futile, Unity 2DToolkit, and cocos2d-iphone. In the meantime, we have been thinking a lot about what to do for stretch goals.\n\nWe've received hundreds of requests to build Spine runtimes for all kinds of gaming toolkits. We would love to build official runtimes for everyone's favorite toolkit, but this would take an astronomical amount of effort. We have thought long and hard about what our stretch goals should be for Spine and finally decided we could do better than listing a bunch of game toolkits, each of which only a fraction of the gaming community cares about. We think we have come up with a way to make everyone happy.\n\nWe have stretch goals to implement generic Spine runtimes for specific programming languages. A generic runtime does everything except the game toolkit specific drawing. It loads the skeleton and animation data into an object model that makes it easily accessible, for example to pose the skeleton, do procedural manipulation, changes skins, etc. To support a game toolkit, all that needs to be done is add the game toolkit's rendering to the generic runtime. This allows the gaming community to easily make high quality runtimes for almost any game toolkit. The key part of this plan is that the core of the runtimes are officially supported and maintained as Spine evolves.\n\nWe have also added stretch goals for some really awesome features. When building Spine there were many things that couldn't make it into version 1.0. We choose from all those as well as features suggested by the Spine community. We are very weary about feature bloat, so we have been careful to choose the features that provide the most value when taking into account Spine's workflow. We also took into account how feasible the features are and we only chose those that we know we can implement in a timely manner. It is very important to us that we don't let you down!\n\nWe are extremely excited about Spine's future and really hope we can meet many of these stretch goals. Please help us bring Spine to the next level and make it the most amazing tool for game development!\nTouchpad support Spine was designed for use with a mouse. When using a touchpad, for example on a laptop, Spine can be difficult to use. This item adds a touchpad friendly input mode. We may not be able to support multi touch touchpads, but will be sure that the app is perfectly usable with a touchpad.\nAdditive blending for slots Enables the images attached to a slot to be drawn using additive blending, for toolkits that support it.\nAdjustable playback speed and framerate Enables slowing or speeding up playback so animations can be tweaked easier. Also allows the framerate used in the timeline to be changed.\nResizable dopesheet and tree Enables the dopesheet and tree to be resized by dragging. This allows a lot more to be seen on larger screens and is especially great for tweaking keys in the dopesheet.\nImport for exported skeletons and animations Allows data in the same format Spine exports to be imported back into Spine. This allows data to be brought into Spine from other programs. Also, data can be exported from one project and imported into another.\nA Spine runtime in the Lua programming language. This enables easier development of Spine runtimes for Gideros, L\u00d6VE, Moai, and others.\nA Spine runtime in the JavaScript programming language.

This is very useful when refining animation movement by adding keys between major poses.\nKeyable draw order Allows draw order to be changed and keyed in animate mode. This allows a slot to move in front or behind other slots during an animation.\nDuplicate bone Makes a copy of a bone, any child bones, and any slots and images. This is useful when creating skeletons that have multiple similar bones or body parts.\nBone snapping When moving a bone, this snaps to the start and end of other bones. This makes it easy to build skeletons where the bones match up exactly.\nDisable rotation/scale inheritance This allows rotation or scale to not affect a child bone. For scale, this means additional keys are not needed to avoid a child being scaled. For rotation, this allows a child bone to not rotate with the parent, for example a rope hanging from the end of a crane.\nThese are boxes attached to bones, similar to how images are attached. The boxes represent where the skeleton can be hit. In your game you can easily test for hit detection.\nIntegrated texture packer Enables Spine to pack individual images on to larger images for more efficient use by your game toolkit.\nGraph presets Allows graph curves to be stored so they can easily be applied to other keys without needing to define the curve again.\nMultiple slot color modification Allows multiple slots to be selected and have their color changed all at once.\nMultiple drag and drop for slot draw order Allows multiple slots to be selected under Draw Order and dragged to a new position all at once.\nThis adds an \"Events\" node to the tree where named events can be defined. These events can then be keyed in animations. This allows events to be triggered in your games, for example to play a sound or spawn a projectile or particle effect at a specific time in an animation.\nSlot image chooser A popup for a bone that shows thumbnails for all images for each slot. Choosing a thumbnail sets a key to change the slot's image. Note changing a slot's image in an animation is already possible, this is just a faster way of doing it.\nAnimated textures This allows image with a common prefix to be treated as a single images. They are given a framerate and are displayed as an animation. This is much easier than keying each image change.\nBackgrounds This adds a \"Background\" node to the tree where images can be dragged. These show up behind the skeletons in the editor. This can give a better feel for how the skeletons will look in-game. It can also be used to animate skeletons for use on top of a specific image, for example to animate a skeleton climbing on top of objects in the background image.\nRipple animation Repeats a dopesheet channel for the rest of the animation. Without this, repeating an animation manually for a whole animation is very tedious.\nDopesheet overview This is a dopesheet item that represents all keys in the animation. This makes it easy to select, scale, etc all keys.\nDisable dopesheet channels This disables a dopesheet channel so it won't affect the animation. This is useful for disabling portions of an animation during tweaking.\nFree-form deformation allows an image to be manipulated by moving the four corners or points along the edges. The image will distort appropriately. This reduces image changes, meaning a lot less art is required. It allows for much more powerful animation beyond just animating bones.\nThere are many tools for working in 3D that can be used for 2D, though they tend to be very expensive. Custom plugins need to be written to have a sane workflow for 2D skeletal animation and to extract the data for use in your games. You must write your own runtime for your games to make use of this data. These tools tend to have an enormous feature set and you must be careful to avoid accidentally using features that aren't supported in your runtime. All this is a lot of work up front to get the custom plugins and runtime working, and the end result is a clunky workflow riddled with gotchas.\nThere are not many tools dedicated to 2D. We will mention a few here.\nAdobe's Flash is ubiquitous on the Internet and can be used similar to Spine. It is not dedicated to skeletal animation though, making the workflow somewhat tedious. Data is exported as XML, but there are no standard runtimes for game toolkits, you have to write your own.\nBrashMonkey's Spriter began development 15 months ago. We were initially thrilled when Spriter was funded on Kickstarter 9 months ago. We posted our feedback on the Spriter forums when we found it lacked official runtimes, a multiple-timeline dopesheet, tweening curves, and separate keying of scale, rotation, and translation. After a couple months we decided that Spriter may never have the features and workflow we envisioned, and that is when we decided to build Spine.\nSpine focuses on having an efficient workflow from start to finish. The best way to compare Spine with other software is to build a simple animation with each and put them in your game while noting how easily the tools allow you to tweak and refine your animations.\nSpine animation has many advantages over traditional raster animation:\nReduced art assets Characters can be animated in many ways without requiring additional art.\nSmall data size Spine animations are tiny, enabling hundreds of animations to be used throughout a game to bring it to life.\nFaster development Creating and making use of animations is easy, even programmers can do it.\nAnimation reuse All of the same animations can be reused for characters that look completely different if they use the same skeleton.\nProcedural manipulation Modify the skeleton or animations at runtime to react to game situations.\nSmooth interpolation Interpolated keyframes mean animation is as smooth as the framerate.\nAnimation blending Transition smoothly to a new animation by blending it with the old animation.\nSpine makes it fast and easy to bring your entire game to life!\nWe've been working on Spine full time for a long time. We are excited to have completed all the major features it needs to be used in production and we are looking forward to seeing what the gaming community can build with it. There are many features we wanted to implement but were unable to include in the first version of Spine. We have been careful to avoid feature bloat and keep the workflow in mind, but these features would be very useful. If this Kickstarter does extremely well, we would love to implement these!\nEvent timeline Allows timing arbitrary events during animations, eg to trigger sounds or particles.\nBounding boxes Rectangles attached to bones for easier hit detection.\nOnion skinning Shows the previous and next animation frames so it is easier to see motion over time when designing animations.\nProcedural animation helpers Utilities to make procedural animation easier, eg a bone that is always rotated toward a point with rotation constraints.\nBox2D integration Control physics entities from animations or animations from physics entities.\nImage attachment animation Animate an image's scale, rotation, and translation separately from the parent bone.\nFreeform deformation Animate an image using a lattice for deformation.\nInverse kinematics at runtime Allows for fewer keyframes and more flexible procedural animation.\nAnimation layers Have an animation extend another animation and add keys.\nAnimation mixer Similar to the dopesheet, but for blending and timing animations for cutscenes and larger animations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor each game toolkit, building a Spine runtime consists of implementing the loading of the data, the math for properly transforming the bones and images, posing the skeleton based on the animation data, loading and drawing the art assets, and providing a nice, easy to use API. Each of these tasks is done differently in the various game toolkits and programming languages, so we must carefully research how to best integrate the Spine runtime.\n\nBecause Spine makes it easy to animate everything in your game, it is expected that many animations will be used at once. This means it is important that the Spine runtimes perform well. Animations and bone transformations need to be efficient. Texture atlases need to be supported. Drawing the images should be fast, batching used if possible, etc. Performance testing needs to be done for each game toolkit to optimize the runtime. For toolkits that run on multiple platforms, this must be done on each platform.\n\nWe have a combined total of 23+ years of industry experience building software, gaming libraries and tools (eg, libgdx), and designing concise, clean APIs (eg, Kryo, KryoNet). We've spent an enormous amount of effort building Spine with great attention to detail and high standards for quality. We want to build the runtimes to match so that the entire Spine experience is seamless and pleasant from start to finish.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "New Spine Features", "update_content": "Hey everyone!

This can be useful when you have multiple items to equip which have a different bounding boxes. Also, a bounding box is translated, scaled, and rotated by the bone it is attached to.\nWe've been focusing on editor features, so currently some of the runtimes are missing bounding boxes, keyable draw order, and events.

It takes biodegradable PLA plastic filament, melts it into thin layers onto a surface, moves up and prints another layer. After layer upon layer, you are left with a physical object. You can use 3D modeling software such as Solidworks, the free google sketch up program, or go to thingiverse.com, download free things that people have already created, and print them out in your own home or office or classroom.\nWhat is RoBo 3D? \nRoBo 3D is the ultimate 3D printer everyone has been waiting for. We combined the best minds from the open source community, the best hardware we believe can give the best prints, and our own ideas based on our experience working with 3D printers. The open-source design is made so people like us can go online and find all the documents that show the ins and outs of how to make a RoBo 3D. In true rep-rap fashion, RoBo 3D has been made so that it can print out its own parts. Once in your hands, print out another for a friend! Come experience it and together, lets create something great.\nWho is RoBo 3D for?\nArchitects- print out model homes and buildings for clients. Change and print out again without hassle.\nDesigners- Have an idea that you want to bring to life? Print out your designs and see if they were everything you imagined. If not, change it and print out the next idea.\nHobbyists/DIY- Easily create your projects in the comfort of your own home. \nSmall Business owners- Manufacture your own products at the office!\nStudents- Senior engineering project coming up? Use RoBo 3D to proint the parts you need to get the job done done.\nHome owners- Replace broken household items for next to nothing!\nWhat can you create with RoBo 3D?\nThe amount of things you can print out with our 3D printer are only limited by your imagination. The list goes on and on but some examples are iphone cases, prototypes, household items, replacement/spare parts, and more! There are plenty of free 3D modeling software out there such as; google sketchup, tinkercad.com. \n3D Printer Beginners: Go to thingiverse.com, check out all the different designs people have created. When you see something you like, It's as easy as plugging RoBo 3D into the wall, plugging it into your computer via usb, downloading that design, and then let the printer do the work! \nWhy RoBo 3D is Great!\n**Open Source 3D Printer that anyone can use\nRoBo 3D was created for ease of use. Buying the fully assembled printer will allow you to plug it in, download an open source software like Google Sketchup, and start printing within minutes. You do not have to create anything yourself before you begin prints. Like we said, you can go to thingiverse.com, find something cool that has already been designed by other 3D printer artists, download it into Sketchup, and press print! Simple as that. \n**Low Cost Without Sacrificing Quality\nWe wanted to create RoBo 3D to not break the bank in the Consumer 3D Printing Industry. For just around $520, we are not only one of the cheapest, but one of the most precise printers out there...Which brings us to our next topic:\n*Precise and high detail printing\nWe had to make sure that our printer was extremely precise and as detailed as possible when printing. Still in the works, but these are some of the prints we have currently done! We will upload more as the crowd-funding continues.\nSummary of Rewards\nAll RoBo3D assembled and disassembled kits will include plastic filament so you can get started from the minute you plug it in.

PLA only\nRoBo 3D printer with installed heat bed for ABS\nManufacturing Pipeline: From Start to Finish\nProduct Development:\nAfter tinkering with other DIY 3D printers,such as Printrbot and Prusa, we decided to take our favorite components of each, and combine them into one awesome, easy to use 3d printer. Starting from scratch, we made 3D renders to see how our product would look on our desk. After agreeing on the right printer design, we set out to create it. Using mainly wood and our existing knowledge of key components, we made a mockup of our finished product. Our satisfaction of this mockup led us to further seek a manufacturing partnership. Using outsourcing websites and communicating with dozens of plastics manufacturers, we found a company to produce our 3D CAD engineered prototype.  We based our encasing around the idea and concept that people can build into it.  The holes are pre-cut, and pre-sized to fit the different screws, rods, etc in. The encasing will allow even the most beginner builder to make a RoBo 3D Printer.  While working on manufacturing the right encasing, we simultaneously sought out manufacturers for different components such as motors, rods, bearings, wires, hot end, build platforms, and the open source community for different parts. We found the best tactics, what not to do, and how to build an effective and efficient 3D printer inside our encasing.  \nProduction and fulfillment plans:\nWe will use a large part of the money to work together with our plastics manufacturer to create a mold for mass manufacturing so we can lower the cost per encasing in order to reduce our retail 3D printer price. This manufacturer has already successfully built us a prototype, has the 3D CAD engineered files and is ready to go once funds are provided.  \nWhile we are getting the mold manufactured, we will be simultaneously obtaining the other key components like motors, pulleys, etc which we already have developed the relationship with manufacturers for.  We have gotten this to a point where we just need the funds to fulfill the orders for parts.  For parts we can print, we will be running a RoBo 3D Farm that will allow us to print multiple parts at once that we can use to build Backer models.  All this will be done in a timely fashion and we will make sure we are as efficient as possible when it comes to compiling and fulfilling rewards. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of the risks and challenges throughout the production of RoBo 3D are:\n\n1) Overcoming great leaps when determining print quality- Everything in a 3D printer has to be tuned very fine in order for everything to work perfect. We know it will be a challenge and we challenge ourselves to create this product so that when it is fully assembled, it can be calibrated and in perfect working order very easily and efficiently. We know that that is the basis of a successful printer and we will strive throughout the funding stages to make sure that is our main focus. \n\n2) Manufacturing the printer encasing- A large portion of the investment will go to creating a mold for mass manufacturing allowing us to produce the encasing for a much cheaper price in the future. Essentially, we will then be able to lower our printer retail price. \n\n3) Delivering products in a timely manner according to our strict quality guidelines we impose on ourselves- we are almost fully done working on fine tuning the development of the encasing and all the components successfully working within the encasing so people can build RoBo 3D in their own homes if they wish to purchase the disassembled version. As the funding progresses and at this moment, that is something we are tackling and working directly with our manufacturer and CAD engineer on. It will be perfected and tuned properly and successfully. We also understand that in order to complete all the orders in a timely manner, we will need a way to build pieces quicker and consistently. Our solution to this problem is to build a RoBo 3D Farm with multiple printers all printing parts simultaneously. \n\n4) The founders all have their own individual work schedules outside of RoBo3D therefore matching time and time committing has made the process getting here take a little longer. We have all spoken in regards to this and have all agreed that we are getting closer to a stage where we want to be doing this full time because we enjoy it so much. We just need that push to the next stage. Taking it one step at a time and trying to put out the best product possible to you all is our first concern. \n\nAnother topic we want to address here is that we will assure questions and concerns by backers will be responded to promptly and taken very serious. We want to succeed and we have been following many different past projects on kickstarter and we know that the only way to build success from this point is to make sure that the backers are our #1 priority during this campaign outside of perfecting our actual product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "BATCH OF PRINTERS ARRIVED!

Any game that uses on screen joysticks, directional pads, or buttons will benefit. \nIf you're a developer and using Unity in your development (over 50% of mobile development is currently), then it's super simple to integrate support with our Unity Package that will eventually be available in the Unity Asset Store. We're looking to integrate with other game engines as well and have a native SDK in Objective C.\nWe will also be putting out an app, Audojo Gallery, that will highlight the supported games and help developers cut through the noise of the app store to reach gamers that are interested in this type of experience. If you're a developer interested in learning more, please contact us at info@audojo.com.\nFor More Than Just Games\nHobbyists that use their iPad to control external devices will also benefit. When flying the AR Drone from Parrot or controlling the Sphero from Orbotix, you will no longer have to look down at the touch screen while controlling your device. You will get the same feedback that you're accustomed to from joysticks while still being able to use the gyroscopic controls and camera which make the iPad so much fun to use with these devices.\nPlay on the Big Screen Too\nThrough Apple's AirPlay technology, you can connect your iPad to a TV. Our case will only make this experience better as you will be able to focus your attention on the screen.\nWhere We Are Now and What's Next\nCurrently, we have a fully functioning prototype that we had CNC machined and assembled ourselves. The case fits iPads from the 2nd through 4th generation. It is currently powered off a rechargeable battery that uses a Mini-USB connector. With the speakers at full blast, the case outlasts your iPad. On headphones, gameplay stretches into weeks of playtime. We will be evaluating a rechargeable battery vs. user replaceable batteries. We are really happy with the mechanism for getting the iPad in/out of the case as it is rock solid, having been tested over a 1000 times and feedback from gamers and developers alike has been overwhelmingly positive.  We have a very limited number of hardware development kits though. If we are successful on Kickstarter, we will take the following steps to bring the product to market: \nBuild hardware development kits based on the current design\nSource improved joysticks and trigger buttons\nOptimize the industrial design for ergonomics\nCreate new CAD files and documentation necessary to create tooling\nBuild out tooling\nContract out to a manufacturer for production\nWe Need Your Support\nWith your support, we will be able to:\nGet from prototype to production \nDeliver hardware developer kits so more games can integrate\nPlace our first run of orders, once we know how many to make\nBuild our two launch apps (Audojo Gallery and Audojo Minis)\nGameplay Footage\nHere is some unedited gameplay (development builds) captured from a few different genres of games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are working with experienced hardware designers and mechanical engineers that have shipped hundreds of products. However, manufacturing is challenging and we want to highlight some of the risks involved. \n\nOne of the bigger risks is the tooling. When fabricating the tooling, issues can arise that prevent the tool from being sufficient for manufacturing. If this happens, there will be delays. Similarly, once the tool is made and the process moves towards manufacturing, the first units off the line can be subpar. In this case sometimes the tooling or the process needs to be modified, which will also cause delay.\n\nWe already have functioning PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) but will be making them smaller for final production. We will test these thoroughly and if any issues arise, it could also cause delays. \n\nGame integration is extremely important for the success of this product. The more games, the more value it has. To ensure that backers are able to have fun with the case, we will be putting out an app, Audojo Minis, that will include a series of mini-games. It is not our intention to become a publisher of games and compete against our partners. We do plan on making sure that anyone who purchases the case can enjoy it right away.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Audojo\nFirst created \u00b7 10 backed\nMark Vinton spent over 10 years at Dolby Laboratories as a Research Engineer working on various audio codecs and technologies like Dolby...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Buttons and a New Backer Tier", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWe've heard your feedback loud and clear.

We have support for additional buttons including a directional pad. We've spent time reviewing our industrial design over the last few days and have made the decision to move forward with the addition of four face buttons and a D-pad. \nWe've also heard from you that it would be good to have a backer tier with a reward for a lower dollar amount.

It's time to check the temperature and you grab the inexpensive thermometer you purchased, press the on button and nothing happens because the little coin cell ran out of energy.  Then, you find the replacement battery costs about as much as the original device.  The throw away cycle repeats itself.\nDefeating Obsolescence\nWe have all purchased multiple chargers and product specific interface cables for our cell phones and now tablet based devices. The only common interface left on these devices seems to be the 3.5mm headphone jack. This isn't the easiest interface to use but we took the challenge and figured out how to use it for our application. The smart thermometer harvests energy from the headphone jack and uses the microphone input to transmit data back to the iOS or Android device.  No batteries are required and we don't see the headphone jack interface going away anytime soon. Our vision can now become a reality with your help.\nThe Universal Interface\nSpecifications\nTemperature Range = -30\u00b0C to +250\u00b0C (-22\u00b0F to +482\u00b0F)\nRTD Sensing Element\nAccuracy = \u00b11.05\u00b0C over temp range\nHigh Temperature Plastic Body\nStainless Steel Probe Assembly (food grade)\nWorks with majority of iOS & Android devices\nPSoC\u00ae Enabled (read technical details below)\nConcept to Reality\nTechnical Details\nWe chose a high end programmable system on a chip for the electronics. This approach yields a very efficient product development cycle and also allows us to quickly make hardware changes to our product without having to redesign the entire circuit board.  Having programmable hardware is awesome!  For those who want more specifics we chose a Cypress PSoC\u00ae device.  This approach gives us a high level of confidence in delivering a product on-time. It also gave us the ability to do some pretty complicated analog and digital circuits all on a single IC.  Thanks to the low power capabilities of this technology, using the Smart Thermometer will not be a large power drain on your device battery as it operates on just a few milliwatts of power.\nHardware Development Platform\nProduct Development Process\nThe first step was to specify what it was we wanted to design.  This is always an iterative process and we continue to update our specifications as we continue to follow through on our product design.  It was especially important to have a specification in place for our app developer to follow to make sure the app met our expectations.  This paid off as our app developer did a very good job on gettting the initial app to work as we expected.  It is very simple at this point but proves out what we need for now.  Once the project is funded we will be able to take our app to the finish line.  The feature set may grow if funding allows.  We are always open for ideas from the kickstarter community too.\nThe second step was to figure out how to harvest energy from the headphone jack (audio signals) in order to power the Smart Thermometer. There are some interesting resources on the internet where others have done this but most yielded poor results.  Dan's experience in pro audio and power electronics became very beneficial here.  In the end, we have found a way to generate as much as 100 milliwatts of power from this interface.  We only need about 1/10th or less of this amount of power to run the Smart Thermometer.  This enabled the project to move forward and we considered it a milestone to the success.\nThe third step involved a multitude of parallel activities. Phil was now able to go to town on the mechanical designs as we knew the rest of the electronics was fairly straightforward to implement.  We went through about 3 rounds of concept designs until we finally settled on what you have seen in our video.  The prototypes seen in the video were created with 3D printing technology by a local company that both Phil and Dan have done extensive work with in the past.  It all came together around Thanksgiving and we were delighted to start producing our video.\nA sudden sensor change........\nDuring the filming for our kickstarter video, we realized we had missed something in our original specs.  Phil's wife is quite good at candies and baking and she informed us the Smart Thermometer needed to be extremely accurate for these applications.  The original sensing element was based around a thermistor design that was quite accurate from 0 to 100 degrees celcius but slowly lost accuracy the closer it got to 250 celcius.  In the end it would have met the majority of applications out there but we would have had some unhappy candy makers.  So, we decided to switch to a RTD sensing element which costs more but produces very good results over the entire temperature range.  We believe candy makers will be very happy we made the change. \nThe fourth step is going from prototype to production.  This is where we need the funding to move forward.  Going from idea to prototype is a big step but equally important is having the know how to take the product into production.  This is where our experience will pay off.  We have detailed our manufacturing plan in the risks and challenges section below.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction\n\nWe have designed and developed the Smart Thermometer, but we need your help to push it into production. We cannot build high quantities of the Smart Thermometer on our own, so we have teamed up with several US based component manufacturers to bring you a high quality product. During our development process we have had the privilege of working with several sources for all of our components. If the Smart Thermometer project funds, we are prepared to kick off our vendors immediately. First, we will initiate tooling and begin to inventory parts for final assembly. Next, we will perform an engineering build of 10 units with a local contract manufacturer to validate our work instructions and assembly process. Then we will perform a pre-production build of 250 units (at 50 units per day) in order to evaluate the production line and finalize all remaining process flow parameters. After we complete our pre-production run, the Smart Thermometer will go into full production right here in Arizona. \n\nChallenges\n\nTooling is always a challenge but even more so when dealing with high temperature plastics. Injection molding tools and processes become more expensive and complicated to run. This is one of the major drivers for the amount of funding we need. We have selected Stanyl\u00ae, a high temperature plastic, and will be using a local company with experience running this material. Once the funding is in place this will be a major focal point to ensure the success of our project.\n\nApplication Development\n\nDeveloping the app to work on two platforms requires more work and increases our funding requirements. We have contracted with a seasoned app developer that is accustomed to both iOS and Android platforms and has successfully launched apps in both environments.\n\nProject Funding\n\nWe will not be successful without you. We think the product is hot (pun intended) but it needs a cool kickstart to make it happen!
