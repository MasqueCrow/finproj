It is a historical fiction set in the Roman Empire in 69 CE, also known as the Year of the Four Emperors. The story is an action comic with a healthy dose of character drama and is inspired by true events. If you are a fan of history, cavalry charges, and legions of Romans then this comic is for you!\n\nSynopsis\nIt is 69 CE; the death of Nero has thrown the Roman Empire into chaos. Several powerful generals have been proclaimed as Emperor by their legions and march on Rome to lay claim to the title Augustus. On the frontier of the Empire, a tribe of starving nomads, seeking food and supplies, have crossed into Roman territory. Ara, a young hunter and eager warrior, is among them and longs to fight against the famous steel men of Rome. He will receive his wish far sooner than he expects.\n\nPreview\nHere is a four page preview of the first issue.\nMeet the Team\nRiley Hamilton (Writer & Letterer):\nRiley Hamilton has been writing stories as long as he can remember. As a kid he even drew his own comics, though none survive. After putting his pen down for a number of years he rediscovered his passion for writing through helping his university's comic club write and self-publish their own superhero comic book, Gael Force. SPQR is his solo creator debut.\nSamrat Das (Penciller):\nSamrat is a penciller from India. He is really passionate about what he does which makes everything he works exceptionally satisfying. He is really into comics and pencilling has always been the medium through which he contributes in this field. He is always looking for more opportunities to draw. You can find him at dsamrat7@gmail.com.\n\nRowel Roque (Inker):\nRowel Roque is both a penciller and inker based in the Philippines and has worked on a number of comic book projects. Rowel has also done animation work and worked on titles such as Les Enfants de Toromiro and Goofballs.\nLucas Aparicio (Colourist):\nLucas Aparicio is a comic colorist and flatter based in Argentina. He has mostly worked as a freelance artist since 2017 when he decided to take his career more seriously. He started with a lot of small projects, and learned that coloring comics is not about light and shadow or rendering but about storytelling and he hopes to continue to tell stories for many years to come.\n\nCampaign Goals\nThe goal of this campaign is to secure funding for the printing and distribution of issue #1 of SPQR. We have a reliable printer based in Toronto, Ontario with a proven track record for delivering high-quality books in a timely manner. We will also be pursuing digital distribution on Gumroad for both electronic and print copies of issue #1.\nhttps://gumroad.com/rileyhamiltoncomics\n\nBudget\nPrinting: $650 (A print run of 150 books from our printer plus the physical prints)\nShipping: $850 (Estimated cost of packing and shipping to get the books out to backers)\nTotal: $1500\n\nRewards\n$1 - Enemy of Rome: Our eternal gratitude for helping get this book to print.

You have introduced a background character, tavern interior, or maybe you briefly mentioned a chair in the corner\u2026 then your players ask you every conceivable detail about it. Even the most experienced game masters need a helping hand sometimes, and that is where Roll & Play comes in. This 84-PAGE* book is packed with generators, loot producers and setting inspiration which will help you master your game on the fly, and help to add richer detail to the world you create.  \n *94-PAGE after the More, More! stretch goal was unlocked \nSpread not final\nBehind-the-screen friendly\nOne of the key features of this project is its wire binding \u2013 this helps to maximise space right where you need it, behind your games master screen. Space is at a premium behind there with your notepad, dice, tablet computers, pens, miniatures, maps etc. but with the wire binding you can easily fold the book in half without forcing it to stay open or worrying about it closing by itself like a normal book. Because of its A5 wire-bound format, it will fit snugly next to your essentials during your game. \nRoll & Play is also available as a digital eBook and a print-optimised PDF, for all of the DMs that use a combination of technology and paper during their games!  \nSpread not final\nRoll and play\nThe concept is simple. Either before a game or during a game flick to the generator of your choice, roll the indicated dice, and read out the result. By doing so, you have just easily produced detailed content that will satisfy your players with minimal effort or thought. Of course, you can adapt or add to anything in the book with your own imagination and campaign settings using the book as a helping hand on your way! \nSpread not final\nWho is the creator?\nMy name is Sam Bartlett, I studied Visual Communication at the Arts University Bournemouth (UK) and since graduating six years ago I have worked as a graphic designer for one of the world's largest international publishers. I have plenty of experience in producing books and working to print specifications. Producing a quality product is my highest priority, and I won't let anything go to the printers unless I know it is exactly how I want it to look. I also have plenty of tabletop role-playing experience, I am a DM and Player within the London Wargaming Guild (the largest tabletop gaming club in the UK), and I am currently DMing 3 separate campaigns with friends \u2013 some of which have run for a number of years.\nI will be designing, illustrating and writing the content of the book. However, I can\u2019t make something like this alone and I will need your help, as a book like this needs to be something that works for everyone. Pledging at Beholder or Mind Flayer status will make you a Producer of this project and your name will be featured on the inside cover; you will be able to vote on elements of the content meaning the book will shaped by those who help bring it to life. \nSpread not final\nWhat will the content be?\nI am still working on the final synopsis. However, my plan so far includes the following:\nChapter 1: People (NPC names, NPC defining features/flaws, Tattoo generator, Travelling merchants and wares, Mysterious allies and motives, Bard songs, Instruments and band names, Fiendish contracts, Lingering injuries, Resurrection side effects + more)\nChapter 2: Items (Chest fillers, Quest rewards, Magical item generators, Single-use magic items, Magical drawbacks, Trinkets, Unlabelled potion reactions, Misfiring magic scrolls, Picked pocket loot, Body looting, Art pieces + more)\nChapter 3: Encounters (Critical hit and miss results, Arctic encounters, Coastal encounters, Desert encounters, Forest encounters, Mountain encounters, Swamp encounters, Cave encounters, Underwater encounters, Traps, Door mechanisms, Monster motives, Monster origins, Unusual plants + more)\nChapter 4: World Building (Quest ideas, Tavern generators, Festival generators, Shop generators, Local attractions, Street rumours, Bounty posters, Books names/authors, Dream/Nightmare generators, Blessings, Curses, Diseases, Hauntings + more)\nMore, More! Stretch Goal: 10 Additional Pages (Alchemical backfires, Potion tastes and descriptions, Strange otherworldly corruptions, How the party first meet, Magical encounters and phenomenon, Cave names and descriptions, Charlatan scams, Global developments, Conspiracies and rumours, Guild names, and Local economic/political make-up)\n5 Exclusive Generator Cards (Puzzles and challenges, Tavern food and drink menu, Random weather forecasts, Vehicles and mounts, Side quests) \u2013 included with Hobgoblin pledge level and above. Read all about them in Update 12!\nCover subject to change\nPost Campaign Add-Ons\nIf you back Roll & Play, at the end of the campaign you will be able to add a selection of EXTRA rewards to your pledge when filling out the backer surveys (these will be sent out by our pledge manager BackerKit up to 2 weeks after the campaign closes). See below for a list of things you can add, and read Update 16 for the full details.\nThe notebook cover is 100% customisable!\nBackers will be able to add (max. 3 copies of each per backer):\nExtra physical copies of Roll & Play, \u00a314 each\nExtra eBooks, \u00a39 each\nExtra sets of the 3 themed bookmarks, \u00a33 per set\nExtra sets of the 5 exclusive generator cards, \u00a35 per set (Hobgoblin and above only)\nOrange and blue Roll & Play themed pencils, \u00a31 each\nThe newly announced Roll & Play: The Game Master's Notebook, \u00a38 each\nThe notebook has been specially designed with GMs in mind. It contains 3 pages of character reference boxes, 62 pages of lined paper with purposeful margins for your session notes, 8 pages of quarter-inch hex paper for large-scale maps, 8 pages of half-inch hex paper for smaller-scale maps, 12 pages of squared paper for dungeon/room planning, and 1 page for quick reference notes at the back. The cover is printed on uncoated paper stock so it is 100% customisable! Paint it, colour it, or go crazy with glitter and sequins, it is totally up to you.\nAll extra add-ons will add a minor shipping charge, proportionate to the extra weight of the package.\nTake session notes, create maps and plan out dungeons...\nBonus: Playable Races\nAfter unlocking the Playable Races stretch goal, backers will be sent four NEW playable races absolutely free with every pledge level. The four races will be fully fleshed-out in a printable PDF (including lore, traits, name suggestions and features) and sent to all backers around a month after delivery of the books. All credit for the incredible commissioned artwork goes to Sketchgoblin. Read all about them in Update 20!\nThe races include:\nOozlings / innately magical slime humanoids, which must split every ten years.\nBorsukk / somewhat tribal badger humanoids with a fierce sense of loyalty.\nHederans / ancient, solitary, plant-like protectors of the world around them.\nBlackhorns / brutish and powerful beetle humanoids, with very thick carapaces.\nWhich race are you most looking forward to playing as?\nWhat if I want even more?\nDon't worry, I have you covered if you want more loot! If you pledge over \u00a330 you'll not only receive a Roll & Play generator book, you'll also receive THREE bookmarks and FIVE extra generator cards which you can paperclip to your GM Screen. These will be exclusive generators, voted for by the producers (see above) of the book.\nYou want more than that? Well, if you pledge \u00a350 to the rare and illusive Beholder level (there are only a limited amount of these) you will have your name immortalised forever as an NPC included within one of the generators! You will also be credited as a Producer of this book and get to vote on future content.\nYou want even more?! If you pledge \u00a3100 to one of the very limited Mind Flayer levels, I will personally DM a session of Dungeons & Dragons 5e for you and up to four friends (5 players max) digitally over the Roll20 platform.

It features paranormal commandoes fighting a pack of Soviet werewolves!\nAre you a fan of '80s and '90s action movies and comic books? Then, pal we have a comic book series for you!\nWriter Matt Nixon (RETCON, Wolverine) and artist Mike Rooth (Conan/Red Sonja, TMNT, Little Bird) team up to bring you a high-adrenaline, supernatural SCI FI thriller with loads of high-stakes action and packed with story in each issue!\nFrom the steamy jungles of Vietnam to the frozen wilderness of Siberia, para-human Green Berets take on a pack of Soviet werewolves in a race to secure a doomsday weapon before it can be used to kill millions.\n\u201cI set a new universe in motion with RETCON,\u201d says Matt Nixon, a creator who has handled influential properties like Conan the Barbarian and Wolverine. \u201cThe physics of that story allow me to retcon my own creation and with that we get to tell more specific sorts of stories, like the werebear commando Chris \u2018the Animal\u2019 Dodge\u2019s origin. I\u2019ll give you some more of the details of the RETCON Universe but it\u2019s a more simple story this time around with DODGE!.\u201d\nDrawn and inked by Mike Rooth, one of the most respected and beloved artists to emerge from the world of comic books. His work DODGE! is going to interject Rooth\u2019s name into any discussion about handling the most hallowed licensed characters in the world.\n\u201cThis is the best gig I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Mike Rooth. \u201cIt\u2019s testing me, and pushing me, and humbling me at times but it\u2019s pulling the best out of me. I\u2019m getting better every day. DODGE! is helping me focus and making me healthier too, I\u2019ve lost weight and I\u2019m stronger.\u201d\nFeaturing reward pin-ups by baller talent like Casey Parsons and Shay Hahn\nWe are making this book because we love Chris Dodge. If you didn't fall for him when you read RETCON, then this book will make you a believer.\nColored by Caroline Nolasco, each issue is a clinic in state of the art coloring techniques and technology. Caroline creates a visceral atmosphere, shifting from frozen forest to thick jungle in a crisp and clean way that orients the reader perfectly from page to page.\nDODGE! RETCON Volume 2 is a throwback prequel with over-the-top characters, period settings and Cold War themes. We\u2019re taking you back in time with a retcon of RETCON Volume 1. Mike Rooth was asked to emulate the bold lines, and square jaws that were so popular during the '80s and '90s but we\u2019ve refined it with a more classic storytelling style with lots of detailed panels. Each issue is full of action and story.\nThis is an exploration of late \u201980s heroism calling back \u201cPredator\u201d, \u201cPlatoon\u201d and the glory days of Wolverine.\nSet during the Cold War, DODGE! tells the modern origins of the Paranormal Ordnance Disposal team seen in RETCON Volume 1. Returning for DODGE! are Keith Swan, the bionic commando turned world-ending villain and of course Chris \u201cthe Animal\u201d Dodge.\nMeet Arnold Begay, the Rez Dog from Arizona. A man of few words, Arnold always seems to rise to the occasion, especially when he\u2019s riding the wind.\nIntroducing a new cast of villains, including a real bad egg from Russian folklore, meet Koschei the Undying and find yourself in a globe-trotting tale of high-adventure!\nCover Tiers\nStretch Goal 1 - DODGE!

From Conan: The Barbarian to Weapon-X and on to Wolverine, Nixon has worked with Marvel, Image and IDW (doing a comic book retcon of the horror classic Motel Hell). In 2017, through Image Comics, Nixon launched the first RETCON story with legendary artist Toby Cypress. This is his first Kickstarter.\nMatt Nixon\n**Mike Rooth is a Canadian Freelance Art Mercenary possessed of a life-long love of art and comics whose illustration career began in the mid 1990\u2019s.

Therefore, I've taken great consideration to make Bright Ideas, Dark Mind of the highest quality I can.\nOf course!\nEach physical book will receive a numbered and signed 3\" x 4\" bookplate, exclusive to Kickstarter! Pretty cool, right?\nI mean, since you're helping me make this thing I wanna make sure you have something you can't get anywhere else.\nKeep an eye out for an upcoming Kickstarter update where YOU can help choose the final art!\n \n  Hey, there! I'm Ryan Kroboth, and I'm an illustrator, colorist, and writer from Pennsylvania. \nMost of my art education has been self-taught through books (and later blogs). However, in the last few years I've taken digital coloring, lettering, art, and digital inking courses through Comics Experience. \nThrough these classes, I\u2019ve experienced a large leap in my artistic growth in a short period of time. The biggest being learning to color digitally, and learning about color in general.\nPerhaps one of the most exciting parts of Bright Ideas, Dark Mind is it contains just about all of my digital colors after the Comics Experience course. You\u2019ll get to see my experimentation and growth across the course of the book!\nI have a passion for teaching, and I love sharing the lessons I\u2019ve learned with others. And I\u2019ll be sharing a story or two throughout the campaign.\nTo bring you the best possible book, I teamed up with Dave Lentz to help me with the logo and the finalized design of the book. Dave has been a big help with Sunmaker, and you'll see some of his art in Bright Ideas, Dark Mind in our Cthulhu story!\nHere's a bit more about Dave:\nDave Lentz is a family man, letterer, graphic designer, and sometimes artist. When he's not making comics he's usually reading them.\nHe is a fan of Star Wars, Batman, Ninja Turtles, and ninjas in general. \nSome of his credits include Metalshade, Spero: Breaker of Worlds (coming soon from Source Point Press), and Arabella Damage (coming soon from Action Lab).\nYou can find some of the things he do here\nFew things get me as pumped as an awesome art book!\nWhat's not to love?!\nWhile some collectors are looking for a single image that resonates with them to hang on their wall, I prefer a book that collects the work of an artist.\nI love seeing the growth across multiple projects. \nNot only that, but I feel like I get more value from an art book. I wanna see all the art!\nAnd I wish more artists collected their work into books. I feel it's not a common thing in the comic artist space... I'm always looking when I find a new artist I dig! Seriously, every artist should make an art book!\n(You can ask my friends. I'm always bugging them.)\nWith my passion for art books, I'd love the opportunity to offer one of my own.\nReaching the point in my artistic journey to consider this is a bit mind-blowing, honestly.\nAs there was a point that I almost gave up on art.\nIn high school I discovered Deviant Art. This was my first window into seeing art from other artists. The sheer talent of the work crushed my confidence. In retrospect I know this is silly, but at the time I felt like I'd never be \"good enough\". So I stopped drawing for a very long time.\nAsk any artist and they will tell you drawing is a part of who you are.\nEventually I found my way back. And through the encouragement of my wife I finally took the steps of becoming the comic artist I'd always dreamed of being.\nI'm still learning and growing. Over the last few years I've released two self-published creator owned comics, done several anthologies, and had the privilege of sharing the worlds of other creators by doing pinups and a few covers.\nBright Ideas, Dark Mind collects developmental material and sketches of those pieces.\nAnd I'm hoping to raise money on Kickstarter to fund a print run of the book so I can share those with you.\nAt one point seeing great art crushed my confidence, now it inspires me.\nI'd love the chance to inspire you and others.\nThe book is already 99% complete! The only page left to complete is the one bearing your name as a backer.\nI'm looking to print 100 digital-press copies of the book through PrintLore.\nTherefore, most of the funds will go to cover printing costs. Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top, with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.\n \n   \n  Here's what to expect for the campaign:\nAs an avid collector of books, I want to make sure you receive your book in excellent shape.\nNot only will it be shipped in a Lil Packaging bukwrap cardboard mailer to keep your book protected, you will find it secured by cardboard inserts and wrapped in a plastic sleeve to shield it from the elements.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\nThat's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\n Thank you for the opportunity to share my project with you.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Bright Ideas, Dark Mind to life. Please back this campaign today and allow me to share my journey with you!\nWith gratitude,\nRyan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI understand what it means to ask for your support. \n\nThis is my third Kickstarter, so I (more-or-less) know what to expect.\n\nThe biggest challenge to the campaign is the outside vendors, namely our printer. I have nothing but confidence in our printer, PrintLore. I've worked with them on my previous Sunmaker campaign. If any problems arise, I have had great communication from the company and I don't think that will change.\n\nAll the shipping supplies have been purchased, meaning all shipping costs will be for postage.\n\nI'm very familiar with Kickstarter platform having backed over 300 campaigns. This helps give me insight to what a backer looks for and expects. In addition, I am a part of the ComixLaunch course which specializes in crowdfunding comics. With this community I have an experienced group to turn to should the unexpected arise.\n\nAnd above all, I pride in communication.

Issue 4! \nDamage Inc. Issue 4-20+ pages of explosive Grey-tone supernatural glory!\nAt the end of the last issue a portal opened spilling an army of hungry vampires into our world, and due to a bet between two of the characters Damage inc. left the guns in their van. Now we get to see them try to resolve one of their toughest challenges, facing an army of fangs with only each other to rely on. Hell now they even have to team up with the same crazy Femme Fatals that they were there to hunt in order to survive!\nSo here is the deal. It is time to return to bounty hunting for fun and profit by joining the Club and funding Damage Inc. issue 4, a 30 page grey-tone occult explosion in a saddle stitched high gloss comic book. The series evolves as I bring in the style that Damage Inc. was made for. An eerie grey-tone I developed long ago for my work. As one critic mentioned the action bursts through this change:\n\"Damage inc. is a book for those who crave an original story that pumps harder than the wild fists of the mosh pit.\"  4.5 out of 5\n                                                                                                                      Shaun Barbour\nHere is what you get when you join the club and receive the Kickstarter-exclusive edition: \nThe 20 page main story concluding the Shadow Damage arc.\nPDF's of the first three issues, and Damage inc. Bible. \nFor the first time in Damage Inc. history, I use my horror developed award winning Grey-tone style. \nThe Kickstarter only, Cera Screams cover as seen above!\nA special addition of the short story comic Intermission by me James Burton! It is a 3 page story revolving around Gauge and what constitutes his dangerous and dysfunctional dating life.\nIllustrated Poetry from Kira Burton \n3 Bounties one for each of the Shadow Hunters. See what details sparked the hunt in the first place!\nEach Kickstarter exclusive will be hand numbered and signed. Back early for lower number!\nMy son James and I at Metropolis Comics.\nMy name is James Burton!\nI am an Award winning Artist/Writer who draws inspiration from a lifetime of Role Playing Games, being raised in the crazy life of my Biker father, and growing up in the craziest chaotic places. Some of that gave me a lot of things to love, a lot of  challenges to deal with, and the strength to survive level four cancer.\nAs a professional illustrator I have knocked out multiple storyboard projects for independent film, illustrated for The News and Review magazines, Penciled and inked two issues of Vampire of the Lost Highway, I have done multiple covers for Knights of the Dinner Table, covers for Psychosis and I am best known for my artwork on the award winning book Inheritance, that I co created to the tune of 106 beautiful labor intensive pages in four issues. I was also successful funding Damage Inc. Issue 3 on Kickstarter!\nThis time out I have handled everything in this story down to the lettering and the shading, but I did have some help. Noel Serrato and Terry Shoemaker made an action packed alt cover as did Ryan Krolbroth.\nRyan Krollboth and the bad ass alt cover he made!\nNoel Serrato and Terry Shoemaker's all cover!\nThis is an additional 3 page story I have in this issue purely to make people laugh and explore how out there Gauge actually is. You gotta love the big guy despite the crazy.\n\nHere are some creators who were down to ride along with Damage inc. and a few words they had to say: \n\n\n-Tyler is a mentor to a movement.\nUniqueness gets you noticed: Clay Adams, master of Fried comics\nRyan Krollboth-creator of Sunmaker, master of his own path.\nAdam Atkinson\n\n\nWhy did I bring Damage Inc. back to Kickstarter?\nThis book was a fight in certain ways...\nBut I like a good fight.\nBringing this together was not easy. This past year has been filled with life's challenges. Moving, changing jobs, desperately working to be a good enough father and husband. \nLife...but it's done.\nMy reason though, my motivation for the time spent on these pages has not changed. Each page, each book still helps me build the life I am trying to create as a legacy for my children. They go to cons with me, and Camille loves being at the table. Recently she and a cousin even outsold me while I was doing Panels. The legacy for my children began the moment I became their father, and getting these into print shows them a bit more that life is what you build. \nIt makes it even easier though depending on who your building with, and for...\nNow this is Kickstarter. I believe in this platform. My last book was run through Kickstarter, and the experience  while challenging made more possible for me at a time when I needed to believe in myself. That is why I am back. That is why Damage Inc. has returned with me. There is still a lot of legacy to build.\nAs this action bursting occult mosh-pit of a comic is finished, the funds will be used to pay for the printing of new issues for all the backers as well as for sales in the immediate future and costs for the backing rewards.\n\nThe preview of Badassery:\nNow let me show you some pages from the book. Always open on action...\nDamage Inc. was created when I was a kid trying desperately to stay out of the world of trouble I was born into. In a haze of Comic books and role playing games I managed to form a surrogate family with boyhood friends that forever changed who I was, and provided me with the basis for Damage inc. \nWe mixed a combination of RPG ideas and elements into our own world creating Damage inc. and the comic evolved from there. It sped up dramatically when one of us discovered that the guns in our game were far more powerful than most super powers. All hell broke loose and they started hunting super-villains like they were trophies. \nGauge is often a fan favorite. He's sarcastic and a bit of a misogynist. Lets face it he's a jerk, but a jerk who is more than willing to take hits to keep his friends safe. \nThe friend of mine he's based on says the character is like that because he's tanking, and the more people hate him the more they target him instead of the people he cares about. Personally I find it therapeutic watching other characters put him in his place or throwing him through walls. \nWhen Cuda joined the club he was the most reserved person I had ever met. Half Chinese and half German, huge glasses and as dorky as I was at the time. I knew him for three months before I heard him speak. \nHowever once he let it out things changed quickly.\nHe earned the nickname Overkill as his love for action exceeds the limits of what he's usually fighting, but in truth the character is based on the most honest and true person I have ever met. He is one of the few people in my life who has ever helped me find peace within myself. Not bad for a guy obsessed with Kung Fu and Grenades. \n We are Damage inc.\nWhen I was 14 I got into a huge fight after school with a kid who had been tormenting me for over a year. I planned on walking out there and killing him or at least breaking an arm, but something happened. I asked him to hit me and get it out of his system, and he did. He let loose and tried to rock my head off at the shoulders, but instead, I shrugged it off, and started talking to him.\nThat day I settled the issue with him and it ended, and I didn't have to throw a punch. In today's hindsight I am very proud but then I hated myself for it. I wasn't as strong as I knew my dad wanted me to be. I didn't kill him...\nThe next day my dad took me to a little shop in Marysville he bought me a vest that matched his, placed an angel on one side to remind me I was never alone. Then he explained to me...\n\"This vest is your armor it will protect you. When you wear it you can't be hurt, and you are unstoppable. It will warn off people and tell them you are not to be messed with. Respect it, take care of it, and it will keep you safe.\"\nFor years I barely wore it thinking I was unworthy. It was a symbol in my mind of my failure. Until my dad went down hard in a canyon not far from my house. In what I thought was his deathbed he was laying there barely able to speak. It was time to say good bye. I told him I was so sorry I was never tough enough for him, never the man he was. He started to choke up and said...\n\"Do you remember when I gave you your vest son? You were so upset about that fight.\"\n\"Because I failed you dad.\"\n\"You didn't fail me son. I was proud.\"  Gasp.... cough,\n\"It takes more courage to talk then it does to hurt some one. Me, your brother, we woulda fought. We woulda hurt him. But you... You changed that kid. You did the right thing. You are the brave one, not me... I'm a coward.\"\nI would later find out after he had died that he was regularly beaten as a child by my step grandfather, a bad man who thought his belt and his fist was the only way to teach his step son. My dad's words took on such a greater meaning then.\nThat's why we wear that patch, and most have vests and jackets on. To us  it carries the legacy of PITBULL JIM, a reminder that courage comes in all forms, and so do the fights that it is needed for.\nI still have my vest, and that angel. Now it has my Damage patches on it thanks to my sister Kira. I won't give my vest up till I leave this world, but I can make anyone worthy of riding along side of us one.\n\nThe Inks fo Noel Serrato on top of Terry Shoemakers lines.

(Book is done remember?)\nBook Printed and shipped to me  ~November 15ish\n\"Goddamn it Brain\" buffer - 2 weeks\nPack and ship ~(November 14-November 31) \nExpected delivery to US ~ 2 Weeks (Early December) \nExpected delivery to International ~ 4 Weeks (late December) \n\n Getting it done: THE PACKAGING \nI hate the post office. They once mangled 80 copies of Inheritance right before my first big con. So I am taking precautions.\nBackers trust the creators on Kickstarter, and you deserve the best in return. That's why I am shipping with comic mailers to protect your investment. Know this though. If they botch it and you get a book that looks like a guinea pig was chewing on it, you'll be getting another right after you reach out to me.\nThank you!\nEach time I get to print these books it changes my life and I will be grateful forever to the people who have helped make that happen. The backers other creators who show support, the mentors and teachers we find. All of them are the invaluable part of the legacy I am building that I never thought would exist.\nSo please back this project. Help me keep building Damage inc. and the legacy for my family.\nThank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges:\nThe book is done the only risks are issues with the printer or the vendors I get the loot for the rewards from.

Some of my earliest memories are of me locked away in my bedroom with my action figures and creating entire worlds to play in.  As an adult, I love the fact that I get to share these worlds, and these stories, with everyone.  Nothing brings a bigger smile to my face than someone telling me that they've enjoyed my work.  \nCAMILO WRITES: Yes, I live in Chile. Yes, I am Latino, but I do not dance Salsa or Reggaeton  (well, maybe with a few extra drinks).  I live with my two daughters (both cats) and my girlfriend (another cat).  I love the arts in general as music, paintings and drawings are my main passions. I like to play drums, I do not do it very often, but when I do it is very intense (sometimes, it gets me in trouble).   With respect to my work, I like everything about the introspection and the emotinal processes, I think that darkness is not a wall that limits us, but rather, the darkness is like a riddle and when we decipher it, we can heal and keep growing, sometimes the dark hides true personal treasures. FOLLOW CAMILO ON INSTAGRAM TO WATCH HIM WORK ON MAN OF SIN  @SITHRALIS\nWES WRITES: Wes Locher's lettering work has appeared in countless titles (I mean, I guess you COULD count them, but honestly, who has the time?) from Alterna Comics, ComixTribe, Titan Comics, Markosia Enterprises, and Arcana Studios, along with myriad self-published projects. \nWhy this story?  Why Man of Sin?\nCreator Andrew Guilde writes:\nI remember holding my sobbing grandmother as they lowered my grandfather\u2019s casket into his grave. I don\u2019t remember much more from that day. \nA few months later, I was back at the cemetery, this time holding my own mother as her husband, my stepfather, had just passed. \nWithin a year, I lost the two most important men in my life. \nAs time went on, I watched as my family tirelessly navigated their deaths. Anger, tears, fear, self- doubt and blame all manifested for everyone. Tragedy, I learned, sows deep roots. \nIt was here, watching my family struggle, that I felt I needed to tell a story. One part personal catharsis, one part meditation on the dangers we all must confront when we\u2019re met face-to-face with tragedy. \nAs I began to think on how I\u2019d tackle this subject, I knew instantly that I was going to write a horror story. Not because horror allowed me to deal with death and dying, but rather, the horror genre allowed me to explore the depths of the human condition when faced with death and dying, which is often times much more terrifying than any creature of the night. \nLuckily for me, as this idea was swirling around in my head, I happened to be watching a documentary about the history of the anti-Christ. And like that, Man of Sin was born.\nWant to learn more about creator Andrew Guilde and the Man of Sin project?

We're back to bring you the next installment in the 'sitcomic' adventures of Morgan and the crazy organauts living inside his body. Are you ready to see what might really be going on inside our insides?\nIn 2016, we introduced Kickstarter and the world to Book 1 of our quirky concept, and in 2017, we returned with Book 2. Thanks to the love and support of our incredible fans, we're able to return for Book 3 of Morgan's Organs. The great thing about this series is each story is standalone - you can read it in any order and still enjoy the heck out of it!\nIn Book 1 (click to preview), we witnessed Morgan's two \"heads\" of the body clash for control of Morgan's decision-making, all while Morgan battled the pressure to end a dry spell.\nIn Book 2 (click to preview), we cringed as Morgan dealt with the pains of swallowing something he shouldn't, and the consequences it would have for the organauts as it moved through his digestive system.\nThis time, we're bringing you a story riddled with alcohol, phallic artwork and a secret Morgan wish he never knew. And what I am most excited about is that we're using an unconventional narrative style for this book with a structure similar to that of Christopher Nolan's hit movie, Memento.\nTake a look at the Book 3 preview pages below!\n Dick drawings, black eyes and amnesia, oh my!\nMorgan's Organs is the brain spawn of me - Daniel Brodie. After a couple years of pursuing the idea as a television series, I realized that the best way to bring my idea to the world would be to make it happen myself. So I partnered with the incredibly talented artist, Robert Jennex, to create the world of Morgan's Organs. Rob brings an incredible vision and spark to the series, and none of this would be possible without my Canadian partner-in-crime.\nWe're also excited to continue to have Tyler Kelting from Oklahoma, USA, on our team as the series colourist. Tyler joined us for Book 2 to handle the full colours, and he has brought an incredible sense of discipline and creativity to build on the Morgan's Organs style.\n(From left to right): Daniel, Rob, Tyler\nThis series focuses on Morgan as he navigates everyday college life, which is made difficult by the fact that he isn't completely \"human\". Inside his body lives a variety of organ-like characters (called organauts) who control his various body systems and ultimately, are keeping him alive. The problem is these organauts don't always operate with the best interests of their host in mind.   \nThe stories take place on two levels. Outside, we follow Morgan and his group of friends as they navigate college life. Zoom in to his insides and we see how Morgan's struggles are made worse by a group of organauts who bicker, lie, cheat, argue, act selfish, and generally, don't work together as one.\nStretch Goals Unlocked!\n\nClick to learn more about this stretch goal\nClick to learn more about this stretch goal\nMake sure to read the below highlights about our rewards. \nBelow is a summary of the various reward tiers. Most rewards tiers build on their previous tier.\nAll of the below tiers include physical rewards. Shipping is incremental to the dollar amount indicated.\nI have always tried to be transparent about the budget for my Kickstarter's and what the funds will be used for. I don't see this as a business - not yet, at least. These campaigns are part of my long-term vision to have Morgan's Organs picked up by a publisher, and eventually made as a television series. All of my rewards are priced appropriately to cover exactly what I need to support this vision. That means covering artist salary, production (including printing), and packaging/shipping. \nI pay my artist team what I am able, but we have a mutual understanding this is a partnership and we're investing in a long-term vision. Between Book 1 and Book 2, I was able to increase my per-page-rate for the art team. I hope to be able to do so again for this campaign by exceeding our campaign goal.\nOur Kickstarter goal of $4,000 CAD supports the below:\n60% = artist salary\n30% = the 4P's - printing / production / packaging / parceling (shipping)\n10% = Kickstarter fees\nEverything raised above this goal will go to a combination of:\nAdditional printing (further driving down per-unit-cost and creating opportunity to invest in our stretch goal rewards)\nIncreasing artist salary\nConvention booths at future events\nFuture stories in the series!\nBook 3 is already more than 75% complete - we only have about 10 pages left to ink and 20 pages to colour. Our goal is to deliver all campaign rewards by end-July/early-August.\nRead some of the past coverage we've received on Book 1 and Book 2 of the series!\nStarburst - Book 1: 8/10 stars - \"Smutty, slapstick yet spectacularly striking in its approach and relatability, this is a battle of the heads that\u2019s an absolute riot to watch unravel.\"\nStarburst- Book 2: 8/10 stars - \"Even more charming and funny than its predecessor... a hell of a fun ride.\"\nComic Crusaders -\"Daniel lays out a wonderful story that I, no WE, need to read more of! The art is great, Robert brings to life the world of Morgan\u2019s organs with a clean, animated style.\"\nComixBrew - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is the kind of comic that is good to show your buddies for the laughs but also contains a deceptive amount of depth.\"\nComic Unknown - \"If you ever wondered how Inside Out would have worked through the eyes of a male college student, look no more. Morgan's Organs is a gut-busting comedy that while the idea has been seen before, it is the fresh take we need and want.\"\nBleeding Cool - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs #2 hits a rhythm that the first issue only brushed up against. With this issue, each character has its place, and the situation is so ludicrous that it really lines up with the surreal premise of the comic.\"\nThe Outhousers - \"The delightfully cartoonish art and exploration of maturity help [Morgan's Organs] defy expectations. It's a satisfying read for those that love thoughtful comedy.\"\nIf you've gotten this far, might as well read the rest of it! I'm honestly humbled that Morgan's Organs is even a thing in this world. I remember six years ago, I was embarrassed to even spill my idea to friends. Now, I am on my feet at Conventions, shouting at people walking by my booth to check out a comic that features a talking penis.\nThe reception to the series on Kickstarter, online, and at events has been incredible. I am not in this industry to make comics - I'm here to make Morgan's Organs! With each book, I get closer to my goal of getting picked up by a publisher so that I am able to make books more frequently, and who knows, maybe one day I can go back to my original dream of making this into a television series.\nOnly more books and more time will tell what the future of Morgan's Organs holds... oh, and your support for the series!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks, schmisks! We've done this twice before already and know exactly how to execute a Kickstarter campaign. In our previous two campaigns, we delivered within one to two months of the original promised date, with delays simply because we wouldn't sacrifice time for quality! This campaign, we have even more of Book 3 complete than ever before to ensure we can deliver that much sooner.\n\nShort of Rob and Tyler getting enlisted to be the first humans to land on Mars, there is nothing stopping this project from happening. And even if they do end up on Mars, I'm sure there will be decent Wi-Fi connection for them to keep working between their less important, interstellar missions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Atom", "descp": "Every dollar helps!\nThe description in the below tiers indicates the feature reward available.

Okay... \nThis is my first real attempt at a comic book. I wrote the initial draft ages ago and ended up sitting on it for a while. It was influenced by the early movies of Kevin Smith and Edward Burns. \nAfter reading many indie comic (mainly the books of Terry Moore), I revisited, revised and completed the story. It developed it into something else. The first issue introduces the characters, and delves a little deeper into one of the main protagonists, Will, while setting up the second issue (currently being illustrated).\nABOUT THE BOOK\nSWEET EUPHORIA is a black and white comic book, coming to a total of 28 pages (24 of story). The digital copies will be hi-res pdfs sent once the campaign has completed. \nThe other books offered as rewards are as follows:\nSHORTS - a collection of short stories that I created or collaborated with creators Lea J. Zimmit, Dan Amareiles, JR Loflin, Nikki Sherman and Justin Birch. \nPOWER-UPS: VILIFIED & ONE COMIC TO RULE THEM ALL - short tales created by the #ComicBookHour community. I worked on two stories with Erik Bitmanis (creator of the HARD WYRED series).\nNEWLY ADDED! \nThere's a sketch reward where you can get a 5x7 sketch included with your pledge.

Being sci-fi related has the chance to hold it back slightly but give it time to garner a cult following and give it the right marketing campaign and anything is possible. Let\u2019s wait and see what happens next.-Rogues Portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few different reasons. Since we successfully funded issue 2 a lot has changed, Aaron Alfeche was originally just going to finish the second issue as we had the first few pages already completed by another artist, but as Aaron's style is so distinctive and amazing having pages from the previous artist wouldn't work for me.  So we redrew them and we also added more pages.\nWe hired a new colourist, by the name of DC Alonso whose own talent needs to be witnessed.\nWe hired the Legendary Marshall Dillon to do the letters, all of this was post Kickstarter and has taken the book to an entirely new level.\nIt took a fair chunk of time, from when we funded to when we shipped due to a multitude of reasons (I got hospital level sick, we changed colourist after a significant delay, we added more pages and added a new cover etc.)\nI want to avoid delays as much as possible in the future, the only way to do that is to finish as much as possible before heading to Kickstarter, I don't want to make backers have to wait for their rewards in the future.\nAny funding we raise here will go towards producing issue 3 and to do another print run as we are almost sold out, and probably the biggest reason is that I would love to attract more readers because whether you like the story or not (you will!) the level of artistic talent within these comics deserves to be seen.\nI'm proud of what we achieved with REPLICATOR 1. With REPLICATOR 2 we have improved in every facet, producing something absolutely amazing.\nWe are specifically funding a limited edition cover for REPLICATOR 2 which you can see at the start of this Kickstarter.\nDepression and mental health are important to me. I have depression and I have written a long post about it which you can find Here.  I wrote Replicator because I was unable to relate to a lot of the mainstream superheroes with their \"do the right thing and everything will be ok\" mantra.\nI found as a teenager with depression that kind of thought process alienated me. It made me feel more isolated and that there must be something wrong with me because I would do the right thing and things still wouldn't be ok. Life isn't like that, and pretending it's all sunshine and rainbows is counterproductive.\nI related more to the \"evil\" villains as they often had a compelling reason why they had to do what they had to do and a lot of them were mentally unstable. If I had known there were others like me then maybe I wouldn't have felt so alone.\nI also got frustrated that one of the superheroes' biggest concerns was juggling their superhero life with their secret identity. People deal with much bigger issues.\nWith REPLICATOR there won't be heroes wondering if they are doing the right thing, there will be people doing what they feel they need to, it's up to you to decide if they are good or bad.\nOur main character Ryker turns from a stable loving husband into something else... Someone we wish we couldn't relate to, the worst version of ourselves who embraces the darkness that we all have felt at some stage in our lives.\nLike Mech's?

I initially thought this guy can't be real as he had no real history but was producing work of a quality similar or better than the big two. He is real and he is the real deal. This is Aaron's first full book which is absolutely insane..He is from the Philippines, it wont be long before he is picked up by one of the big companies.\nColours by DC ALONSO DC Alonso or David is a colourist hailing from Spain.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will. \nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit. We couldn't be happier to share it with you.\nWhat Exactly Is This Kickstarter For?\nThe team has already invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of man-hours into the development of this first WAILING BLADE series. \nThe first issue is 100% complete and ready to print.\nSoon, our book will compete for attention on the shelves of comic shops world-wide. \nWith your support here on Kickstarter, we can fund a larger initial print run for the book and expand the TAKE THE BLADE TOUR, bringing our new series to more comic conventions and in-store signings around the country. \nIt will also help fund cool new Wailing Blade merchandise and Kickstarter-Exclusive collectibles for our biggest fans. A successful launch will also help make even more Wailing Blade stories than initial series possible. \nFunds raised above and beyond our modest goal will go into project stretch goal enhancements for our backers as well as be invested back into the series. \n ComixTribe was launched with the help of Kickstarter fans and we know the only place some of our biggest fans can get our books is here on Kickstarter. So we\u2019re back with another awesome campaign to help make more killer comics! \nFeast Your Eyes on These Pages Inside the Book...\n Want to See Even More Before You Take the Blade? \nIf you'd like to read even more of Wailing Blade before you back this campaign, we invite you to download a generous 19 page preview. \n \u2694\ufe0f CLICK HERE TO ACCESS ACCESS THE PREVIEW \u2694\ufe0f  \nWhat Awesome Rewards Are Available?\n Want a Closer Look at Those Killer Covers? \nNOTE: YOU CAN ADD the KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE Cover to ANY PHYSICAL PLEDGE LEVEL for +$25!\nWAILING BLADE PROJECT TIMELINE\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: Jan 15 - Jan 31\nKickstarter Funds Received: Feb 14\nWailing Blade #1 to Print: Early February\nMerchandise in Production: February\nBook Manufacturing and Freight: (Late February) \nExtra Buffer Time for Unexpected Issues: (March)\nExpected Deliver to US Backers: (Early April) \nExpected Deliver for INT Backers: (Late April)  \nTHIS BLADE IS SHARP, SO HERE'S HOW WE'LL PROTECT IT IN TRANSIT! \nAs Kickstarter fans and collector's ourselves, we know there's nothing worse than backing a comic project and then having your rewards arrive damaged. \nAfter consulting with our backers, we've revamped our shipping practices to ensure your comics and collectibles arrive in great condition. \nAll comics shipped will be individually bagged with boards, and will be secured in Gemini Comic Supply Comic Flash Mailers, which provides impact-resistant protection.\nOrders with multiple comics will be sandwich packed and secured for additional protection.\nAnd our Wailing Boxes will be BUBBLE WRAPPED before being inserted into a second shipping box, so that it arrives in great condition. \nFurthermore, for this campaign, we're handling fulfillment 100% in-house. In the past, we've worked with some external fulfillment companies who specialize in packing and shipping so that we can stay focused on creating the books. \nHowever, for this campaign, we want to make sure that everything arrives to our backers as quickly as possible and limit the possibility of unforeseen delays, which is why we are rolling up our sleeves and personally overseeing fulfillment for every backer.  \nThank you so much for taking the time to check out our project.

To protect what was left of their culture, the Sunmakers sealed themselves away from the doomed world. Now their numbers have dwindled, and Tibhan, the last of the Sunmakers, must risk everything by returning to the desolate wastes to fuel the fire that preserves his people's essence.\nEven if the cost is great and unthinkable.\nThis is the second chapter of a three issue mini-series. \nSunmaker is for those who like their fantasy dark, with thematic undertones, and who want some color in their apocalypse!  \nA fantasy story that takes place in a vivid apocalyptic world.\nStrong theme of legacy and what happens when your values come into conflict with morality.\nThe struggle of understanding that for something to thrive, something else may have to be sacrificed.\n22 pages of full-color sequentials plus 6 pages of extras which include a pinup gallery. That's a whole 28 pages total!\n6.625 x 10.25 on 85b gloss paper with a 105lb gloss cover, just like issue #1!\nOff-set printed for the highest quality.\nA limited variant cover by John Edingfield II. \nFree digital issue #1 standard version with every pledge\nAnd, you know, a glove that shoots fire...\nTibhan and his father are the last remaining Sunmakers. Their legacy, the great fire of the Second Sun, must be preserved by any means.\nWith the fire of the Second Sun nearly extinguished, Tibhan must leave the safety of the vault and find more energy to fuel it. During his travels of the frozen wastes he runs into opposition; a race of ice people known as Sunbloods.\nDid I mention those Sunbloods are hostile? Very hostile? \nLucky for Tibhan, his Combustion Glove makes him no pushover.\nHowever, with their greater numbers, Tibhan is over-come... sweet flame thrower glove or not.\nTibhan awakes to find himself saved by Meirin, another Sunmaker!\nTo save her own people, Meirin agrees to travel along with Tibhan to the Sunbloods tower and retrieve the source of the Second Sun.\nAnd just when it seemed like it was going to be easy... well, let's not spoil that.\nHow far will Tibhan go to preserve the legacy of his people? We find out in issue #2!\n\u201cWhen are you going to stop talking about making a comic and actually make a comic?!\u201d\nNot exactly the words you want to hear from your significant other, but for me they rang true and struck deep. They pushed me to take action.\nAnd then? \nNot having the first clue about what exactly making a comic entailed, I stumbled upon a website called ComixTribe which, for the first time, broke down all the steps. Included on the ComixTribe website was a column called The Proving Grounds, a weekly public script edit by two professional comic editors.\nThis is where I found the script for Sunmaker. There was something that captivated me about the world and the characters. Especially the line \"All things return to the cold!\"\n  After the first time I read the script I'd feed my cats and I'd be shouting \"All things return to the cold!\" at them (which was met with \"just freakin' feed me already\" stares). \nDamn cats.\nI had to tell Liam how much I loved the script, which ended up kicking off Sunmaker  coming to life. My hope is to capture as much energy and excitement  that I felt the when I initially read the story and bring that to  each page. \nBut the reason I reached out to Liam beyond all the other submissions to TPG is how he kept coming back to TPG. He submitted more than anyone else. His desire to grow and learn made him someone that I would love to work with.\n  Because of that, I've grown as a storyteller.\nI think Liam is a fantastic writer, and if this project means a book Liam has that he can give to people to see his skills and use it to get more work in the future, that would mean more to me than anything for this series.\nStories are meant to be shared.\n \"I wanted to write Sunmaker to tell a story about tradition and the lengths people are willing to go to preserve it. \nFantasy works best, in my view, when it examines a particular facet of the human condition (albeit through the lens of magical fires and ice-people) and there's something inside all of us that speaks to the need to preserve; it's a basic human instinct. \nIn that way, we are all Sunmakers looking to keep our respective fires aflame. But as is the nature of reality, all things return to the cold, and clinging our dying legacies pulls us further from the warmth and the light. \nLetting go is then what keeps us human, and that's really what I wanted to convey with Sunmaker.\" \n\"It feels like a video game when you're reading it.\"\n          -Kat Calamia, Comic Frontline \n\"Sunmaker has an art style that will melt your heart and a story that will freeze it back together!\"\n          -Chris Orndoff, Headmetal Press\n\" Sunmaker is a fantastical romp through a frozen hell of snow and ice monsters that only the bonds of friendship and family can keep at bay and ultimately overcome. All things return to the cold, but some things are greater than the cold.\" \n          -Will Allred, writer of Diary of Night\n\"A dying sun, a tormented warrior, and a glove that shoots fire! Sunmaker carries you into heated battles, tortured pasts and mournful music, before returning you longingly - where all things belong - to the cold...\"\n          -Andy Perry, writer of Undetermined\nIndeed. And a giant one, at that.\nCheck out the first few pages of issue two that picks up where the battle left off!\nThe book is 100% complete! The only thing left to do is print, and that is why we are coming to Kickstarter.\nWe are looking to fund an offset print run of 1,500 books through KrakenPrint that Liam and I will split for product to sell at conventions and other channels.\n Most of the funds raised in the campaign will go towards printing costs.  Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top of the campaign,  with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.   \nOh, we're bringing the BOOM to a whole other level.\nIf this hasn't been enough and you still want to see more, then how does an 10 page full-color preview sound? \nBy signing up to to my email list, you'll receive it right now, and I'll even throw in the full issue #1 if you're new to the series and want to be sure this is for you!\nShow me more!\nJohn Edingfield II, creator of Rancidville, contributed this AMAZING variant cover for Sunmaker #2! \nFor you collectors out there, this is limited to 150 copies!\nOh, yea, did I mentioned it would be signed by John? How cool is that?!\nIf you want a print copy of Sunmaker Chapter #1 and it's not included in your pledge, don't worry!\nAll you have to do is click \"Manage your Pledge\", then \"Change my pledge.\" Add $6 to any print level reward and you're set!\nI love comics. The larger majority of books I get are from creators  themselves, so I appreciate when someone takes that little something extra to be sure that my package gets there in excellent shape.\nHere is a look at the packaging mock-ups you can expect to receive your reward in.\nFor tiers that include the physical book, sketch-in, and aluminum prints this is what your shipment will look like. All comics are bagged and boarded, then packed inside a rigid cardboard envelope.\nOriginal art mock-up packaging looks like this:\nThe comic is still protected inside of a bag with a board. Aluminum prints have their own bag to protect them from being scratched. The original art will be placed inside a rigid plastic protector, then inserted into a priority mail box to make the package even more rigid.  Finally, that box will be placed into a large bubble mailer to protect your reward even further.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\nThat's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment with a book that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\nIf you've played video games, you know collectibles are a big part of the experience.\nSince Sunmaker has huge influences from gaming, I thought it would be cool to take that part of the gaming world and bring it to this project. \nThe only way Sunmaker is possible is because of your support, and I'm ever grateful for that.\nAnd as a Kickstarter supporter, I feel that you should have something unique, only available through the campaign. \nWhenever you support the book through a physical tier (because of shipping) you will receive a Sunshard for that corresponding issue. These Sunshards can be collected together to form an image that will be used to attach to a future bookplate.\nNo one from a convention will get these pieces. \nNo one from an online store.\nOnly the people who help make this project a reality.\nJust a little something to make it extra cool and as a thank you.\nThis is not the final art, but it should give you an idea of what to expect!\nThe campaign will run throughout January and Febuary. Since KrakenPrint does all their offset printing overseas, there is approximately a two month wait for books to arrive. Books are expected about the middle of May, and will ship immediately upon arrival.\nBackers should expect to receive their rewards by July.\nA big, blue caption box can't express nearly how grateful I am for allowing me to share my project with you. Thank you for your time and attention.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Sunmaker to life. Please back this campaign today and join us for the fun we have in store for our backers!\nWith gratitude,\nRyan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI understand what it means to ask for your support.\n\nThis will be my second Kickstarter campaign, so I know (more-or-less) what to expect. \n\nBut let's be realistic, there are always surprises\n\nI'm very familiar with Kickstarter platform having backed over 200 campaigns. This helps give me insight to what a backer looks for and expects. In addition, I am a part of the ComixLaunch course which specializes in crowdfunding comics. With this community I have an experienced group to turn to should the unexpected arise.\n\nWith printing overseas there are always possibilities with delays.

Thanks to our amazing backers and fans, we were able to produce the first volume in 2017 through a successful Kickstarter and now the story continues in Book 2.\nIf you're returning to Rancidville, Thank you so much! None of this could have been done without you. If you're new to the story, Welcome! You've picked the perfect point to start your journey into the town of Rancidville.\nThis campaign is to raise funds to print the 52-page graphic novel Rancidville: The Rotten Truth. There is also a Kickstarter Exclusive Variant Cover by Ryan Kroboth.\nA kid-centric mystery comic that is all-ages appropriate. \nA central theme of not judging people by their appearances.\n48 pages of full-color sequential art.\n6.625 x 10.25 Graphic Novel with a 12pt Matte Cover that has a Spot UV and 105lbs Matte interior pages - identical to Book 1.\nHighest Quality Printing\nA limited variant cover by Ryan Kroboth.\nFourteen year old Nathaniel Wicket had to move to a junkyard in a small unfamiliar Pennsylvanian town with his estranged Uncle.\nHe meets Shane Hines and Alice Martin, and the trio became quick friends.\nMeanwhile, in the City Council, the acts of nefarious men go unchecked.\n And Nathaniel finds a clue to a deeper mystery.\nSo they rush off to question the Guardian of the city.\nAnd get arrested.\nBut, after speaking with the Guardian...\nTheir fears are dismissed as the fantasies of children.\nWhich only fuels their desires to find the truth.\nRancidville is imaginative, funny, and is sure to engage the kid in all of us.\nI enjoy reading fiction novels.\nI like movies.\nI really, really enjoy television.\nBut, I love comics, and I absolutely LOVE to draw.\n\n\nSince I was eight years old, I have wanted to make comics. But I didn't have a clue where to start or what story to tell.\nI was never really into the superhero genre of comics, I always gravitated to comics like Usagi Yojimbo, Cerebus, TMNT, Elfquest, and Bone. \nIndependent, different, and with humor.\n\nOff and on for over 20 years, I have worked on some aspect of the Rancidville story as it has become a passion and a labor of love.\n\nIn 2011, sometime after it started, I discovered a webcomic called reMind by Jason Brubaker, and that opened my thoughts up to webcomic publication.\nThen, in 2014 I took an online course on how to get your comic project started. It focused on the organization of ideas surrounding comic creation.\n\nAll those things led to me getting my comic off the shelf of ideas and into the world of reality.\n\nI am incredibly excited to bring the second chapter of Rancidville to you.  I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have in creating it.\nIf you like mysteries you will love Rancidville.\nThere are over 50 Pages of Content\nIf you like mysteries solved by kids you will love Rancidville.\nIf you're a fan of Goonies or Scooby-Doo then guess what, you will love Rancidville\nIf you think the government is corrupt and wish someone could prove it (well I can't fix that) but you may still love Rancidville.\nBook  2 is even better than Book 1! While the first book primarily set up the characters, Book 2 is where the action really gets going!\nYou will love Rancidville if you are looking for a fresh story that challenges the preconceived notions of appearances and how we judge others based on those things.\nThe Rotten Truth is both Chapters 3 and 4 of Rancdiville making up the second act of a three-part story.\nThe book is 100% Complete\nA Digital Deluxe PDF is included with every book.\nAll the money raised will go toward printing the second book, backer rewards, Stripe/Kickstarter fees and shipping.  There is a small Miscellaneous amount set aside for contiengencies. If we're lucky enough to surpass our goal, any additional funding will go towards creating new rewards or be put directly back into the book, and production of the next volume. \nFree Shipping in the U.S.\nRancidville will be packed with care by experts who have years of shipping experience. No one enjoys getting a mangled comic as a reward from a Kickstarter Campaign.\nFrom the individually wrapped book to the shipping carton, the same attention and love goes into each shipment as it did in creating the actual books. \n                          >>>Click here to get the Preview of Chapter 3<<< \nIf you dig what you see, I hope you'll choose to join the campaign and select one of the rewards to help make Rancidville: The Rotten Truth a reality.\nRyan Kroboth, the artist of Sunmaker, whose credits include having published works by Fried Comics, Dren Productions, and Wannabe Press, contributed this AMAZING variant cover for Rancidville: The Rotten Truth! \nThis is a limited print run for the Kickstarter only. Once the campaign is over, this will not be available anywhere else. As an added bonus Ryan is going to autograph each backers copy, how sweet is that!\nI want you to back my project with confidence. If you're not 100% satisfied with your pledge, I'll do whatever it takes to resolve your issue. And, if that's not possible, simply return your reward and you'll be refunded your full pledge amount.\nIt means a lot to me that you have taken the time to read through my campaign.

Our goal for this Kickstarter is to fund the creation and printing of issues 3 and 4, completing the first arc of the series. \n\"Gritty, plausible, and highly entertaining.\" -- Comics Anonymous\n\"An intense crime story...the tip of a great, big, storytelling iceberg.\" -- Monkeys vs. Robots\n\"An ambitious first issue that exceeds on all accounts.\" -- Rogue's Portal\n\"Fantastic...trippy and uber plausible.\" -- Comic Crusaders\n\"Spectacular.\" -- RWAFR\nTHE STORY\nThe U.S. is at war--against Russia, and its own people. With the country on the verge of economic collapse and political revolution, the CIA recruits Seattle DEA Agent Brendan Kruge to test an experimental mind control drug on unwitting citizens.\nNorth Bend is inspired by the true events of project MKULTRA - a secret CIA program that took place during the cold war, where experimental drugs and mind control methods were tested on people without their knowledge. \nPREVIOUSLY IN NORTH BEND\nAfter a workplace accident, Sam, a CIA chemist, wanders the streets in a drug-fueled haze, and is conned into giving away his savings. \nIssues #1-2 art by Robert Carey, Dee Cunniffe, and Ellie Wright\nBrendan, a Seattle DEA agent, is visited by CIA Officers Braxton Church and Hal Holbrook, who want him to join a secret program to test a mind control drug on unknowing subjects.\nAnnie will do almost anything to get things back the way they were...before Sam's accident.\nBrendan, Braxton, and Hal set up a safehouse in a quiet, suburban neighborhood.\nNEXT IN NORTH BEND #3-4\nIssue #3 cover by Pablo De Bonis\nIn the next issues, Brendan and his wife, Jamie, find themselves on opposite sides as they track down Sam's money. And Brendan begins his first MKULTRA experiments - with unforeseen consequences.\nBy the way, there will be violence, language, and sexual situations...so this is recommended for mature readers.\nHere's a 6 page preview of issue #3. It comes in at 31 pages and issue 4 will be around there as well. So there's plenty more story and we're keeping some of the best stuff a secret!\nTEAM \nRyan Ellsworth - That's me! I'm the writer of North Bend. I also write Thought Experiment, an online crime/sci-fi comic anthology. @RyanEllsworth_\nPablo De Bonis - Pablo is from Rosario, Argentina, and began drawing at the age of 6. He is currently a student of the renowned comic book artist Marcelo Frusin. He has published in some editorials in Argentina, and drew the cover for Skies of Fire: Book 1. pablodebonisart\nPaul Little - Paul is a colorist from southern Ontario, Canada. He's contributed to the New York Times bestselling Image Comics series Morning Glories, as well as licensed properties including Sons of Anarchy and Shrek. He lives for Americana and post-punk music, and he'd probably die if he had to go more than a month without seeing a live show. Behance\nThomas Mauer - Thomas has lent his lettering and design talent to numerous critically acclaimed and award-winning projects. Among his recent work are CRUDE, ELSEWHERE, HARDCORE, THE BEAUTY, and THE REALM, as well as DEAD KINGS, LARK'S KILLER, and the World Food Programme's LIVING LEVEL-3 educational comics. @thomasmauer\nREWARDS\nPrevious issues/prints (all covers available as an 8x12\" print - issue #4 cover to be revealed):  \nIssue #1 cover art - standard by Robert Carey / variant by Tula Lotay\nIssue #2 cover art - standard by Robert Carey / variant by Caspar Wijngaard\nOriginal art\nTarot cards by Benjamin Mackey\nComics are bagged & boarded, and shipped in sturdy cardboard mailers. Prints are on nice semi-gloss paper, just like you'd hope it would be. Original art will be shipped separately in a poster tube. Rewards will be shipped all together when both issues are complete, because shipping is insanely expensive, especially international.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've now successfully fulfilled two Kickstarters and am feeling pretty good about this one. We're about 70% done with production on issue #3, and writing on #4 is underway. I've already assumed most of the risk for creation of issue 3 since it's nearly complete. And you can be sure issue 4 will be getting made if this is funded! \n\nDelays in production/printing are probably the main risk, but chapter 3 has been moving along quite nicely. So I really think 5 months should be enough to have everything ready to go.\n\nI can usually be relied on to answer any questions/make sure you guys are happy. After all, you guys are the reason we're doing this. We love you guys!

So we want to have something for them that is only for them.\nWe've already achieved our first stretch goal to add a Gold Foil Embossment to the regular cover to make itas elegant as possible.\nWe're ecstatic to be back on Kickstarter to bring another installment of our fantasy comic Tart into existence. Tart is the story of a group of soldiers who risk their souls fighting to protect our world's history from being torn asunder.\nTart Acid and her friends have the courage to go anywhere in the world, or any time in history, to face down demonic threats...\n... But are they brave enough to confront the demons of their own past?\nTart 7 digs deep into the hells that can make you a hero. And, it visits the literal Hell where the Biggest Bad of them all dwells.\nThe Toxic Fruit must fight off the nemesis behind the demon incursions, The King of Hell himself.\nAt his right hand; The First Lady of Lust. She is the matriarch of every disgusting thought you wish you could stop obsessing over: The Queen of Hell.\nThe very definition of Sexy as Hell\nHalf the fun of our series has been offering up questions to our readers. It's time to start giving some answers!\nThough the funds from this campaign will be used to print issue 7, don't fear if you're new to our series.

Besides being as nice in real life as he is on the show, he's also generous with his time.\nMing agreed to read Tart Vol 1 and offered this review:\n\"Tart is fucking awesome!\"\nSince then, we've delivered each issue of Tart to him as they've come out. The result was Ming giving us one of the greatest reviews we've ever heard:\n\n\"If I could date a comic, I'd date Tart.\"\nAs amazing as it is to hear that from a guy whose entire business revolves around comics, it is just as incredible to hear from returning backers what they think. Here are just a few reviews of Tart 7 from backers we gave a sneak peek.\n\nTart would not exist if it were not for the incredible support of the Kickstarter Community in general, and our Kickstarter backers specifically.\n\nThe passion our backers show our book drives us to continue to make each issue of our series as strong as we possibly can. Returning to the original platform to deliver the next book is just natural. \n\n\nThe funds we are raising in this campaign will be used to pay for printing of the comic, production of all rewards, and shipping to our backers. \nAnything above and beyond the initial reward will be used to make the best quality printed comic we can, and then recoup the the costs of the already completed art. If we go beyond that, extra funds will pay for the labor on Tart 8.\nOUR REWARDS\nWe can not thank you enough for taking the time to consider our Kickstarter Campaign to bring Tart 7 into the world.

To be honest, I didn't expect to have to come up with stretch goals for this campaign. I'm flattered that you all got us to within striking distance of our funding goal on day 12! :D\nSo here are our current stretch goals:\n$650 DONE! (Jun 7) - Rosie Riveter - all backers at $12 and up will receive this 2nd exclusive print\n$700 DONE! (Jun 12) - Captain America Tribute - all backers at $12 and up will receive this 3rd exclusive print \n$750 - Seize the Memes of Production! - All backers at $4 Digital Dandies will receive 1 exclusive print of the Laugh It Forward cover.\nI'm still not sure what else to offer for further stretch goals. There seems to have been some interest in magnets, stickers or buttons. If you have suggestions, let me know in the project updates! :D\nOur Story!\nHi, I'm Sam and I'm on a mission to tell everyone why laughter is a moral imperative!\nAlso, I tell DICK JOKES FOR JUSTICE!\nSeriously, that's my thing, comedy and activism. Some people call it laughtivism.\nI've created cartoons and comedy on Woohooligan since 2006, and more recently satirical blogs and roast-like webcomic reviews on Tumblr. Today I'm creating Woohooligan Vol 2: Laugh It Forward, a new 64-page, full-color book of my comedy and laughtivist cartoons for you to enjoy! The funds from this campaign will print both the new volume as well as reprinting copies of my first book, Woohooligan vol 1: Into Dorkness.\nIf you'd told me a few years ago that I would be making \"political comedy\", I'd have told you you were crazy! Despite being a big fan of the Daily Show and many spin-offs, I didn't want to be known as a \"political cartoonist\".\nOccasionally, something would stick in my craw until I had to make a cartoon about something like the mythical \"death panels\". After several years, I realized those cartoons I resisted making were often my most popular works.\nIt wasn't until after the election of President Spanky McBoneSpurs that I gave in and embraced social activism as part of my work. :P I still tell pop-culture and dick jokes, but I do it knowing that they're in service of a greater calling to make the world a better place.\n\"I love what you\u2019re doing... like Swift meets a calm Bill Hicks, you use your comedy to expose the animal trappings of human nature. Ego, fear, ignorance, etc... You have a unique voice and perspective.\" - Eric Hailey\nOn just about any issue, the odds are you and I have some common ground, and I probably advocate for something you support, whether that's racial or gender equity, GLBT rights, common sense gun laws, or economic justice. And I love hearing from you and working with you on new laughtivist projects! :D\nIf you'd like to see more of my work before you back, get a copy of my first book with bonus comics when you subscribe to our newsletter here. If you decide it's not your thing, you can unsubscribe any time.\nWhy Kickstarter\nTo spread our message of hope and hilarity in a more practical sense, this Kickstarter will fund my second trade paperback, Woohooligan Vol. 2: Laugh It Forward!\nWoohooligan Vol. 2, like the first volume, will be 64 full-color pages of mostly random comic strips -- some pop culture, some slice of life, some activist-oriented, like my strips on Black History Month or Trickle Down Economics.\nThe art is complete, previously published on our webcomic (or Patreon). All that remains is some pre-press cleanup and fulfillment. I'll finish the Kickstarter exclusive wallpaper and art prints in the first week after the campaign and expect 3-5 weeks to get the finished books back from the printer. So I expect to mail the books out to backers in late July.\nI'm also getting a ton of advice from seasoned Kickstarter creators like Tyler James and Russell Nohelty to make sure I can handle the fulfillment challenges.\nRewards\nIn addition to the books themselves, I'm also offering some other great rewards for your pledge, from art cards and custom comedy ringtones, to caricatures and custom comedy videos, all the way up to a party at your house or the opportunity to rename the book!\nShipping is free for anyone in the US, or backing at $20 or under, or backing at $80 or more.\nAt the higher levels, you can get me for a day! For $799, I'll fly to your house and party with you and your friends! I'll perform standup, make caricatures, whatever you want, it's your day! Too much? For $299, you can be a character in the book (or just put whatever you want on a full-page spread), or for $119 get a custom comedy video!\nBut if you can't afford very much, there are also awesome rewards at the lower levels. At the $1.00 level, you get the Woohooligan vol 2 ebook (or substitute one of the other books), for the same price you would normally pay, plus you get your name in the credits and an an exclusive desktop wallpaper!\nAlso, as part of the digital dandies rewards at the $4.00 level, you get all four of my ebooks at their regular price, plus your name in the credits, the exclusive desktop wallpaper, and we've arranged a PDF ebook copy of Wes Locher's Unit 44! This is the first of a four-issue series about two Area 51 agents scrambling to recover the top-secret contents of a storage locker that was accidentally auctioned off to rednecks. Reminiscent of Men In Black, it's a hilarious ride! :D It's described as the X-Files as a sitcom!\nNew to Kickstarter?\nIt's easy! Just pick your rewards on the right and enter your payment information. You'll only be charged if we meet our goal, and after the campaign ends. If we fail to meet out funding target, no money will be collected, and we'll talk about how we want to move forward, whether that's with a second campaign or some other way. Hellbent Hellbent\nWhere's the Money Going?\nMost of the campaign funds will go to printing and shipping. This campaign is a reboot of a much more ambitious campaign that included a third book that didn't attract much interest, so I've shelved it for a later campaign. I also removed from the goal funds I hoped to use to attend conventions this year, and to hire fulfillment help (I'll be shipping the books myself). If I have some extra for those things at the end, great, but they're no longer part of the fundraising goal.\nEach book costs $182.50 for a minimal print run of 25 copies. So dropping one book brings our printing cost down to $365. The hand-signed prints will cost about $10-30 (it depends how many backers get them), and Kickstarter will take about $60, leaving $145 for shipping, miscalculations, or emergencies. (Shipping costs for the 42 backers from the previous campaign came out to ~$60.)\nI'm confident the previous campaign gave me a clear understanding of what to expect, and I've fixed the many hilarious mistakes I made, like totally botching the campaign graphic. :P\nI'm sure this campaign will fund and then we can talk about unlocking some cool stretch goals! :D\n- Sam", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first time I've Kickstarted for a print volume that needs to be shipped, so I've done a lot of research on the fulfillment side of running a Kickstarter campaign and getting advice from people like Tyler James (Oxymoron, the Red Ten) and Russell Nohelty (Pixie Dust, Monsters and Other Scary Shit), so I think I have the bases covered. \n\nSome of the other non-book rewards for this Kickstarter may require a little creative thinking -- the party at your house for example. I'm convinced that with a little effort and my willingness to fly in the luggage compartment, we can work out the rough spots. ;)\n\nI'm also aware that there are sometimes declined cards and disputed charges on Kickstarter. In the unlikely worst-case scenario that the final amount is less than needed for printing and shipping, I'm sure we can figure out a way to cover the difference. I'll discuss options with backers obviously if it becomes an issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Funny Friend!", "descp": "Get the Woohooligan Vol 2 ebook at it's regular price, plus your name in the credits, and a Kickstarter exclusive desktop wallpaper!\nRemember to subscribe to our newsletter for updates and tell your friends!

Set over 5 issues with twists and turns worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster, the Saga of the Kittens follows the Pirate Kittens Zed, Jay and Tee.\nWill the kittens succeed in their attempt to prove they are worthy to call themselves Pirate Cats? Or will the evil Barracuda thwart their efforts and scupper the ship?\nThe Pirate Cats is based on my love of cats and pirates, it is the end of the beginning of a dream I've had for many years. However, more importantly, I'm not writing this comic for myself. It is being written for my family, friends and everyone who may lack a bit of confidence in their own ability or who are told they can't do what they love.\nIt is my aim through this comic, to show everyone that it's okay to be afraid of doing something new, of giving it a go. It's okay to be scared of making big decisions, being scared shows you how important it is to you.\nAnd it's okay to fail. \nYou just have to get back up and try again. And those feelings of pain are perfectly natural. All you need to do is when you try again, use those feelings to remind yourself of how important this is to you. Use those feelings to try harder with more passion and more heart and eventually, you will succeed.\nAnd that's what The Pirate Cats - Saga of the Kittens is all about.\nCaptain Horatio 'The Mouse' Hunter - Captain of The Retribution, one of the fastest ships in the world. Captain Horatio is steadfast and cautious as a Captain preferring to look after his crew rather than risk their lives.\nMacTavish - Horatio's right hand cat. MacTavish is the rock Horatio leans on when things get tough. Whilst being hard on the crew, MacTavish see's them as his family. Often the first to the bar and the last to leave, MacTavish likes nothing better than having a drink and a large plate of fish n chips.\nTee, Zed and Jay - The Tegan Sisters. AKA the Kittens. Growing up on the island of Ellyn in the town of Shaywynn, the Tegan sisters grew up around ships and boats of all shapes and sizes. As soon as they could walk the Kittens took to the sea determined to prove that they could not only talk the talk, but walk the walk and become famous pirates themselves.\nBarracuda - An evil pirate who takes pride in stealing and causing pain and suffering. His crew is full of the worst scum and villany this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina.\nComic is 100% complete\nReady to go to print with comic\nRewards designed and templated\nIssue 2  already written\n The Lounge Kittens with their stickers and a copy of the 10 page preview.\nHoratio 'The Mouse' Hunter \u201cI'm delighted this story is finally being published.

The country is on the verge of economic collapse and political revolution. Desperate to regain control, the CIA recruits Seattle DEA Agent Brendan Kruge to test an experimental mind control drug on unwitting Americans.\nCompelled by his sense of duty to his country, Brendan struggles to keep his life from falling apart as he tries to reconcile his personal beliefs with the security of the nation.\nThe story is loosely inspired by the true events of MKULTRA - a secret CIA project that took place during the cold war, where experimental drugs (like LSD) and mind control methods were tested on people without their knowledge.\nVariant cover by Caspar Wijngaard\nPREVIOUSLY IN NORTH BEND \nIn chapter one, Brendan Kruge, an undercover Seattle DEA agent, questions Andrew Park, a drug dealer, about an experimental drug stolen from a research lab.\nSam and Annie, chemists contracted by the CIA to synthesize drugs from exotic plants, run tests on their latest sample. During one test, Sam accidentally slices his hand open, causing the drug to spill into his bloodstream.\nThe U.S. is under siege by the Crusaders, a revolutionary communist party, who are steadily gaining popularity with the public.\nSam wanders the streets in a drug-fueled haze, and crosses paths with Fred, who sees an opportunity to take advantage of Sam's impaired state.\nBrendan is visited by CIA Officers Church and Holbrook, who want him to join a secret program to test an experimental mind control drug on unwitting citizens.\nCovers for #1 by Robert Carey and Tula Lotay\nCOMING UP NEXT IN NORTH BEND #2  \nHere you can check out a six page preview for North Bend #2.

Right now, all black and white artwork for #2 is complete.

The Kickstarter is for a print run of #2 (and #1!) of the mini-series. The comic is a perfect balance of 50's sci-fi, 80's action, and everyday life.\nThe first Kickstarter for Prospects #issue 1 was a Kickstarter staff pick and funded in just 100 hours.\nStory:  \nThe town of Ridgeville has been stuck in the middle of a 150-year-old battle between two mad scientists, and former colleagues, Edwin Grabowski and Victor Farsimov. Both claim to have figured out the secret of immortality and created armies of zombies and cyborgs using their respective methods. The scientists have waged a war for so long within the town that the townspeople now consider it an honor to be abducted by one of the mad scientists in their quest for glory. Anyone who shows any bit of potential, be it brains, brawn, or anything in between, will be captured by one of the scientists by the time they are 25 years old. \nOn the outside looking in is 30-year old Colin Bates, who isn\u2019t one of the prospects. He has been selected by no one, not by scientists, girls, or even friends. He spends most of his days watching TV in his basement where he avoids doing odd jobs for his Grandma and her friends. Everything changes when a notorious terrorist, intent on destroying both scientists, appears in Colin\u2019s basement begging Colin to take over his legacy. \nOn the inside looking out is 18-year old Andrew Russell. Andrew has it all, the brains, brawn, and looks to be whatever he wants: the ultimate 5 tool prospect. The problem is that the whole community wants him to be a soldier for one of the scientists, while he just wants a normal 18-year-old life. He has to deal with the pressure of the town, especially his mom, about every aspect of his day AND the thought that he can be abducted by one of the scientists at any moment.\nAccolades\nPreview\n            Meet the Team\nMax Majernik (Writer) @SnowballMax I currently reside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

She takes the fight to them, via her diplomatic sell out sister, and she fails.\nOr does she?\nWhat comes next is a wild ride of spacesuit noir that's my take on a 70s revenge flick with our wandering hero loose in space.\nThis comic is 100% made and completely ready to deliver.\nAlex Cormack is amazing. The world recently lost their mind over his work on SINK, with John Lees through ComixTribe, and his work on this comic is superb as he brings gristle and emotion to the page.\nHassan Otsmane-Elhaou letters with the style that's making him a stadium-filling favourite across all the continents.\nDan Hill edits his ass off to make this a better book. He is smart, has edited most of my other creator owned books, and his name is quickly becoming a signifier of sharp erudition.\nAnd I'm Ryan K Lindsay, and I've written what were hopefully some of your favourite indie miniseries of the past few years - BEAUTIFUL CANVAS with Sami Kivela at Black Mask, NEGATIVE SPACE with Owen Gieni at Dark Horse, and HEADSPACE with Eric Zawadzki at Monkeybrain/IDW.\nI have also previously run 5 successful comic Kickstarter campaigns, raising ~$20,000 across 3 years on this platform, I've yet to fail, and I always deliver. Sometimes I even over-deliver by rolling out unlocked rewards and stretch goals just because you're amazing.\nALL DIGITAL, ALL THE TIME\nThis campaign is an all-digital, all-singing, all-dancing affair. You can purchase the PDF of StSS here, there will be no print copies available as a basic tier [kinda, maybe].\nYou can get the PDF, as well as upsized PDFs, audio content, and we keep it simple like this because shipping books outta Australia is a logistical nightmare, and also because with a PDF we can make it as many extra pages as we want to. So this helps both me and you.\nAlthough, there are some actual 'irl rewards' on offer. You can buy original art, or annotated scripts, and a special Variant Cover Print Copy will be unlocked [see below for more details].\n~~~~~FIRST DAY BACKER PARTY~~~~~\nTo say thank you to everyone who already follows me, and came into the campaign early, which helps spread the word, I wanted to thank you all and reward you all, so here's the deal: all first day backers will get downloads at the end of that day for:\nOXYMORON: THE LOVELIEST NIGHTMARE #1 from Alex Cormack and John Lees\nHEADSPACE #1 from Eric Zawadzki and Ryan K Lindsay\nCHUM #1 from Sami Kivela and Ryan K Lindsay\n~~~~~~~PLEDGE LEVELS~~~~~~~\nHere's the important stuff, what can you get, and how much will it set you back. NOTE: all $s are set in Aussie $s [the USA $s convert to a small number].\n$2 StSS PDF Comic\nYou get the full 22 page comic PDF delivered straight to your inbox.\nThis level will receive some digital extras as we hit Stretch Goals.\n$4 StSS Deluxe PDF Comic\nYou get the full 22 page comic PDF backed up with pages and pages of extra material: back matter, essays, lists, process material, and the full script.

Tommy Gun Banshee is a new quarterly full-colour comic. With Issues #1 and #2 complete, that's 64 pages of comics we're ready to give you!\nMeet Nicky, aka, \"The Tommy Gun Banshee\", a semi-mythic figure of the Prohibition underworld. Some call him a monster, others call him crazy- but everyone's heard the story of the hit-man haunted by the ghost of a beautiful woman. But just what IS the Banshee? Is she the fever dream of a sick man, or something far more sinister? Nicky's gunning to find out- and it seems like the whole world is gunning for him.\n  Tommy Gun Banshee is a comic in the Roaring Twenties with all of the pulp fiction fixin's; wicked gangsters, wild adventures, and sinister supernatural action.\nWhat you'll get...\nEach issue of Tommy Gun Banshee features 32 pages of content, and printed on NEWSPRINT! That's right - just like the comics of the Golden and Silver Age, we've printed our book on newsprint paper. \nNot only is it aesthetically fitting, but it keeps the cost down... which allows us to produce more content for less money! It's a win-win all around!\nIssue #1\nFeaturing 3 stories in the Banshee-verse (Two fully colored stories, and a 5-page Black & White short!);\n\"The Grave of Patty Dooley\" - Two would-be grave robbers get more than they bargained for when they hunt for a corpse buried with several crates of bootleg whiskey...\n\"What the Doctor Ordered\" - The Tommy Gun Banshee's got a headache- and a crooked Doctor is the only one in town who can help...\n\"The Honorable Hunt\" - In the dead of winter, the Tommy Gun Banshee finds himself on the trail of an old bootlegger turned snitch- but it turns out this rat isn't ready to go out without a fight.\n\"The Grave of Patty Dooley\" from Tommy Gun Banshee #1\nIssue #2\nThis issue begins the serialized story of the Tommy Gun Banshee!\n\"A Tale of Two Speaks...\" - Just what IS the Banshee? After a long absence, Nicky's back in town to ask some tough questions about the spirit clinging to his heels. But when the heist of a speakeasy is pinned on him, he's got no choice but to fight his way out.\nAll this, PLUS, the FIRST ENCOUNTER between Nicky and the Banshee!\nIssue #2 Cover\nThe History...\nTommy Gun Banshee is the first book by Todd Sullivan, and Miike, of Blue Banshee Press, a brand new indie-comics publishing house from Toronto, Canada! Meeting in Ty Templeton\u2019s Comic Book Bootcamp, and then collaborating on the Toronto Comics Anthology, Todd and Miike found themselves gravitating towards old-timey stories of mobsters and pulp-fiction mayhem. The pair decided to collaborate on the first short story, \u201cWhat the Doctor Ordered\u201d, for the Toronto Comics Vol. 2 Kickstarter!\n'What the Doctor Ordered' (Toronto Comics Mini #1)\n After enough time spent kicking the idea around, the two decided 'Hey! This idea just won't go away. We need to do something with it', and thus, Blue Banshee Press was born! Under this name, we'll be producing the Tommy Gun Banshee series, and plenty of other indie comics.\nWhile we love TGB (and think you'll love it too!), we didn't want you to have to buy the 'pilot issue' and wait around for more. So while TGB is an ongoing series, Issue #1 is already complete with 3 short stories to introduce you to the Banshee-verse!\n\nIssue #1 Cover\nSo by supporting us now, you can get Issue #1 hot off the press. We'll send you a PDF copy of Issue #1 upon successful Kickstarter completion- and you can then expect both Issues #1 and #2 to arrive together in January 2018! It's our way of showing both our commitment to and confidence in this project.\n\nWhere your money goes...\nPrinting Costs\nExactly what it says on the tin! This covers the printing costs for Issues #2 completely. We've already printed Issue #1 on our own dime!\nCreator Costs\nIf you didn't already know, drawing and writing take a lot of time (surprise, surprise). And it doesn't stop there! We're constantly making content, promoting, planning - a lot of planning and sitting in coffee shops. Or sleeping in coffee shops. \nWe are a small but mighty team of three, and some of us are holding down multiple jobs just to play the game of life. This money would allow us to step away temporarily to make these comics and pay rent while staying fed/alive.

But luckily, this isn't our first time on KS - Miike has served as an editor, working on the Toronto Comics Vol. 1 & 2 Kickstarter's, as well as editing Hogtown Horror, a full-colour, horror comics anthology this past year. \n\nLuckily, we\u2019ve already taken the initiative to complete Tommy Gun Banshee #1. Backers can expect Issue #1 sent to them as a PDF right after the kickstarter's completion, with the physical copy shipped alongside Issue #2 in January. We\u2019ll be using the same printers for Issue #2, and we don\u2019t expect any significant delays regarding delivery of the second issue!\n\nThe real risk is the financial cost that we\u2019ve already shouldered. This Kickstarter is to help cover the printing cost, and to justify the time we've taken off other work to bring you the story!

Recent work includes DC's Prez and Marvel's Starbrand and Nightmask.\nCharles is from Canada, so we imagine he looks like one of those flappy-headed dudes from South Park. He has lettered books for Image, IDW and Top Shelf (among others) and is a founding member of Frozen Beach Studios. As far as we know, Charles has a normal-looking head.  \nBesides being a kick-ass artist, Emily has studied martial arts for over a decade, so she can literally kick your ass. She has worked as a colorist for Action Lab and Coverage, Inc., as well as PBOW and RED XMAS.\nKyle is a high school art teacher and indie comic creator whose work includes Parent/Guardian, The Brokener, and the forthcoming The Ark, all from his imprint, FROM BEYOND COMICS. A righteous dude, Kyle makes a mean beef jerky. \nRyan is a writer, artist, and alum of the The Comics Experience School. He successfully Kickstarted his debut comic, SUNMAKER, and contributed art to the ComixTribe column 'The Proving Grounds.'  He loves Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, ninjas, teens, mutants and turtles.\nTabor makes all our purty logos from his home in the future (AKA Australia). He's performed design and development work for countries on five continents, had photographs published in international travel magazines, and is the Creative Director of Print and Web at Tiny Robots.\nThe less said, the better. But she's really not so bad once you get to know her. Don't make eye contact, and just be glad the coffee isn't too hot.\nWhy?\nFrom ELF to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to \"The Hanakkuh Song\" to \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\"... the holiday special is a staple of nearly all media.\nOur goal is to create a perennial holiday classic, and we want you to be a part of it.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBecause you people are awesome!\nNothing lets you interact with readers the way Kickstarter does. It's like a month-long book tour where you get to meet a bunch of the coolest early adopters.\nWe already successfully Kickstarted two projects--RED XMAS #1 and the trade paperback of PBOW--so why wouldn't we come back for more?\nFair enough. Where will all the money go?\nPhoto: (c) Can Stock Photo / pressmaster\nFirst, we'll toss it in a bathtub and bathe in it, Scrooge McDuck-style. \nThen we'll:\nPay Kickstarter taxes and fees\nPay our artists a fair page rate\nPay for printing\nPay for shipping\nIf we're fortunate enough to raise more than our goal, we'll use what's left over to make more comics.\nHoo-ray! Win-win.\nStill not sure? \nWe know asking you to fork over your hard-earned money is a big deal. So we're gonna give you a big free preview. \nBut, first, we asked one of Santa's elves to tell you more about the story:\nPLAY\n\nBack? Great. Thanks for watching.\nIf you're a fan of PBOW - RED XMAS takes place in an alternate timeline and features cameos by Birdie, Bristol, Leslie and the gang. Plus, FRIEDA: HARDBOILED AND OVER EASY drops some hints about future PBOW storylines. You definitely won't wanna miss that!\nLove DEADSKINS!? Cataract Jack and his wife Sylvia are back in FRIEDA: HARDBOILED AND OVER EASY. An' if you've ever wanted to see a waitress sucker-punch a donkey... well, that'd be spoiling things. \nBut you know what? The story itself is the star. \nHere's a five page preview:\n        An' if you still need more convincing, or just want some free comics, click the obnoxious yellow button below:\n        In addition to the book, we're offering some cool rewards.\nHere are a few we want to point out:\nThe Tee Shirt\nClassic cut t-shirt, 100% cotton (heather gray is 95% cotton/5% viscose). Lovingly fulfilled by Spreadshirt, so you know it's great. \n  Available in all sizes in black, white or gray. \nShow Frieda your love, Frequent Frier.\n The Song(s)\nBack in the '70s, Frieda worked as a, um... street performer in Tijuana (you'll read more about that in our back-up feature, FRIEDA: HARDBOILED AND OVER EASY).\nHer act was so popular, it became the subject of a hit song that spent one whole week atop the Mexican pop charts in 1974--before it was pulled from radio for \"gross indecency.\"\nWell... it took a lot of back and forth, and more than a few pesos changing hands, but we are thrilled to announce that we've bought back the rights to \"Yellow Ribbon Frieda\" from the Mexican Michael Jackson himself, Miguel Juanson. \nYou can own the song on mp3, or enjoy it the way it was originally presented, as a 7'' square record. \nHave a listen:\nPLAY\n\nWant Miguel Juanson to write a song about YOU? \nHe's open to commissions! \nJust choose THE SONG ABOUT YOU, and he'll not only write and record an ode to you (or the subject of your choosing), he'll send it as an mp3 and a one-of-a-kind 7'' square record.\nThe Letters Page\nEveryone knows that the secret weapon of comics is the letters page.\nThat's where fans of a title used to get together and interact with creators before the advent of the internet.\nA good letters page is a beautiful beast that takes on a life of its own-- it's part of the magic only comics can create.\nWe still love the idea, and the better creator-owned comics out there today (Saga, Copperhead, and Sex Criminals, to name a few) include a letters page with their individual issues.\nWe decided to give this old concept a new spin...\nEvery two weeks, Frieda publishes an online letter column via email called \"Order Up.\" \nShe chats with fans, gives away free comics, and offers up sneak peeks of our works in progress. \n(You can get in on the action--and get free comics-- by joining a thousand or so Frequent Friers over at friedcomics.com/free). \nFor RED XMAS: O HOLY CRAP! we're bringing the column to print. Your letters can be immortalized for all time, right next to Frieda's snarky replies. \nSend your love/hate mail to frieda@friedcomics.com.\nThe Back-up Story\nReaders of our online letter column have fallen for Frieda. \nOne of them, Lyn Collie, wrote to request that our not-so-loveable waitress be given her very own short story. We opened it up to the readers and asked if anyone else wanted to see such a monstrosity. \nMany, many people wrote in to say, \"Make Mine Frieda!\"\nSo, we had a contest to name her story, and the winning entry came from Kyle Roberts, who suggested, \"Hardboiled and Over Easy.\"\nNow, Kyle's a fantastic artist in his own right, and we were thrilled when he offered to draw it. Our old friend Ryan Kroboth joined us on colors, and we couldn't be more excited to share the finished product.\nHere's a B&W preview of the first two pages:\n         The Producer's Club\nWe wanted to give our most dedicated fans a place to gather--a special booth if you will--so we created a Private Facebook group where we regularly share behind the scenes stuff, such as sneak peeks, scripts, and process stuff. \nIn addition to info about all aspects of comic creation, Clay regularly shares story analyses of various books, movies, and comics (he's a nerd like that).\nSo far, we've examined the structure for the movie and the novel of JURASSIC PARK, the Dreamworks animated feature TROLLS, and the seminal comic book mini-series, BATMAN: YEAR ONE--which we dissected on both an issue-by-issue basis as well as the story overall.\nIf you like this sort of thing, or even want to vote on some creative decisions and help chart the future of FRIED, join us, won't you?\nHere's what some Producer's Club members are saying:\n\"Clay\u2019s been breaking down Batman: Year One for us in his Producer\u2019s Club. It is amazing. I\u2019ve actually been trying to break down a story that I\u2019ve been writing for way too long, and Clay\u2019s breakdown of Batman has probably been one of the most helpful things to me in editing my story down--more than any book I\u2019ve ever gotten or any advice I\u2019ve read online.\"\n          - Ryan Kroboth, artist of SUNMAKER\n\"The Producers Club grants a peek behind the curtain of the creative process. You could probably find this information elsewhere by spending hours culling the internet, but why would you when you can get a hands on, one-on-one approach with Clay.\"\n          - John Edingfield II, writer/artist of RANCIDVILLE\nWanna check out some of the story analysis?\nCLICK HERE TO READ CLAY'S ANALYSIS OF BATMAN: YEAR ONE\nTo join the Producer's Club, add $15 to any tier and leave a comment that says \"Producer's Club\" to help us keep track.\n  Quit Stalling and Tell Me About The Perks!\nWe'll do you one better.\nWe'll show you.\n                                           The Add-On Menu:\nBuy a copy of the PBOW trade, and we'll combine shipping to get you a lower price. \nOr just get the digital trades of PBOW and DEADSKINS!\nSimply click \"Manage Pledge,\" then add the amount of your add-on item to the pledge level you've selected. (Yes, sorry, this involves math.)\n      Our Evil Plan:\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: 4 Weeks (Nov 1-Dec 1)  \nKickstarter Funds Released: ~Dec 14 \nDigital Rewards Released: early January\nBook Goes to Printer: ~January 15\nBook Printed and shipped to Fried Diner - 8-10 Weeks (~Mar 31) \n\"$#it happens\" buffer - 2 Weeks (~April 14) \nFrieda and our sweatshop workers (AKA Frieda's kids) pack and ship - (~April 14-April 30) \nExpected delivery to US backers - 2 Weeks (Early May) \nExpected delivery for International Backers - 4 Weeks (late May)\nThanks, Hon!\nWe're not asking for a million dollars.\nWe just want to give you some holiday cheer, put a cool book in your hand, and entertain you for a bit.\nSo find a pledge level you like and pre-order. We'll make more comics.\nAnd, as always, if you leave a comment on our Kickstarter page that says, \"Frieda sent me,\" we'll send you an extra-special gift.\nOh!

If you are looking for a comic for your kids this is not it.\nWe are back on Kickstarter after successfully funding and shipping REPLICATOR #1 (100% finished and printed coming in at a massive 32 pages)\nWe have 15 pages of REPLICATOR #2 left to complete, the goal of this Kickstarter is to fund and print these remaining pages.  It will be 22 pages with the potential of more if the project reaches the stretch goals.\nLink to preview\nhttps://goo.gl/RyfFm8\nor read the overview below.\nWhy Replicator?\nDepression and mental health are important to me. I have depression and I have written a long post about it in the about you section. I wrote Replicator because I was unable to relate to a lot of the mainstream superheroes with their \"do the right thing and everything will be ok\" mantra.\nI found as a teenager with depression that kind of thought process alienated me. It made me feel more isolated and that there must be something wrong with me because I would do the right thing and things wouldn't be ok.\nThis is not something you want a teenager going through. Life isn't like that, and pretending it's all sunshine and rainbows is counterproductive.\nI related more to the \"evil\" villains as they often had a compelling reason why they had to do what they had to do and a lot of them were mentally unstable. If I had known there were others like me then maybe I wouldn't have felt so alone.\nI also got frustrated that one of the superhero's biggest concerns was juggling their superhero life with their secret identity. People deal with much bigger issues.\nIn Replicator I want bullets to kill people, I want people that have unique powers and use them effectively I don't want to have superheroes to come back to life after being killed with no repercussions and I don't want to have stereotypical good guys and bad guys, I want you to decide who is good and bad and who is just doing what needs to be done.\n Who will love Replicator? \nFans of sci-fi comics \nFans of post-apocalyptic comics\nPeople that love futuristic technology and Mechs\nPeople that love superpowers \nFans of top quality art. \nPeople that can't relate to mainstream superhero's and want better powers and more original storylines.\n  REPLICATOR #2 - Page 11!\nWhat the critics are saying.\nComics anonymous\n https://comicsanonymous2015.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/a-comic-a-day-in-may-day-21-replicator-1/\nGrim in places as it needs to be an edge of your seat elsewhere, this first issue is the type of debut that shows the potential of both its creative team and the title itself and with it all ending on a cliffhanger it sets things up so that you are desperate to know when we\u2019ll see more. 9/10  \nRogues Portal-\nhttp://www.roguesportal.com/replicator-1-review/\nMy prediction is this series has the ability to be the next Saga in terms of success. Being sci-fi related has the chance to hold it back slightly but give it time to garner a cult following and give it the right marketing campaign and anything is possible. Let\u2019s wait and see what happens next.\n Outright Geekery-\nhttp://www.outrightgeekery.com/2017/07/09/indie-comic-smash-grab-replicator/\nIt\u2019s got a great blend of action, intrigue, and mystery to keep readers interested in what\u2019s happening here. This is one of those books that I keep saying you need to support, the kind that you find in Artist Alley at a convention that shows off the passion and love of the industry. \nFellowship of the Geek-\nhttp://opinions.thefellowshipofthegeeks.net/2017/06/a-review-replicator-1.html\nLike many great thrillers, this book lays down the tension on the personal scale and on the large citywide level and then cranks it on for good measure. Go check it out.\nREPLICATOR #2 Page 8-9!\n  So where is all the money going?\nBook Production: $4645\nPrinting: $502\nShipping: $500\nKs Fee's: $375\nPrints and Cards: $300\nTotal: $6322\nThe total cost of making this Issue is more than 6k However I am only asking for $3750 which is what it will take to finish the comic, If i'm not prepared to invest my own money in the project I can't expect you to.\nThe Art Team\nThe art quality of Replicator is gorgeous, beautifully disturbing at times haunting and harrowing. It's one thing I wont compromise on. Being successful on Kickstarter allows me to work with some incredible artists from all over the world- England, Scotland, USA, Bosnia and Herzegovina Philippines and Australia and that's not including the artists that have done character and concept sketches.\nOne thing of Note the people that work on the covers are the same people that work on the internals. I'm not bringing in some superstar to wow you and then reduce the quality inside.

You are not paying for bags, boards, packaging materials or my time. \nShipping can get expensive and I want to make it as cheap as physically possible. I buy things in bulk and make my own packaging to cut down on costs.\nI love packaging it's a weird thing to say but there is something about getting a package in the mail that is special.\nAll physical rewards are bagged and boarded and encased in cardboard and sealed with tape.\nBelow is an example of how it arrives I learned this method while working at Raygun comics in England to ensure that the comics arrive at the destination with the comics undamaged.\nNot Pretty- But Effective.\nThe edges are sealed with tape so no water can get inside and to ensure the gaps are firmly sealed closed.\nBelow is one of the wax sealed folders that comes with the rewards of $50 or above. You can also add it as an add-on to any physical level for $5.\nI decided to use manilla folders because it looks better and is thicker than the envelopes I had access to.\n  Sealed Folder with close up.\n    The available prints from the top left - Red Death, Green Cover, Ka-boom Monster and the River of Corpses-Printed on 300gsm.\n    The available Sketch Cards (A5) from the top left - Martin Griffiths, Michael Lee-Graham, Elena Vitagliano, Michael Lee-Graham Lee Sullivan Josh Suarez.\nThe Printed Comic, Prints and Sketch Cards.\n                                                     Draw me in- affectionately known as Harpoon Gary\n Incoming New Reward! Custom ONE OF A KIND Funko Pops. Get the Funko Pop Killer Himself \"Monster Ryker\"\n These are one of kind, Hand sculpted, Hand painted by me- Robert Arnold. Below we have Monster Ryker after he has dispatched Marty Mcfly. Ryker is sporting his tattered suit and tie which have been damaged by all the fights he has been in, along with his black monster arm. Finished off with some hauntingly beautiful green eyes.  \nTo Purchase a Monster Ryker simply add 130aud to any pledge level( this includes shipping to anywhere in the world) or select the reward level over on the right-hand side. There are a limited number of these available.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving done this once before and with a larger page count I'm confident in saying the only real risks are delays. If you back this project you will get your reward.\n\nWith the first issue there were delays and because of that, I upgraded everyone's pledge to the next tier from what they backed at my own cost.\n\nIt's important to me that people get their reward and feel that they got value for it.\nI'd just say now you have experience dealing with a larger project you are confident that there will be no delays, but if anything does happen you will keep in constant contact with backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "REPLICATOR #1 Big Barebones PDF", "descp": "Want to read the giant 32-page digital edition of REPLICATOR #1?

This full color 52 Page comic tells the story of Nathaniel Wicket who moves to a junkyard in an unfamiliar town with his estranged Uncle.  \nInstantly making new friends with Alice Martin and Shane Hines, the trio soon discovers a conspiracy within the greedy town council and a deeper mystery involving the Guardian of the city, Nathaniel's uncle, and his parents.  \nThis book explores the stereotypical roles we play in society, the bonds of family and the beauty of friendship. It is imaginative, funny, and is sure to engage the kid in all of us.\nWhy should you back Rancidville?\nIf you like mysteries you will love Rancidville.\nThere are over 50 Pages of Content\nIf you like mysteries solved by kids you will love Rancidville.\nIf you're a fan of Goonies or Scooby-Doo then guess what, you will love Rancidville\nIf you think the government is corrupt and wish someone could prove it (well I can't fix that) but you may still love Rancidville.\nYou will love Rancidville if you are looking for a fresh story that challenges the preconceived notions of appearances and how we judge others based on those things.\nA Sour Beginning is both Chapters 1 and 2 of Rancdiville making up the first part of a three act story.\nThe book is 100% Complete\nA Digital Deluxe PDF is included with every book. \nMeet the Creator\n John Edingfield II (comic artist factotum*)\nI have been a comic fan for 38 years. Ever since I was 8 years old spending my free time in a dingy used bookstore by a 7-eleven.\nI have always enjoyed telling stories and I love to draw pictures. Being an illustrator and a painter, I have held a number of creative professional positions over the years including drawing political cartoons for newspapers, graphic design work for a computer magazine and operating offset printing presses.\nI have spent a lifetime (it seems) raising children, which has given me a unique perspective to tell engaging stories that are safe for virtually all ages.\nI am currently working on Part Two of Rancidville as well as a number of other new projects. \n*literally \u201cdoes everything\u201d\nWho's it for?\nI would love the short answer to be EVERYBODY!\nBut that may be oversimplifying it.\n\nI have always wanted to create comics that could be enjoyed by everyone. \nHowever, some of the themes in Rancidville may be too complex for younger readers. Although it could be read to children as young as 5 years old, the ideal audience is 8 years old and up.\nWhy Kickstarter and What Will the Funds Be Used For?  \nI want to make high-quality books that are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf or when you slowly flip through the pages. \nIn order to have complete control over this process, (and because I do not have any incriminating photos of anyone in the publishing world) I have chosen to self-publish.\nThe funds raised from this Kickstarter will go toward an off-set print run of Rancidville: A Sour Beginning.\nPreview the Story\nYou can read the story so far online by going to Rancidville.com \nAnd if you go to Rancidville.com/citizen and become a citizen of the town of Rancidville you will get exclusive content and postings before anyone else sees them.\n                     >>>Click here to get a black and white Preview<<<\nIf you dig what you see, I hope you'll choose to join the campaign and select one of the following rewards to help make Rancidville: A Sour Beginning a reality.\nPerks and Rewards\nThe Skinny on a Guarantee\nI want you to back my project with confidence.\nIf you're not 100% satisfied with your pledge, I'll do whatever it takes to resolve your issue.\nAnd, if that's not possible, simply return your reward and you'll be refunded your full pledge amount.\nHere's the Lowdown\n4 Weeks: Kickstarter Campaign runs from Sept 1 to Sept 30\n2 Weeks: Review Pledges and wait for Funds to Clear Oct 1 to Oct 15\n1 Day: Digital Rewards Released Oct 20\n1 Day: Send Files to the Printer Oct 23\n2 Weeks: Proofs reviewed Nov 6\n8 Weeks: Books Printed and Shipped Jan 2\n2 Weeks: Safety Buffer Jan 16, 2018\n2 Weeks: Fulfillment Jan 30\n1 Week: U.S. Backers should expect their rewards delivered Feb 9\n2 Weeks: International Backers should expect their rewards delivered Feb 16\nIt means a lot to me that you have taken the time to read through my campaign.

To protect what was left of their culture, the Sunmakers sealed themselves away from the doomed world. Now, their numbers have dwindled, and Tibhan, the last of the Sunmakers, must risk everything by returning to the desolate wastes to find fuel for the fire that preserves his people's essence.\nEven if the cost is great and unthinkable.\nThis is the first chapter of a three issue mini-series. \nSunmaker is for those who like their fantasy with dark undertones but don't always want apocalyptic scenario's that are gray and drab.\n     A fantasy story that takes place in a vivid apocalyptic world.\nStrong theme of legacy and what happens when your values challenge your morals.\nA story that features the struggle of realizing for something to thrive something else may have to be sacrificed.\n22 pages of full-color sequentials plus 6 pages of extras which include a pinup gallery. That's a whole 28 pages total!\n6.625 x 10.25 on 70lb gloss paper with a 85lb gloss cover.\n             \"When are you going to stop talking about making comics and actually make a comic?\"\nNot exactly the words you want to hear from your significant other, but for me they rang true and struck deep. They pushed me to take action.\nAnd then?\nI found the script for Sunmaker on an online editing column called The Proving Grounds, which is found on the ComixTribe website. I was captivated by the characters and the dialog, especially the villains catch phrase, \"All things return to the cold!\"\nI had to tell Liam how much I loved the script, which ended up kicking off Sunmaker coming to life. My hope is to capture as much energy and excitement that I felt the when I initially read the story and bringing that to each page.\nNow what?\nSunmaker is my first comic, and the thought of holding it in my hands...heck, the thought of anyone being able to hold it in their hands... is nothing short of empowering. I eagerly await the first time I get to open a box filled with comics that I helped create. It's a huge milestone.\nWith having printed books, the next big milestone will be the ability to attend cons. Being on the other side of the table and sharing a story I helped bring to life feels like one of the biggest joys of making comics.\nStories are meant to be shared.\n    \"After reading an early preview of Sunmaker, my only question is, 'When can I see issue 2?'\"\n          -James W. Powell, TEN31 Publishing\n \"Ryan Kroboth's art crackles with energy and style.\"  \n           - Clay Adams, Fried Comics\n \"Hayes and Kroboth pull off the difficult task of introducing a mysterious new world without spoon-feeding the audience. They build to a revelation that has me yearning to know more, and a climax that leaves me fearing what will come next.\"\n          - Kevin Joseph, Kechal Comics\n    Don't worry, I got you covered! Here is the first scene.\n                                         The book is 100% complete! The only thing left to do is print, and that is why we are coming to Kickstarter.\nWe are looking to fund an offset print run of 2,000 books through KrakenPrint that Liam and I will split for product to sell at conventions and other channels.\n     Most of the funds raised in the campaign will go towards printing costs. Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top of the campaign, with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.\n      Boom?\n         If this hasn't been enough and you still want to see more, then how does an 11 page full-color preview sound?\nShow me more!\n                                            I love comics. The larger majority of books I get are from creators themselves, so I appreciate when someone takes that little something extra to be sure that my package gets there in excellent shape.\nHere is a look at the packaging mock-ups you can expect to receive your reward in.\n    For tiers that include the physical book, sketch-in, and aluminum prints this is what your shipment will look like. All comics are bagged and boarded, then packed inside a rigid cardboard envelope.\nOriginal art mock-up packaging looks like this:\n  The comic is still protected inside of a bag with a board. Aluminum prints have their own bag to protect them from being scratched. The original art will be placed inside a rigid plastic protector, then inserted into a priority mail box to make the package even more rigid. Finally, that box will be placed into a large bubble mailer to protect your reward even further.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\n  That's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment with a book that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\n   The campaign will run throughout September. Since KrakenPrint does all their offset printing overseas, there is approximately a two month wait for books to arrive. Books are expected about the middle of January, and will ship immediately upon arrival.\nBackers should expect to receive their rewards by February.\n             A big, blue caption box can't express nearly how grateful I am for allowing me to share my project with you. Thank you for your time and attention.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Sunmaker to life.

Any additional funds will go directly into the production of issue #5.\nSkies of Fire takes place in the Aquilan Empire, a kingdom where airship travel has become the dominant means of transportation, commerce, and war. In the center of the Empire lies a monstrous, never-ending storm called The Expanse.\nIn Issue One, the raider Delmonte orchestrates a surprise attack on the key trade outpost, Port Prince.\n His actions prompt Royal Guard Captain Helen Pierce to volunteer for an expedition to bring him to justice.\n In Issue Two, Captain Pierce enlists the help of the elusive William.\nIssue Three follows the pair as they continue assembling the rest of the crew for their mission in the bordertown of Copperhead.\nIn Issue Four, the crew of the Zephyr comes together as the mission takes flight. \nVincenzo Ferriero and Ray Chou have been creating stories together since 2008. They met in college and continue to collaborate despite being 5,437 miles apart\nPablo Peppino is a an illustrator from Argentina with a focus on sequential art.

He currently occupies his time coloring various projects, including Mythopoeia's Skies of Fire and Glow, Aftershock's InSexts, and Boom!'s Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army.   \nZakk Saam is a comic letterer from Detroit, Michigan who works for And World Design on properties like Star Trek, Frozen, Finding Dory, and more. When not slaving away behind a computer screen he manages an adult hockey program in the Detroit area.\nJosephe Vandel is a German cartographer and graphic designer with a love for RPGs and creating fictional worlds.\nDimitris Martinos is a comic artist/illustrator that grew up in Athens, Greece. He\u2019s been addicted to drawing black and white stories since discovering WW2 combat comics as a kid. The influence of the period and the style still stays with him today on projects like Modiphius' Achtung! Cthulu. He\u2019s also worked with Delcourt as a comic colorist. Before turning to art, Dimitris had been studying Pharmacy. When he's not holding a pen he likes playing guitar or going outdoors for cycling.\nIn addition to the print run, a portion of this Kickstarter's fundraising goal will be used to fund the production of the issue:\nSkies of Fire is printed in a beautiful 8x11\" oversized format that showcases the incredible talent of our artists. The size harkens to a European aesthetic, reflecting the diverse background of the people working on the project.\nIn addition to the story, each issue contains a 3-4 page codex in the back of the book. The codex provides additional background and context to the world much like an old school video game manual or tabletop rulebook.\nShips of the World by Alex Bucur - part of the codex for issue two.\nThe Aquilan Calendar by Alex Bucur - part of the codex for issue three.\nIssue #4 contains 38 pages of interiors, along with four pages of new codex material, making it our largest single issue to date. \nVariant covers give us an opportunity to showcase and collaborate with talented artists.

One of my coping mechanisms was to come up with stories about confronting some of the things I was afraid of like corruption, inequality and the consequences of actions.\nCould these be your next comics?\nAfter gaining confidence, making steps towards stability in my life, I began to want to develop what I had daydreamed about for so long. I taught myself how to letter comics, and saved up money from gigs to pay Bernard Gita and Sean Callahan to work on a script I'd written. This comic is the result of my journey from struggling to leave my home, washing my hands up to 25 times a day, to attempting to live out a life long goal of creating stories.\"\n\n- Jamie Me\nWith your backing we can continue making Queen. Every back will help give us momentum towards reaching our goal!\nWhat is the comic about?\nEmily Green is a struggling politician. She is the second-in-command of the British government, but her personal life is falling apart, she doesn't believe in the political system anymore and she is preparing to quietly step down from her position after the upcoming General Election.\nHactivist group 'Nidus', known for releasing leaked documents to the general public, have greater plans for the Deputy Prime Minister.\nWhat the comic critics are saying about Queen.\nJump into the Queen universe that Graphic Policy's Brett Schenker, who works in politics, describes as \"about as authentic as you can get.\"\nWhy do we need Kickstarter?\nWe successfully crowdfunded issue one of Queen, and we sent out physical copies to our backers. What we have returned to Kickstarter for is to raise funds to finish colouring issue two, and to send the first two parts to print.\nBernard Gita's art will look even better in rich colours by Sean Callahan!\nYour back will:\n\nPay comic artists.\n\nAllow us to print both comics, the rewards and ship them to you.\nHelp us continue making Queen.

This time around, we plan to outsource this to a company who will efficiently handle, process and ship all the books for us. We began working with them in our last project, and they've provided an excellent service.\n\nThe files are at the printers, way ahead of time, and the printer's finger is poised, ready to smash the 'Start' button on the conveyor belt and get these rolling off the presses as soon as the campaign finishes. As a result, delays are very unlikely, unless the printers are attacked by sea-bandits. Unfortunately, as the printers are based in Cornwall, pirate attacks remain an inescapable possibility.\n\nEach country's postage has been calculated ahead of time to avoid any hiccups there. To the very pound, this is the cost to ship to our lovely but rather heavy book to each individual country. We've also decided only to ship to countries that we know handle the parcels well. We want this to arrive in the best possible condition. If we do not ship to certain countries, it is because we have faced difficulties with those destinations in the past. Well, not quite. I mean, we've never shipped to Antarctica, the reason why countries such as Antarctica, Andorra etc are missing is because we suspect we might not be able to deliver to these areas.\n\nThis is our third project now, so we consider ourselves pretty experienced with this stuff. After projects end, we take it upon ourselves to make sure that if any outstanding problems are resolved. You can always contact us for support.

Get your hands on MERAKI #1!  \n**A high-quality, full-color, limited-edition comic book**\nThe lands of Balen have turned dry, suffering from an extreme drought.\nDesperate for water Psi and her team are forced to travel to Jupinar.\nWhen the village Elder refuses to help and marauders attack, will Psi order her team to fight or let the village burn?\n        Created by mighty Gods, Balen teems with sea-creatures, dragons, and genetic-hybrids. Echoes of the Gods\u2019 own characteristics infuse the races of this land. The goddess Athena introduced genetically enhanced humans into this realm nearly two centuries ago. These second generation humans had to learn their place in this world or were soon parted from it.\n  The story follows our lesbian hero, Psi, as she travels through the barren lands of Balen desperate to reach the capital. \nBorn into the land of Wrathic Warriors, Psi ascended swiftly through the savage ranks. Her path forged in blood, she now commands the deadliest military team on Balen.\n                                                                                                                       Do you want a MERAKI keychain? Or a glow-in-the-dark MERAKI patch? What about a copy of MERAKI: Descent to the Underworld? Well, you're in luck! \nPlease follow the directions below to claim your Add-On:  \n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project's page.  \n2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).  \n3. Save your pledge. \n**Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.**  \nAt the end of the campaign, we will send you a survey so you can let us know which Add-On you selected.\n      I created MERAKI because we need more gay heroes! It is important to represent the LGBT+ community in fiction. My characters are gay, but that is only one part of them. Each and every single one of them has positive and negative traits that make them human. They are loyal, selfish, forgiving, and vengeful. It is my hope that the theme and characters resonate with all! After all, a good story is a good story! \nToday, more than ever, I think it is important for all people to come together and find strength in unity. If you believe the same, please take a moment and write Strength in Unity in the comment section of this Kickstarter! As a bonus, if you add the comment above along with a pledge of $7 or more, you'll be entered to win a limited variant comic from MERAKI: Descent to the Underworld!\n     Minh H\u1eb1ng creating the Variant cover for MERAKI #1\nMinh H\u1eb1ng creating MERAKI #1 page 12\n       A former Molecular Biologist turned comic book writer, letterer, web developer, graphic designer, and video editor. I\u2019ve worn many hats to create this book! \nThree years ago I had an opportunity to follow my dream of writing a comic, and so I began creating MERAKI. I grew up reading comic books in the late 90's, but there was always a little disconnect. They lacked characters that represented me. No one was gay. When I created MERAKI, it was important to have a diverse world with intelligent, brave and cunning female characters. I have learned a lot over the last three years about storytelling, and now I am excited to take the next step of funding my book! I hope you will join me on this journey and help bring MERAKI to life!\n  I studied fine art under celebrated Vietnamese artist Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00ecnh. In 2008 I graduated from Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s University of Architecture with a degree in Industrial Art. I quit my fashion design career to become a digital artist. This work has led me to MERAKI, and I'm really happy with my choice!\n  The greatest cost of creating MERAKI is the high quality artwork. I've already paid for six pages, concept artwork, shipping materials (labels, stay-flat shippers, boards & bags). As you can see, even with my out of pocket contribution, it's expensive to produce this comic and that's why I need your help!  \n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter campaign.

This Kickstarter campaign is also creating a complete teaching guide to be used with the comic, which provides a range of lessons and ideas suitable for use in the class or at home, as created by the writer who is also a teacher.\nThis full colour 22 page one-shot comic from the Australian partnership of artist Craig Bruyn and writer Ryan K Lindsay tells the story of Parker and Elliot [Ryan\u2019s children] who live in a lighthouse and have the duty of keeping the disgusting monsters in the dark away.\nWhen an attack during a blown globe results in Elliot being kidnapped, Parker must conquer his trepidation and travel out with his fearless stuffed frog companion, Williams, to mount a rescue mission to Ink Island.\nThe book is a personal study in how we overcome our worries, and how siblings rely on each other. It examines perceived gender roles, the power of inner strength, and the beauty of teamwork and partnership. It is also wildly imaginative and stupidly funny, so is sure to engage the children we know, and the ones we hide we still are.\nCraig Bryun\u2019s art in the comic is a phenomenal blend of the absurd and the amazing. Whether it\u2019s delivering an emotional beat through a child\u2019s face, or defining the pert yet hairy glutes of a dirty Inky monster, Craig can do it all with style, as he also colours all his own work here.\nCraig has spent years working on his own awesome creator owned comic, FROM ABOVE, and more recently he\u2019s shot to Instagram fame through his brilliant and infectiously fun pin ups and illustrations delivered daily to his 15k+ followers.\nThe creative team is ably rounded out by Ryan Ferrier who letters the comic with character and storytelling prowess which brings the whole package together.\nAs for me, I'm Ryan K Lindsay - I've previously run a great Kickstarter campaign for an all ages one shot titled EIR and co-created with Alfie Gallagher, as well as 3 massively successful campaigns for my DEER EDITOR series with Sami Kivel\u00e4. \nI've also written NEGATIVE SPACE @ Dark Horse [with Owen Gieni on art], BEAUTIFUL CANVAS @ Black Mask in June this year [with Sami Kivel\u00e4 and Triona Farrell on art/colours], HEADSPACE @ IDW/Monkeybrain [with Eric Zawadzki on art, joined by Sebastian Piriz, Marissa Lousie, and Dee Cunniffe on art/colours], CHUM @ ComixTribe [with Sami Kivel\u00e4 and Mark Dale on art/colours], and I am an alumni from the DC Writers Workshop [under the instruction of Scott Snyder].\nI am also a multi-award nominated teacher in the elementary system, with 14 years experience instructing young students, and teaching comics, which brings us to our next very important aspect of this campaign.\nLET\u2019S MAKE A COMIC TEACHING GUIDE! \ncover image not final\nTeaching comics is amazing. Kids love it, the teacher loves it, and the ability for educational growth through engagement of a rich text which is something new, and actual fun, is a glorious opportunity to behold. As such, I try my best to teach through comics whenever the opportunity arises.\nIt made sense that if I was writing an all ages comic, I\u2019d probably want to teach it in class. If I was teaching it, I\u2019d probably plan for it. So the idea of sharing a planning resources for teachers to use felt like the right idea. Underpinned by educational understanding of curriculum, engagement, and fun, this ~35 page PDF resource of 15 unique and in-depth lessons can be manipulated to fit most upper primary/elementary classes, and can also be used within by eager parents [like myself] who love to interrogate and discuss literature with their kids in the home.\nI went for a PDF for this resource because then it\u2019s instantly printable, it can be shown to classes via smart tvs/interactive whiteboards so it'll pop large in the front of the room, and it can be easily shared between colleagues [because teachers share, and rightfully so]. I'm happy for the resource to be handed around teaching teams, taken to new schools and districts.\nI've also assembled an All Ages Script PDF for the scripts that are child friendly so they can be shared in the classroom as examples of what goes on behind the page.\n1ST 48 HOUR BACKER REWARDS\nEvery backer in the first 48 hours will receive an extra free comic as I will send you a free PDF of FIND, a fantastic one-shot comic from Alex Cormack and Sam Read!\nALL DONE NOW, AND SENT OUT TO THOSE TO WHOM THIS APPLIES.\nPLEDGE LEVELS\nOkay, here\u2019s what to get, and what it\u2019ll set you back!

Share the love.\nMY FIRST TIME OFFERING PRINT COMICS\nAll of my previous Kickstarter campaigns have been for digital-only rewards and this is the first time I'm offering a print copy of the book.\nThe reason I didn't do it before is because postage from my convict rock down here is prohibitive to making a profit, or delivering a price that's fair. And I don't like overcharging my readers - you should pay what I would be willing to pay.\nThis is why in order to make the entire package more worthwhile for posting, we are including an A4 pin up print that Craig Bruyn has put together just for this campaign.\nPin Up Art with every comic bought\nWe'll be using Kraken Print to print and fulfil our book, and we're glad to have them on board.\nIn the end, the biggest question i always get is if the book will be available in print. This time, I'm offering it for those people who've been wanting it for so long and deserve a chance for me to offer it. Enjoy. \nPAGE SAMPLES\nPage 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 3\n  Page 4\n  Page 5\nMEET THE CREATORS\nCraig Bruyn - Artistic Demigod\nCraig likes to draw little pictures inside squares and rectangles and have words in balloons come out of them. He first cut his teeth seriously in comics with seven issues of his own series From Above (that he did both the art for, and more worrisomely the words) and then scored a break working on Skylanders for IDW. He is currently working on several new projects. He lives with his dog Oreo and exhibits questionable social skills.\nRyan K Lindsay - Lowly Writer\nRyan is an Australian writer who has written the EIR all ages one-shot he Kickstarted with Alfie Gallagher, the critically acclaimed NEGATIVE SPACE miniseries at Dark Horse with Owen Gieni on art, the upcoming BEAUTIFUL CANVAS from Black Mask with Sami Kivel\u00e4, the CHUM mini with Sami Kive\u00e4, and he also made HEADSPACE at Monkeybrain Comics/IDW with Eric Zawadzki + Sebastian Piriz/Marissa Louise/Dee Cunniffe on art. He wrote a short story for the Vertigo CMYK anthology and was blessed to see Tommy Lee Edwards illustrate it, his FATHERHOOD one-shot was once one of the top selling ComiXology Submit titles, and he once sold out to write a MY LITTLE PONY RAINBOW DASH one-shot.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe comic is complete, this is my 5th campaign, and I've yet to miss a beat.\nAnd Craig?

We just finished creating an original comic book, SPACE CASE! \nIt's a 36-page journey that's action-packed, heartwarming, and full of laughs. The first issue sets in motion an ongoing, all-ages adventure that will take you to the farthest ends of the universe! We're creating the comic book of our dreams and we want to get it into your hands... so YOU can be a part of our story!\n  The hero of our series is a young boy named Ronnie, a kid who grew up on Mars! He's the son of a butt-kicking, intergalactic space hero; a crusader for peace and justice in a treacherous universe. In our first issue, when Ronnie's mom is kidnapped by his father's greatest foe, an evil alien mastermind, it falls to Ronnie to become the hero and save the day!\nOver the course of our series, we will go to many new worlds, meet many different types of creatures (some friendly, some not), and ultimately see if Ronnie can live up to his father's storied legacy. With guidance from unlikely allies, like a strange robot named NAN0 (who you see on our cover), Ronnie must learn to adjust to his new, dangerous reality.\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise the necessary funds to print several hundred copies of issue #1. With the cost of printing so high, it is challenging to self-fund both the production and distribution of the book. With your help, we can handle the cost of printing and make our comic available at an affordable price in our online store, at conventions, and at select retailers. \nRonnie hopes to LAUNCH a successful kickstarter!\nWhile the bulk of our projected goal will go toward the printing cost, a small portion will also fund shipping costs, the Kickstarter fee, and our fantastic rewards. Any excess funds will go towards the making of issue #2, which we are illustrating at this very moment!\n  Drew Dorenfest (Writer/Creator) + Hazen Becker (Illustrator/Colorist) at Comic Con 2016!\nDrew Dorenfest (Writer/Creator) is a film editor in Los Angeles, CA. He edits movie trailers and commercials, which is fun and challenging! He's been a lifelong fan of comics and graphic novels, so creating Space Case from start to finish was truly a dream come true. This project marks the beginning of what he hopes to be a long-running series that continues to expand and develop into a vivid, imaginative universe.\nHazen Becker (Illustrator/Colorist) is multi-talented artist in San Diego, CA who designs for J!NX apparel. He\u2019s been into comic books for most of his existence, so he couldn\u2019t pass up the awesome opportunity to help bring one to life. Together with Drew, he\u2019s helping to create something special, which he hopes will inspire a new generation of artists and creatives alike.\nOh boy, we have some super cool rewards for our Kickstarter backers! \nWe truly appreciate any amount you can pledge. These rewards were designed with the goal of building a fanbase and getting our colorful comic brand out there. We hope you love what we have to offer!\n                      Sneak Peek: Page 1\n  Sneak Peek: Page 2\n  Sneak Peek: Page 3\n  Sneak Peek: Page 6\n                FACEBOOK // INSTAGRAM // TWITTER // TUMBLR", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNot a lot of risks and/or challenges if we reach our goal.

The problem is she can't die, because a higher power has special plans for her. Sam desperately wants to use the evil powers within her for good, but she is afraid of becoming the monster everyone believes she is.   \n\n\"...what I loved was that the audience is learning alongside Samantha. We don\u2019t know entirely what led to her creation or how she was able to survive...\" - @kleffnotes from The Nerdy Girl Express\nThe book is done and ready to go. The entire story has been drawn and colored. The only thing we are waiting on is the funding to go to print. So as soon as funding is achieved, we are off to the printers!\nAbout the physical book:  \nProject: Anti-Christ Graphic Novel  \nPages: 120 (approx)  \nBook Type: Trade Paperback  \nBook Size: 6.625 x 10.25 inches  \nInterior: Color pages, gloss  \nExclusives: Variant Kickstarter Only Cover by Mike Crome and colored by Ula Mos.\nAll pledges for print editions will get signed copies of the book.  \n   About the Book -    \nMany people fear the end of the world\u2014I personally am not one of them, but I have always been fascinated by it. Every religion, dating back even to Ancient Egypt and the Aztecs have some form of an End of Days story. It usually involves some sort of evil or darkness sweeping across the world, annihilating everything in its path. The most famous, modern day story, comes in the form of the Anti-Christ who will help to bring about the Rapture and fight a losing battle against the second coming of God. But in thinking about it, I wondered, what if the Anti-Christ was just a pawn in someone else\u2019s plans? What if the Anti-Christ actually wanted no part in this great battle or prophecy? Everyone thinks of the Anti-Christ as a being of pure evil. But what if the Anti-Christ was a good person who happens to have a crappy fate? So, the question I want to ask is this, can a good person be a monster? This is an idea I explore in my comic, Anti-Christ.   \n  Why Am I Doing This? - \nI am going to launch a Kickstarter in order to create Anti-Christ because all these evil ideas in my head need someplace to escape and if I don\u2019t let them out I will literally go insane.\nIt's all about following your dream. We've always wanted to create comics, and so we are. All of us have to pursue those dreams that we want to pursue, no matter what they are. It's the way we find happiness in our own lives. \nWho's Involved - \nWriter - James Mascia\nArtist/Colorist - Osiris Junior\nCover - Daniel Leister\nVariant Cover 1 - Mike Krome\nVariant Cover by Mike Krome and Ula Mos\n    Variant Cover Mini-Print by David Lima\n Rewards - \nNow, we have a great lineup of rewards for you. Everything from digital PDFs of the completed book to variant covers to me giving you a hand in writing your own comic script.\nWe also have some little extras planned as the campaign goes on. But those are hush hush now, so we can't talk about them yet. So, take a look below at some of the great rewards we have for you.\n          What the Funds Will be Used for - \nThe bulk of the funds raised for this Kickstarter will be used for printing and shipping. Of course, Kickstarter will be taking their fee out of what we raise. There will be some money used to cover the expenses of our artist fees, and whatever is left will be used to cover promotions and conventions to get the book out there and keep it in circulation. \nThanks for taking a look at our project. Take a look through all the rewards and pledge for the Kickstarter. Or if you can't do that, if you could at least share the project on your social networks, that would be excellent! Thanks again.

Desperate to regain control, the CIA recruits Seattle DEA Agent Brendan Kruge to test an experimental mind control drug on unwitting Americans.\nCompelled by his sense of duty to his country, Brendan struggles to keep his life from falling apart as he tries to reconcile his personal beliefs with the security of the nation.\nThe story is loosely inspired by the true events of MKULTRA - a secret CIA project that took place during the cold war, where experimental drugs (like LSD) and mind control methods were tested on people without their knowledge.\nVariant cover for North Bend #2 by Caspar Wijngaard\nPREVIOUSLY IN NORTH BEND\nIn chapter one, Brendan Kruge, an undercover Seattle DEA agent, questions Andrew Park, a drug dealer, about an experimental drug stolen from a research lab.\nSam and Annie, chemists contracted by the CIA to synthesize drugs from exotic plants, run tests on their latest sample. Sam accidentally slices his hand open, causing the drug to spill into his bloodstream.\nThe city is under constant disruption by the Crusaders, a revolutionary communist party, who are steadily gaining popularity with the public.\nSam wanders the streets in a drug-fueled haze, meeting Fred, a homeless person. Taking note of Sam's impaired state, Fred easily convinces Sam to empty his bank account.\nAfter a visit by CIA Officers Church and Holbrook, Brendan agrees to join a secret program to test an experimental mind control drug on unwitting citizens.\n  Covers for #1 by Robert Carey and Tula Lotay\nCOMING UP IN #2\nBelow we have a six page preview of North Bend #2. This is just a small look at what's to come in the next chapter, which comes in at 32 pages.\nPage 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 9\n  Page 10\n  Page 14\n  Page 23\nCHARACTERS\nHere's a few of the characters we've met so far. More will follow, including cops, criminals, victims, and everything in between.\nTHE TEAM\nRyan Ellsworth (writer), Robert Carey (illustrator), Jason Wordie (colorist), and Thomas Mauer (letterer)\nRyan Ellsworth - Ryan currently lives in Utah, where he got a degree in animation from UVU. He loves visual storytelling, from animation, to screenwriting, to comics. He also enjoys writing about himself in the third person. It's the best. Oh, hey. Yep. This is me. I'm writing this. Right now.\nRobert Carey - Rob is an illustrator from Dublin, Ireland and co-founder of indie label Lightning Strike. He's known for The Phantom: Scarlet Sapphire, Power Rangers: Aftershock, Ness, and was recently chosen as a winner in the 2017 Mark Millar talent search.\nJason Wordie - Jason is a colorist and illustrator from Canada and has worked on a variety of cool projects. He is currently the colorist on the perpetually sold-out God Country from Image. Past projects include Turncoat, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and Johnny Red.\nThomas Mauer - Over the past few years, Thomas has worked as a letterer and designer for a wide variety of publishers including Dark Horse, Image, Oni Press, and Black Mask. He has been involved in a number of Harvey and Eisner Award nominated and winning titles, and his current lettering credits include 4 Kids Walk Into a Bank, Copperhead, and Kid Savage as well as a host of other upcoming titles he can't talk about yet.\nWHERE THE MONEY GOES\nTo help fund chapter two, we are asking for $3,500, all of which goes to our super cool art team. Making North Bend is a bit more expensive than that, but if we can get that much out of the way, I can cover the rest.\nREWARDS\nIf you pledged for a physical item within the first 48 hours, you'll get a bonus art print of your choice.\nThere are 9 total art prints available -- all 4 comic covers (~7.25\" x 11\") as well as the 5 Benjamin Mackey designs.\n  6.5\" x 11\" art prints by Benjamin Mackey\n  These are also 6.5\" x 11\" art prints by Benjamin Mackey\nThe print copies of #1 turned out really nice and we plan on continuing the quality for #2. Art prints are printed on glossy, quality cardstock. Everything will be shipped in sturdy mailers, and comics will be bagged and boarded. \nShipping stuff inside sturdy stuff holders\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe North Bend #1 Kickstarter was my first project, and we saw a few months worth of delays. We now have a little more experience and have made some changes, which will hopefully get us a little closer to our release estimates.\n\nRob has finished his end and all black and white artwork for #2 is complete. Which means we are further along than we were during the last Kickstarter. That just leaves coloring and lettering left to go.\n\nI will continue to haunt your inbox occasionally with updates as things progress, but if you'd like to get in touch, feel free to message me, leave a comment, etc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ryan Ellsworth\n5 created \u00b7 29 backed\nHey, my name's Ryan Ellsworth.

His directorial debut, THE BOY SCOUT, was nominated for Best Short at the Golden Egg Film Festival in Los Angeles, and his feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU.

He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS, DOC OF THE DEAD, and THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PAUL THE PSYCHIC OCTOPUS. His most recent feature about the iconic shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s PSYCHO, titled 78/52, played to great success at Sundance and sold to IFC.

Recent work includes DC's Prez, Marvel's Starbrand and Nightmask, and our very own RED XMAS #1.\nTabor makes all our purty logos from his home in the future (AKA Australia). He's performed design and development work for countries on five continents, had photographs published in international travel magazines, and is the Creative Director of Print and Web at Tiny Robots.\nA total nerd and otaku, DJ met the gang at San Diego Comic-Con, which she has attended every year since she was 13. She has drawn sketch cards for Marvel and Upper Deck, and you can follow her on tumblr at darke-imp.tumblr.com.\nCharles is from Canada, so we imagine he looks like one of those flappy-headed dudes from South Park. He has lettered books for Image, IDW and Top Shelf (among others) and is a founding member of Frozen Beach Studios. As far as we know, Charles has a normal-looking head. \nBesides being a kick-ass artist, Emily has studied martial arts for over a decade, so she can literally kick your ass. She has worked as a colorist for Action Lab and Coverage, Inc., as well as PBOW and RED XMAS.\nThe less said, the better. But she's really not so bad once you get to know her.

So, what the %&*# are you Kickstarting?\nYep, this book is 100% complete. \nBut we've never collected it into an affordable trade paperback. And now we want to reward our readers with a print copy. \nMore than that, though, we thought there might be a new audience for it. \nWe dunno.

It's like a month-long book tour where you get to meet a bunch of fantastic people.\nWe successfully Kickstarted RED XMAS #1 on this platform, so why wouldn't we come back to the scene of the crime?\nOK... But where will all the money go?\nWe're not asking for a million dollars. \nNot asking for this. (Photo: (c) Can Stock Photo / pressmaster)\nWe paid all artists out of our own pockets. \nWe're not even looking to get paid back.\nWe only want enough money to fund a small print run as a reward to the loyal readers who like the book.\nOf course, a portion of our funds will go towards Kickstarter fees and taxes (on the project. Not, like, our personal stuff).\nAnd if we're fortunate enough to raise more than our goal, we'll make more comics. \nHoo-ray! Win-win.\nStill not sure? Download the first issue FREE.\nWe know asking you to fork over your hard-earned money is a big deal. So we're asking Frieda to fork over hers instead. \nYep. Ol' Frieda has generously agreed to buy you the first issues of PBOW, DEADSKINS!, and RED XMAS so you can be sure this comic is for you.\nThat's a $6.00 value, and a whole week's paycheck for Frieda. \nSee how excited she is?\n      CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD PBOW #1 + TWO BONUS COMICS\nOr click this obnoxiously bright button: \n                                                 Our evil plan:\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: 4 Weeks (March 28-April 28) \nDigital Rewards Released: early May\nKickstarter Funds Released: ~May 14\nBook Goes to Printer: ~Week of May 14\nBook Printed and shipped to Fried Diner - 8-10 Weeks (~July 31) \n\"$#it happens\" buffer - 2 Weeks (~July 31st-August 14) \nFrieda and our sweatshop workers (AKA Frieda's kids) personalize the books, pack and ship -  (~August 14-August 31) \nExpected delivery to US backers - 2 Weeks (Early September)\nExpected delivery for International Backers - 4 Weeks (late September) \nSo long, and thanks for all the fish!\nAgain, we're not asking for a million dollars. \nWe just want to put this book in the hands of anyone who wants a copy.\nSo find a pledge level you like and pre-order. We'll make more comics.\nAnd if you leave a comment on our Kickstarter page that says, \"Frieda sent me,\" we'll send you an extra-special gift.\nOh!
