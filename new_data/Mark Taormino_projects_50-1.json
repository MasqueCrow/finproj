These are one of a kind, and only one for each demon will be made.  See below for scroll details.\n BUCKSKIN SCROLLS NOW UNLOCKED!!! See below for description.  THESE ARE AN ADD ON OPTION. \n As of the creation of this campaign, the page count is well over 200 pages. \nBUCKSKIN SUMMONING SCROLLS ARE NOW UNLOCKED!\nPLEASE KEEP READING, ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED...\nPLAY\n\n\n\nI started gaming in the early 80's, and I'm pretty sure I started at a way too early age. By the time my friends and I got a handle on how to actually play the game of D&D, the Satanic Panic had hit.  And so like a lot of young players, into a box in the basement my books went, for fear that I might make a pact with the devil with just a simple roll of a D20.\nThe fan-art based books that I create are the types of tomes that I would have loved to have had as peripherals as a young player, and even now more than ever.  I want to create something that makes the game more immersive and cater to the individual player, such as the illustrated spellbooks that are almost at completion for the 8 schools of magic.  (Back issues can be found here -  PhilStoneIllustrations )\nWhich brings me to The Demonology of Lire Goest. \nArtistically, this grimoire is modeled after several books from the past, most notably, The Demonology of King James the 1st (who actually coined the term Demonology), The Grand Grimoire, and The Lesser Keys of Solomon.\nThere are 3 to 5 pages for each named demon or creature complete with stats from either 3.5 or 5e.  There is also a summoning spell and sigil should the Dungeon Master or player decide to make things more interesting during the game.  A personal grimoire is added at the back for your own inscriptions and conversions.\nLire Goest was evil to the point of insanity.  His personal recordings while travelling through the abyss have been recorded on the living skins of the residents of Eastbourne, only to be flayed off the carcass to be used as summoning scrolls for later use.  Lire Goest desired power and infamy.  This is the one and only recorded tome of his existence, his interplanar travels, and his diabolical magic.  It has been so extensive, that two volumes had to be created.\nWHAT IS THIS BOOK, AND WHY IS THERE NO PDF??????\nNo, there is no PDF version of this book.  It is not formatted as a quick reference piece.  It is a grimoire to haunt your bookshelf.  Although there are stats and what not for each summoned demon,  it is not like my spellbooks (which will always have a PDF) where one can pull up something on the fly.  No, I want you to be able to touch it, peruse it, experience it.  This is how I always wanted a Necromantic tome to be.  I want you to hold it, show it off.  I started these projects as immersive peripheral props to be the character that you play.  There are summoning circles, protection wards for those who are summoned, and one hell of a backstory to the most infamous necromancer who started this grimoire.  \nThe Demon List for Vol. 1\nAdaru, Alkilith, Armanite, Babau, Balor, Baphomet, Barlgura, Bebilith, Bulezau, Carnage, Charon, Chasme, Demogorgon, Demonthorn Mandrake, Destrachan, Draegloth, Draudnu, Dretch, Evistro, Fraz-urb'luu, Gadaacro, Glabrezu, Goristro, Graz'zt, Hezrou\n\nSUMMONING SCROLLS\nAt 5k I will unlock the ability to pledge for the one of a kind buckskin scrolls.  These are one of a kind and only ONE will be made by CaveGeekArt for each demon.\nAbout CaveGeekArt work:\n            Cave Geek Art creates unique, handmade artwork using ancient materials and techniques combined with pyrography. By burning designs into traditional brain-tanned buckskin, he sculpts the leather into a three-dimensional relief that brings the images to life! Any color added is done with natural pigments, applied with bone tools.\nScrolls:\nSize- The scrolls are roughly 11x17\u201d in size, but may vary depending on the specific design. Each is one-of-a-kind, and some may have additional pieces attached to them.\nWeight- Roughly 4oz\nTurnaround- Assuming all materials are on hand (quality buckskin can be difficult to acquire), a scroll can take many hours to create, and probably up to 2 weeks per scroll.\nPrice- Each scroll is a 450.00 pledge plus shipping.\nThe scrolls WILL NOT go into production until the money has been collected from Kickstarter. Regular updates will be given as scroll production is ongoing.\nPLAY\n\nAt 10k, we will unlock PRINTS of the scrolls.\nScroll prints are 11 x 17\nEach print is a 20.00 pledge plus shipping\nExample of scroll print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is not being funded\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hardcover Leatherette copy of the book", "descp": "Get a hardcover, leatherette bound, and foil stamped cover version of the Demonology Grimoire.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["138 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Enchantment spellbook is live and more!", "update_content": "The feedback through messages and comments for this book have been amazing, and for that I want to thank you all!

They can easily be adapted to most fantasy role-playing games, including the Advanced 2nd edition game, the Original game, the B/X or BECMI (\u201cBasic\u201d) games, old-school renaissance (OSR) role-playing systems, and most other FRPG game systems. All DGG products are designed to evoke the look and feel of the classic D&D modules of the early and mid-1980s. These adventures have minimal plots that allows you to easily fit them into any campaign world.\n\nBoth modules will be available in print and eBook PDF versions. The print versions feature the classic module format with stapled booklet and a removable two- or three-panel cardstock cover. The maps are printed in classic dungeon blue on cover's inside for that genuine old-school gaming feel. As with all DDG products, creating a module of quality production, artwork, and printing is the paramount goal of this project. \n\nYour support of this Kickstarter ensures the production of more fantastic classic-style adventures from Dungeoneers Guild Games in the future, and helps keep old-school dungeoneering alive and vibrant for years to come.\nRumors speak of a mysterious silver tower that shines like a polished mirror that has recently appeared out of thin air. Bizarre creatures believed to have emerged from the tower roam the land. The few learned sages that know of it suggest that the tower is really a dimension-hopping fortress. Possibly some adventurers could go to the tower to find out why it has come here?\n\nDD4 Secret of the Silver Spire is a 52-page module for characters levels 3 to 7. In this adventure, the player characters explore an outlandish citadel inhabited by strange creatures, such as the barzani ape-men, modrons of many types, and three-faced golden sentinels. The enigmatic overlords are the \"silver masters\" \u2014 alien beings  made of pure energy. The tower is a maze of rooms stuffed with strange equipment and curious items these creatures have collected from all over the multiverse.\n\nArtwork\nThe module contains eighteen original black-and-white illustrations by Ryan Jack Allred, Jonathan Bingham, Jeff Laubenstein, Bradley K. McDevitt, Stefan Poag, and Peter Saga. Russ Nicholson (of Fiend Folio fame) created the outstanding and colorful cover art featuring the Spire and its alien inhabitants.\n\nFeatures\nA 52-page saddle-stitched booklet printed in black-and-white.\nA removable, two-panel cardstock cover printed in color.\nEight level maps.\n153 numbered encounter areas, adventure background for the GM, and scenario hook suggestions.\nSix new monsters: barzani, flame harlequin, flying bloodworm, golden sentinel, silver master, and tselmoi.\nSixteen new magi-tech items.\n\nStefan Poag's illustration of some of the inhabitants of the Spire.\nSome rogue modrons undergoing \"reeducation\".

No one knows what exactly lies behind its mudbrick walls. Surely vast treasures fill its fresco-lined chambers, and doubtlessly terrible guardians keep the unworthy from claiming them.\n\nDDS1 The Sacred Temple of Erwadu is a 36-page module with a world-generic setting for characters levels 7 to 10. In this adventure, inspired by the mythology and culture of the ancient Sumerians, the players explore a ziggurat located in marshy river delta. The characters must survive the four deadly levels of the temple to escape its mudbrick walls. This adventure contains background notes, a cutaway map of the temple, five new monsters, and six variable endings. Additionally, this special module contains original thirteen illustrations to show the players. The referee can opt to play this module one of two ways \u2014 as a \u2018Living\u2019 or, \u2018Lost\u2019 temple.\n\nArtwork\nThe module contains twenty-two original black-and-white illustrations by Jonathan Bingham, Darlene (ex-TSR), Earl Geier, Jeff Laubenstein, Mark Lyons, and Frank Scacalossi.

All that is needed is a group of inquisitive adventurers to investigate the veracity of these claims. Foul sorcery, evil doings, and horrid beings from the blackest pits stand to thwart the meddlesome heroes. An adventure for characters levels 5-8.\n\nDD2: DUNGEONS OF THE DREAD WYRM: No one has seen the wicked red dragon, Felmurnuzza, ravager of the northlands, for decades. Some believe that she has perished, while others believe that she sleeps away the years ensconced in her fortress-like lair. Rumors suggest that over the centuries she has amassed a vast hoard of treasure that is second to none. Cunning traps, devious tricks, and powerful guardians defend the dragon\u2019s dungeons from would-be looters. This challenging adventure is for characters levels 10-15.\n\nDD3: THE MISTY HALLS OF KAL\u00c1VORKA: A lost vale located in a high mountain range is home to a clan of mysterious giants. Sages believe the giants have strange powers that no other of their kind possesses. Yet, no one has heard anything from these giants in decades. Do they still dwell in their misty fastness? Do they really possess these reputed powers, and if they do, what are they? Crafty giants, evil gnomes, and a weird guardian await any adventurers who go seeking the lost halls. An adventure for characters levels 5-7.\nDUNGEON DELVE SIDE QUEST 1: SHIPWRECK AT HAR\u2019S POINT: Nothing much usually happens in the sleepy fishing hamlet of Har\u2019s Point. Recently, however, a ship has crashed on the rocks outside of town. Now rumors concerning treasure it supposedly carried are running rife amongst the fisherfolk. Some of these rumors hint that dead sailors from the ship are now walking the nearby beaches at night. Even more concerning, a mysterious stranger has been spotted around town. A few inquisitive adventurers might be able to discover what exactly is going on in Har\u2019s Point. An adventure for characters levels 1-3.\nAbout the Project Designer\nMy name is R. Nelson Bailey. My start with playing role-playing games began with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in 1983 and has never stopped. For the last 18 years, I have run a weekly AD&D game with a group of dedicated players. As with many kids of the day, I dreamed of having TSR publish one of my modules. Now I am doing that with Dungeoneers Guild Games. DD4 Secret of the Silver Spire and DDS1 The Sacred Temple of Erwadu are part line of classic-style adventure modules. The fifth Dungeoneers Guild Games project will come out later in 2021.

Every other Monday night we got together at Garret's house and had a ball role-playing into the early hours of the morning.  After COVID, the group dispersed.  We tried to transition online but couldn\u2019t recreate the in-person magic.  Meanwhile, I was DMing a game for my family online.  It was a great way to spend time with my brother and cousins who live in another state, but the role-playing wasn't as engaging as Garret's in-person campaign.  So during this last year of social distancing I've thought a lot about using digital tools to create great role-playing experiences online.  This project implements ways to engage players online including beautiful battle maps, short videos and narrated box text.  \nELEMENTS OF A 5E NATIONAL PARK\nBelow are the elements of a 5E national park.  These come as a coherent pdf.  For example, there is a picture of the battle map that has \"room numbers\" overlaid on it. Then there is \"box text\" that describes those \"rooms\".  Finally, the box text has an embedded audio file so that when you click on it the pdf reads the box text.  \n\nAdditionally, all the digital files also come separate from the pdf so that you can easily upload the maps, monsters, video and audio into your favorite virtual table top or creatively incorporate them as separate elements into your in-person campaign.\nBattle Map\nA 40 x 30 battle map that is 162 pixels per square.  It comes in a simple sketch version (great for a player handout), detailed black and white version, full color gridded (square), full color gridded (hex) and full color ungridded (clean) versions.  \nPhotos \nFive real world photographs of the national park.  These photos are used by the cartographer and point of view artist to inspire their work.  Specific features from the photos are incorporated into the battle map.  For example, look at the dark crevices in the photograph of the cliff below (no, they are not caves in the real world).   These feature prominently on the battle map and in the point of view art.  In your campaign they might be caves!  The pictures are fun for general inspiration and as player handouts.   \nPoint of View Art\nThe point of view art corresponds to a specific location on the battle map.  It is drawn to represent the field of view of a character standing at that point.  \nMonsters\nEach monster comes with a picture, token, and 5E stat block.  The monsters may be 5E OGL or custom monsters. Regardless of origin, they fit thematically with the national park, and may be inspired by real world animals, such as the Dire Big Horn Sheep that TPK\u2019d my test party in the Badlands. \nVoice Acting\nThe box text from each national park is read by a professional voice actor.  DMs can click on the box text in the pdf to play the audio.  Each national park comes with 200 words of voice acting.  Click on \"Play\" below to check it out!\nPLAY\n\nMovie\nThe movie introduces the 5E national park.  It incorporates some of the voice acting, photography and potentially the point of view art.  It is one minute long. \nPLAY\n\nSHARD TABLETOP\nAll Rewards (minus the $1 fan & map only) come with the 5E National Park also delivered as a Shard Package.   This is in addition to the pdf and other digital files. \nSOCIAL GOALS\nThe 5E Inspired by The National Parks Facebook Group is this project's social media focal point.  Social goals are unlocked when people join the facebook group - so please join it and invite your friends who would enjoy this digital content to join it! \nIn the facebook group you can vote on which national parks should inspire this content, provide feedback on concept art and enjoy a fun community!\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$4,500:  Overland Map\nOne overland map for each park based on the real world topography and scaled to 1 hex = 1 mile.\n$6,000:  Battle Map\nAn additional Battle Map for every 5E National Park!  Along with the overland map, this second battle map allows each park to become a mini-adventure.\n$7,500:  Battle Map\nAn additional Battle Map for every 5E National Park!\n$9,000:  Additional National Park!\nThe base Park Package plus all unlocked social and stretch goals.\n$10,500:  GIFs!\nEach 5E National Park will include a monster GIF!  These are fun to play when a monster makes a critical hit or does its signature attack.  \nADD ONS", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that I am the driving force behind The Basement War Room.

Perhaps I should be saying this to my Kickstarters Anonymous group, but whatever.  We're here, we love games, let's do this!\nBefore I forget, here's my blog:  Venger's Old School Gaming Blog. \nSince creating Cha'alt and Cha'alt: Fuchsia Malaise (I'll put some review links in the FAQ area), I've been writing adventures for my eldritch, gonzo, science-fantasy, post-apocalyptic campaign setting.  Before releasing Book III in the trilogy (hopefully 2022), I want to get these short scenarios out there.\nAlso, I need to sell more luxury hardcovers of the first two books before embarking on the third.  A lot of my money is tied up in inventory. More on that later.\nBelow are some WIP maps I've drawn during my pandemic downtime...\nWhat kind of adventures are we talking about here?  Low to mid-level, sword & sorcery with lasers.  These will be 10-page one-shot scenarios that both expand the world and drill deeper into what makes a Venger Satanis adventure - weird, grindhouse, pop-culture, mash-up that's both humorous and deadly!\nIf that sounds like your cup of tea, please back this project.  And tell others - that's important.\nThe first adventure is titled Six Hours To Save Cha'alt.  It's about a meteor on a collision course with the planet.  Only the PCs can avert disaster.  They have to venture inside a sleeping spawn of an Old One in order to find the tech that can save Cha'alt.\nThe second adventure is about a man with a crazy scarf whose death leads the PCs to guarding the Federation President before their starship plummets into Sanz Egra'as - a maximum security prison zone on Cha'alt.  Yeah, that's going to be fun for the whole family!\nWe're talking eccentric NPCs, new monsters, awesome locations, weird artifacts, maps, artwork, strange and familiar ties to this campaign world (along with various other things I've written along the way... Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, Liberation of the Demon Slayer, Alpha Blue, Dead God Excavation, etc.), and your favorite - RANDOM TABLES.  It's going to be insane.\nI've got ideas for the third adventure (coming up with stuff has never been a problem for me), but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  This thing has to fund before we get into stretch goals...\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$2,000 - Two Adventures\n$3,000 - Three Adventures\n$4,000 - Four Adventures\n$5,000 - Five Adventures\n$6,000 - Six Adventures\n$7,000 - Seven Adventures [7 sweet-ass scenarios for $5?  Are you for serious?  That's better than the party's assassin murdering the party's bard before reaching the dungeon!]\nOk, you may be wondering why I'm selling more Cha'alt books when it's already sold out.  Last year, a friend of mine bought up 500 of the initial print run at a discount to both help me out (I was in debt) and sell them at a future date at a much higher price. \nHe's agreed to sell me back (for what he paid) as many Cha'alt hardcovers as I need to successfully fulfill this Kickstarter.  \nI know a lot of Cha'alt fans wish they could still get the first printing hardcover, so now you can!\nThe PDFs will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.

Complete list of announced Stretch Goals can be found below.\nAre you a gamemaster looking for a fun and challenging adventure to add to your ongoing campaign? Or maybe you just want a scenario you can run for your players that can be completed in one or two sessions? In either case, I have just what you want\u2026 Wyrmkeep Dungeons TZ3: The Forbidden Isle is a fantasy role-playing-game adventure module designed for a band of 4-8 5e DnD characters of 4th to 6th level.\nA renown rogue has stolen an heirloom from a powerful family and fled to a little-visited island. There he waits for news from those who have offered to fence the item. A party of adventurers is being sought to both hunt the criminal down before he can escape the island, and return the treasure to its rightful owners. Unfortunately, there are complications.\nThe Forbidden Isle is surrounded by foreboding magic, has some very strange geography, and is inhabited by dangerous creatures including the mysterious humanoids known as \"Icylanders.\" A final concern is that more than one group may be competing to win the bounty being offered! Can the adventurers beat the clock and their opponents?\nThe author of this module is Joe Pearce, who has been running and writing RPG adventures for over 20 years. This is his seventh fantasy RPG funding drive, the first six being the successfully funded and shipped Temple of the Dragon Kin, Befouled Maze of the Demi-Lich, The Beast Below, Raiders of the Cloud Castle, Curse of the Desert Outpost and Maps #1: Buildings, Castles and Dungeons. Joe is also a video game developer and writes a webcomic.\nAn abridged version of The Forbidden Isle was run at Gateway 2019, and all that is needed to complete the module is to fill-in a few additional encounters, write final monster stat blocks, and commission some more illustrations. I expect it should be available for delivery to backers by the late Summer 2020.\nThere are some of the artists that will appear in the module (based on availability): Jacob Blackmon, Brian Brinlee, Joshua LH Burnett , Ed Lacabanne, Mark Lyons, Brian McCranie, and Phil Stone\nThe module will have the following features as a base goal:\n20-24 pages in length\nOver two dozen encounter areas\n4 black & white interior illustrations\nColor cover artwork\nAt least one new monster available as Open Game Content\nMaps of the island and all significant locations\nAlthough written for 5th Edition, the module should be easily adaptable to other fantasy RPG systems!\n Once the base goal is reached, I would like to make The Forbidden Isle even better by adding more content! You must back at a $6 or above pledge level to receive Stretch Goal rewards.\nShe's falling for you!\n You can include additional items in your rewards by increasing your pledge total above the base for the tier you selected. Just include the additional amount(s) listed below.

If you would like to purchase a copy of the module, please visit http://wyrmkeep.com/dragonkin for production status and ordering information.\nThank you again backers!\nThe Project\nAre you a game master looking for an interesting and challenging adventure for your players that can be completed in one session? Well, I believe I have just what you want: Temple of the Dragon Kin is a mini-adventure module designed for a band of 5-8 5e DnD characters of 6th to 8th level.\nA party of stalwart adventurers is being sought by the learned sage, Gaspar Uberbellum. He wishes to hire the group to find and explore a lost temple dedicated to the veneration of dragons and their humanoid children, the dragon born. Within this temple is supposedly a powerful magic item that Gaspar covets: the Helm of the Dragon Lord.\nThe party will be paid handsomely for successfully locating, extracting, and returning the Helm to the sage. And unusual for agreements of this kind, the party\u2019s employer does not desire a cut of any other valuables discovered \u2014 the party can keep random loot they acquire along the way!\nSounds like a great deal! Simple really.\nWell, one should expect to encounter deadly traps, inscrutable puzzles, and powerful guardians along the way. Nothing a strong and resourceful group of adventurers can\u2019t overcome!\nAlthough they might want to worry about the dragons.\nThe Details\nThis project is a special All in 1 Kickstarter, which among other things means that the funding drive only has a duration of one week. Back it now because there is not much time for procrastination!\nThe author of the module is Joe Pearce, who has been running and writing RPG adventures for over 20 years. He is also a video game developer and writes a webcomic.\nThe module has a complete design and only needs expanded descriptions of the encounters, playtesting, and artwork for it to be finished. I expect it should be available for delivery to backers by May of this year (2017).\nThe module will have the following features:\n12-16 pages in length\n10-14 encounter areas\n4 original, to-be-commissioned, black & white illustrations\n2 new monsters available as Open Gaming Content\nMap of the Temple of the Dragon Kin\nAn adventurer encounters something shocking!\nRewards\nThis is a nice, short Kickstarter and has a corresponding small set of rewards.\n$3 / PDF Module: You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module.\n$10 / Printed Module: You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in both printed and PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module.\n$30 / Name an NPC: You will get the opportunity to name an NPC! (Name must be approved by Joe.) You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in printed and PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module. The reward has a limited number of backers!\n$100 / \u201cI Funded This\u201d: A singular backer will earn the right to claim they truly funded this Kickstarter -- you will be listed as Executive Producer in the main credits! You also get to add a message to one plot-significant item. (Message must be approved by Joe.) You receive two printed copies of Temple of the Dragon Kin (one signed by Joe if you wish) and a copy of the module in PDF format. The reward is limited to one backer!\nAdd-On\n$10 / Extra Printed Copy of Module: If you are backing at the Printed Module reward level or higher, you can purchase an additional copy of the module for $10. Just add this amount to your pledge. Joe will sign the extra copy too!\nStretch Goals\nOnce the base goal is reached, I would like to make Temple of the Dragon Kin even better by adding more content!\n$250: Splash of Color! The module gets a color illustration for the cover. UNLOCKED.\n$500: Bigger Is Better! A full-page illustration is added to the module. UNLOCKED.\n$1000: Invitation from the Past! You receive a facsimile of an invitation to join the secret society behind the Temple of the Dragon Kin, just like one that appears in the module! The document features a new piece of artwork and is provided as a printed letter (on parchment-like paper) for those backers receiving a printed copy of the module, while others receive a PDF of the letter. Show it to your players during the game for extra realism! LOCKED.\n$1500: To be revealed once previous stretch goal unlocked. The goal will include Kickstarter exclusive content! LOCKED.\nFinal Words\nThanks for your interest in this project. I hope you will become a backer and help make Temple of the Dragon Kin a reality for gamers to enjoy. Regardless if you can donate, please share a link to this project with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or any other forum that you think people would like the module.\nLink to this project: http://wyrmkeep.com/dragonkin\nOne final note: As a backer of Kickstarter projects myself, I have one request for you: even if you don\u2019t support this project, please find another project today and donate at least $1 to them. That way they will be excited, you will feel great, and it will help us further everyone's creative and artistic goals on this site.\n-- Joe Pearce", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project risks are pretty minimal for such a basic RPG module.

Incidentally, the main picture above is from a previous blue map of his.  \nThis one is going to be in the \"middle ground\" between standard dungeon and mega-dungeon.  Not too busy, but lots going on... and huge!  Each quadrant of this map will be created by Glynn so they can be printed out as one big map or used separately as 4 smaller maps (individual dropbox links will be provided for everything), arranged as you like.  And if this goes well, it's possible we'll immediately have bonus quadrants or giant maps available to us.  See stretch goals below.\nYou may have a reservation about using a map big enough for all the players to see what's going on.  Well, if it's a trade off, I suppose.  If the GM presents the entire map all at once, a fraction of the mystery is gone.  However, it saves everyone at the table the trouble of taking time out to map what the GM sees in his book.  I don't know about you, but my spur of the moment mapping sucks compared to what's in my module.  \nWhat about the secret stuff GM maps contain?  All that's being left out of the map... but not left out of the adventure!\nThe map will also come with a 5 - 7 page PDF.  This document will contain a brief history of the dungeon, as well as, various random tables for helping the GM spontaneously come up with content, description, rumors, factions, and encounters (including traps, monsters, NPCs, weird stuff, etc.) so that each adventure into the S'rulyan Vault can be unique.  \nThis map, in conjunction with the PDF, is perfect for sparking the imagination and fostering improvisation - something the O5R needs more of, in my opinion.  Although, there's nothing to stop a GM from creating his own room key ahead of time, either based on my notes and suggestions or as developed from his own imagination or published modules.\nWhen finished, the entire map can be printed out at 34\" x 44\" from your local copy/print shop without any loss in clarity, as Glynn is making it high-resolution 600dpi (similar to the Alpha Blue space station map). Although, the maps could just as easily be printed off yourself at 8.5\" x 11\".  The files will look just like the inside cover of a module from 1983... or (see stretch goals) like the example below, also by Glynn Seal.\nFor those curious, The S'rulyan Vault random tables will contain minimum gonzo and science-fantasy... but those aspects shall be present to some degree.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000  :::  If this project reaches $1,000, then the map files will not only be available in blue and white but a bloody, stained, and wrinkled extremely realistic parchment and black ink (see example above).\n$1,500 ::: I'm going to have James V West illustrate a custom-made fantasy RPG character sheet attached to the PDF.  Scroll down below for a sample of James' work.  It will be similar aesthetically to his \"demon idol\" character sheet... yet generic enough for compatibility with most O5R fantasy roleplaying games (such as Crimson Dragon Slayer).\n$2,000  :::   If the project reaches this mark, Glynn will create a whole set of additional four quadrants that can be used separately or together to form a second mega-map!  These new dropbox files will also be in blue/white and virtual parchment and black ink.\n$3,000  :::  If this project reaches $3,000 (tentacles crossed), then all files (including the corresponding PDF will be available to the entire world... for FREE!!!\n ________\nWhat else have I done?\nWell, as High Priest of Kort'thalis Publishing, I've created the following: Liberation of the Demon Slayer, The Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, Revelry in Torth, How to Game Master like a Fucking Boss, Crimson Dragon Slayer, The Outer Presence, Alpha Blue, and Girls Gone Rogue.\nClick on the DTRPG button below to see everything available for purchase (usually PDF and print).\nClick me!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt will take Glynn approximately 3 weeks to finish the map files and I should have the PDF finished by then, as well. \n\nThe completion date of \"July 2016\" is for the stretch goals and just in case one or both of us are delayed by illness or some other catastrophe (Dread Cthulhu forbid!)... however, as of today (4/19/16), it looks like everything will be done and in backers' hands by June 1st.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Gamma Turquoise Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Volume II is finally starting!", "update_content": "Yes, after an awful long wait...

Do you like the idea of mixing things up by confronting your players with villains none will expect? Is a fun and challenging encounter something your gaming friends will appreciate? Would you like to glean game-mastering knowledge from someone who has been running super-powered battles for decades?\nAh, I see you answered, \"YES PLEASE!\" Well then, you are ready for Heroic Havoc\u2122 #1: Instant Circus Is Going to Get You!\u2122\nThe circus has come to town, but it's not the kind anyone should attend! A troop of super-powered villains have been hired to put on a show as a cover to test a powerful new crowd-control agent. Unfortunately, the citizens of your fair city are the guineas pigs. Maybe they'll literally become guineas pigs -- you never know with foes like these!\nThe questions is, will this instant circus get you too?!\nHeroic Havoc #1: Instant Circus Is Going to Get You! is a scenario for 4-6 novice super-powered heroes. This 12-16 page module will include write-ups of the villains (with illustrations), maps of the encounter areas, introductory material to assist in getting the heroes to the site of the circus, and suggestions for follow-up adventures. There will even be a section explaining the motivations of the villains! (Hey, you may want some of them to show-up again to annoy and confound your players!)\nThe module will be written for D20 Hero system (the Open Game License version of Mutants and Masterminds) but can be easily adapted for ICON, FATE\u2122 or other game systems.\nThe number of pages in the module will increase as various stretch goals are achieved!\nThey are here to entertain -- mainly themselves!!\nThe heroes opponents include:\nMaster of Ceremonies - the charismatic and literal ringmaster of the group. He has light control powers with some technological augmentation.\nIvan the Strongman - a super-strong and resilient bruiser who like to wield a barbell as a weapon.\nThe Flying Winona - graceful and acrobatic, she is a experienced unarmed combatant with wind powers. Her trapeze act is partially a cheat as she can really fly!\nCalamity Clown - the leader of the clown henchmen. He is a devotee of chaos gods who, he says, have granted him powers both funny and fundamentally annoying.\nJorge - a former human cannonball, he now has the ability to being unnoticed. Which can be more dangerous then you might think!\nHello, all! My name is Joe Pearce, and I am a professional computer game designer and programmer. Although that is important information, it is not as critical as knowing that I have been creating and game-mastering original RPG adventures since the '80s!\nAlthough it is great to have friends who enjoy my games, once a scenario is run, that is the last that anyone sees of it-- until now. Via the power of Kickstarter, I can spread the fun to every GM and player who wants to get in on the action.

The Folio\u2019s goal is to insure that, and always give folks the very best quality \u2018lean and mean\u2019 adventures we can.\nSo my hope is this, that you will all share this project with others and help us create a continuing line that can be easily played and remembered fondly just like the modules of old.\nOld School 'wrap' removable cover design to double as DM Screen!\nMy Project: The Folio will be a bi-monthly [every two months] adventure module subscription that will hit on all genres of gaming using 5th Edition mechanics and expanding on them as we move from genre to genre.It will be produced as an 8x11\u201d, removable cover [11x17\" once removed], module with mostly b/w interior artwork and typically come in around thirty pages in length.\nWho\u2019s it for? ALL gamers, both new gamers and old gamers as it is easily expandable or playable as is.The concept is to allow gamers a starting point for adventure that can be modified to their liking while providing excellent reference content and frameworks.The base mechanic will be for 5th Edition, but I\u2019ve designed it to be readily modified to any fantasy game.\nWhat\u2019s in it? All original content.It has been written by Scott Taylor and Mark Timm, with incredible cover art from old school masters and interior artwork by skilled black and white illustrators Travis Hanson and Michael Wilson, and even a bit of Jim Holloway because I can never get enough Holloway.We are intent on providing what we refer to as neo-retro, a polished and modern design with creatively nostalgic content that transcends a particular age.All modules in The Folio series will contain 3-D maps, a Gazetteer, a monster section, a new monster unique to the setting, DM\u2019s notes and guides, and a full adventure.  And don't forget, for all you AotG readers out there, each Folio will come with an illustrated short story in PDF form to continue our tradition of fleshing out the Nameless Realm's world!\nIncredible interior artwork that comes in two stand alone booklets!\nWhy? Because I\u2019ve played and written about these games for more than thirty years at companies like TSR, Wizards of the Coast, White Wolf, and Privateer Press. After so many licensed projects, I feel it is time I put out something that is unique to my own creativity under my Art of the Genre brand. The corporate mentality and \u2018the man\u2019 often modify inspirations so fundamentally that the finished product is never what the author originally dreamed.In this case, The Folio is exactly the product I\u2019ve been looking to release for years.\nWhen? The initial module is complete, we only need to be funding so we can begin the full printing process.  This means that PDFs of the the first Folio will go out after the campaign wraps, and the physical copies should be to you no later than December! Also, concerning the later modules, we've already begun work on them, as you can see from the various previews of already secured cover artwork.\nI can\u2019t do this without you: Art of the Genre needs your help, that is why we are here.$15,000 is our goal.This covers the printing, shipping, design, writing, mapping, and the incredible story telling artwork we\u2019ll be using in these adventures.We have already devoted countless hours to seeing this product come together, but to make it \u2018real\u2019 and available to all players, we need your help.We believe in this dream, and we hope you do too!\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, it will allow us to begin production of the next adventure in the series, and our hope is to find enough support along the way to complete the entire six part campaign.Bottom line, our goal is to make a truly fantastic and age-defying piece of gaming history, each penny we receive goes toward that.This \u2018put everything into the product\u2019 mentality is why this Kickstarter is so think on \u2018rewards\u2019, as SWAG steals from everyone, the project, the product, and the backers.I firmly believe that backers want great product, not coins, bookmarks, post cards, prints, or T-shirts, and so this Kickstarter campaign is designed to put everything into The Folio to make sure everyone gets a product they will never forget and be proud to own.\nFull Campaign Modules featuring artwork by Daniel Horne, Jim Holloway, Jeff Laubenstein, Jeff Dee, and David Martin!\nCan this be easily played without using the 5th Edition mechanic? Yes, I\u2019ve gone to great lengths to set the story, the pacing, and the place, but I\u2019ve also separated the monsters into a bestiary so that ANY system \u2018monster book\u2019 may be employed with the proper use of monsters supplements to that system.The only other in depth change needed would be the dungeon master\u2019s understanding of the mechanics of invisibility, stealth, and traps.\n3-D mapping as well as standard hex maps!\nBacker Levels\nStretch Goals!\n*Trademark Disclaimer\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"3E\" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

The best parts of a bad decade.\nSpirit of 77 is an over-the-top, pedal-to-the-metal, nitro-burning, action adventure role playing game about an alternate history 1977. Richard Nixon has made a deal with aliens, and is still in the White House; renegade rock gods from another galaxy have shared with us the power of Glam; kung-fu bad-asses wander the city streets righting wrongs, and everyone is trying to stick it to The Man.\nSpirit of 77 is about recreating all the classic action and adventure TV shows, movies, and comic books of the 1970's. It draws inspiration from movies like Shaft, Smokey and the Bandit, The Warriors, Barbarella, Rocky, and Enter the Dragon; TV shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Rockford Files, and Charlie's Angels; and music like James Brown, KISS, David Bowie, Jerry Reed, and Isaac Hayes. \nPowered by the Apocalypse\nSpirit of 77 uses the Apocalypse World engine created by D. Vincent Baker, like a classic hot-rod we've made a number of modifications to amp up the horsepower. The basic mechanics consist of rolling two six sided dice adding a modifier and then narrating the success or failure.\nEasy to pick up for novice role players, and with plenty of options for the experienced, the rules of Spirit of 77 are geared towards encouraging over-the-top, pedal-to-the-metal action. You know the type: leaping cars, swinging from rooftops, blowing up tanker trucks, and punching bigfoot right in his hairy face.\nLook at him, he's totally asking for it.\nStory, Role, and Buzz\nCharacters in Spirit of 77 are made up of three basic components: Story, Role, and Buzz.\nYour Story describes where you're from. It's the source of your abilities. Stories can include things like being a War Vet, a Former Badge, or having a touch of the Glam.\nYour Role describes what you do. It covers how you interact with the world around you. Roles include things like hard hitting Tough Guys, funky Rockers, and fast driving Good Old Boys. \nYour Buzz describes your motivation. It's why you're out fighting the good fight. Buzz includes things like seeking Vengeance, looking for Love, or just being out for the Thrills\nThis system lets you describe nearly every classic character from 70's cinema and TV, such as:\nBilly Jack is a Tough Guy and Former Vet, looking for Peace of Mind.\nFoxy Brown is a Vigilante who's One Bad Mother, looking for Payback.\nThe Baseball Furies are Boppers with Glam, looking for Respect.\nJim Rockford is a Sleuth who's an Ex-Con, looking for Cold, Hard Cash.\nThe Bandit is a Good Old Boy with Humble Beginnings, looking for Fame and Glory.\nMock ups of the Core Book and the Expansion - Subject to change.\nThe Core Book and the Expansion\nThis Kickstarter is to fund the printing of our core rulebook and first expansion.\nThe Core book will be a digest sized (6in x 9in) softcover, 250-300 pages, with full color cover and black and white interiors.  The Core book will cover everything you need to play the game, rules, character creation, and setting information. Post Kickstarter the core book will retail for $30.\nThe Expansion (final name to be determined) will be a digest sized (6in x 9in) softcover, approximately 120 pages, with full color cover and black and white interiors.  The Expansion will include additional character stories, character roles, custom moves, and three complete adventures. Post Kickstarter the expansion book will retail for $20.\nStill not convinced?

Fortunately, between us, we've got a lot of experience delivering professional projects, and we've got a lot of friends who have experience with successful Kickstarters who've offered their help and advice. We've left ourselves reasonable margins of error in our budget, and have planned out every detail possible.\n\nCompletion - The writing for the core book is finished and ready to go to our editor. The expansion book is currently being written. Additional stretch goals will require additional writing. We're confident that we'll be able to complete all of these by our shipping date.\n\nShipping - Shipping prices have skyrocketed in the last few years. While we have a good idea as to how much it'll cost in the near future, there's always a chance that things will change drastically. To account for any unforeseen price changes, we have intentionally over-estimated our shipping costs.\n\nCommunication - We realize that post-funding communication to our backers is very important. We will be committing to providing bi-monthly updates both here on Kickstarter and through our social media presence (Facebook, Twitter).\n\nEvents Outside Our Control - Monkeyfun is a two-man operation. If one of us gets hit by a bus, the other will be able to carry on and complete the project (after seeking street vengeance against the bus). If both of us get hit by a bus, things might be in trouble, and this is why we only ever meet in secret locations at unannounced times under heavy guard.

This particular Kickstarter project is not the current funding drive for the game. Please visit the funding status page for up-to-date information!\nInherit the Earth\u2122 is a point-and-click adventure game and webcomic series set on a future Earth where humans have mysteriously disappeared and the dominate inhabitants are tribes of anthropomorphic animals or Morph, as they call themselves.\nThe primary hero of Inherit the Earth is Rif, a young Fox, who is a quick-witted, puzzle solver. Such skills come in handy as Rif tends to be thrust into dangerous missions involving righting wrongs and saving his friends.\nThe project being funded by this Kickstarter is Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows, a video game sequel to the original Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb. The game will be available for Windows, Mac, and other platforms.\nLike the original game, the sequel's story can be enjoyed by adults, teens and pre-teens. It will be an enchanting and thrilling adventure for all to enjoy, with subtleties and hidden depths that can be appreciated by older players.\nWhat's an Adventure Game? An adventure game is best described as a story-based puzzle-solving entertainment experience. The game\u2019s protagonist attempts to complete a series of goals by talking with characters encountered in different locations and using the clues learned to resolve problems blocking the path to success. In many situations this involves collecting items to trade or use.\nWhat about Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb? In the first game Rif the Fox is accused of stealing an ancient human relic, but is able to convince the authorities that he has the skills to find the actual thief of the Orb of Storms. Two guards are assigned to accompany Rif on his quest to ensure it is completed. There is the added incentive of rescuing his friend Rhene who is being held hostage by the Boar Tribe. Rif is eventually able to prove his innocence, but at the apparent loss of the Orb.\nA free trial version of the first game is available for desktop platforms. You can view a video of the game's intro below:\nInherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows takes place after both the original game and the webcomic story Little Wolf Lost. The Morph Tribes of the Known Lands continue their efforts to live with the loss of the Orb, which they used to predict the weather. There are rumors of the artifact\u2019s survival, but none are credible. Even Rif, who feels some regret in not being able to retrieve the Orb, discounts these rumors. The arrival of a chieftess\u2019 daughter, with a startling revelation, leads to Rif embarking on a new adventure to learn the truth \u2013 assuming he can avoid the doubts of friends, threats of foes, and the ravages of a great drought.\nYou can view a video of some scenes from the game prototype below.\nPLAY\n\nAs the developers on Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows know, funding an adventure game through the usual channels is extremely difficult at this time. Adventure games are not the type of game most big companies are looking to publish or even know how to market.\nThere is an alternate in the 21st Century: crowd-funding through Kickstarter gives a game like ours a chance to find its own players and supporters. Honestly, we would prefer this method of funding as it allows us the freedom to create the game we believe our segment of the gaming world is seeking.\nHelp us make this game a reality!\nAnd now what many of you have been waiting to know the answer to: \"What do I receive as a backer of this funding drive?\" The rewards you can receive are listed below and include such goodies as a copy of the game, a book of artwork, credit for your sponsorship, your avatar appearing in-game, and even a trip to the launch party.\nSome reward artwork may be preliminary or placeholders for final art.\nInherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows is being developed by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. and produced by a team of experienced professionals, including excellent artists, writers, voice actors, audio techs and programmers. Many of these individuals were involved in the creation of the original game. Key developers include:\nJoe Pearce - Designer, programmer, and company owner. Joe has been a professional game developer for 28 years with over 20 game and application titles to his credit. He was one the original designers of Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb and the primary force in making the sequel possible by acquiring the rights to the original game.\nEd Lacabanne - Artist. Ed was one of the background artists for the original game. He has worked on a dozen other projects including titles based on Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, and Fallout.\nJulie Butler- Artist. Julie Butler has been the illustrator for the Inherit the Earth webcomic for the last couple of years.\nAllison Hershey - Additional design. Allison, a designer and art director for the original game, has provided assistance in the design for the new game. She was also the first illustrator for the webcomic.\nWe expect development will take approximately nine months from the date the project is successfully funded. The game will be released in English plus other languages based on Stretch Goals met (see below).\nDifferent tribes of the Morph\nYou can stay in touch with the folks involved in this project through the following:\nOfficial Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows website\nThe Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. website\nOfficial Wyrmkeep Entertainment Twitter\nOfficial Inherit the Earth Facebook group\nInherit the Earth webcomic site\nInherit the Earth webcomic tumblr\nI hope you are ready to join us in the process of making a great sequel to a classic game.

WE DIDN'T REACH OUR GOAL, BUT IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS FILM GET MADE, AND IF YOU WANT TO HELP MAKE IT, GO TO http://cassavafilms.com/contact AND LET'S TALK!\nThis funny, fast-paced 2-minute animated pitch will give you a taste of this (live action) film's dark humor, and it lays out the first half of the story as well:\nWHAT IS THIS MOVIE?\nIt's a feature-length thriller - with black comedy and horror elements - about a smart young woman named Robin who accepts an under-the-table temporary position at a tech company in suburban California. She has just days to find out that the charming man who runs the company likes to hunt down and murder his temps - and that she's the next target on his list.\n\"Office Space meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is not a bad jumping-off point for describing this film.\nWHY DOES IT NEED TO BE MADE?\nBecause I love suspense. I love the tension in shows like Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Hannibal, and yet I don't find this tension in many feature films today. DIAL 9 TO GET OUT will be one of those rare films.\nThere also aren't enough thrillers out there with truly interesting characters - especially female characters - and I want this to be one of those too.\nBut mostly I just want to glue you to the edge of your seat for an hour and a half. When you watch this movie, I want you to be able to say, \"Well, that was awesome.\"\nDIAL 9 TO GET OUT is funny, scary, smart, unpredictable, a little thought-provoking, and definitely popcorn-friendly. I want it to do for working late at the office what Jaws did for going to the beach.\nSO IS THIS OR IS THIS NOT A HORROR FLICK?\nOkay, yes, there's a maniac in a mask who goes around stabbing people. But it's about the tension, not the gore, so DIAL 9 TO GET OUT is more for the Breaking Bad crowd than for the You're Next crowd (though I hope the You're Next crowd likes it too). The emphasis is on a tight story, crisp dialogue, and rich suspense.\nIf I do sell this movie to a distributor, they might market it as horror, which is what happened when Lionsgate released my second feature Claustrophobia (which they retitled \"Serial Slayer\" for the English language market).\nBut between you and me and the blood-spattered water cooler, this is a thriller.\nStory is everything, and DIAL 9 TO GET OUT has a great one. Now that we're at the end of the campaign, I've posted pages 1-67 of the full 105 page screenplay for all to read. You can read it here.\nIf you want to know how the movie ends, you'll have to get it funded!\nFrom left: Mark, Meta, Scott, Christopher, William\nMARK TAPIO KINES, Writer/Director. I've made two feature films. Foreign Correspondents (1999) was the first movie to be crowdfunded online. It starred Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures, Up in the Air), Wil Wheaton (Big Bang Theory, Star Trek: TNG), Corin Nemec (Stargate SG-1, Parker Lewis Can't Lose), Lisa LoCicero (General Hospital), and other fine folks. Claustrophobia (2003) also starred Ms. Lynskey, as well as Mary Lynn Rajskub (24), Sheeri Rappaport (NYPD Blue), and Judy O'Dea (the original Night of the Living Dead). I've also made a number of short films, I authored a screenwriting course on Lynda.com, and I sometimes write for Indiewire. More about me here.\nMETA VALENTIC, Producer. Meta has produced a number of independent features, including Sundance favorite Urbania, Hunting of Man, Ladr\u00f3n que roba a ladr\u00f3n, and several shorts. In her TV life, she's worked on hit shows such as Castle (we shot my talking head in the DIAL 9 intro video on the Castle set), Bones, and Lost.\nSCOTT SPEARS, Director of Photography. Scott's got more than 45 credits as DP and cameraman. Among his accomplishments: winning an Emmy for the short film The Birthmark and shooting Richard Hatch's 1999 Battlestar Galactica trailer, which revived interest in the show and led to the reboot. Scott was the DP for Foreign Correspondents and I'm happy to work with him again. He shot the creepy office building footage in the DIAL 9 intro video.\nCHRISTOPHER FARRELL, Composer. The extremely gifted Mr. Farrell wrote the scores for my first two features Foreign Correspondents and Claustrophobia (as well as several of my shorts, including A Trophy). He's also scored a ton of genre pictures with great titles such as Dead Scared, Nightmare Man, and House of the Witchdoctor. That's his music you hear in the intro video.\nWILLIAM LEBEDA, Titles Designer/Visual Effects Supervisor. William did the amazing title work on the intro video as well as my first two features. As Creative Director of Picture Mill, William has designed the title sequences for a slew of major Hollywood releases, most famously for David Fincher's Panic Room, but also for Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, Jason Bateman's Bad Words, War of the Worlds, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Signs, Anchorman, and many others.\nWHAT ABOUT THE CAST? ANY CELEBRITIES?\nWe're casting this movie the old-fashioned way: by holding auditions and hiring the very best actor for each role.\nBack when Meta and I were trying to raise a million bucks from Hollywood types, they kept saying, \"You need to cast bankable names so we can sell the picture to foreign territories.\" Yes, even if an actor is not right for the part or is impossible to work with. And of course, said actor's salary would eat up half the budget. A gloomy proposition.\nOne of the great things about crowdfunding this film is that there's no pressure to be \"bankable\". We can cast who we want. So if a complete unknown is better for a particular part than someone who was on a semi-popular TV show 15 years ago, we're going to cast that unknown.\n\nThat said, we're not dumb. If Jennifer Lawrence wants to star in this movie, she's gonna star in this movie. And in fact I have a good track record with casting well-known actors: I got Wil Wheaton and Mary Lynn Rajskub to star in my first two features, with little money and no industry connections. DIAL 9 will be a SAG-AFTRA signatory production, allowing us access to the best talent, so I will do everything in my power to land some recognizable actors.\nMARK, ARE YOU REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER CROWDFUND A MOVIE?\nYes! I earned this claim to fame in 1998, when I raised $150,000 in finishing funds for Foreign Correspondents through my website for it. (Warning: ancient site.)\n1999 newspaper articles, from left: The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune, The San Jose Mercury\nAnd here's an interview I did for a PBS show called \"Net Cafe\" in the summer of 1999. Dig that long hair! Ah, the '90s.\nIf you need further proof, you can read scans of all the newspaper articles on this page. Or check out the 1999 Chicago Tribune article, which is still online in digital format.\nHOW DOES THAT $120,000 GET SPENT?\nWe're all about transparency here at the DIAL 9 Kickstarter page. So here are preliminary figures, based on a 12-day shooting schedule, with 3-4 weeks of pre-production and 2-3 months of post-production.\n$12,000 goes back to Kickstarter and Amazon for their commissions.\n$8,000 goes back to YOU - in the form of all those DVDs, Blu-rays, T-shirts, flash drives, shipping, etc.\n$5,000 for pre-production (office space for auditions and meetings, salaries for casting director, production staff, etc.).\n$30,000 for production crew salaries (based on 20 full-time crew members).\n$8,000 for cast salaries (based on the SAG-AFTRA Ultra-Low Budget rate of $100 a day per actor, plus agency commissions and SAG-AFTRA pension & health fees).\n$3,000 for 2 weeks digital camera package rental.\n$20,000 for lighting/grip/electric rentals, costumes, props, and set dressing.\n$3,000 for production insurance (required).\n$10,000 for main location rental (suburban office building) for 10 shooting days. The other 2 shooting days will be at (hopefully free) private homes.\n$7,000 for meals and craft services.\n$10,000 for post-production (editing, sound editing, music composition, titles).\n$4,000 for final sound mix and digital mastering.\nIf we can score any deals and use some of that money for higher production values, we will. (Anybody got an office building that we can shoot in?)\nHere's a trailer for my newest short A Trophy. Everybody who backs the DIAL 9 campaign at $9 or more gets to see this short in its entirety. While I am exceedingly proud of this dark little film, its visual style is completely different from DIAL 9 TO GET OUT.\nBelow are the two different T-shirt designs that you can choose from. After the end of the campaign, we will contact you about your preference and size.\n THIS COULD BE YOU:\nI am modeling both shirts. These are mockups; nothing's been printed yet.\nIf enough people ask nicely at the end of the campaign, we will also print style #2 (the shirt on the right) as a white graphic on a black T-shirt.\nAside from making movies, I'm also the author and host of Screenwriting Fundamentals, a tutorial on Lynda.com. Here's a sample:\nI've gotten a lot of requests from people who want me to critique their screenplays. I have always told them no. But for 10 screenwriters who back DIAL 9 TO GET OUT at the $450 level, I will say yes! This won't be just a perfunctory glance, either. I will really spend time with your script, pointing out what works and suggesting fixes for what doesn't.\nThese make great holiday cards, \"save the date\" announcements, direct mailers for your business, etc. You send me the background artwork, and I'll do the magic. I spend hours making these things, so it's worth your pledge.\nHere are two examples, using graphics from the DIAL 9 Kickstarter campaign. (They're heavily Photoshopped: the hallways were in Columbus, Ohio, and I was in my bathroom in L.A.!) Your cards don't need to be this creepy. Unless you want them to be.\n(Please note: I may ham it up in these photos, but I am NOT an actor, and I will NOT be starring in DIAL 9 TO GET OUT.)\nA lot of filmmakers offer speaking parts as a reward, but isn't it weird that they won't tell you up front what you're going to say? If you're going to cough up $1,100, you should know what you're in for.\nBelow are the lines for \"GARY\" (the male character) and \"MELISSA\" (the female character). They're not Shakespearean monologues. But you will come off well, and the audience will enjoy your little moment. I promise.\nYes, Melissa has a little more dialogue than Gary. But whoever plays Gary gets to work with the movie's leading lady, which will make up for it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is where I have to say that there are plenty of things that could derail this production. An earthquake could hit us in the middle of the shoot, or our leading lady could run off with the Hare Krishnas.\n\nBut I have already written and directed two independent features. Each production had its share of challenges (my favorite might be the Claustrophobia production sound recordist having to get his wisdom teeth removed on the first day of the shoot), but there was nothing that couldn't be overcome. In the end, I finished both films and I sold them. The fact that I'm coming back for a third feature tells you how committed I am to making movies. It's hard work, but I finish every film I start.\n\nForeign Correspondents was shot on 35mm, filmed all over California, and cost $500,000 to make. Claustrophobia was shot on SD consumer video, mostly in one house, and cost $60,000 to make. DIAL 9 TO GET OUT has a budget, scope, and shooting schedule right in between those two. We do have some particular challenges: There will be tricky stuntwork. There will be messy practical effects (blood). We're going to have to make every penny of our budget count. But with a solid cast and crew - and lots and lots and lots of planning - I know we can handle it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Mark Tapio Kines\nFirst created \u00b7 27 backed\nI'm the first person to ever crowdfund a film.

By using a sophisticated parts system and web UI, we're bringing the flexibility, ease, and control of a robust video game character creator to the tabletop. \nAs we add new parts, the number of potential combinations will grow exponentially! We can't wait to see what people create!\nChoose your race, your gender, your build, and your facial expression. Select and swap individual armor pieces, weapons, adventuring equipment, hairstyles, and faces. Choose your pose and watch all of the dynamically rigged parts and attributes conform to fit your selection. Choose the scale of your mini, and even the material it's printed in. We're bringing a high-tech update to a classic analog hobby and giving you the opportunity to breathe your vision and creativity into your miniature.\nYour equipment selections are dynamically rigged to conform to your choice in pose and character. These three 30mm scale minis have the same equipment but are in different poses. Click for video!\nAnd a close-up. 3D printing allows us to capture incredibly fine detail, even at 30mm scale, like the engraving on the chest piece.\nWhether you want to create stranger fare (good luck finding a dual-wielding halfling barbarian mini), capture key details (no one should be forced to make compromises on their dwarf\u2019s beard style), or simply have more say in your mini than just the paint job, Hero Forge is for you! \nWe've built a team uniquely qualified to bring this project to life. We invite you to get to know us:\nThere are many advantages to using 3D printing and digital models over the more traditional injection mold and sculpting techniques. Printing from digital models means we can easily scale our models up or down. Want 6 inch display versions of your party to immortalize their heroic deeds? Can do. Playing a niche tabletop game that uses a larger or smaller scale? No problem. And that's not all: our character builder will let you save high resolution screenshots of your model for your character sheet and overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. You can even save your mini and edit it later so it can grow and change as your character does!\nPrint on demand means you're not limited to what big companies think have the broadest appeal, and we don't have to exclude poses, equipment, or designs simply because they can't be made with injection molds. This means more freedom for you. Interior or recessed detail, which is notoriously difficult for injection molds, is easy with 3D printing. We can also offers certain novel options like printing segmented chains or swinging lanterns with articulated parts, no assembly required.\nSomething as simple as a mini with swords crossed in front of him would be impossible with injection molds.\nWe believe that this is the next step in miniatures and a fantastic application of new, exciting technologies. We'd love to be another example that tabletop gaming is alive, well, and just getting started!\n3D printed plastics are easy to paint, too! Here are a few minis we designed, 3D printed, and painted ourselves. Click for video!\n                                                                                               We've come as far as we can on our own, but it is your support that will allow us to see this project through. Backing will go towards turning our concept art into one of the coolest, most diverse digital armories on the internet, and further developing/polishing our web UI to provide the smoothest experience possible. We can't wait to start our next campaign where every player is using a custom, bespoke mini that they designed themselves. We invite you to help make that happen!\nWe need the funding and support of backers to help us turn our library of concept art into a library of fully rigged, 3D parts. Backer's funding will also go towards developing our web UI so we can give you unparalleled flexibility and control while building your character. With a wide range of 3D parts and a perfected web app, users will have the tools to build truly unique, distinctive, interesting minis.\nAdditionally, Kickstarter offers the ability to go beyond basic funding, to reach exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of our big plans even earlier! In short, the more funding we receive, the more we can offer at launch!\nBeyond giving us the ability to fully fund this project, Kickstarter lets us connect with you. Many of our limited reward tiers offer you the opportunity to make your voice heard, working with our artists and modelers to make armor, weapons, items, and poses YOU want to see included. We wanted to give the community a voice in our product\u2019s creation, and Kickstarter seemed like the perfect way to do that.\nOur concept artists have earned their stripes in the tabletop and video game industries, and they know what makes a character truly exciting. We can't wait to see what they come up with next! Here are some of the designs they've turned out already.\nBy breaking all of our armor down into multiple parts we can generate an incredible amount of variety. Even with the limited pool of parts and poses we have now, our in-depth parts system can generate millions of variations, each with subtle differences. But that isn't enough for us.\nWe want enough variety that one could randomize our parts for years and still never arrive at the same mini! To that end, we are focusing on designing armor sets that have distinctive motifs, themes, and profiles, that will really come to life when you log in and combine the parts in exciting ways to create a truly unique look, distinctive to your character.\nArmor pieces will automatically fit your race, gender, and pose!\nWe've highlighted the customizability of our armor, but we aren't neglecting weapons and adventuring equipment either. Not only do we want everyone to be able select exactly the weapons they have listed on their character sheet, but to also be able to choose from multiple motifs, looks, and styles. When your character upgrades from a regular long sword to a masterfully crafted +3 long sword we want you to be able to have that reflected in your miniature. Hero Forge will make that a simple proposition.\nWith our initial funding goal, we'll be starting with fantasy-themed figures with an eye on expanding. Sci-fi, steampunk, cyberpunk, Victorian era, historical military outfits and weaponry, pulp, western, superheroes--the possibilities are endless, and some may even be revealed as stretch goals. Our in-depth parts system makes mixing and matching genres easy! As new parts are released you will be able to add a robotic arm to your knight, or give your cowboy a samurai sword. \nAfter setting aside the manufacturing costs of our physical rewards, the majority of the funding will go towards building 3D models and finishing the development of our web UI. When we reach base funding, we plan to have five races available at launch: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, and Half-Orc, and we will expand over time! With a successful funding campaign from Kickstarter we aim to have our full-featured mini-builder off the ground this year with new batches of parts hot on the heels of release.\nOur initial five fantasy races, with more coming as our first stretch goal!\nIf we exceed our base funding goal, we will have more resources to produce more parts and features faster. For example, here are a couple features we hope to add. You can help us add them sooner by helping us meet our stretch goals!\nWe've got many other big things in mind, including more genres, nudity options, color, wings/horns/tails, multi-figure poses, and more!\nMeet our All-Star team:\nBuilding the right team takes careful planning, an eye for talent, and a guiding passion. Joshua Bennett is that jack-of-all-trades. Having worked as a freelance artist, writer, editor, and project coordinator from L.A. to Hong Kong, he has been embedded in the tabletop RPG community for years. His work has appeared in Wayfinder Magazine, on paizo.com, and in dozens of online shops and indie RPG releases.\nCreating a character customizing UI is a complex endeavor. There are website limitations to work within, quality and quantity of art to consider, not to mention making sure that all parts are compatible with each other. As Technical Art Director for the video game studio Naughty Dog, Teagan Morrison has been dealing with digital resource management and character customizers for critically acclaimed games like the Uncharted series for years.\nThe fantasy genre is rich with traditions, tropes, and distinctive styles. Freelance artist Nicole Cardiff lives and breathes fantasy art and provides an insider\u2019s understanding of what people want when it comes to their fantastic heroes. Her work has appeared in Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition materials and the reboot of Tomb of Horrors, in Warhammer, Call of Cthulhu, and Game of Thrones cards for Fantasy Flight Games, and on the covers of fantasy novels.\nCreating designs that are iconic and integrate well into a parts system is no easy task, but expert concept artist Molly Maloney is uniquely suited for it. Currently working as a concept artist for Telltale Games, Molly is skilled at creating gorgeous concept art with an eye on its future digitalization.\nModeling characters for miniature, 3D printing, and a parts system requires a number of considerations that would make some 3D artists balk. With a masterful understanding of proportion, and a keen understanding of the medium, Margaret Dost is the perfect artist for the job. An expert 3D modeler who has worked on everything from blockbuster films like Pacific Rim, videogames like Mortal Kombat vs. DC, commercials, and cinematics, Margaret has the skills to guide our transition from concept art to 3D models.\nWith Hero Forge, customization is king. This is built on a complex and in-depth part system which requires extremely clever, dynamic rigging, and a balance between creativity, efficiency, and a keen artistic eye. Beverly Sage excels at all of these things and has earned her stripes working as a freelance rigger and technical artist in the videogame industry on games like The Last of Us. She currently works for Nickelodeon Animation Studios as a technical character artist.\nMaking a part system that just works, plug-in free, in your web browser involves a lot of pipeline challenges, as does getting a customized 3D model into a data format that can then be 3D printed. David Lenna has been dealing with pipeline as South Park studio's Chief Technical Officer for years and is uniquely equipped to make the right decisions.\nAll that to say: We have an amazing team with passion, big ideas, and the technical chops and experience to back it up. We can't wait to make Hero Forge a reality!\nThere are technologies available now that would have made this project impossible even a year ago, and further improvements in this already groundbreaking tech are right around the corner.\n3D printing\nWhile injection mold minis are not likely to see any revolutions in their production process any time soon, 3D printing is evolving at a blistering pace. While current printing technology allows us to capture detail comparable to current minis, our character and object models are sculpted at remarkably high detail, so you can look forward to fidelity improving as printing technology does!\nWe've chosen to use Shapeways for our 3D printing needs. They recently released a developer API which allows small businesses, independent sculptors, and start-ups like us to take advantage of the latest in commercial 3D printing technology. By using the Shapeways developer API, we can evolve and grow as new materials and printing options are added.  As new features like color printing or improved materials are released, upgrading will be easy. This frees us to focus on what we're really excited about: making high-quality models. We're happy to have manufacturing handled by one of the leading names in the 3D printing industry.\nAt the moment, there are two main materials that we are interested in releasing at launch. The first is an 'ultra-detail plastic' material which is slightly translucent (before priming), highly detailed, and is fantastic for painting--very suitable as a high quality display piece. The majority of the miniatures we show here are printed in this material. The second is a lower cost, albeit lower detail material which is very durable and flexible. This 'strong plastic' It is opaque white, and has a rougher finish that makes it less suitable for painting. As in all other aspects of Hero Forge, We wanted to offer users as many choices as possible, so a cheaper, but still entirely customizable option just made sense. Note that the \"patron\" and \"novice party\" tiers are both available only in the latter 'strong plastic' material. Keep in mind that, by the time we launch, there may be exciting new material options available!\nWebGL\nWebGL, the new web standard for 3D, allows video game-quality graphics right in your web browser. This has allowed us to build an interactive 3D interface that lets you easily and quickly design miniatures without downloading plugins. See beautiful, interactive models as you design, pose, and build them. Gone are the days of browsing low-rez photo galleries or rooting through poorly stocked shelves. You'll be able to see your mini in crisp 3D long before it arrives in your hands. \nWebGL also allows us to add fun, free features that we believe people will enjoy: whether you're buying our minis or not, you will be able to export high resolution screenshots of your unique character. Use it for your character sheet, as a keepsake, or for a 'wanted sign' player handout. Export an overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. Save a character to edit later, or get a head start designing your next one. Here is a video highlighting some of the features that we will be including!\nWe believe our WebGL character builder will be a fun and amazingly useful tool. We just can't stop thinking of new uses for this technology, and we're sure you'll have some great ideas too! \nPledge tiers $20 and up may add individual miniatures and statuettes to their order!\nClick for instructions!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n---While we want to offer as many options as possible, we also want to ensure that we have the absolute best base product we can before sticking baseball cards in the spokes and painting flames on it. Some of the more ambitious customization options may have to be prioritized or wait for things like print technology to catch up.\n\n----3D printing tech is rapidly improving, but just as the injection mold production process has its challenges and problems (flash or mold lines, limited shapes, etc.) so does 3D printing. Current print technology still has some disadvantages that it is working to address. For example, the strong material is not especially detailed, and the detailed material is not very strong. Another example: we've pointed out that the sandpapery texture of the 'strong plastic' material is not especially suitable for painting (paint sticks just fine, it just is harder to layer on). And the ultra-detail plastic is not as durable as most plastic miniatures. Much like a resin model or miniature, if you drop one from high up, it very well may break.\n\n---The ultra detail material can also come with some visual artifacts in the plastic's consistency. This is different than the \"stair-stepping\" effect of earlier 3D printing. In most cases it is a primarily a visual quirk rather than a physical one--and will be undetectable once a figure is sprayed with primer.\n\nOf course, these are challenges that are actively being researched and addressed. We are especially excited about new material offerings that are stronger, more detailed, and even allow for fine color application. These are advances we hope, and expect, to see in the very near future.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Your Alpha Access to Color Tools and \u201cSuper Backer\u201d Rewards", "update_content": "Hello again, Hero Forge Fans!

Experience 30 years of gaming evolution, from the early pong days to the modern games of today. Attend midnight game launches or test your skills in competitive in-game tournaments. Read in-game magazines for tips, tricks and reviews, or for the latest rumors about the new Gametron 9000 XZ.\n\nMy childhood consisted of a pure diet of EGM, Nintendo Power and every video game I could get my hands on. Weekends meant all night gaming marathons with friends and swapping NES games with kids on your street was part of daily life. You never had to worry about DRM, constant online connections or bricking your console with a firmware update. Things were wonderfully simple. It was a time when a new console generation meant taking a giant leap into the future of gaming. You never could have mistaken an SNES/Genesis game for an NES title, even if your parents thought it all looked the same. We didn't have E3, we had CES and gaming publications would trickle out screen shots from the event for months. Release dates were ambiguous at best, which meant you had to call your local store every single day throughout the summer to see if Zelda II was available (sorry store guy). This was growing up with video games in the 80's and this is where Retro World comes from.\n\nRetro World will be available on Windows,Mac and Linux platforms.\n You've just moved to a new town where the video game craze has taken the town folks by storm. Unfortunately this newly favored past time comes with more than the people of Frankton had bargained for. Extended periods of play have resulted in strange phenomenon from disappearing children to sightings of spooky creatures. It's up to you and your newly found friends to get to the bottom of this bizarre mystery.\nA few of the characters you'll meet.\n You basically play the part of a young boy who's just moved to a new town where video games have just starter to become a popular past time. You eventually realize that some of these games are not what they seem. Some games will actually leak some of their characters and themes into the real world or even absorb some of your friends right into the TV. It's up to you to use your knowledge acquired from the retro game play and gaming magazines to solve their problems and push the game worlds back where they belong. The main overarching goal is solving why these games are coming to life.\nThe game segments can be broken down into four phases:\n1) The Hype - In anticipation of a release the town folks will talk about the upcoming titles expressing their likes or dislikes. You'll see prominent billboards advertising each game using various colorful marketing strategies as well as special features in magazines. After properly researching your game you'll make your choice determining how much cash you'll need to earn. \n2) Earning some cash - Games don't come cheap. It's up to you to gather enough money before the game's release. For this you'll do all sorts of chores for your parents, neighbors and even strangers you meet. Cutting the lawn and making deliveries are just typical things you'll do to earn your money. There's still always a chance a distant relative will send you a gift through the mail. \n3) Getting the game - Getting the hottest new game can sometimes be difficult. Stores having limited stock was a common occurrence back in the day and in Retro World things are no different. You'll have to track down your games by calling specialty shops, department stores and then get there before it sells out. In some cases finding a game can be a quest in itself taking you to some of the more seedy parts of Frankton.\n4) Playing the game - Now that you've got your game it's time to play it. Finishing games to 100% completion advances the story to the next Hype phase. \nBeing just a kid means you won't be able to buy everything available on release day. You'll have to rely on your friends to play everything. But once a game gets old you can always find it in a bargain bin or a second hand store.\nWe've teamed up with members of one of the biggest names in adventure games, LucasArts!\n\"Unfortunately for LucasArts, the company was shut down back in April by Disney. Thankfully for Francois, however, since the shutdown the members of the LucasArts audio team - one of the most highly regarded and awarded audio teams in the game industry - have all gone freelance and we've talked about bringing the same sparkle of AAA quality adventure game audio to the world of Retro World. With team members who have worked on the Special Edition Monkey Island titles, as well as The Dig and Grim Fandango, we know adventure games and we know that we will do a great job with audio for Retro World.\" -Jesse Harlin former Staff Composer for LucasArts currently wielding his talents from dunderpatemusic.com.\nIf you've played a LucasArts game in the last ten years chances are you've heard Jesse's incredible work. \nWe also have on board the great musical talents of Clark Aboud (responsible for the trailer's soundtrack) who will also be contributing to the game's soundtrack.\nYou can sample Clark's previous works on his SoundCloud page.      \n\nWe have Mathieu Galarneau as our resident web master & graphic designer. Mathieu has done some incredible character pixel art and animation for us.\n\nAnd finally myself Francois Grenier, lead designer and developer, responsible for the environment art as well as character art and animations.  \nsome games might be too controversial and result in protests from the town folk.\nMany of our features are still in the early stages of development and are simply too raw to show. Here's what we can tell you. You'll take on game challenges on and off screen as the game worlds and main world collide. You'll use your wit as well as retro play styles from inner games to solve real world problem situations. At it's core Retro World is an Action/Adventure/RPG but you'll find just about every type of game available throughout the four console generations.\nExperience a wacky retelling of the video game industry while uncovering the mystery of why games are coming to life.\nExplore a 3D stylized open world with various seasons, weather effects as well as night and day transitions.\nInteract with colorful characters from gamers to folks simply enjoying small town life.\nPlay arcade and console games with your friends. (Some games feature real life multi-player options for up to 4 players.)\nSome later gen games feature real Stereoscopic 3D, permitting you have the necessary hardware in your home. (3D types supported include Side by Side and Top and Bottom). Note that 3D viewing is not required to play these titles and is simply used for show.\nDefend yourself using real-time combat in the over world using a variety of weapons taken from the environment as well a from the video games you play.\nSome game worlds will collide with the real world making town life a little difficult.\nI've always enjoyed the tongue and cheekiness of discovering games within games. But what if the idea could be pushed to the point where the player begins to question what is real and what is game? So I decided to take the concept to the next level , while telling a relatable story to gamers like myself and yet interesting enough for new gamers that weren't around in the 80's. I've never seen anything of this scale before, so this presented a great opportunity to create something different.\nPlay classic shooters like Planet Defence.\nExperience the zany adventures of Suitman through a series of games.\nWe have a few interesting game mechanics we have yet to reveal as doing so would spoil some of the fun.\nDreaming big comes at a price. There is no way a single person could deliver a fully flushed out game of this magnitude without additional help. Kickstarter can supply me with the needed additional resources required to deliver this vision without sacrificing anything that makes this game special. The $175k will allow me and my artist to take this on full time as well as pay for an additional developer and animator to join our efforts. This also has to pay for our talented sound guys and any additional cost incurred by legal fees, Kickstarter fees etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking on a project of this scale can be quite daunting. But not all is grim as we have three elements working in our favor: \n\nThe first is the target platforms. We are only shipping on Windows, Mac and Linux, on which the game already runs without any issues. \n\nThe second is the fact that we already have a head start on the project. The main framework of the game is almost complete with a little over a year's worth of coding already done (weekends and evenings). The in-game games are running on smaller modularized engines that can easily be morphed into any retro game style imaginable. We already have side scrollers, shooters, adventure and puzzle games in various stages of development representing every gaming era within our 30 year scope. \n\nThe third is our completely digital reward tiers. This ensures that every penny is strictly spent on the game development. We're not printing T-shirts or full sized posters that must be shipped around the world. All funds are strictly to going to towards the completion of this project.\n \nEven with all of these elements already in place there is still much to be done . We still need to fully complete and polish the world map, interior spaces, code additional features as well as animate our full cast of characters. It's not going to be easy but nothing worthwhile ever is.\n\n\n\nShould we exceed our funding goal, I ensure you that the surplus amount will be completely reinvested into the project to improve the the quality of the product beyond your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Francois Grenier\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nA gamer since the age of four, I first toyed with the idea of making games during my first programming class in high school at the age of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Thank you for all of your generosity and support.", "update_content": "I would like to thank all of the backers for believing in our project.

BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started. Here's a list that summarizes and links to a few of the more important updates.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.

ColecoVision is Back.\nColecoVision is a classic retro games console from the early 1980s. And we're trying to bring it back! We're planning on creating an app - as a starter on iOS, but if we get the backing also on Android, Mac, PC and Vita. Way more than just 'an emulator' we want to create something that showcases the ColecoVision, including:\nBeautiful, graphical, intuitive user interface (see some ideas below)\nCompetitive scoring \nChallenges \nAchievements \nBox art & instructions \nHistory of ColecoVision \nAround 20 original fully licensed games and now homebrew titles too.\n$250,000!! What are you spending the money on?!?\nWe hear you internet! Lots of you have been asking for a breakdown of where the money is going - so here we go!:\n- Licensing costs \nYes, there are free emulators out there which work to varying degrees, and that is GREAT! But we are delivering a fully branded (It's a proper 'ColecoVision'!), fully licensed set of original games. That means it is 100% legal, totally official, no grey areas. This is the ONLY way you are going to see a collection like this for sale.\n- Rewards costs and other fees (Kickstarter/Amazon). \nUnlike some Kickstarter campaigns where the 'physical' rewards kick in at $100+, we start ours at just $45 for a custom T-shirt or poster. We feel strongly that we want our backers to get a LOT for their money. We deliberately pitched our 'core' reward at a super-low $10 so that as many retro fans as possible could get something without breaking the bank. Of course, by pitching physical rewards at a lower price, that means our margin on those pledges is reduced - and the amount that goes into the actual delivery is lower too.\n- The remainder\nIn total (it's impossible to be precise because we get different margins on different rewards) we are going to be left with around $130-140k after the licensing, rewards and fees. This money is all going to go on actually executing the project. This means paying for: \nGraphics Designer \nUser Interface & User Experience Specialist \n3D Modeller \nDevelopers\nRemember we are absolutely not just building \"an emulator\" here. It's going to take about 5 months to complete the project, and we're creating a beautiful, unique, graphical, intuitive user-interface including competitive scoring, challenges, achievements, box art, instructions and history of ColecoVision.\nPress Coverage\nWe've received some great press coverage so far from some of the biggest gaming and tech websites around!\n\"Rantmedia Games has a knack for rekindling childhood gaming memories -- see its uncannily accurate Vectrex Regeneration as proof.\" - Engadget\nWe've got some great ideas and would love to find out what you think. It's going to be slick, polished and beautiful. You can check out the concept art below too, and see where we're heading with it.\nWe really like the idea of re-creating a living or family room with a ColecoVision console right in the center. We want people to be reminded of the original system, to see what it looked like. We're thinking atmospheric lighting - the glow of the TV, lighting the room and then to the left, we're imagining your stack of games.\nSwipe or tap, and the games all fly up and assemble in a line so you can swipe left and right through your library - accessing box-art, instructions and the ROM cartridge. Choosing to play a game will drop the cartridge into the console, and then zoom you into the TV and you'll be playing full screen.\nTo the right, we're thinking it would be cool to have a trophy cabinet. Only, instead of it containing football or athletics trophies, this one will slowly fill up as you get scores and achievements in the games. You'll be able to send challenges to friends, and see how you shape up on global leader boards.\nUltimately, it's all about the details, the little touches, the polish and the delivery of the most authentic experience possible.\nUpdate 10th October: Some fresh new renders!\nWe've got the rights to a huge list of games that we're going to include in the initial release including:\nAntarctic Adventure \u2022 BlackJack/Poker \u2022 Bump 'n' Jump \u2022 Brain Strainers \u2022 Destructor \u2022 Fortune Builder \u2022 Frenzy \u2022 Jumpman \u2022 Jumpman Junior \u2022 Jungle Hunt \u2022 Ms. Space Fury \u2022 Pepper II \u2022 Space Fury \u2022 Super Action Boxing \u2022 Super Action Football \u2022 Super Action Baseball \u2022 Super Action Soccer \u2022 Zaxxon\nWe're hoping that more can be added later on and we're also hoping to support homebrew games. That's a lot of games!\nInitially we're planning to launch on iOS, but we're also very keen to get this onto other platforms too. So it really depends on your enthusiasm - hopefully you can help us make this happen.\nWe know that everyone has their favorite platform, and we have ambitions to also launch onto Android, Mac, PC and even hardware like PS Vita. But we wanted to start simple, and then get feedback on what you'd like us to support.\nWe are excited to announce our first stretch goal!\n\n $300,000 = Android\nSomething for everyone hopefully! Depending on the amount you pledge you will get a selection of amazing rewards that include:\nWe're a small team, but we're experienced and we know what we're doing. We're the guys who bought you 'Vectrex Regeneration' - launched onto the App Store at the end of last year - bringing back the classic Vectrex experience to a whole new audience.\nIt got some great reviews from people who really know what they are talking about - like Classic Game Room, Kotaku, TUAW, Joystiq, ArsTechnica, Engadget and Touch Arcade. Lots of people called it the best emulator on the App Store, where we got featured by Apple in 141 countries!\nIt's pretty much like this: we love those classic games of the 80's and early 90's which are SO addictive and yet so simple. I guess that means you could call us 'retro enthusiasts'!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wouldn't be pitching this if we weren't supremely confident we could deliver big time on our vision. We believe we've covered just about everything to nail this, from the design, development and delivery of the game to the logistics (and costs) of shipping the T-Shirts! We've got the rights and licenses already in place, and we've got track record of delivering this kind of thing successfully.\n\nThat of course doesn't mean it's going to be plain sailing - any game that is meaningful has the tendency to cause you pain when you least expect it, but we're confident we can deal with just about anything that comes our way.

We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Scavenge for supplies, find survivors, and deal with massive hordes of classic-style zombies. Recruit up to five survivors with their own random names, appearances, personalities, and quirks that can both help and hinder your journey to safety. This unique blend is wrapped in a colorful game world that doesn't take itself dark-and-gritty seriously.\nTons of replay value. Every game is different. Randomized cities, different survivors to recruit, different events. We will have a big focus on rare events and Easter Eggs.\nVaried and robust Interactive Fiction style decision making. The traits, personalities, and status of your group members influence the choices you can make and their results.\nSurvivors keep track of how they feel about other members of the group. It's up to you to keep your everyone together or at least mostly alive in the middle of bickering, personality conflicts, despair, rage, and/or insanity.\nWe have the rarely seen classic \"death metaphor\" style of zombie. They're slow, they're stupid, there's up to 200 onscreen at once, and they'll never stop chasing you. They form a shambling wall of inevitable death that will drag you down.\nRarer survivors called Uniques, that have their own special events, appearance, and dialogue.\nFind a dog, teach it to drive. Have all the humans in your party die. Make the dog recruit other dogs until your band of survivors consists of 5 dogs driving a muscle car.\nDeath Road to Canada is coming out around the end of Fall 2013. We want it have as much content as possible, and we want it our PC/Mac/Linux launch to go smoothly. Your support means we can put extra resources into accomplishing these goals, especially the \"more content\" part.\nFunds are specifically going to:\nMORE ART: We throw more money at our artist and he magically converts it to new graphics. Even more survivor and zombie variety! More city variety! New special locations! More dog types!\nMORE RARE EVENTS: Paul, our programmer, has four kids to feed. Some extra money to feed his five kids would give him the peace of mind he needs to work on extra fun stuff. Rare events! Rare weapons! Rare characters! Easter Eggs!\nMORE PROMOTION: I want to show the game off at festivals, as doing so really helps getting the word out. Travel costs, much less booth costs, are really expensive. A small portion of your support will go towards this, but not much because I don't want to be responsible for taking food from Paul's six kids.\nMORE FLEXIBILITY: Funding would give us the option of hiring a part-time programmer to help out. Or a part-time writer/designer to help make more Interactive Fiction scenarios and decisions. Your support would help us hire any extra help we end up needing.\n(IF WE GO OVER) MORE FREE UPDATES: If we exceed $25,000, we want to avoid Stretch Goals that will increase the complexity of the project and the time it takes to make the game. This is known to game developers as Kickstarter's Folly. Instead, we will put extra money into providing post-release content. This will be a mixture of extra content and feature requests from the community!\nHere's some details on what you can get for backing Death Road to Canada. All rewards are cumulative, you get all the lower tier rewards if you pledge to a higher tier.\nThe Game ($10) - A copy of the game when it releases, on PC, Linux, and Mac! Mobile versions aren't included, as the Android port will take longer and iOS codes are generally limited to 50 or so. You'll also get access to news updates exclusive to Kickstarter, including exclusive polls about game content!\nSoundtrack and Manual PDF ($25) - We'll be making a cool instruction manual in PDF format. It'll have tips, art, a strategy section, and various fun stuff. You'll also get all the music used in the game.\nEarly Access ($30) - Play the PC, Mac, or Linux version of the game about a month before it's out to the public! You'll be given access to a forum where you can send feedback directly to the developers of the game. Help us make the game even better.\nStarter Pet Option ($50) - Only available to Kickstarter backers of this tier or higher, you get the option to start the game with a kitten or puppy. They take extra food, but provide a morale boost and grow into a full sized cat or dog.\nSpecial Thanks ($75) - Everyone who pledges at this tier or above will have their names put in a Special Thanks section of the game's credits. Your first name will also be added to the big list of names that randomly generated survivors may use.\nOfficial Death Road to Canada T-Shirt ($100) - Designed by the game's artist. May or may not unlock hidden secrets if you play the game while wearing the shirt.\nGraffiti Message ($250) - Write a short message and we'll put it in the game for other players to find at random. We'll work with you so it fits within the game. Size would be about 200 characters big, maximum. $150 if you get it through the limited Early Bird tier.\nPut Your Pet in the Game ($500) - Take a picture or video of your pet, write a description of it along with its name. We'll make it so that other players can randomly find and recruit your pet into their party. Unusual pets are ok, put your ferret in the game. We'll work with you so it fits within the game design.\nAbandoned Journal ($1000) - Players can find small, abandoned journals to read that tells the story about the person that wrote them. Write a story, write poetry, write crazy top 10 lists. We'll work with you on having it fit the tone of the game. Size would be about 1200 characters big, maximum.\nDesign a Recruitable Character ($2000) - The big one! Put a version of yourself in the game, or dream up an all new character. Other players may rarely find and recruit your character into their groups. You specify your character's appearance and possible special traits. We'll work with you on having it be a good fit in the game world, and also include your character in some of the dialogue and events.\nKepa Auwae is the lead designer of Rocketcat Games, makers of Mage Gauntlet, Hook Champ, Punch Quest (a collaboration with Madgarden), and more.

With future ports to iOS, Android and Blackberry planned.\nThe story revolves around Reemus, a medieval exterminator and his loyal sidekick Liam the purple bear as they battle giant insects in a quest to legitimize \"extermination\" as a heroic career path.\n\nSound ridiculous? Well it is, but don't take my word for it. You can try the earlier games for yourself right now, for free! Just click this link, don't worry I'll be here when you get back.\n UPDATE** We're 100% Funded and we've hit every stretch goal!! Take a bow everyone, we did it!

To celebrate their arrival into the Reemus universe I've been drawing them early, click here to see all the \"Zeebarfed\" characters.\nThis new game will be the 7th outing for Reemus and Liam and the 2nd in the \"Ballads of Reemus\" series. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's milking an idea for all it's worth!\nThe original \"The Several Journeys of Reemus\" series of point and click adventure games have floated around the internet as free to play browser games since 2008. With five chapters in the series, each garnering an award nomination, they've been played millions of time on sites like Kongregate.com and Newgrounds.com. If you still haven't clicked the link to try them, click and play now! Seriously, they're free to play! \nIn 2012, Reemus made the leap into a full commercial game with a new title called \"The Ballads of Reemus\". Featuring a new, longer story, more puzzles and full voice acting. It received an award for \"Best Story\" at the Casual Connect Indie Prize 2013 last month and just because I like you, I'll let you sample that game for free too, here's a link. Click and enjoy, you can thank me later.\nSo now that you've experienced what the world of Reemus has to offer, I know what you're thinking.\n\"Jay, that Death Slug storyline was nutty. When are you going to finish it?\".\n\nWell my friends, you are in luck! That's what this Kickstarter is all about. I want to finally finish what I started in 2008 and tell the complete saga of the Death Slugs. My plan is to take the first five chapters from the \"Several Journeys\" series and reboot them, touching on some of the major story elements but with all new puzzles, full voice acting and longer gameplay. The final game will be a shiny stand alone commercial version that tells the full story from beginning to end. \n\nTHE STORY SO FAR...\nWhen Reemus the Exterminator\u2019s main competitor Pest-Go reduces pest control to a skill anyone can do with a squirt bottle, Reemus fears his chances of having a truly heroic ballad written about him are over.That is until he stumbles upon an invasion of killer Death Slugs that has all the makings of the greatest quest of all time, one that can not only restore extermination to its former glory but finally put Reemus on the map as a true hero. Now the only question remains, will Reemus and his sidekick Liam defeat the insidious Death Slugs, or will they be the ones exterminated?\nWILL THIS BE A FLASH GAME? \nNo, this time around I'm using a brand new engine. The VISIONAIRE adventure engine is tailor made for creating adventure games. The team at Daedalic games used it for \"Deponia\" and \"Whispered World\" among others and if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me! \nHOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS BY YOURSELF?\nCan I really juggle that many balls at once? Well I was worried at first, so to set my mind at ease I created a prototype just to make sure the engine could do what I wanted and that I could actually handle programming it. \nTurns out it's really intuitive and because it's focused on adventure games it really has all the tools I need to create the game I want. \nIf you're interested in checking out what I made, click the link below. It's super short and missing a lot of key elements, like voice acting and Liam! Hopefully it's enough to whet your appetite for a full game and showcase a bit of what you'll be in store for.\n\nPLAY THE PROTOTYPE!\nPLEASE NOTE *This build is PC Only, the Mac and Linux version will have to wait a bit longer until Visionaire officially releases their porting tools. Don't worry, the full game will be available for all three! \n\nLets keep this free train rolling, click for another free shot of Reemus. This one is just a tiny morsel. Don't worry it won't ruin your appetite.\nReemus will have to deal with such quests as breaking up a Stag Beetle stag party\n$15k you say? That's barely enough for groceries, never mind padding the budget to go on an extravagant trip! Well, that's how I roll. My passion runs deep for this project, so I'm not looking to retire on kickstarter money. I just want enough to cover my living expenses so I can focus all my energy into the game.\n\nI've also managed to guilt some of my friends into investing into the project, with that I've been able to lay the ground work for the game. Writing, design and art have already begun. So I just need another hot cash injection to pull it over the finish line.\nOkay, we both knew this rain of freebies would end. It's time to ask for some money but to ease the pain I've created a bunch of cool rewards for you. Check them out...\nIf I manage to exceed my goal, all money will be re-invested back into the game in the form of:\nAdded Production Value (Extra music & animation)\nIncreased Marketing Budget\nFRIGS language translation\nPizza\n\n\nIf I completely shatter my goal, I would like to expand on the content by including some new, optional side quests. \nI have some ideas for small Reemus quests that could be expanded into optional bonus stories that don't affect the main storyline.  I've also always wanted to create new content by telling stories with secondary characters. \nFor instance if Reemus visits a honey bee in the main storyline, I'd like to add content that involves controlling that same honey bee and telling a bit of the story from his perspective. By doing this I can add new puzzles and story without having to create a whole new set of art assets which, because of the time consuming nature of art production, is what would cause delays in the schedule. Also by telling other stories within the game, the main story line doesn't get padded with filler and the original vision stays intact. \nBut for now I'd rather just promise to make the best game I possibly can with my current design document. \nWHAT PLATFORMS WILL IT BE FOR?\nVisionaire will support PC, Mac and Linux. I also have plans to port the game to all mobile devices. \nWHEN CAN WE PLAY IT?\nI'd like to launch the game by June 2014.\nWILL IT BE ON STEAM?\nI'm actively working on getting the first \"Ballads of Reemus\" game on Steam. So we'll see what happens but I'm definitely trying to get it on there. In the meantime you can vote for the first game on Steam Greenlight right now!\n\nWhile you're there, show some love for The Ballads of Reemus 2 concept page!\nHOW WILL IT BE DISTRIBUTED?\nIt will be available as a DRM-Free digital download from my site, www.Zeebarf.com.\nMy name is Jay Ziebarth aka \"Zeebarf\".

The risk is always one aspect of the game will be much harder than anticipated to complete and as such requires more than the allotted time to finish. This usually starts a chain reaction and before you know it your deadline whizzes past you.\n\nHaving already tackled a full commercial game as well as a large scale iOS project, I feel I've gained enough experience to accurately predict how long each step of the process is going to take and have allocated the appropriate amount of time for each stage.\n\nUsing an existing engine will dramatically cut down on development time as most of the heavy lifting has already been worked out.

The kickstarter funding has successfully concluded ... but the journey of our game is only beginning! Come visit our website and see how you can become part of Sojourner Tales!\nIf they combined the power of tablets, smart phones and ebook readers...with the joy of storytelling and board games.\nWelcome to Sojourner! I'm Tracy Hickman. I'm an International and New York Times Best Selling author and game designer. For over thirty years, my wife Laura and I have been writing novels and designing games ('Dragonlance', 'Wayne of Gotham', 'Ravenloft', 'Dragon's Bard'). Now we're thrilled to invite you on our latest adventure: to bring interactive adventure storytelling to families and hobbyists alike. \nIn Sojourner Tales, you will use strategy and wits as you discover and collect the pieces of your mysterious story as you strive to be the first to complete the epic adventure. The tale is different every time you play ... or you can download new Sojourner Tales to explore from our website!\nNumber of Players: 2-6\nPlaying Time: 60-90 minutes\nAge of Players: 12+ (requires minimum reading skills)\nSetup time: 5-7 minutes\nTeach the rules: 3-5 minutes\nAlmost everything you need to know in order to play the game is contained in our basic game play video right here. \nCan I play without electricity?\nAbsolutely! The Sojourner Story books are designed so that you can use either a print version of the adventures or the e-book version although the electronic versions make the game faster and easier to play.\nWINNING\nThe first person to collect all five of their Chapter Disks and fulfill the final win condition of the story wins that game!\nThere are other rules clarifying the random setup of the board and when you turn over a face-down Chapter Disk but you already know enough rules right here to play the game.\nWe've created a board game like no other: the first to integrate download content for tablets such as iPads, smart phones and e-reader devices such as Kindles, Nooks and Kobos.\nUnique Ebook Story Modules: The story told in every Sojourner Tale is designed to be contained entirely in the electronic mobi or epub files. You also have the option to download the adventure in PDF format to print out and use with the game if you do not have a tablet or other device that supports the electronic book formats. However, the use of any touch-screen device provides a magical experience in storytelling and helps the game move faster.\nAdaptable Design: The game components that come in the box and the rules of the game itself are specifically designed to be adaptive to a broad spectrum of storytelling. Each Sojourner Story Module contains information on which location tiles are to be used on the board with that particular story, thereby changing the look of the game board depending on the story being told. All of the flavor, setting, characters and narrative of the adventure are contained in the downloaded module ... meaning the game can adapt to any story you want to live.\nInnovative Storytelling System: The board keeps track of your location in the epic story, making certain that the game flows back and forth between the board and the ebook with the story continuity left intact. For random encounters, an innovative 'Twisted Tales' system lets the players draw two twisted cards and one tales card and then 'stack' them in such a way as to make a phrase -- a phrase which takes them to a specific adventure entry for that combination of cards. \nGrass-roots Licensing: We want YOU to write adventures for our game and so we are even providing you with a 'grass-roots licensing option whereby you can not only create your own Sojourner Tales games but (with our license) also sell those adventures on our official website.\n\nAnything is possible! Since the story and complexity of the game is designed to be contained entirely in the Sojourner Story Module, it is entirely up to the module designer.\nThe book contains our 'secret recipe': a matrix of entries designed specifically to interface with the game. You play the game under the same basic rules but once you enter the book, whatever the story's author creates will plunge you into that story.  Some stories are simple and created for quick play and families. Others may be complex, intended for more serious hobby gamers.\nOur stretch goals list two additional modes of play: Improv and Theater play. Improv is a way of using the game to make up the story collectively as you play.  Sojourner Theater  play has each person at the table downloading the same book ... but with each player taking a different speaking part as the game progresses.\nIn our initial release of the game, we will include components for six genres of story:\nFantasy\nScience-fiction\nHorror\nRomance/Steampunk\nMystery\nHoliday\nAdditional themed components representing further genres are certainly possible. What would you like to see?\nWe're packing a lot of awesome in every box.\n1 Gameboard\n50 'Twisted' Cards\n50 'Tales' Cards\n36 'Destiny' Cards\n6 Player Tokens\n6 Six-sided Dice\n1 'Lead Player' Marker\n1 'Chapter' Marker\n1 'Scene' Marker\n32 Story Disks (6 each in 6 colors)\n6 Journal Display Boards\n15 Location Tiles (creates 6 unique board configurations supporting fantasy, sci-fi, horror, mystery, romance/steampunk, superhero and holiday themes)\n1 Sojourner Story Module (print edition with additional access instructions for downloading PDF, Kindle Mobi or iPad epub files)\n1 Rules Book\nOriginal Cover Design\nCould you write a game just for your son's birthday? Maybe a game specifically for your parent's anniversary?  What if you want to write fan-fiction Sojourner Story Modules of your own?\nGreat! We want to help you!\nWe will be providing through our website tools to help you create your own Sojourner Tales adventures for your own, personal -- as in non-commercial -- use.\nBut what if you want to SELL that amazing Sojourner Story Module that you polished to perfection?\nGreat! We want to help you do that, too!\nWe will sell you a license to produce official and sanctioned Sojourner Tales adventures which you can sell with our blessing. The license initially will be for from one to two years. Anything you produce during the period of the license that meets our standards, is licensed for five years after the end of the license. You should notice that there are Backer levels which include this license. You'll need to adhere to our standards policies regarding content and quality.

The campaign is now over, which means Kickstarter has frozen this page and it can never be updated.  Which means that everything here is absolutely, 100% guaranteed to be hopelessly and comically out of date.  The actual Robot Turtles activity is now happening at www.RobotTurtles.com, where you should proceed immediately (after watching my adorable children in the video above). \nThank you so very, very much for your support.\n-- Dan Shapiro\nRobot Turtles Forever!\nAnd now, the campaign that started it all...\nRobot Turtles is a board game for kids ages 3-8. It takes seconds to learn, minutes to play, and will keep them learning for hours. Kids won't know it but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.\nI'm a father of four year old twins.  Teaching them to program a computer is the single greatest superpower I can give them. I made Robot Turtles so that my kids could learn programming basics without needing a computer. In fact, they don't even need to be able to read!\nI've been told that this would never sell in the toy aisle.  I've shown it to board game designers and manufacturers; they told me this would never work on store shelves. Learning programming just sounds too complicated.\nBut I disagree.  I think programming can be as simple as playing with these four turtles.\nThat's why I'm here on Kickstarter.  If there are a thousand of us, we can do this.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in believing that programming literacy is going to be key to our children\u2019s future. How many of us are there?\nI\u2019m a software guy who\u2019s been programming since I was 7 years old.  I invented Robot Turtles as I pondered these questions in the shower one morning:\n1) Why are kid games either pure luck (Candyland) or a frustrating exercise in trying to lose on purpose, without the child noticing (Tic-Tac-Toe)?\n2) How old does a child need to be to learn to program? (Do they even need to read?)\n3) What's something cool I can do with my kids this afternoon?\nI got out of the shower, printed out some generic robot clip art, and told my 4-year-old twins that I had a new game for us to play.  We started experimenting with the rules, and the kids couldn't get enough of it.\nI got so excited about this game that I took a leave of absence from my job at Google and spent the summer working full time to develop it.\nNow I just need to find homes for 1,000 copies so I can meet the factory minimum order!\nOne of the unique things about Robot Turtles is that only one person (the \u201cTurtle Mover\u201d) needs to read the rules. That means the kids can just start playing!  Here\u2019s how it unfolds.\nFirst, put away the Laser and Function Frog cards.  They'll get to unlock these later!\nEvery player (\u201cTurtle Master\u201d) gets to pick a turtle and gets a matching deck of cards.  \nStack the cards on the table, in piles, face up, and build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel.\nThen read these three rules out loud to your turtle masters:\nThe youngest turtle master goes first.  They put their first card down and you move the turtle accordingly.\nIt might help to point out that the purple card turns the turtle toward the purple flower, the yellow card toward the yellow flower, etc.\nAs they progress, they build their program up on the table. If they make a mistake, they can shout \"Bug!\" and debug it.\nPretty soon your kids will figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: it lets the kids control the grownups!  The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grownup is the computer, executing commands on the board.  At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults. Just like programming is about bossing around computers.\nKids love unlocking new features of Robot Turtles, like powerups in a video game.  Each unlockable changes the game to make it more challenging, so Robot Turtles can grow with your children.\nIt may not look like it, but Robot Turtles is a very simple programming language.  It drew its inspiration from Logo, the first programming language I learned as a kid (and the first programming language to prominently feature a turtle).  \nWhile the Robot Turtles programming language isn\u2019t Turing complete, it prepares kids with the skills they\u2019ll need to learn to love programming as they grow up:\nExperiential learning. Kids start the game the same way they start programming \u2013 at the command line. Every instruction they issue is executed immediately. They quickly discover that they can learn by trying things out.\nDebugging. The \u201cBug\u201d undo feature offers the simple confidence that they can try anything. If it doesn\u2019t work out, they know they can back up and try again. For new computer learners, discovering that there\u2019s no cost for being wrong is essential to their growth.\nLimited syntax. Computer programming is about expressing complicated ideas with just a few simple building blocks. The first time they play, kids will want to tell you what to do, or point the cards sideways to make them do something different. Learning Robot Turtles is a process of learning to use a new, simple language to express complicated thoughts.\nOrder of operations. It\u2019s quickly apparent that \u201cforward, forward, right\u201d is very different from \u201cright, forward, forward\u201d.\nPlanning a program. There\u2019s nothing more cool then when kids graduate to \u201cPlay 3\u201d and \u201cWrite Program\u201d and you see them planning out the whole course in their heads. Just like real programmers, they mentally run their code and debug it. Then they get frustrated and just try it to see what happens\u2026 also like real programmers.\nFunctions and optimizations. Although the youngest turtle masters may not be old enough for Write Program and Function Frog, this offers slightly older kids a level of abstraction and challenge on par with \u201creal\u201d programming. Yes, kindergartners can refactor code!\nComputers work for you. Somewhere along the line, programmers learn that writing code isn\u2019t like doing your homework \u2013 it\u2019s like ordering around a devoted (if not very bright) servant. Guess what? You are the computer and they get to order you around. (That\u2019s why kids love this game!)\nMade in America\nI spent a lot of time figuring out the best manufacturer for Robot Turtles, but in the end the decision was easy.  Delano Service is based in Battle Creek, Michigan.  They're over a century old and manufacture fantastic games like Anomia and Fluxx. Their CEO, Kim Drayer, is wicked sharp and a pleasure to work with.  And while we live in an international economy, I'm particularly proud to be able to send your family something that was made entirely in the country in which I live.  No matter where you may be! Which takes us to...\nInternational Backers\nRobot Turtles has the most amazing backers imaginable. 47 volunteer translators have already offered their services to help localize the Robot Turtles instructions in to 21 languages.  The game has no text except the instructions and the box art, so it's perfect for audiences around the world.  So far, backers plan to have the instructions available in the following languages:\nAfrikaans , Catalan, Chinese (Simplified) , Danish, Dutch, Australian English, UK English, Finnish, French , German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian , Polish, Portuguese , Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.\nIf you would like to help, please sign up!\nRobot Turtles is available internationally for a single, fixed shipping price. All tiers except the early bird pricing tier (read why) are available to international backers, including the 3-pack and 10-pack discount tiers.\nI can't believe you made it this far.\nBut if you did, you must be terribly interested in what kind of turtle experiences are available!  I will try not to disappoint.  If anything's unclear, let me know and I will clarify.  It's frustrating when you can't figure out what's in a pledge level and what isn't, so I tried to summarize each one below for you.\nThank you ($1)\nThank you for your support! Every dollar helps bring these adorable robotic terrapins in to existence. \nSummary:\nMy thanks, transmitted psychically and through email\nEarly Turtle: Full Game with Discount ($29) \nSmall print runs of games are extremely expensive - most of the cost comes from set up, so the first thousand copies are the most expensive. Still, I want to get Robot Turtles in as many hands as possible. So the first people to pledge get robot turtles for just $29, including free shipping in the US. Unfortunately this tier is not available internationally (read why). \nIncluded in the box, you get:\n1 quad fold game board (20\" x 20\" heavy duty chipboard)\n1 full-color set of rules\n4 robot turtle tiles (all tiles are 2\" x 2\" heavy chipboard)\n4 decks of cards (one for each turtle player) - 36 poker-sized cards each\n14 stone wall tiles and 10 ice wall tiles\n4 robot gem tiles\nand an incomparably good time with the kids!\nUpdate: the incredible backers of this project have enabled me to make the game even better! More cards, more tiles, and more fun.  See the updates section for details.\nSummary:\n1 game\nRobot Turtle: Full Game ($40)\nIf you pledge at this level, you'll get the same as the Early Turtle tier. Unlike the Early Turtle tier, this one can be shipped internationally (and so can all the tiers below).\nSummary:\n1 game\nThank-you Turtle: Letter & Game ($60) \nYour kid is going to be very happy: in addition to the full game, your child(ren) get a full-color letter, addressed to them by name, with an inked turtle-foot signature on the bottom. You get to choose which turtle sends it, too. And inside the game box? Their name is in the credits in the manual! This tier includes one letter with up to four children's names on it.  Note that an email will be sent asking for your children's names on Sept 27, and you must reply within three days of the project's closing (by midnight PST on September 30th) in order for them to be included in the manual.  You also get a digital printable version of award-winning illustrator Matthew Cordell's \"Turtles Playing Turtles\".\nUpdate: Because of your incredible support, a full color pick-your-own-path 32-page ebook will be included at this tier!  It's a fantastic tale where kids make decisions at each page that guide the story. It tells how Beep the turtle learns how to work with his new friend the Function Frog.  \nHere's a draft of the first of the 16 amazing illustrations in the book.  It's going to be something else. \nSummary:\n1 game\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\nTriple Turtles: Holiday Shopping 3-pack ($80) \nNot one, not two, but three teams of turtles will march their way to your door.

This level doesn't include the letter or the recognition in the manual.\nSummary:\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n3 games\nLaser Turtles: Extraordinary 3D Edition ($200)\nAs terrific as Robot Turtles is, I have been itching to make something truly unique. Something gorgeous. Something 3D.\nSomething that gave me an excuse to spend some quality time with a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter.\nAfter evaluating miniatures (big minimum order), 3D printing (ugly plastic and too expensive), and various handmade options (I have no artistic skill whatsoever), I settled on laser turtles - a special edition where all the tiles are upgraded to pure laser-made awesomeness.  \nEach one of these is made by hand, probably by me although I'm still entertaining fantasies of recruiting someone's teenager to babysit the lasercutter. They are labeled for ages 12+ (not for little ones) because they absolutely cannot go in little mouths.  But damn, do these make the game amazing!  (This tier also comes with the standard game, which you'll need for the board and cards, plus you can play it with younger ones). And you get the Thank-You Turtle.\nHere are the current prototypes. I'm going to keep experimenting with methods and materials to make this as fantastic as it can possibly be!\nIt is awesome.\nIf you want the laser turtles AND another tier, see the FAQ entry for \"How do I get two rewards?\"  \nSummary:  \nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook  \nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\n1 game\n1 Laser Turtles upgrade pack\nTen Turtles: School-size Deca-pack ($240) \nA very noble cause.

Your support was spectacular. We did it. Production art is starting; the game is going to go to press. WOOHOO!\nMore early birds.  My $40 price was based around a 1,000 unit minimum order.  I had no idea there was going to be this kind of excitement. That means I get to place a bigger order, which means I get to make more units available at a discount!  (Note that, because international shipping is already discounted, I can't offer it as an option for Early Bird, so the best value for international backers is the 3- and 10-packs). \nInstant coloring sheets thank-you. For hitting (and then blasting through) the $60k stretch goal, Backers at the $1 level and up can go here and download a PDF of six coloring sheets. This is completely free, with no DRM, and available immediately.  \nRobot Turtles in the news. You can read about the project all over the tech news.  Here's the list of articles. \nRobot Turtles: Galapagos Rules.  Us old codgers can enjoy Robot Turtles too!  Raising $150,000 has unlocked a new set of rules that allows older kids (8+) and grownups to play after the kids go to sleep.  It's incredibly fun!\nCommunity website. Raising $200,000 has unlocked a community site to collaborate on new game ideas, translations of the manual, share pictures, and more.\nDouble-sided tiles. Raising $250,000 has unlocked tiles printed on both sides, so when your kid melts ice walls, you flip them over to reveal puddles!\nMulticolor jewels.  Instead of just having green robot jewel tiles, the four jewels will come in four colors: sapphire, amathyst, ruby, and emerald.  \nLimited edition print. Award-winning children's artist Matthew Cordell has created a limited edition of 25 prints, \"Turtles playing turtles\", that are available at two pledge levels, signed and personalized by the artist. \nPrintable \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" For those of you who don't get the collectible limited edition print, all pledges at $60 or higher will get a digital, printable version of the print. \nPick your own path book. All backers at the $1 level and up get the text; backers at the \"Thank-you Turtle ($60)\" and up levels get a full-color ebook! This is shaping up to be an amazing 32-page book, illustrated in a style similar to the box cover, where kids get to decide at each page what to do next.\n50% more tiles. The original design had 32 tiles, which was plenty for basic play but could run a little shy if you really wanted to build something incredible. Every copy of the game now comes with extra walls for a total of a ridiculous 48 tiles, enough for mazes that would make a minotaur marvel. \nWe found a bug. Every game now comes with four unique bug cards, one in each deck, that kids can point to when they find a problem with their program.\nMore cards. Each deck has been upgraded from 36 to 45 cards, for bigger mazes and more turtle goodness!\nThanks so much for making it all the way to the bottom.  This project has been amazing because of people like you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time delivering a board game. I've spent months learning everything I can about the process and interviewing some of the greatest game developers around. I've been cataloging a huge litany of problems and mistakes, and making plans to avoid them. Here's what I've come up with.\n\nI'm working with Delano Services, a major game publisher in Battle Creek, MI, that's been in business for over a century. I've quoted every aspect of the process so I know the costs and materials used. I've talked to the CEO, who fully supports the project, and has agreed to let me fly in for the initial print run to inspect the results (and to package up the collector's edition boxes and ship them immediately). \n\nBecause Delano is in the US, I can and will hop on a plane if something goes wrong. Since Robot Turtles uses standard cardboard parts, the risks of unforeseen production difficulties are minimal (but not zero). \n\nShipping is something that trips up many Kickstarters, so I've been working on that for a while. It's insanely expensive. If I took delivery of a pallet of games to my basement and shipped them out to you via UPS ground, it would cost me more to ship the game than it would to manufacture it! So instead, I'm shipping the games to Amazon and using their third party fulfillment services, which saves cost (and my basement, and my sanity). \n\nBut that adds another level of complexity. So I've spent some time working with an ex-Amazon consultant to do my best to ensure that everything goes smoothly. \n\nMy biggest concern isn't actually getting you the game. It's getting you the game in time for Christmas. I've reviewed the schedule with Delano, and everyone's confident that they can do it. But in the unlikely event that something holds up production of the game - natural disaster, turtle rebellion - I will get all the backers a print-and-play PDF version, then ship the games ASAP. I don't think it'll come to that, but that's the backup plan.\n\nInternational backers have additional uncertainty. It is more likely that shipments may miss the holidays because of shipping delays, customs holdups, or border gremlins. I don't know the taxes, duties, or tariffs you may owe when the game arrives. \n\nIt's possible that, if problems occur, I may not be able to fix them to your liking. My options to make things better will be limited to refunds and, if extra inventory is still available, replacements. If extra inventory isn't available (or if there's a problem that can't be fixed, like a special reward that can't be delivered), then you're going to be stuck with a refund instead of a game.\n\nBut I'm deeply committed to getting this product in to your hands, and the hands of your kids, as quickly as possible. Whatever comes up, I will keep you posted, step by step.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Robot Turtles latest: Target in Fargo, and why that matters", "update_content": "I can't believe it's been more than a year since the crazy Robot Turtles adventure started. All sorts of amazing things have been happening, but let me tell you the part I'm most excited about.\nWhen I was two years old, our family moved to Fargo, North Dakota. I lived there until I was 12. I've been asked, \"What brings a family to Fargo, ND?\" It's the answer to this riddle: \"Where can two newly-minted professors (my parents) get a decent job at the same place and same time?\" NDSU was hiring. \nSo I grew up in the midwest, the land of the Frozen Chosen. Wonderful people, winters that would send a polar bear looking for a space heater. There weren't many options for things: ethnic food meant the chinese place on the overpass. \"The Mall\" meant West Acres, a place where people occasionally died of hypothermia in the parking lot in the winter.

Completely synchronized cutting-edge video screen visuals, state-of-the-art lighting and special fx, stage show production and special on-stage interactive segments with the audience dazzle crowds of all ages \u2013 gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThe Kickstarter campaign will help us raise the funds to create and produce our third album which we have titled \"Level 3\". This will be a studio recording (not a live recording).  Our hope is to be able to obtain funding for our stretch goals so we can produce a full length live concert motion picture as well.  Over the past decade Video Games Live has helped to legitimize video game music and has shown the world the creative, cultural and artistic side of gaming. Although VGL has obtained a lot of accolades and success, the music industry and record companies are VERY different and no music or record company is willing to invest the budget needed to accomplish our goals and put out a top quality product that we and the entire game industry can be proud of. They don't believe in the culturally artistic significance of video game music and they don't believe that people are interested in listening after the game is turned off.  And that's where YOU come in!\n\nThis project is open for funding for EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE in the world!  We will ship anywhere and there will be absolutely no region coding, etc.  PAL versions of the DVD/Blu-Ray will be made.\nVideo Games Live: Level 3 will be the 3rd album of symphonic & rock video game music from the award winning 10 year+ world touring Video Games Live concert series.\n\nThe album will be recorded in a world famous recording studio with a 60 - 72+ piece orchestra, 60+ person choir and full rock band consisting of world famous game composers from around the world.\n\nEach music segment in Video Games Live is personally arranged and orchestrated by the original composers and also uses input from the actual game designers & producers and game developers & publishers.\n\nThe album track list will consist of NEVER BEFORE RELEASED Video Games Live music arrangements from potential game franchises such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Shadow of the Colossus, Skyrim, Journey, Monkey Island, Destiny, DOTA, Assassin's Creed, Earthworm Jim, Silent Hill, Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, Super Smash Bros., Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Mass Effect, Katamari Damacy, World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, BioShock, Beyond Good & Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Street Fighter II, Uncharted, Portal, Tetris, Red Dead Redemption, Devil May Cry, Megaman, Soul Calibur, Resident Evil, Pac-Man AND MORE! (final setlist to be contingent on game publisher approval). The goal is to have between 15 - 18 tracks on the album.

Here is just a small sampling of some of the people whose work will be featured on VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3!\n\nWe want to film the new Blu-Ray/DVD/motion picture in Latin America during our big tour beginning at the end of September (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico City).  The fans in Latin America are VERY loud, VERY excited and VERY passionate about Video Games Live.  Here is just a small taste of what it is like at a Video Games Live show in Latin America!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe album will take at least 2 full studio days to record.  An orchestral recording of this nature is based on 3 hour sessions.  We will need a total of FOUR 3 hour sessions (12 hours total).  Salary costs for top of the line highly skilled orchestra musicians range between $350 - $500 per person per 3 hour session.  For a 72 piece orchestra the cost for a 2 day session (just for the musicians) can easily reach $125,000 - $150,000.  Choir is another big consideration and choir budgets can widely vary anywhere from a few thousand dollars to $20,000.  A top-of-the-line recording studio (including ALL costs) will be approximately $5,000 per day ($10,000 total).  Mixing with a top Hollywood film (& game) audio engineer (one week including studio and assistants) = approximately $15,000.  Mastering will take place at the most famous Mastering Studio in Hollywood (Bernie Grundman's) by one of the most highly regarded mastering engineers in the business... Patricia Sullivan. Patricia has personally worked with and mastered films by John Williams (including Star Wars & Indiana Jones films), James Newton Howard, James Horner, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, John Powell and Mark Isham.  Mastering budget for this type of project could go upwards to $7,500.  Other parts of the budget will include things like Album Art ($5,000), CD manufacturing based on 7,500 initial units ($5,000), Music Licensing/Mechanical Licensing to the Game Publishers, composers, right holders, etc. based on 7,500 initial units ($15,000), Kickstarter & Amazon fees (10% = $25,000), hiring of a PR firm in both North America and Europe, Shipping & Handling of goods, added physical products at certain tier levels, etc.\n\nMusicians (symphony & choir) = $130,000 - $160,000\nRecording Studio = $10,000\nMixing = $15,000\nMastering = $7,500\nAlbum Art/Liner Notes = $5,000\nCD Manufacturing = $5,000\nMusic Licensing/Publishing/Mechanicals = $15,000\nKickstarter/Amazon fees = $25,000\nProject PR (Worldwide) & Marketing (Advertising) = $15,000\nDomestic U.S. Shipping & Handling of Rewards = $5,000\nPhysical Reward products (hats, print-outs, keychains, etc.) = $12,500\nLocation Rental & Celebration Events = $5,000\nTOTAL = Approximately $275,000\n\nVideo Games Live is not making any money from this project.  Our goal is to continue doing what we love and bringing it to the people who care (as well as introducing game music to people who don't!)  In fact, Video Games Live and Tommy Tallarico will be personally helping to fund the project outside of the Kickstarter campaign.  The initial $250,000 does NOT cover all of the expenses associated with the project.\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray.  Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994 with Capitol Records) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since.  This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\nThe main idea behind our project is to give back as much as possible to donors by AT LEAST QUADRUPLING THE VALUE of the amount pledged!  You can also view our epically long REWARDS VIDEO below that details, shows and explains all of the different Tiers (Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers as they were not available when the video was created).\n\nRewards Video:\nNOTE: Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers or the STAGE 1-3 tier or WARP ZONE 2 as they were not available when the video was created.\n\nHere's a handy text based matrix for all the Reward Tiers!

Upon funding of this goal, EVERYONE who pledges will get a special and exclusive digital version of this documentary (we ask our fans to please NOT publish this publicly out of respect for the people who backed the project).\n  $750,000 - A live full length feature film and documentary of the music, making-of, interviews with composers/designers, history of game music, etc. to be recorded during the upcoming Video Games Live Latin America tour taking place this fall.  If we hit the $750,000 stretch goal then all tiers from $25 and up will receive a digital version of the film and all tiers from $40 and up will include a physical Blu-Ray/DVD combo of the movie!\n\nTO BE CLEAR... The VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3 album will be a studio recording and NOT a live recording.  The movie on the other hand WILL be a live video recording (and documentary) of a number of shows filmed in Latin America.  Depending on funding and stretch goals, we may include a special download album of the live recordings from the film as well.\nThe main goal of Tommy Tallarico (23 year video game composer veteran and creator/producer of Video Games Live\u2122) has always been to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games have become as well as helping to usher in a whole new generation of people to appreciate the arts.\n\nPlease watch this very informative and important video that will give you incredible insight as to what goes on in creating such an event and the passion behind it (courtesy of Game Informer).\nIncorporated in 2002, Video Games Live\u2122 is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having already performed over 275 shows in 27 countries on 5 continents. Over 1 million people have experienced the show live. Video Games Live\u2122 has previously released 2 albums worldwide (both of which debuted in the Billboard Top 10) as well as an award winning full length feature DVD/Blu-Ray. In 2010 the show aired nationally on PBS and quickly became one of the top rated PBS Specials of all time. Video Games Live\u2122 continues to break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\nPress Quotes\n\"Captivating!

As one of the most successful video game composers in history, he has helped revolutionize the gaming world, creating unique audio landscapes that enhance the video gaming experience.  He is considered the person most instrumental in changing the game industry from bleeps & bloops to real music now appreciated worldwide by tens of millions of fans.  As a well-recognized on-air television personality, live performer and composer, Tommy brings his in-depth knowledge, years of experience, and love of cutting edge multimedia and video games to the masses.  Tommy has worked in the gaming industry as a designer, product manager, producer, writer, games tester and heads of both music and video departments.\n\nAn accomplished musician, Tallarico has been writing music for video games for more than 23 years.  He has won over 50 industry awards and has worked on more than 300 game titles; to date, they total sales of more than 100 million units and over four billion dollars in revenue.  No one in the history of the video game industry has ever worked on more titles and projects.  In 2008, he was enshrined in the Guinness Book of World Records with a two page feature article and interview and currently holds 3 Guinness World Records including the person who has worked on the most commercially released video games.  In 2012 during the Game Developers Conference he received a Lifetime Achievement Award and is also in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. for his contributions to the game industry.  In 1994, he founded Tommy Tallarico Studios, the multimedia industry's largest audio production house.    Tommy is a cousin of rock star legend Steven Tyler (nee Tallarico) and in 2002 Tallarico\u2019s music was used as the opening song for Aerosmiths' \u201cGirls of Summer\u201d world tour.  His top titles include Earthworm Jim, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Disney\u2019s Aladdin, Spider-Man and Metroid Prime as well as top selling popular game franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Madden Football, Mortal Kombat, Time Crisis, Unreal, Lineage, James Bond, Blitz Football, Knockout Kings, Test Drive, Scooby Doo, WWE & Twisted Metal. His score for Advent Rising has been noted as \"one of the greatest musical scores of all time\" by websites such as Yahoo, Gamespot and others.\n\nTallarico has been featured on numerous national and international television shows, appearing repeatedly on CNN, FOX and MTV.  Tommy hosted, wrote and co-produced the top rated and very popular Reviews on the Run/Judgment Day television show as well as the longest running award-winning video game television show, The Electric Playground (www.elecplay.com), which has been on the air since 1997.  The show is syndicated worldwide and airs daily in prime-time.  The Electric Playground won the 2001 Telly Award for \u201cBest Entertainment Cable Program\u201d.  In 2006, Tommy hosted and helped to launch the worldwide Championship Gaming Series for DirecTV.  His national television debut came in 1994 when he was featured and asked to guest host ABC's \"In Concert\" television program which included artists Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren.  From 1991 to 1994, he headed Virgin Interactive\u2019s music and video division, and executive produced numerous video game green screen shoots for films including \u201cDemolition Man\u201d where he worked with Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and Hollywood producer Joel Silver.\n\nIn 2002, Tallarico created the critically acclaimed Video Games Live (www.videogameslive.com), an immersive, audio and video concert experience celebrating video games.  Video Games Live features music from the greatest video games performed by top orchestras and choirs around the world combined with synchronized video footage, lasers, lights, special effects, interactivity and live action to create an explosive and unique one-of-a-kind entertainment experience.  Video Games Live is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having performed over 250 shows in 25 countries on 5 continents.  The debut performance was launched on July 6th, 2005 at the world famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with the LA Philharmonic.  Over 11,000 people attended making it the biggest video game concert in the world at that time (since then they have performed to over 40,000 people in places like Taiwan and China).  Most of the game music played during the initial launch of the show (Halo, Sonic, Warcraft, Tomb Raider, Myst, Kingdom Hearts, Tron, Advent Rising, etc.) had never been performed live anywhere in the world.  Since then over 1 million people have experienced the show live.  On October 30, 2005 they broke new ground once again by putting on the very first video game concert in Canada (Vancouver).  They followed with groundbreaking first ever game concert performances in countries such as Brazil, New Zealand, Spain, Mexico, England, Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, Wales, United Arab Emirates & France.  Video Games Live was also the very first American video game concert to perform in Asia (Korea) and the first non-Japanese game concert to perform in Japan.  In 2007 they were recipients of a major industry award in Brazil for \"Special Breakthrough Achievement\" following their performances in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo the year before.  Also in 2007 they helped to launch the $1.8 billion LA Live Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles and had their national television debut on Spike TV.  In 2008 they released the highly anticipated album entitled Video Games Live - Volume One, recorded at the world famous Abbey Road Studios in London, the album debuted at #10 on the Billboard charts.  It was the first video game compilation album to ever be released worldwide and won BEST SOUNDTRACK ALBUM awards from IGN.com and the Game Audio Network Guild.  In 2010 a 90 minute national PBS Special was aired in over 90 million households across America.  A Blu-Ray, DVD and album were released.  It was the first time that music from franchises such as Mario, Zelda, Sonic and Megaman were released outside of Japan.  The second album (entitled Video Games Live - Level Two) debuted at #8 on the Billboard Charts.  With literally 100\u2019s of ticket buyer reviews on Ticketmaster.com, Video Games Live boasts an impressive and outstanding 4.6 (out of 5) rating.   There are currently over 30,000 unique videos of Video Games Live performances on YouTube which total over 100 million views.  Sponsored and endorsed by some of the top corporations in the world, the Video Games Live concert event continues to tour the world, break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\n\nTallarico was the first musician to release a video game soundtrack worldwide (Tommy Tallarico\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. 1 \u2013 Capitol Records).  He has released over ten video game soundtrack albums since, including the highly acclaimed James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies, MDK and award-winning Advent Rising and Earthworm Jim Anthology.  Tommy was one of the first musicians to ever use live guitar and 3-D audio in a video game (The Terminator), and was instrumental in bringing true digital interactive multi-channel 5.1 surround to the gaming world.  He has performed and sold out shows on the biggest and most prestigious stages in the world including London's Royal Festival Hall and Hammersmith Apollo, the Olympic Park Stadium in Korea, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., WolfTrap, Hard Rock Live in Orlando, Pan-Chiao Stadium in Taipei, the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and multiple shows at the Hollywood Bowl attended by tens of thousands of fans.  In 2004 he performed the grand finale music act on national and worldwide television (E! Entertainment, G4TV) with BT & Mobius 8 for the G-Phoria awards show.  In 2007 he performed along with Kid Rock and the Foo Fighters during the nationally televised Spike TV Video Game Awards show.\n\nTommy is the founder, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.), which is a non-profit organization educating and heightening the awareness of audio for the interactive world (www.audiogang.org).  With over 2,500 members representing over 35 countries since its inception in 2002, G.A.N.G. has quickly become known as one of the strongest and best examples of helping the game industry community.  Tommy is an Advisory Board member for the Game Developers Conference, a Governor for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS/GRAMMY's), a spokesperson for the Entertainment Consumers Association, a proud member of the International Game Developers Association and a nominating peer panel leader for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\nTommy is involved in many community, non-profit, scholastic and charitable organizations which include the Hollywood Arts and GRAMMY In The Schools.  In 2007, Tommy's many charitable works were recognized by the Hollywood Arts organization when they chose him as the first honoree and recipient for their now annual Dream Awards.  The IDG video game industry white paper mentions Tommy (along with Bill Gates) as one of the people who contributed the most to the advancement and growth of the industry in 2003.  In 2009, he received the prestigious \"Ambassador Award\" during the Game Developers Choice Awards which was only the 2nd time the award had ever been bestowed.  That same year he was chosen as one of the Top 50 Game Industry People by Game Developers Magazine.\n\nBorn February 18, 1968 and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, he moved to Southern California on his own at age 21 to pursue a career in entertainment.  Homeless with no means of financial support, Tommy was discovered in a music store and started working in the video game industry within 3 days of arriving in California.  All 4 of his grandparents came to America from Italy in the early 1900's and instilled a great sense of hard work, compassion, appreciation, passion, dreaming, creativity, sense of accomplishment and love for others that he has carried with him his entire life.  Tommy is a proud vegan and has been a spokesperson, supporter and contributor for many animal rights organizations.  In his spare time he enjoys nature, photography, traveling, cooking, video games, comic books, backgammon, being a kid and meeting new people.  His popular website www.tallarico.com has received over 250 million hits by more than 10 million unique users.\nHere is the video of Tommy's recent TED talk explaining the cultural significance of video games and they're importance as art.\nTommy playing Intellivision circa 1982", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released award winning PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray. Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since. This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\n\nBecause we have done this same kind of project multiple times in the past, we know exactly what the challenges for this project are (and how to overcome them). The toughest part in doing the project will be to get the game publishers approvals for the project. That being said, Video Games Live was the FIRST in the world to officially perform music from game franchises such as Kingdom Hearts, Halo, Warcraft, Sonic, Myst, Tron, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, StarCraft, Diablo, Civilization, God of War, Skyrim, BioShock, Mass Effect, Silent Hill, Shadow of the Colossus, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Street Fighter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Tetris, Earthworm Jim, Journey, DOTA, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny, Monkey Island and MANY MORE! Video Games Live was also the FIRST to license music and synchronized video for an album and DVD/Blu-Ray release outside of Japan from companies such as Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami and Sega!\n \nVideo Games Live creator/producer Tommy Tallarico has been in the industry for over 23 years and has worked on over 300 video games (a Guinness World Record!). He has worked with and created games with every major publisher and game developer over the years. This is one of the main reasons why Video Games Live is able to get so many approvals and why it is the only show in the world with so many different games by so many different publishers and developers. But it is still a long process that has many time challenges. In order to get the album/motion picture out within the targeted time-frame (February 18, 2014) sacrifices to the preferred setlist may need to be made. This is part of the reason why ALL of the tracks listed in the description section will be sought after.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "LEVEL 6 Album finished!

Strongman is my all-new creator-owned adventure series that tells two-fisted tales of an original pulp hero, whose exploits stretch from the Gilded Age of Teddy Roosevelt and Nikola Tesla, through the Roaring 20s, into the Dust-Bowl 30s, and beyond. This project will take the form of an anthology of legends, each revolving around circus athlete and adventurer Bronislav \u201cBron\u201d Bellman \u2014 a Depression-era strongman who doubles as a pulp hero. Bron travels the world with his companions in the Strange Bros. Circus, righting wrongs, and defending the downtrodden against all sorts of foes \u2014 from the criminal, to the supernatural. Tonally, Strongman draws on some of our favorite stories and characters for inspiration. It blends light-hearted action and globe-trotting adventure with vintage pulp crime drama, and gothic, mystical horror. Fans of H.P. Lovecraft, Lester Dent\u2019s Doc Savage, Jack Kirby\u2019s In The Days Of The Mob, Windsor McKay\u2019s Little Nemo, Todd Browning\u2019s Freaks, and Siegel and Shuster\u2019s Superman, will all find something new to love in Strongman.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es Strongman?\n\u00a1Hola, soy Jon Bogdanove! Strongman es mi propia serie totalmente nueva que cuenta las aventuras a pu\u00f1o limpio de un original h\u00e9roe sensacionalista, cuyas haza\u00f1as van desde la Edad Dorada de Teddy Roosevelt y Nikola Tesla, a trav\u00e9s de los fabulosos 20\u2019s, pasando por los \u00e1ridos 30\u2019s, y m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Este proyecto tendr\u00e1 la forma de una antolog\u00eda de leyendas, cada una girando en torno al atleta y aventurero de circo, Bronislav \u201cBron\u201d Bellman \u2013 un fortach\u00f3n de la era de la Depresi\u00f3n que tiene una doble vida como h\u00e9roe sensacionalista. Bron viaja alrededor del mundo con sus compa\u00f1eros en el Circo \u201cHermanos Bizarro\u201d, defendiendo a los oprimidos ante todo tipo de enemigos/maleantes \u2013 desde los criminales hasta los supernaturales. Tem\u00e1ticamente, Strongman recuerda algunas de nuestras historias favoritas y personajes que nos han inspirado. Mezcla acci\u00f3n ligera, con aventuras errantes, drama criminal cl\u00e1sico, y horror m\u00edstico y g\u00f3tico. Los fans de H.P. Lovecraft, Doc Savage de Lester Dent, En Los D\u00edas De La Mafia de Jack Kirby, El peque\u00f1o Nemo en el Pa\u00eds de los sue\u00f1os de Windsor McKay, Fen\u00f3menos de Todd Browning, y el Superman de Siegel y Shuster; encontrar\u00e1n algo nuevo que amar en Strongman. \nA sample page in various stages: from thumbnail to ink wash before color and lettering is applied.\nI\u2019m very grateful for DC and Marvel. It was an immense honor and my lifelong dream to contribute to Superman. I was also blessed to work at Marvel in a time of tremendous freedom and creativity. But the stakes were low in the comics business when I first started. It still felt like it did when I was a kid. There was a closer connection between fans and creators. It felt like we were all in it together. I want to bring this new project to Kickstarter because I believe in the direct relationship between readers and authors. That's what Kickstarter offers and that's what appeals to me the most. There's total creative freedom to explore and experiment with new ideas, but the comics won\u2019t happen unless fans want it to. The readers are literally invested in the creativity. It is the purest, most democratic hope for new concepts and enterprises. We can go right to the readers and fans, and say 'Hey guys, this is what we want to do.' And if people are excited, they can make it a reality in a very direct way \u2014 person to person.\n\u00bfPorqu\u00e9 Kickstarter?\nKickstarter es una forma segura de financiamiento para que los artistas saquen adelante sus proyectos. Sabemos que muchas personas tienen miedo de comprar por internet o s\u00f3lo quieren saber que pasa si el proyecto no llega a la meta. Aqu\u00ed entra el encanto de Kickstarter. Si el proyecto alcanza la cantidad deseada para hacerse realidad, se cobra la cantidad exacta que donaste a trav\u00e9s de Amazon Payments (\u00a1Totalmente seguro!). Si desafortunadamente no se llega a esto, a ti no se te cobra ni un centavo, es decir, \u00a1no hay manera de perder!\nLe estoy muy agradecido a DC y a Marvel. Fue un inmenso honor y el sue\u00f1o de toda mi vida contribuir en Superman. Tambi\u00e9n fui bendecido al trabajar para Marvel en una \u00e9poca de tremenda libertad y creatividad. Pero hab\u00eda poco en riesgo cuando yo estaba empezando, todav\u00eda se sent\u00eda como cuando yo era ni\u00f1o. Hab\u00eda una conexi\u00f3n m\u00e1s cercana entre fans y creadores, se sent\u00eda como si estuvi\u00e9ramos juntos en esto. Quiero traer este nuevo proyecto a Kickstarter porque creo en la relaci\u00f3n directa entre lectores y autores. Eso es lo que ofrece Kickstarter y lo que m\u00e1s me atrae. Hay una total libertad creativa para explorar y experimentar con nuevas ideas, pero los comics no van a existir a menos que lo quieran los fans. Los lectores est\u00e1n literalmente invirtiendo en la creatividad. Es la esperanza m\u00e1s pura y democr\u00e1tica para nuevos conceptos e iniciativas. Podemos ir directo con los lectores y fans y decir \u201cHola chicos, esto es lo que queremos hacer\u201d. Y si a la gente le emociona, pueden hacerlo realidad de manera directa, de persona a persona.\nLa meta final es tener 200,000 d\u00f3lares para poder cumplir este proyecto de principio a fin. Para poder llegar a esto, necesitamos aproximadamente a 4000 personas alrededor del mundo. Necesitamos toda la ayuda que sea posible. Incluso si no puedes cooperar, \u00a1corre la voz! \u00a1Tal vez alguien que t\u00fa conozcas pueda!\nThe Characters of Strongman: (from left to right) \u2014 Bella \"The Ball\" Akiyama / Rolly \"Tynamo\" Beaudine / Luminitsa \"The Flaming Angel\" Angelo / Adelita \"The Wolf Girl\" Aceves / Woolcott \"The Mammoth\" / and Bronislav \"Kettle\" Bellman - A.K.A Strongman\nIt is very important for us to be able to pay our awesome colorist, letterer, and background assistants a professional living wage, comparable with what Marvel or DC would pay them for their time \u2014 to help support livable rates for working artists everywhere. Plus, we want to create 150 entirely new pages of comics \u2014 which include all new characters based on the likenesses of our backers!  From start to finish, Strongman will take about a year to complete, with everyone working full time. We are relying on your support to raise enough money to keep us employed for the time it will take to produce this amazing collection. Plus, a large portion will go towards the costly printing and distribution of the final graphic novel, and the other awesome rewards! Strongman will take everything we've got!\n\u00bfA d\u00f3nde ir\u00e1 el financiamiento?\nEs muy importante para nosotros el poder pagarle a nuestro asombroso colorista, al letrista, y a los asistentes de fondo un pago profesional decente, comparable con lo que DC o Marvel les pagar\u00eda por su tiempo; para apoyar un sueldo justo para artistas trabajando en cualquier parte. Adem\u00e1s, queremos crear 150 p\u00e1ginas de comic completamente nuevas \u2013 \u00a1que incluyen personajes nuevos basados en la imagen de nuestros patrocinadores!

Unlike our work on Superman and other similar franchises, this project does not come with a rich existing canon, or ready fan recognition to fall back on. Instead we're creating a mythos and a cast of characters whole-cloth. Each creative decision will have far-reaching implications to the characters and the world. The consequences of taking a misstep are greater. However, if we communicate frequently with our backers throughout the process, we can get direct feedback from readers in a way that is not possible in mainstream comics.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Fancif Arts\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nFancif Arts is a creative collaboration between comic book artist/writer Jon Bogdanove, writer/producer Chris Faiella, and writer/director...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Results of The La Mole Promotional Are In!", "update_content": "Swing on over to www.facebook.com/StrongmanComic to find out who gets a custom figure!\nBest,\nJ,C, and K"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Thanks and Next Steps", "update_content": "Hello Stalwart Backers!\nFirst off, thank you to everyone who has supported this project so far!

Personally, my introduction was from the classic Disney animated movie.  Most of us have seen the Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe versions as well, but I realized that I have never seen an updated version: a modern-day Robin Hood, where he doesn't exactly \"rob from the rich to give to the poor,\" as the saying goes, but he instead steals medical supplies and gives them to those in need, or those who can't afford them or have no health insurance.  I am sure a lot of people can identify with how expensive health care is in the U.S. these days, and this comic book is a commentary on this, and other, issues.  But don't be fooled, it's also a straight-up adventure story that, hopefully, captures the spirit of the Robin of old.\nCreating comics is a costly venture these days. I wrote the words, but the true masters bring it to life; the artists, letterers, colorists, and cover artists (industry stalwarts Jason Baroody and Mark McKenna) all did amazing work on the book, and should be paid accordingly.  In fact, here's a tasty preview of the cover to issue #1, done by Baroody and McKenna and colored by John Hunt:\nCover art for issue #1\nThere are also printing, distribution, production and other assorted costs  That is where you come in!  If this Kickstarter project is funded, I will pay the creators, and hopefully earn enough to create future issues.  If that happens, then the next goal is a four-issue series which can be collected into a trade paperback edition.  Beyond that?  Hopefully many, many more adventures for Robin Hood and his modern-day merry men.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I said above, I wrote the words to the comic, but that is just step one. There are many cogs in the wheel, and not just involving the creative process. There are printing delays, production issues, promoting the book, and many more obstacles that can get in the way. If issues do arise, the simple thing would be to say, \"Stick with it.\" But that goes without saying, as I have been working on this for four years now. But there real solution is to find another way. Use the web to promote your book (I have a comic book podcast that may come in handy!), find another printer, or another colorist, whatever it takes.

For those who are unaware (and until last week, I could count myself in that group), a black & white comic, which this is, still needs a colorist to add grey tones to it, to give it body.

For every pledge, share and simple video watch you have helped us reach our goal.\nChaos Hour is a non-profit Geek Lifestyle e-zine based out of South Wales in the United Kingdom. \nWe specialize in Video Game, Film, Comic Book, Sci-Fi & Fantasy Literature and Hardware News, Reviews and Articles. Conceptualized by Padraig Balch in 2010, Chaos Hour has gone from strength to strength since its launch in March of 2011 at Cardiff Comic and Animation Expo.\nReaching a worldwide audience of 1500 - 5000 unique visitors every day, Chaos Hour is committed to bringing unique content, entertainment and informative articles to its loyal fan base.\nHowever, in order to continue to grow as both an online community and centre for geek related entertainment and information, Chaos Hour need to improve their website. \nAnd this is where we need you...\nWith your help and financial support we will be able to advance Chaos Hour into a much more user friendly website; advancing our search system, tagging and organization as well as fixing numerous issues from image uploading and site customization to additional pages and formatting. The advanced site structure will allow us more time to focus on gaining unique content, supporting our writing team and of course creating more of those competitions our fans have learned to love so much.\nSo where would your money go?\nTaking Care Of Business\nWhen Chaos Hour began it was very much a bedroom project and while it may look professional at the moment, much of the back end of the website is still very much unfinished making even the simplest of tasks such as tagging, editing, image uploading and formatting, very difficult if not impossible. With your support we will be able to improve the website to an organized and structured professional standard making it much more user friendly for the staff and audience alike.\nPromoting Independent Projects\nChaos Hour are avid supporters of independent film, publishing and video game projects; championing crowd funded campaigns such as Afterlife Inc, Melksham Comic Con and Stiffs among many others; having written detailed features on their projects at the time of fundraising, theming the site around their project and creating banner ads for them.\nWith an improved layout and image uploading system we will be better able to advertise and promote fellow independent projects through graphics, banner ads, illustrated articles and even a \u2018Supporting\u2019 feature - showing a project Chaos Hour are currently supporting via crowd funding who we believe you should support in turn.\nEntertainment\nSince founding our Twitch project earlier in the year, Chaos Hour have finally found an outlet for their need to entertain. While the website has been host to many competitions and giveaways, we would like to advance our entertaining reach to YouTube videos and programming, Podcasts and online comics. With your support we will be able to integrate more advanced image uploading onto our site allowing us the ability to publish online comic strips and fan art competitions. If we reach an amount over our target goal, we will be able to afford better audio and video recording equipment and editing software so that we can better improve our YouTube channel branching out into weekly talk shows, live interviews and even sketch shows.\nSocial Media Integration\nWhile we have managed to create a thriving Facebook, Twitter and Twitch community, it is hardly evident on our site. With your help we will be able to better intergrate our social media accounts into our website making us able to better promote our writers, articles, competitions and giveaways.\nTwitch Stream\nAs well as the website itself, Chaos Hour have recently branched out into Live Streaming on Twitch.TV and, since launching the CH Stream in April of this year, have grown a loyal fan base of over 1,800 followers, over 200,000 page views, and an average viewership of 100 people per night. If we go over our target goal, subsequent funding will go towards improving our Twitch stream with better audio and visual equipment as well as editing programs to make better video adverts which you can utilize in our advertisers packages to help promote your business; and we can use to help promote the content on the website.\nCompetitions\nFor the last two years Chaos Hour has been funding all of its competitions out of its own pocket without any income for the site itself. This has included giving away free video games, DVDs, tickets to events, DLC codes, Exclusive Game Content and even Riot Points and In Game currency for MMORPGs. Overall this has cost Chaos Hour over \u00a32500 With your support we will be able to boost our website Search Engine Optimization as well as offering banner advertisements and advertising packages to our audience, which will help the website fund itself. This money would be able to go straight back into funding our competitions and giveaways, benefiting you - the Chaos Hour audience.\nA Site Built By Writers For Writers\nWorking with new and emerging writers, Chaos Hour gives budding journalists the chance to see their work published on a professional site while reaching a high viewership. With your help we will be able to implement a better search and tagging system allowing our writers to better show off their work via their own personal \u2018Writer\u2019s Page\u2019 or portfolio of work. Writers for the site will also be given \u2018achievement\u2019 style rewards for writing a certain amount of articles/on a certain day of the year, etc... While the site remains a voluntary project for our writers, this will make it much more fun and rewarding for them.\nFINAL HOURS EXCLUSIVE REWARDS\nGENERAL REWARDS & PERKS\nThis project was helped by www.kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re confident that should our Kickstarter project get funded, we\u2019ll be able to significantly improve our website almost immediately.

As Chaos Hour is already live, any changes that will be made to the site will be visible to the backers almost immediately. We will also be communicating heavily with our funders to let them know exactly where their contributions are being spent.\n\nIn regards to rewards featuring the work of artists, crafters and independent business (such as comic books, films etc) and items which need to be signed, we will endeavor to get these out to backers as soon as they are available to us from the various individuals. However, we will be attempting to collect all items at least a week before the funding deadline (if it looks like we will be successful, of course) so that we can try to get them out to our backers ASAP.\n\nIf your reward package calls for a custom made item, i.e. an art commission or sketch card, these will take a little bit longer to get to you as we will be waiting on the artist. However, we plan to get these out as quickly as we can.\n\nAdvertising packages will be available as soon as the new and improved website is up and running and we have communicated with the backers to discuss their objectives and received their graphics. If they wish to use their packages at a later date (E.g. If some one has purchased a month\u2019s worth of the site theme and wish to use it the month that their book/film/comic/game is coming out, we will be happy to delay your request until that time.)
