The first of a proposed comprehensive trilogy ('SILVER' and 'BRONZE') of art books, featuring a huge selection of work from over thirty five years in the comics industry by artist and writer Liam Sharp. Backers will also receive an all-new creator-owned 25 page comic, 'The Chronicles of Lib LaRoche', written and lavishly illustrated by Liam, completely free! And on top of that they'll receive an exclusive collectable card from a planned Tarot deck used in the Lib LaRoche universe.\n\nENCORE: GOLD features an incredible introduction by legendary writer Grant Morrison, a creator profile by renowned journalist and interviewer Geoff Boucher, and is a showcase of some of Liam's all-time favorite pieces.\nENCORE: GOLD - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp hardback cover mock-up\nBIOG\nLiam recently wrapped his ground-breaking and acclaimed epic 24 issue run on DC's The Green Lantern with Grant Morrison, and is currently working on Batman: Reptilian with superstar writer Garth Ennis. But before that, and before his award-winning six issue limited series 'The Brave and The Bold: Batman and Wonder Woman' (which he also wrote) and before the wildly successful 'Wonder Woman: Rebirth' with fan-favorite writer Greg Rucka, Liam had a long and distinguished career as an artist and also a writer of both comics and prose fiction. He has also been a well-regarded boutique publisher, co-founding both the Mam Tor imprint and the ground-breaking digital company Madefire. \nLiam has worked for Marvel, DC,Vertigo, Wildstorm, Image, Darkhorse, Fleetway and Dynamite, producing a huge range of eclectic work in every imaginable genre. Encore - The Art of Liam Sharp  is intended to celebrate this long, creatively restless and innovative career, and will be a must-have book for collectors, fans and new-comers alike. As Grant Morrison writes in his introduction -\n\n'Knowing the standards (Liam) sets for himself, witnessing first-hand the constant striving for new goals, new achievements, I\u2019d hazard a guess he has barely begun the latest phase of his artistic journey, is only now stretching his peacock wings as we his audience are invited to sit back and applaud the dazzling display\u2026'\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp book with dust jacket mock-up\nABOUT THE BOOK\nAvailable with or without the Conan dust jacket, ENCORE 'GOLD' showcases work from across Liam's extensive career, presenting much of the hyper-detailed art in it's black and white unlettered form for the first time in print - from the spectacular high fantasy of THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN, to the incredibly intricate sci-fi realms of THE GREEN LANTERN. \nWithin these pages you will also find many examples of Liam's full-color work - both traditional and digital - which pays homage to the masters of the past whilst also pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in the industry.\nThe cover to Liam's 'THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN' series. Colors here by Romulo Fajardo JR.\nCatwoman Cover\n'MOULDERING STONES' featuring Red Sonja. A personal piece that ended up being a cover for Dynamite Comics.\nJudges Dredd, Death and Anderson from a poster produced for a feature on the artist in the Megazine.\nPromotional art for Liam's Manthing series with writer J.M.DeMatteis for Marvel - a favourite series for both creators\nEASTER EGGS!\nThe book also promises to contain a host of un-lockable Easter Eggs, linking to (amongst other things) a film shot by Liam's son, Lorcan, where he talks about his career, techniques and life-lessons. \n There will also be a unique opportunity to receive one of Liam's huge (18\" x 24\") original black and white pages (see below) from his iconic Green Lantern run with Grant Morrison for the first person to break a hidden code within the pages! \nSeason 1, page 10, issue 10 of THE GREEN LANTERN - unlock the code hidden in the pages of ENCORE 'GOLD' to win this page!\nABOUT THE COMIC\nAs the first stretch goal was unlocked, along with the book backers will now receive a free 25 page comic, featuring all-new material, and telling the origin of Liam's character Lib LaRoche - a gothic female Conan in a new-weird world of sci-fi and fantasy elements (previewed below!) \nLib LaRoche: Jubileumboek preview art\nPage from Lib LaRoche - placeholder lettering only\nLib LaRoche sample page - placeholder lettering only\nOFFERS\nENCORE 'GOLD' comes with multiple options:\nPDF only\nWithout dust jacket\nWith Conan dust jacket\nDust jacket and signature only\nDust jacket, signature and remark\nDust jacket, signature and exclusive bookplate \nDust jacket, signature with remark and exclusive bookplate\nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original head sketch (3 options) \nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original torso sketch (3 options) \n50% off for retail orders of 10X basic hardback and dust jacket edition\nExamples of previous torso sketches by the artist.\nFUTURE VOLUMES \nENCORE 'GOLD' 'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' box set mock-up\nENCORE 'SILVER\", the second volume, will be a celebration of the intricacy of pure black and white comic art.\nENCORE 'BRONZE\", the final volume, will feature a complete retrospective of Liam's career, from assisting the great Don Lawrence, through 2000ad, Marvel, Image, DC, and beyond. Over a series of interviews Liam talks to writer and teacher Dave Gillette about the trials and tribulations, good times and bad, and about the masters of the past that inspired him, and the artistic heroes that eventually became his friends. For comic historians it promises to be a goldmine, for aspiring artists there'll be a chance to hear first hand what it is like having a long career in comics and the visual arts.\n'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' are slated for publication late 2021 and 2022 respectively. \nThe slip case will be available for purchase with the third and final volume.\n\nBOOK SPECIFICATIONS\nENCORE - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP 'GOLD\"\nHardback with optional dust jacket\n144 pages\n7.5\" x 11\"\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow everybody who buys ENCORE:GOLD also gets the first ever 25 page Lib LaRoche comic free with the book, and what's more it will be signed by artist/author Liam Sharp!\nLib LaRoche comic #0 cover mock-up - not final art.\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow included with the book and comic will be one of a set of six cards, of increasing rarity! Five of them will be picture cards from the world of Lib LaRoche. The sixth will be a simple gold design with a QR code on it that will gift the owner something completely unique! \nOnly FIVE of the GOLDEN CARDS will be sent randomly into the world with the books, for you to discover!\nMock-up of the Lib LaRoche card set\nA brand new set will also be available with both ENCORE:SILVER and ENCORE:BRONZE.\nHuge thanks, as always, from Liam and all of us in Team Sharpy! \nTS\nFINAL STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nAfter asking around we decided on the final stretch goal, and it's going to be a great one for everybody who has backed this campaign. \nUltimately the free comic is fun, and the cards will be collectable and beautiful (more on that shortly!) but those things often get lost over time, and what's left is the book.\nSo with that in mind -\nTHE BOOK\nHaving hit $110K the book will have a page-holder ribbon, an embossed cover, and the dust jacket will have an added metallic ink. It already has heavy, high-end paper of the finest quality, and will be stitched and not glued. It will truly be a beautiful product!\nTHANK YOU ALL so much for the incredible support!!!\n\nBut also-\n\nUPDATE ON THE CARDS\nWhat I didn't say before, and what you are now just learning, is that Lib LaRoche uses cards as part of her character trait - no spoilers! There will only be two hundred copies only of each of the first five cards that will have a gold surround. So everybody who buys this book will automatically get one rare collectable card that will never be reproduced with the gold border again! ENCORE:SILVER will do five more new cards in silver, and ENCORE:BRONZE another five in (you guessed it!) bronze.\nAfter that we are planning to create a deck of cards, the tarot set of Lib's realm, that can be used as regular tarot cards, or traded. These will feature the same cards that come with the three books, but without the gold, silver and bronze surround.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs most of the art already exists and the majority of the book has already been compiled, there is very little that could delay the production of the book(s), baring production issues, and the unforeseeable happening to Liam that might prevent him completing the all-new content promised. \nAt the very least there are already five original unpublished pages, and the book can be filled out with other material from his career in the event of an accident or illness.

That's why, when Chris Moreno (Zombie Dickheads, World War Hulk: Front Line) decided to follow up our beloved The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, we developed Stoned Master, a blend of stoner comedy, kung fu action, and sun-drenched Los Angeles vibes chockablock with anti-gentrification rumination.\nStoned Master #1 is a 32-page, full-color comic book, the first of a planned five-part series cocreated by Chris and me, with letters by Taylor Esposito and logo by Tim Daniel.

And the only ones standing in their way? Burnout kung fu savant Frankie Wong, his drunken master, and his pals from the local cannabis dispensary. \nImagine Kung Fu Hustle meets Pineapple Express. Or, for the old heads, Drunken Master meets Cheech & Chong. It's all the intense, artful fight scenes you expect from a martial arts epic, combined with gut-busting stoner comedy laughs, then fully baked in the Southern California sun.\nWhile working together on The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, Chris and I found ourselves jonesing for an opportunity to cut loose, free of the restrictions that come with nonfiction work. We wanted space and freedom for big, intense, outlandish action and hilarious visual comedy.\nStoned Master is our opportunity to show off, demonstrating all our strengths on a truly gonzo comic, all in service of actual good politics. With your help, we're going to make it happen, with any additional money raised spent how it rightfully should be: Paying the team more.\nCHARACTER DESIGNS\nAs part of his efforts to make Stoned Master's Chavez Heights setting feel real, authentic, and lived in, Chris put in a ton of design work, creating characters that feel unique and visually distinct while remaining authentic and familiar.\nREWARDS!\nSlap it on your bong\nDare you to hang it up at work\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nWHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE MONEY?\n$25,000: Everybody gets raises\nIn order to make Stoned Master happen, everyone's agreed to a lower rate; Aubrey isn\u2019t taking a page rate at all!

Rose, Poppy, and Violet Hawthorn had an unusual upbringing. Their mother, Jasmine, was the daughter of Nazi hunters and indoctrinated into La R\u00e9sistance after WW2. After moving to the United States, Jasmine settled down and had three daughters, but her hard-lived past caught up with her.\nThe Deadliest Bouquet explores the relationships these sisters have with each other and their complicated bond with their mother.

Poppy\u2019s husband, Derek, is oblivious to her family\u2019s history and Poppy\u2019s training. He just thinks she\u2019s a stay at home mom and part-time bookkeeper. Poppy is a Cancer.\nArt by Carola Borelli\nRose feels obligated to help Jasmine run the flower shop since she's the oldest and most responsible. She resents her sisters for leaving and having lives of their own. Rose is a Capricorn.\nArt by Carola Borelli\nJasmine was trained in the art of espionage and assassination by her parents who were part of La R\u00e9sistance in WW2. She lived all over the world hunting down escaped Nazis with her family but left after her brother's death on a particular mission.

In a creative endeavor of this size, possible challenges could be delays in production or printing depending on the current situation with the quarantine, considering we ship overseas. However, we have successfully Kickstarted multiple projects before as creators AND as a team, which has given us the utmost confidence that we'll meet and exceed your expectations, no matter what is happening in the world. When hiccups are hit, we send updates. When we receive our shipment, we get them our to backers immediately without delay. I mean, why would we want to hold onto the books when we're so eager for YOU to read them?\n\nOne thing that we can't control is customs charges and the price of international shipping. We pay more for international shipping than we charge, but some countries will charge an extra customs fee based on the prices of the items included.

And we certainly hope you finished all the grimoires and spell books on your summer reading list.\nYou only skimmed them? Oo, too bad, because we're starting out with a pop quiz. First question: If you summon a demonic familiar, how far away from you can that frustrating little imp actually go? Not as far as you thought? If you'd done the reading, you might've realized how difficult that limited range would be to work with on school grounds, where the strict ban on demonic familiars may leave you suspended before first period's even over.\nSecond question: What are three short-sighted teens and their terrible imp to do?\nIssue 2 Cover\nCreated by Jordan Alsaqa and Ray Nadine, the second issue of Raise Hell! brings school back in session with even more haunted hijinks and coming-of-age comedy. Because even in a world of demonic curses, witch covens, and literal human soul food, high school remains a proving ground of messy emotions, dorky teachers, and trying to just make it out alive.\nIssue Two follows Victor, Miri, and Reeves dealing with all that and more as they struggle to find a way to hide their troublemaking demon Alistair from staff and student alike. With Ali unable to venture more than 100 feet from any of the teens, the day becomes a gauntlet of near-misses and desperate searches to find a permanent solution to their problem.\nOh, and Victor can't wait to finally join the paranormally inclined Spectral Science Club! He... may not be as focused on the task at hand as he should be. It's going to be a long first day...\nWith this campaign, our goal is to raise funding to complete and print physical copies of Raise Hell!: Issue 2. As a thank you for supporting the project, we have a number of reward levels, including digital and physical copies of Raise Hell!: Issue 2, a brand-new mixtape pin, script edits from Jordan, and physical commissions from Ray. At the top level, you can even appear in the book as a student or staff member of Eklund High School! And for new readers, we've got numerous catch-up reward packages and add-ons that'll let you grab everything you may have missed out on in the first campaign.\nIncluded below is a special preview of the issue!\nAnd if you're new to the party, you can get a look an even more art with a preview of the first issue below!\nClick through for that first issue goodness!\nPRAISE FOR RAISE HELL!\n--\"Raise Hell! is a fresh, whimsical take on teenage life combined with what we've always wanted - blood sacrifices, demon spawns, and a wicked fun time.

High school can be one of the toughest times in your life, but this book is sure to remind you of the great friends who got you through it. Nerd.\u201d - Mark Stack (Young Offenders!)\n--\"Raise Hell! returns for issue #2 featuring another ingeniously funny script from Jordan Alsaqa and more vivacious neon-soaked art from Ray Nadine. The attention to detail the team puts into Victor, Miri, & Ali pays dividends big time by giving us one of the most charming and engaging cast of friends in comics. Back Raise Hell! with extreme confidence!\" -Frankee White (20 Fists, Starless Daydream)\nBACK-UP STORY\nIn addition to the main story, issue two of Raise Hell! is foregoing the stretch goal entirely and adding in a guaranteed eight-page back-up! The story will be written by Jordan and drawn by our first guest artist, Kelsi Jo Silva!\nWhereas the first issue's \"Demon King of Ska\" put Victor's musical passion in the spotlight, it's Miri who'll take the stage for this issue's \"Clothes Make the 'Mon\". Dissatisfied with every piece of clothing she makes for Ali, Miri realizes to make the best demonic clothing, she's going to need some demonic materials. The pair sets out for a special market that exists between realities, where one off-handed comment is all it takes to set off a rivalry between tailors of the insectoid and arachnoid persuasions.\nThe back-up story's rival tailors, designed by guest artist Kelsi Jo Silva\nTake a look below at the first page of inks from the story, and see more at her website!\nAli experiencing all the lows of mid-00s fashion.\nWriter Jordan Alsaqa (he/him) is an N.C. State graduate with a degree in Creative Writing. He\u2019s successfully funded numerous comics through Kickstarter, including Terminal Protocol, Finding Peace, and We Have to Go Back, as well as the first issue of Raise Hell!. His rural horror comic, Welderkin, co-created with Joni Miller, was published digitally by Comicker Press. His work can also be found in numerous anthologies, including Alloy Anthology: Electrum from Ascend Comics and You Died from Iron Circus Comics. Jordan\u2019s junior year of high school was spent doodling stick figures, helping run a Creative Writing Club, and failing to appreciate all the bottomless wells of energy that youth has to offer. You can keep up with Jordan's other projects on Twitter and at his website.\nArtist Ray Nadine (they/them) has been drawing since they could hold a pencil, and has been making comics since 2013. They're currently working on a graphic novel for Dark Horse that they're contractually obliged not to say much more about, and also illustrated Messenger on Webtoon. They've had stories featured in a handful of anthologies, notably Everything Is Going Wrong (edited by Mark!) and Local Haunts, edited by Kara Lais.  Ray's also created the webcomic Dollhouse, and several short comics including Anchored, The Collector, The Ties That Bind, and Something Had Changed. When Ray isn't working, they're playing too much Final Fantasy XIV, watching anime, or rough-housing with their cat. Their favorite band is My Chemical Romance and they still listen to all the same crap they listened to in high school. Keep up with their art and projects on Twitter and their website.\nEditor Mark Bouchard (they/them) is a non-binary writer/editor in Chicago, by way of New England who has been self-publishing comics since 2016. They are the editor and creator of EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG: Comics On Punk & Mental Illness, and their writing has been published in a number of comic anthologies including A Wave Blue World\u2019s Dead Beats. They are currently writing a horror graphic novella due out in early 2021. Outside of comics, Mark enjoys curry and black coffee, often at the same time. They also write satire for The Hard Times and Hard Drive. You can follow them on Twitter for updates on their work and their dog, Juicebox. To read their short comics, and learn more about their past work, visit their website.\nGuest Artist Kelsi Jo Silva (she/her) is an artist and illustrator based out of Denver, Co. She has been muddling her way through the process of getting a creative career off the ground since graduating from the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in 2014. Kelsi has worked on a number of odd projects and jobs but is most notably the illustrator for the Ela Cat series of children\u2019s book published by Good Luck Black Cat Books\u2014the first of which won both a MoonBeam award and a CIPPA EVVY award for illustration. In the last three years, Kelsi has shifted her focus from Children\u2019s books to comics, which are her true passion. She's self-published a few short stories and had the opportunity to pitch a multitude of projects with an array of talented writers. Kelsi revels in the fact that she gets to spend her days drawing and her evenings re-watching Star Trek. It's truly a dream. To see more of her work, check out her Twitter and website.\nFor funding, approximately $1500 will go towards paying the remaining page rates for Ray and Kelsi Jo for  drawing, coloring, and lettering their respective stories. Roughly $1000 will go towards printing the book itself, with an additional $300 going towards producing the new campaign rewards, and potentially reprinting some of the old ones. Finally, another $1000 will go towards shipping and fulfillment costs, while the final approximate 10% will go towards Kickstarter fees. Any additional funds will go towards reimbursing Jordan's initial investment before any possible stretch goals. These rates are based directly on our final totals from the previous campaign, so we are confident they should accurately reflect what we'll need for fulfillment.\nBelow, you can get the full rundown of all the various reward levels available for the campaign. As always, we've done our best to make sure that every backer, however big or small, is getting plenty of bang for their buck, in addition to our eternal (infernal?) gratitude.

At this level, you'll receive all five mixtape pins (Ska, Pretentious, Anime, Retrowave, Study Vibes) at a discounted overall price.

However, the current campaign estimates are built with a significant buffer to account for this possibility, and our goal is to begin printing rewards as soon as the funding hits our account. These estimates have also been updated based on final totals from the previous Raise Hell! campaign.

But unknown to the league of heroes who protect the innocent, this world has a cancer growing at its heart. A pantheon of elder gods is starting to awaken. These timeless forces of supernature once claimed dominion over a primordial Earth\u2026 and they have returned to reclaim what is theirs. Super-powered heroes\u2014and villains\u2014find themselves struggling against unimaginable horror to save the planet. It is a hopeless battle.\n\nIn BEYOND MORTAL--written by Cullen Bunn, illustrated and colored by Danny Luckert, and lettered by Simon Bowland--the superheroes (and villains) of a new comic book universe will collide with a new pantheon of alien deities from beyond our understanding of reality. \n\nThe unstoppable force of the Leviathan will collide with the immovable object of the world's most powerful superheroes in an unflinching tale of ultimate horror and ultimate sacrifice. \n\nSuperheroes versus elder gods.\nCover A\nOur heroes include COMMANDER COMET, the cosmic defender; MOTHER NATURE, the avatar of Gaia; TORPEDA, the queen of the undersea kingdom of Abyssia; DEVILX, the masked vigilante from the streets of Empire City; and THE SECRET, the master of mysticism! They are the members of the fabled ALLIANCE, a group of heroes who have banded together to face the most impossible challenges.\n\nBut the heroes aren't working alone! They can't face ultimate darkness by themselves! In order to stand against the Leviathan, they must make allies with their greatest enemies--villains like VALDERI, SPLIT-SECOND, SPRIGGAN, TOXIC, KRAKEN, and many more!\n\nAn entirely new superhero universe will be springing to life in this comic! Over the course of the campaign, we'll be introducing you to the characters through regular updates!\nConcept Art for Commander Comet, DevilX, Mother Nature, and Torpeda\nThe Leviathan are a pantheon of alien elder gods that have set their many baleful eyes on Earth. THE UNWANTED WHISPER, THE CRAWLING PESTILENCE, THE FACELESS PROPHET, THE CHATTERING MAW, THE HORDE MOTHER, THE UNDONE CHILD, THE CALLER FROM THE VOID, and many more terrible beings are rising from the darkness between the stars!\n\nInspired by the Cthulhu Mythos, the Leviathan are a new group of awful deities to inspire the most horrific of nightmares!\nThis is a story that Danny and Cullen have been developing for years, and they are thrilled to be able to bring it to you in this format! All artwork for this issue is COMPLETE! By the time the campaign wraps up, all pages will be lettered. By the time funds are transferred, final designs will be completed and the book will be ready for the printer. That means digital versions of the book go out as soon as funds are transferred!

Especially C\u00e1ssia Costa.\nAn ancient cult and their army of demons have stolen C\u00e1ssia\u2019s home, Apex City.  When a magical dragon bracelet rockets into her life and affixes itself to her arm, C\u00e1ssia\u2019s the only person equipped to stop the cult from offering the entire city to their dark lord.\nThere's just one catch...\nInferno Girl Red by Nicola Scott (w/ Annette Kwok), left, and Valeria Favoccia, right\nThe magical bracelet is powered by belief, and C\u00e1ssia \u2014 an intensely pragmatic, rational girl \u2013 doesn\u2019t have much to spare. She\u2019ll have to find something to kindle her faith, though, and fast \u2014because she has a secret legacy to live up to. Because her mother's life is on the line. And because Apex City needs Inferno Girl Red.\nHi! My name's Mat Groom. And this story, INFERNO GIRL RED, is one I\u2019ve been working on for about three years now. I\u2019ve always thought it was worthwhile, but I was never certain it would work\u2026 until I met Erica D\u2019Urso. Erica is just wickedly talented. You can see that in her work on JAMES BOND, CAPTAIN MARVEL and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS. But it was her energy, her tremendous passion, that made me believe. Erica loves C\u00e1ssia, and C\u00e1ssia\u2019s world\u2026 and that love infuses every part of this project. There\u2019s nobody I would rather be co-creating this world with.\n\nInferno Girl Red Character Design\nTogether with colorist Igor Monti (who has a ultra-modern and vibrant style you'll recognise if you read MEGA MAN: FULLY CHARGED), letterer Becca Carey (a real star-in-the-making) and design agency For The People (a Top 10 Global Agency, according to D&AD), Erica and I are so excited to bring you this all-new 100-page superhero graphic novel.\nINFERNO GIRL RED Creative Team\nKyle Higgins is editing this book. Kyle and I have been friends for half a decade, at this point. He has mentored me, in many ways (he edited my first comics series SELF/MADE), and more recently we\u2019ve worked as a writing team on ULTRAMAN for Marvel Comics. We share a passion for the Japanese tokusatsu genre (which was a big influence here, along with British boarding school dramas and American superhero comics). And there\u2019s little coincidence that C\u00e1ssia was first introduced to the world in the back of the first issue of Kyle\u2019s series, RADIANT BLACK. In fact, the connections between RADIANT BLACK and INFERNO GIRL RED may run deeper than you think\u2026\nC\u00e1ssia\u2019s not shy\u2013 but bouncing around from city-to-city as her Mom bounced from job-to-job meant it was hard to make friends... and any friends she did make disappeared pretty quickly once they found out who C\u00e1ssia\u2019s mother was. So instead of socialising, she focused on learning\u2013 showing a particular aptitude for science.\n\nC\u00e1ssia Costa Character Design\n \n                     Now C\u00e1ssia has a chance for a fresh start in Apex City. Her impressive test scores have earned her an invitation to the world-famous entrepreneur Doctor Janine Caro\u2019s prestigious boarding school for promising young minds. There, C\u00e1ssia starts to settle in. She starts to make friends. She starts to see a future for herself.\nBut when a magical bracelet blasts through a window while C\u00e1ssia is studying late one night, everything changes. C\u00e1ssia's quickly drawn into a strange war that she previously only heard about from her mother... \nConcept Art \u2013 The Griffin and Other Manifestations of Darkness\nConcept Art \u2013 C\u00e1ssia's Mom, and Other Mentors\nConcept Art \u2013 New Friends\n\nReady to experience some of the story?

In Sparrow, we follow the story of an 18 year old high school senior, Alaina Yuen. Alaina is the daughter of legendary heroes Red Falcon and the Sentinel, founding members of a superhero team once known as the Knight Guard. When catastrophe struck, the team found themselves disbanded, the world no longer had heroes.  Present day, Alaina finds it increasingly difficult to obey her fathers wishes and ignore her legacy.  When a new threat comes to her city, Alaina finds herself in the middle of a dark mystery. She'll have to go at odds with her father as she becomes Sparrow and fights this new wave of villainy.  \n\n  Thank you for checking out our page! Like I said before, I've been developing this universe since 2011! It's a huge passion project for me to bring this new take on superheroes to the world! SO, our kickstarter is going to printing and getting this book to you in a high quality, and paying for some awesome variant covers! I hope you all will come along on this journey with me to see how Alaina balances high school life,  crushing on the coolest girl in school, and continuing her parents legacy as... SPARROW!\n\nFUNDED!! stretch goals time!\n So we hit our goal! It's stretch goal time now! Our first stretch goal is going to be an awesome prequel comic starring Red Falcon, the Sentinel and the Knight Guard! The goal is 4750! For this epic story I wanted equally epic artists to help me out! So, we've got @FellHound_ from Commander Rao doing an incredible cover and our amazing variant cover artist @Cemiroz doing 6 awesome pages! Both are on Twitter with those @'s! You don't wanna miss out on this awesome bonus story!\n\nSTRETCH GOAL #2\nTrading cards, stickers, and bookmarks! The cost looks like $850 for the printing and paying my artists. So we're going to need to get to $5850 I reckon!  Here\u2019s the first card for our villain Mystery Man! It is badass! This was illustrated by the incredible @cemiroz on twitter!\nMystery Man trading card\nVariant cover #1\n\nPREVIEW PAGES\nWhat an opening! We hope that got you eager to read more! So, here's a little info on our characters, starting with our leading lady!\nAlaina Yuen, AKA Sparrow is your average high school girl. Except she can bench press a car! Alaina inherited some of her mothers ( The Sentinel ) powers.  She's super strong, super fast and pretty much always super late for class. \nFor years, Alaina followed her fathers rules, that she were not to pursue the life he once led. As we come to find out in issue 1, though, this rule is becoming increasingly difficult to follow. With new dangers emerging, Alaina will have to disobey her fathers wishes and drive a wedge between them doing so. \n\nJames Yuen, AKA Red Falcon. A broken man after the loss of his wife, James retires the Red Falcon mantle and effectively the Knight Guard.  Years after the incident, James would go on to find a new way to help people, as old habits are hard to break. He establishes the Sentinel Security Organization. A new government department dedicated to protecting the world from its largest threats.  When James learns of a new vigilante, he finds his organization at odds with the person closest to him...\n\nAh, the villain of our story. No one knows who this up-and-comer truly is. He's dubbed the Mystery Man by the criminal underworld and the police. He's got a sense for flair and elegance in his crimes, but that doesn't mean he's afraid to get his hands dirty.  All people really know is that he's a force to be reckoned with since coming into town, and it seems like he's got very big plans. \n\nTHE TEAM\nI'm Kal Huset, a 23 year old artist and writer. Simply put, the team is mainly myself on writing and art, along with some script and editing help from my wife Alex Payton-Huset and friend Jordan Davis. I've been drawing and creating stories as long as I can remember.  And ever since I got gifted my first comic, it was one of the Tim Drake Robin one-shots before getting his ongoing, I've wanted to create my own! So to be here is extremely humbling.\n\nWHY THIS STORY?\nSo, I know superheroes is probably the least indie thing you could probably do, but it's one of my passions and missions to bring something new to the scene.  And I feel somewhat obligated to get this universe started, as I have been building it since 2011.  But this initial comic has gone through a whole lot of changes throughout the years! What was initially a pretty standard superhero story starring the Red Falcon has now evolved into a legacy story about the relationship between father and daughter. \n      See, in the last few years I became the father to three awesome kids. Two are adopted and recently we had our newest son.  I started thinking, would if Red Falcon had a child? Fatherhood had such a profound effect on me, I could only imagine if these epic heroes I created had children . So was born Alaina/Sparrow! Going through just as many designs and iterations to get to this point. Alaina is softly modeled around my daughter, sharing the same name even! When Alaina(my daughter) was born, she was months early and had to spend months in the NICU recovering. This little girl has overcame so much and is the strongest little girl I've ever met, she inspires me. And that's the kind of feelings I put into writing Sparrow and the kind of feeling and response I hope to evoke in others.\n\nREWARDS\n $1 -Thanks!

With guidance from a mysterious tribe of \"lost people\", Rebecca rises from the ashes as the bloodthirsty vigilante \u201cMia\u201d, hellbent on revenge.\nComplete DIY Experience with about 3 person total crew yet able to deliver stunts, horses, & multiple locations.\n DID YOU KNOW?\n*\"Vengeance Turns\" is OVER 2 Hours long!\n*UNRATED-- but would be \"Hard R\" for Violence, Language & Nudity\n*Features a Diverse Cast and Female Lead?\n*Has an Original Graphic Novel coming in Winter 2021?\n The Genesis of \"Vengeance Turns\" ! \nWe started working on this over four years ago! Robert Christopher Smith, a lifelong fan of spaghetti western movies like \u201cA Fistful of Dollars\u201d, \u201cA Few Dollars More\u201d, and \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d, wrote the basic story in late 2016. \nCo-writer Amanda Fry was originally going to also star as \"Rebecca/Mia Falcon\"!\nThe first person he ever discussed that story with was David Ruano, whom he met at a Thanksgiving party where neither really wanted to be. Ruano also had thoughts of making a western film. They sat and discussed Western movies, stories and what it took to film one, deciding that they should work together. This partnership would remain in place over time, and despite whatever else they might have worked on independently or as collaborators, \u201cVengeance Turns\u201d grew and grew. \nBecause Smith wanted a female lead, it was decided that the screen story and rough first draft of the screenplay would wait until a FEMALE co-writer was brought on board.\nA Strong Female Lead, A FEROCIOUS Female Co-Writer: Meet Amanda Fry\nAside from various creative pursuits, co-writer Amanda founded and remains active with \"The Borderland 100 Club\" supporting families of fallen first responders.\n Meeting former El Paso Police Officer, Amanda Fry, proved to be exactly what the story and script needed. Instead of simply shoehorning a \u201cmale story\u201d into one that is female-led and driven, it was important to all involved that the VIOLENCE, especially, should be considered and executed as it would by a female. When Fry was originally brought on board, it was with the idea that she would both co-develop the story and star in the leading role as Rebecca/Mia Falcon. \nNeedless to say, Smith and Fry had a blast writing all this mayhem together! Some of the most brutal scenes in the movie sprang directly from the mind of Amanda Fry, on occasion even shocking Smith himself! (Wait until you see the fate of a bad guy named Bronson-- and what made it to the screen is only a fraction of what Smith and Fry originally put to the page based on Fry\u2019s ideas for the sequence!) She directed her first  short film,  \"CUT\"  (and this  BTS Video ), alongside Smith and Ruano when originally scouting locations. While there, Smith shot this original  \"Vengeance Turns Sizzle Reel\"   with Amanda as \"Mia\" in Bandera, TX in 2017.\n \"Vengeance Turns Radio Show & Podcast\"\nFour years of development led to many opportunities to refine the story, as well as exposing it to a growing number of people. Not ones to be deterred, Smith and Ruano treated the lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic in California as an opportunity, and revised the story again. This time, the  \"Vengeance Turns Radio Show & Podcast\" was born. \nThe print on the right was painted by Ken Meyer, Jr. as a promotional print.\n The \"Vengeance Turns Radio Show & Podcast\" was a pleasant surprise! We had a lot of fun recording it over four weekly livestream shows, then RCS edited over about another month. The shows were very well received after going live, causing the largest surge of interest in \"Vengeance Turns\", even causing our  IMDB Page  rating to reach levels reserved for films with much larger budgets and/or \"name-brand stars\". This surge led to the movie being made. \nSHOT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC & Other Challenges!\n Strangely, it was only while the world was falling apart for so many that Smith and his collaborators would finally be approached with an opportunity to get the movie on film! The budget would be far less than any of them had ever dreamed but under the circumstances, the decision was an easy one.\nChallenges pursued the whole team throughout the production. The producer who got the ball rolling bailed on the project, literally sneaking away into the night only about a week before principal photography was starting! Smith, in his relentlessness, found another producer who stepped in and made promises of replacing the locations and securing funds that had evaporated with the disappearance of the previous producer. The second producer failed to live up to their word as well, also fleeing the project. This left Smith, Ruano and collaborators with a movie IN PRODUCTION, partly filmed and suddenly having all its budget and locations again ripped away.\nThe enthusiasm for the project from ALL involved on the cast and crew resulted in a synergistic tenacity that continued to compel the film forward. Every single person involved began to scrape up what they could, calling everyone they knew, and begging anyone who would listen to help get the movie finished.\nThat group effort worked and the movie was shot over 17 days during October 2020.  Even with every curveball thrown at them, the entire cast and crew even made it through in a COVID-safe manner as well. The group developed their own protocols. Each member of cast and crew was tested and provided a negative test result before filming, then stayed in their own bubbles while on call. Everyone wore masks everywhere except in front of the camera and had their temperatures taken and recorded each day. Following wrap, everyone was tested again and provided us with negative test results as they received them.\n SUCH Wonderful Locations!\n We shot the movie in Lake Elsinore, DTLA, Koreatown, Gardena, Littlerock (Old West Town), and Big Bear, CA.\nLake Elsinore, DTLA, Koreatown, Littlerock CA, and Big Bear all on a shoestring budget!\nIn the PICTURE above: \n Sept 17 in Lake Elsinore. 1st day also shot opening sequence!\nDTLA Warehouse-- Building our \"barn\" for the climactic scene.\nKoreatown-- This house was built in 1912 and the Falcon's was supposed to be 1876. Just one of many compromises.\nMalibu Horse Ranch-- A big part of our budget went to spending 2 days to get our shots on and around horses.\nLittlerock, CA-- We also shot two days in Littlerock at an \"old west town\" for the general store, the saloon and the chapel (you will LOVE the chapel).\nGardena, CA -- We spent one whole day shooting all the scenes that are internal shots for the Ewa'as and tents/teepees.  All of this was in the backyard of our Director of Photography David Ruano's parents!\nBig Bear, CA-- This was the most beautiful two days of the whole shoot. A lot of the external wooded scenes around the \"Lost People\" camp were shot here. We even shot an entire nighttime sequence with a fight scene!\nOur Progress & Why We Need Your Support!\nSince November, the movie has gone through two edits, and is currently undergoing its third for detail work. We really have nearly EVERYTHING done! There are two key sequences that are heavier with VFX, though and additional SFX and sound details to be completed as well.\nWe want you to JOIN US in submitting \"Vengeance Turns: The Motion Picture\" to Film Festivals, and we are very focused on making \"South by Southwest (SXSW)\" our Premiere!  We want to be at these events with \"Vengeance Turns\" and we want your name on the screen at every single one--YOUR HELP MATTERS!\nDIVERSITY IN CASTING\nWhile the intent was to produce an epic, action-filled western and never to make a \"message movie\", the concept of diversity in gender, ethnicity and belief has been built into \"Vengeance Turns\" from its inception.  The lead character \"Rebecca/Mia\" is of partial Kumeyaay heritage and female, played by Paola Luelmo who was born in Mexico.\nAs \"Rebecca/Mia\", Paola is joined by her co-star Azeem Vecchio who plays Simon Coletrain. Once they are among the \"Lost People\", they are joined by an intentionally mixed group, led by \"Delicate Poison\" and \"Ghost with Silent Knives Protects\" who are children of a Kumeyaay mother and a father born in India; they are played by Kelsey Jaffer and Nevin Millan who both have parents born in Pakistan.  The character, Gloria, is of unknown Asian ancestry-- having been kidnapped into slavery as a child; she is played by Catherine Bo-Eun Song, a Korean-American female actor.\nThe rest of the cast is heavily populated by females, and individuals of about every background and orientation. Smith's feeling has always been \"the right person for the role is the right person for the role\" going so far as to rewrite characters entirely (from gender to ethnicity and more) to better suit the actor playing them, consulting with them in the process.\nMEET OUR STARS! \nPaola Luelmo plays Rebecca Falcon who after being left for dead finds new life as \"Mia\", a bloodthirsty vigilante hellbent on revenge!\n Paola Luelmo plays \"Rebecca/Mia Falcon\". Rebecca Falcon starts as a woman with strong opinions but who is somewhat reluctant to express them. In particular, she is partly of Kumeyaay heritage which she admits to knowing little about due to her father having \"whitewashed\" her thoroughly. This was as much for her protection as it was out of his own racial ignorance-- The Old West was a very dangerous place for Natives during the late 1800's. As is mentioned by characters in the movie, they are basically considered and treated as vermin to be exterminated. When Rebecca hears the gossip that it is Kumeyaay killing the families in their town, she tries to defend them but is so upset that she runs away. Later, we meet the murderous marauders masquerading as natives and they certainly are not Kumeyaay. After her attack, Mia is taken to a group believed to be Kumeyaay where she is healed and trained.\nPaola did almost all her own stunts, and trained  (See Paola train!) for two key scenes that take place in the \"Warrior's Circle\" during her training.\nAzeem Vecchio remarkably transforms his character, Simon Coletrain, from a victimized child to a man of honor throughout \"Vengeance Turns\"!\n Azeem Vecchio plays \"Simon Coletrain\". Simon experiences quite a transformative arc of his own in \"Vengeance Turns\". When we first meet him, he is so weak in the presence of his father that he literally can barely stand. However by the end of the movie, the character has grown to such a degree that he not only loses his fear of his father but confronts him unflinchingly. Simon will have audiences cheering before they leave the theater!\nNevin Millan embodied the role of \"Ghost with Silent Knives Protects\" through and through, learning specific spear and knife moves just for the role!\n Nevin Millan plays \"Ghost with Silent Knives Protects\". Ghost with Silent Knives Protects is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters in the film! He is half Indian/Half Kumeyaay, as is his sister \"Delicate Poison\" who is played by Kelsey Jaffer. Ghost with Silent Knives Protects plays a few very important roles in the movie, and will not be what viewers expected before it is all over!\n\nJamald Gardner will terrify you and break your heart in his role as the ultimate villain in \"Vengeance Turns\", Jefferson Coletrain!\nJamald Gardner plays \"Jefferson Coletrain\". Jamald Gardner has been involved in the project longer than any other person than Robert C Smith who he met when both worked as background actors for a Disney show! The two actors got to know each other and began discussing westerns and the fact that Smith wanted to write one-- Gardner said he had always wanted to be the \"bad guy\" in one... and the rest is history! Developing the character with Jamald along the way through the writing process created one of the deepest, most complex while still TERRIFYING villains ever to show up in any western movie! \nMoriah Hart has a sneaky role and plays a very SNEAKY Hester Blake-- she will draw you in early and make you feel so sorry for her, but have you seething before the movie ends!\n Moriah Hart plays \"Hester Blake\". Moriah Hart gets to throw one of the biggest curveballs of the whole movies at audiences as \"Hester Blake\"! She had one of the ultimate challenges in the movie: To present her character as somewhat weak, if not a little \"Karen-y\" early in the film only to return at its climax as transformed as Rebecca/Mia or Simon! Moriah Hart will leave audiences reeling as they  see her performance with Paola Luelmo as Mia Falcon in the last minutes of the movie.\nSteven Ciceron brought Sheriff Cartwright to life, and brings both peril and humor to the screen!\n Steven Ciceron plays \"Sheriff Cartwright\". Steven Ciceron was also part of the project very early on, with Smith developing the character of \"Sheriff Cartwright\" specifically for him. As with Jamald Gardner and \"Jefferson Coletrain\", Smith worked with Ciceron over the years to build out the exact character they both wanted to bring to life on the screen. As with Moriah above, no matter what you are thinking about this sheriff right now, you are DEAD WRONG, so be ready to be surprised a few times by this character and this actor!\nAside from Writing, Directing and Producing \"Vengeance Turns\", RCS also found the time to play the villainous \"Frank Effing Ford\"!\n Robert C Smith plays \"Frank Ford\" (and wrote/directed). Smith said from the very beginning of writing and developing \"Vengeance Turns\" that there would be a saloon shootout scene and he would play a character who dies a bloody death getting shot to hell and back in it! Well, he was close! He plays \"Frank Ford\" and ends up spending more time on the screen than originally planned and does not get shot at all-- but DOES DIE A BLOODY DEATH at the hands of the vengeful Mia who stabs a claw straight up through his chin and out his face! Smith was careful about everyone he brought on board with this project, wanting them all to feel more like partners and true collaborators than simply pieces he moved around on a board. The results show on the screen, as you will see soon!\nMORE About the Plot and Story in Vengeance Turns: The Motion Picture!\nRebecca Falcon is happily married in 1876 Blaketon, CA where her husband, Michael, works as an attorney for the primary business, Blake Industrial Gold Mining, Inc. Together, they have two beautiful, vibrant children-- one girl, Emma and her little brother, Edward.\nWhen the movie opens, we find out that families around this small community have been murdered and there is active gossip about local Kumeyaay being involved. Unknown to anyone outside her family, Rebecca herself is part Kumeyaay with a full-blooded grandmother whom she only barely knew.\nSO MUCH of \"Vengeance Turns\" is about the characters, and we really chose some rising stars to bring them to life in this film. Seen here, Azeem Vecchio in FX/Makeup as Simon Coletrain; Nevin Millan as Ghost with Silent Knives Protects; Stacy Marie Turner, Kate Comstock, and Moriah Hart as \"The Biddies\"; Steven Ciceron as Sheriff Cartwright, Nicholas Freedson as his deputy, and Robert C Smith as Frank Effing Ford!; Finally, Jess Be (who also produced and worked as script supervisor) played Mrs. Cartwright and Frank Vavounas as a bad guy named Buck!\nThe treatment of all natives during the late 1800\u2019s was atrocious to an extent that they were often shot on sight, treated as and referred to as \u201cvermin\u201d. From his own ignorance combined with paternal thoughts of safety for his daughter, he meticulously \u201cwhite-washed\u201d her.  Rebecca laments to her husband that she \u201cbarely knew her, but picked up what she could here and there\u201d, and cries that they are a \u201cPeaceful People\u201d, collapsing into his arms sobbing, after hearing some local biddies outside the local market bragging about their children killing Kumeyaay on their property.\nOn that very night, the murderers crash into her life, and her feelings are verified when we meet Oscar Gomez, Frank Ford, and their boss Jefferson Coletrain who brutalize the entire family, even partially scalping Rebecca before leaving them all for dead. Indeed, all are dead\u2026 except Rebecca.\nShe wakes bloody, broken, and vacant from the severe head injuries she suffered, crawling out of the debris and dead bodies that was once her life on autopilot and feral. In one of the first and primary twists of \u201cVengeance Turns\u201d, it is Simon Coletrain (the son of Jefferson Coletrain) who finds her, rescues her and helps her escape only to run into a strange tribe full of various races who refer to themselves as the \u201cLost People\u201d.\nBoth Simon and Rebecca find themselves at peace and at home among this enigmatic group who seem to be run by a young woman who is half Indian/half Kumeyaay named \u201cDelicate Poison\u201d and her brother \u201cGhost with Silent Knives Protects\u201d. (Their father was from India and their mother was Kumeyaay, which is another whole story we would love to tell you!). It is here that viewers also meet Gloria, who likes to take the teeth of those she vanquishes\u2026 for a snack!\nTop left, Mia is unimpressed when she first meets Gloria. Top right, Oscar Gomez reacts to Mia's method of questioning. Bottom left, Gloria has her own way of getting information. Bottom right, Delicate Poison and Gloria move through Blaketon.\nRebecca, who has been christened \u201cMia\u201d by Simon for reasons you will discover in the film, is healed and trained before setting out on her quest to rediscover exactly who she really is and for revenge on the men who took everything from her. Her uncontrollable bursts of rage and the hallucinations she suffers insure a wild ride for her companions and for viewers alike.\nWhile certainly a revenge western at its core, \u201cVengeance Turns\u201d twists nearly everything you thought you ever knew about these movies almost completely inside out! Everyone involved on this film feels viewers will be right on the edge of their seats until the final credits roll! \n Check out the TEASER TRAILER! \nPLAY\n\n  EXPANDED UNIVERSE-- not just an indie film! The \"Explosions of Truth OGN is coming in Winter 2021!\n\n\nSupporters of this film may be surprised to learn they are NOT supporting just a single film but the launch of an entire world! As Robert C Smith and Amanda Fry wrote the original story and first draft of the screenplay, they would often stop to discuss the motivations for certain characters which would lead to longer conversations. This resulted in their decision to do more than capture any important moments in their \"Story Outline/Bible\", and chose to compose short stories that would be told as comics at a later date. \nOne major advantage of the story taking longer to get to the screen than anticipated was having a lot of artwork completed over the past four years. Some stories such as \"Growing Pained\" featuring the character Simon Coletrain are 100% complete and ready to go! Kurt Belcher is working right now on the main story that will appear in an Original Graphic Novel being released in Winter 2021 (with story and OGN) called \"Explosions of Truth\". This story acts as a DIRECT SEQUEL to the film, while the other shorter stories like \"Growing Pained\" serve as glimpses into key moments of our characters lives leading up to the events in the film. \nThis will be a DOUBLE-PAGE Spread in the featured story in an Original Graphic Novel called \"Vengeance Turns: Explosions of Truth\"!\n We have developed so much material, and even have other writers now approaching us to pitch stories about the characters, that we know there are years and years of other exciting \"Vengeance Turns\" stories to tell in other films, short films, comics, graphic novels, podcasts and much more!\n REWARDS \n IF we break our modest goal, we have some awesome stretch goals and rewards ready to go!

Read on for details!\nCome join us, won't you?\nFront Cover\nThe Volume 1 re:VISION of The God Machine series sets the stage for an ongoing epic!\nGuy Salvatore is stricken with sadness and guilt. His world no longer makes sense. His girlfriend has died and he\u2019s seeing monsters. Are they manifestations of grief or something more? A strange man in a graveyard tells Guy that his girlfriend is indeed alive, floating in and out of the \u201cDream Worlds\u201d and that only Guy can save her! However, the Gods stand in his way of happiness. Could this be the uniting of young lovers, or the end of everything else?\nWelcome to The God Machine, a dark comedy that delves into one boy\u2019s struggles with depression and the supernatural. Populated with crazy Gods, terrible monsters, and offbeat goth friends, let us take you on a trip, around the world and back\u2026\n:::For mature readers. Strong sexual content, nudity, and language:::\nBack Cover\nWho's that creator girl?\nHi-o everyone, it\u2019s me, Chandra Free, creator of The God Machine! I am an artist/writer/creator who\u2019s worked with SYFY, Jim Henson, Archaia, Image Comics, Storm King Comics, and many more! I\u2019ve done numerous album covers, storyboards, character designs, and I was the art director for BLAM! Ventures. Pronouns: she/her.\n\nBackstory! The God Machine was originally published in late 2010, but it\u2019s origins date back to 1999, my senior year of high school. I have been formulating this epic for decades, maturing it from a high schooler\u2019s tale to a science fiction-horror-fantasy epic full of mystery, conspiracies, and deep lore.\nOriginal Cover for the Graphic Novel Published in 2010\nThe God Machine had its first outing as a preview comic in 2009, followed by a hardbound graphic novel in late 2010, then-published by Archaia. After a slew of publishing changes in the years to follow, I finally procured the rights to my creation in 2019. With The God Machine back in my hands, I decided to bring it to Machina Corpse, the spooky new comics company I formed with my partner, Stephen Emond. Here I plan to relaunch the series with The God Machine Volume 1 re:VISION and follow it up with volume 2 and beyond!\n\nWait, who are these new characters?!?\n\nThe God Machine is now back in my hands, allowing me to give you a whole new experience, a definitive version of the book with new content throughout! I'm calling all the shots! Whoa!\n\nBUT! Not only will this be a tasty treat to original fans of the book, but a perfect entry point to new readers! \n\nI started with a bold new logo for a new era, created by Phil Balsman (Eisner and Harvey Award winner for logo and book design for Attack on Titan, Akira 35th Anniversary, Magic Knight Rayearth, All-Star Superman, Witch Hat Atelier).\n\n\n I then hired prolific comic book letterer Taylor Esposito (DC Comics, Marvel, Vertigo, Vault, IDW and more!) to bring new life to the pages. \n\n\nPersonally, one of the most exciting things that I've included is all-new text and refined dialogue throughout. The entire volume has a new level of polish to it. There\u2019s stronger characterization, removal of some poorly aged content, and more overall clarity in the writing.\n\n\nScenes have been extended, new pages have been drawn, new characters debut. A new prologue sets the tone for the series. This truly is a re:Vision. In addition to all this, there\u2019s a new forward, and a new intro from myself.\n\n\nThe breakdown of what's in the book:\n\nNew covers front & back\nNew logo by Phil Balsman \nre:Lettered by Taylor Esposito  \nNew foreword by mystery person extraordinaire!\nre:Vised text - questionable content gone, stronger story & characterizations!\nre:Vised art assets\nExtended scenes \nNew comic pages \nNew prologue \nArt galore \nAuthor\u2019s intro\nOriginally 160 pages, now 180!\nWhat\u2019s not included from the original graphic novel? Character bios and pin-ups from guests.\nReturning, however, is the original foreword by Venture Brothers\u2019 own Doc Hammer.\n\nGet yo' coin purse out!\nMoney raised for The God Machine Volume 1 re:VISION kickstarter will be going toward the printing of the book in hardcover with some bells and whistles, as well as prints and reward items. It will also go towards paying for new lettering, for shipping, materials, taxes and Kickstarter fees, as well as bonus rewards and stretch goal production.\nNote! Credit Cards are ONLY charged if the project succeeds on the last day of the campaign. This is an all or nothing campaign. Meaning if we do not make our goal, this project cannot move forward, and you will not be charged. \n\nIt\u2019s full steam ahead though if we make our goal! God Machine is a go!\n\nNOTE: Please keep an eye out for updates and backer surveys after the campaign is funded. If you do not fill out your backer form within 6 months of its issue you will not receive your rewards and your pledge will count as a donation. \n\nSHIPPING: Shipping on all reward tiers is free in the United States. Add-ons have shipping, as do territories outside of the US.\nMagic... well, not really!\n\nThe book is 90% finished.

Thanks for taking a look at \u201cTales of the 399.\u201d \nWe\u2019re students at Moravian College, a small liberal arts school in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. We are a class of English majors and minors, and we all have passion for writing. Some of us have made comics before, while others have not. Throughout this semester, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the creative process of comic-making in our Comics and Graphic Storytelling class, or English 399. This collection showcases our new skills.\n\u201cTales of the 399\u201d is a collection of memoirs, each written by one of us. When choosing a personal experience to illustrate, we focused on the theme of family. Some of our stories are lighthearted, while others are more serious, but each of our unique views of family bind them together.\nWe\u2019ve never attempted to publish a book on this scale before, and we\u2019re excited for others to see and read our work! We\u2019d greatly appreciate your support, as this means a lot to us as students and as authors. Our ultimate goal is to be able to print full-color copies of our collection, to distribute copies directly to you, and to gain meaningful experience in promoting and publishing our creative labors. Putting our work out into the world for the first time is scary and exciting at the same time, and we would greatly appreciate your contribution to our journey.\nPreviews\nHere's a look at some of the eight stories included in this inaugural issue:\n\"The Art Kids\" by Grace Gilbert\n\"Luke 15:20\" by Sam Riley\n\"The Half-Beating Heart\" by Evan Yandrisovitz\n\"Same Old New Year's\" by Anna Litofsky\nRewards\nOur best reward, we hope, is the book itself! We've got both digital and print options available. In addition, we're working on making pins, stickers and prints to offer for something extra. We're also offering a limited number of signed and remarked editions. If you choose this reward, you'll received a signed book with a small head sketch on the cover from one of the artists!\nIf we reach our initial goal, we'll have a few stretch goals, too!\nAbout the creators:\nCaroline Flora (\u201cDistant Whistle\u201d) - Caroline is a senior majoring in English.

This is an incredibly personal project that spun out of a realization I had years ago: There are some days that the most horrific thing I could think of would be to sit, quietly alone with my own thoughts. I live with depression and anxiety on a daily basis and it took me a long time to get somewhere that I felt somewhat comfortable with that and started learning how to not feel like I was always alone. It took friends to help me get out of that way of thinking. Now I want to be your friend by making this awesome zine to show you that you're not alone either.\n\nWho Am I?\nI'm Justin Richards, writer of the critically acclaimed comic book series Finger Guns from Vault Comics. I spend my time writing comics, trying to be a good family man, playing video games and giving my dogs too much affection.\n\nTL/DR:\nIt's a 16 page, variety, comic zine featuring:\n Five (5) page comic story written by Justin Richards with art by Gavin Guidry (Going to the Chapel, Deadly Living) and colors by Val Halvorson (Finger Guns, The Sequels)\n Five (5) pinup images from some of the best artists in the industry today!

As a comic fan, there are so many cool design elements and visuals in golden age stories that always capture my attention- but sometimes the stories aren't quite up to 2021 expectations. I wanted to find a way to dust off all the good stuff there and bring it into a modern story... and hopefully throw in a few twists that will surprise!\nCover to We Are Scarlet Twilight #1\n\nEnter the story's hero-- Captain Lancet. He's a 1930's All-American crime buster* who accidentally creates the world's greatest villain before waking up a century in the future. He'll need to adjust to a strange new world-- Fritz Lang's Metropolis with some cyberpunk dystopia sprinkled in-- if he wants to overthrow the totalitarian vampire cult that now dominates the future.\n\n*some of these things are not, strictly speaking, the truth\n\nThe Team for We Are Scarlet Twilight \u2026 is well, just me- a jack of all trades commercial artist who loves putting together comics.  My previous comic,  August: Purgatory Underground is completed and coming out soon from Action Lab\u2019s Danger Zone imprint. While it\u2019s great having a publisher and team to work with, it seemed like the time was right to get into crowdfunding- the freedom of being able to control my book and schedule, through pandemics and other chaos, was a huge draw.  And there are so many great looking books from indie creators coming up now in the Kickstarter comics community... I wanted to be a part of it!\n\nThis campaign is my first, so I\u2019m trying to keep it my goals modest- enough to cover producing the 24 page comic, an alternate cover and a few fun extras that are a cool way to support production! Being as it\u2019s my first time out, I want to keep things simple as I find my crowdfunding sea legs, so I\u2019m printing these on demand at KaBlam, who'll ship them to you in a Gemini mailer. If this is a success- and I hope with your help it will be- for the next campaigns I\u2019ll have a better idea of what to expect, and can get these printed up in bulk and get the physical issue cost down! That all said, I'm a newish creator, We Are Scarlet Twilight is a new book, and you have a lot of other cool options for your entertainment dollar! I want my book to get out there as much as it can, so I'm keeping my digital prices at $2.\nVariant Retro Cover for We Are Scarlet Twilight #1\nWhile I want to keep a few of the plot points under wraps... I'm sure you want to see what the interior pages look like! Pages 1-5, and a few out of sequence extras that give an idea of the atmosphere but don't give away the story can be found below!\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 1\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 2\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 3\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 4\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 5\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 14 (Unlettered)\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 16 (Unlettered)\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 24 (Unlettered)\n\nIf you're a fan of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials, Fleischer Bros Superman cartoons, Golden Age Comics or old school horror and crime stories, We Are Scarlet Twilight is made for you!  I hope you'll check it out!\n\nOne more thing... I guess it wouldn't be a good kickstarter without some kind of fun reward option. Did some research. I've seen some things you people wouldn't believe: apparel, pins... something called a waifu pillow I cannot unsee. \n\nBut that's not cool.

The funds raised through this campaign will fund the production and printing of the graphic novel and rewards. We have scheduled a realistic production timetable of the book that will allow the creators to produce top notch work while also delivering the final product to our backers in a very reasonable amount of time.\n\nAlex Segura, Sean HusVar, and everyone on the team understand the trust that it takes for you to back our work. We will do everything we can to complete and ship the project on time. However, several of our recent projects have run into unanticipated delays, specifically related to the Covid-19 pandemic, and we need to acknowledge that the pandemic continues to provide a degree of unpredictability in the day-to-day production of projects. In case of delay, we will always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated throughout production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The Sidekick", "descp": "Cap had Bucky.

Most of you know us as the mighty vegan food truck that could, with a small crew. After almost 4 years as a food truck, it's time for us to take the next leap and become a restaurant, or Cycle Dogs can\u2019t live on.\nCycle Dogs Hot Dog Cart\nThe Story\nPicture this: Keaton (CD Owner) working a corporate desk job at an architectural firm, many steps removed from seeing anyone tangibly enjoying his work. He then decided to parlay his love of cooking, commitment to a vegan lifestyle, and knack for bicycles, to start a food business. Cycle Dogs was born, as Seattle\u2019s first all-vegan hot dog stop. (A vegan diet has nearly half the carbon footprint of a traditional omnivore diet, and for many it\u2019s also about compassion and personal health.)\nCycle Dogs Food Truck\nKeaton was on his way, living the dream of sharing his experience of delicious vegan food with fellow vegans, and with vegetarians and vegan-curious alike. Two years after starting the cart, he made the big move onto the food truck, with regular staff, and a larger menu. Through lots of hard work and dedication in the three and a half years since, Cycle Dogs has gone through growing pains, triumphs and setbacks, learning and improving along the way. We\u2019ve tried some crazy things from veganizing entire chain copycat menus to German Oktoberfest fare - working fairs and corporate events, and our amazing recent run of trying out some chick'n sandwiches.\nCycle Dogs Food\nWhen you make something in the food services world, you get to see the impact of your work. At Cycle Dogs, we love bringing happiness to people through food. We\u2019ve been blessed with an amazing expanding family of customers, who have motivated us to keep getting better (and more creative!) at what we do. We always feel excited and privileged when Cycle Dogs is a customer\u2019s first touchstone of vegan choices.\nWith our successes of the last few months, it has become clear that we've outgrown the truck. We have busted our rumps, but have sometimes really struggled to keep up with demand at peak times.\nCycle Dogs Food\nWhy should I help? \nThe next chapter for Cycle Dogs to grow would be to serve out of a restaurant, with a larger kitchen, to offer broader menu and service options to a wider audience, and to be able to introduce veganism and vegan food to even more people! The Cycle Dogs community is vast, filled with amazing customers who are extremely supportive of our food, our journey, and who share our passion for vegan fare. As a person who loves food and/or vegan food, we would LOVE your help and support as we try to bring and widen our passion in the greater Seattle area. \n\nWhat will I get out of helping Cycle Dogs?\nYou will get our many many thanks for supporting our small business and helping to bring our dreams to life!!! In terms of Kickstarter rewards, you have the options for the following depending on the reward level you choose: (Please see Rewards options; it's a top menu item on a mobile device, or it's on the right on the desktop version)\nOur thanks and appreciation, expressed via email and social media!\nCustom Founder Tile on the wall of the restaurant\nCycle Dogs face mask\nA dozen bottles of any of our house-made sauces\nCycle Dogs T-shirt or apron\nPhoto(s) you take, installed on a tiled photo wall for our 1-year anniversary\nMeal and Masks for Two\nPrivate Dinner for Two\nCommemorative Investor Tile on the wall of the restaurant\nPrivate Party for up to 35 at the restaurant\n\nWhat will my contribution bring Cycle Dogs?\nWe\u2019ve signed a lease, but need your help to equip the kitchen:\nGas range + install\nFryers + install\nPrep fridge\nWorktop fridge\nPrep tables\nShelving for the walk-in\nKitchen shelving\nGrease trap cleaning\nIce machine\nCommercial mixer\n8 tap draft fridge\nReach-in freezer\nHeat lamp w/ shelf\n3 compartment sink and faucet + install\n1 prep sink + install\n1 hand wash sink + install\nFire extinguishers \nFire suppresion system adjustments\nCycle Dogs will cover:\nFurniture\nPermits\nPatio\nDecor + Renovation\n  OK, I\u2019m with you so far. But I have to know, where will you be located?!\nNew restaurant space in Ballard\nThis part is truly exciting for us, for several reasons. We\u2019ll be moving into a little place in Ballard, right off NW Market Street, on 17th Avenue NW. You might know it as the former home of the No Bones Beach Club! There's something extra special about moving into this space.\nAs many of you know, the Cycle Dogs food truck was once the No Bones truck, where they got their start!! It feels right to maintain the vegan legacy of that restaurant space.\nWhen will you open?\nOur target date for opening in the new space will be April 12th!  We will of course send updates to all backers and post important updates on this page.\n\nWhy, and why now?\nKeaton and the team - and our families - are deeply thankful for how far Cycle Dogs has been able to come, with the support of our amazing customers.\nThe food business is hard work! Food truck life brings with it a whole list of additional hurdles to jump on a weekly or daily basis. Emptying and filling the water tank, getting propane, frequent shopping runs, tight work spaces, weather extremes, dead batteries, you name it.  The things that could have gone sideways, did and it was always when we least expected it. \nThe core crew stuck it out through the adjustments needed to keep us going during the pandemic. Some of them have been along for the adventure for tours of one, even two years.  They\u2019re thrilled at the idea of being able to show up to work in a predictably dry and warm building with reliable plumbing and electricity, with more space for food prep/service and to work. We hope it will be a better experience for everyone.\nCycle Dogs Food\nLet\u2019s unleash the full potential of Cycle Dogs in Seattle!\nWe understand we\u2019re still in a pandemic, and that times are still weird and uncertain. There\u2019s no \u201cbest time\u201d to make this move, but this is where we're at. This is what we need. And we're turning to you guys for help getting us there because we\u2019ve already availed ourselves as much as we can sustain with loans and reliance on bank capital.\n\nWhat next?\nA big part of Cycle Dogs is capturing that nostalgic feeling of having a good fast food or comfort meal, and offering it in a vegan context. We know we will continue in that spirit, anchored in what you know as \u201cCycle Dogs.\u201d A restaurant space will enable us to get even more creative with what we can offer you, and to try new things for you to enjoy with us.\nWe\u2019ll provide regular updates!\n\nWhat will you do with the extra money if you exceed your goal?\nWe will go for a stretch goal! There is a lot of renovation work we need to do in the dining area and outdoor patio. A stretch goal could help us reduce our loan amount to finish the space!\n\nWhat happens if you fail to meet your goal?\nIf we don\u2019t make our fundraising goal, Cycle Dogs will not live on. The bottom line is that being a food truck isn't sustainable for us and down the line we will probably have to close.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven that we are in a pandemic, we understand that challenges lie ahead.

It is 8-pages long, but that's just the comics part.  There's also a cover and a back cover and some other words my Dad told me to write on the inside so everyone knows I'm the one who made it.  \n5.5\" x 8.5\", 8-page, black and white, comic book +cover\nIn the story, there's this guy with a horn, his name is Honk, and he has some friends named Pig and G.  \"G\" stands for goat, but he doesn't exactly look like a goat.  And there's also a bully when they go to this school.  He's not very nice, but the story kind of shows what to do in a situation like that.\n\nI'm a 7-year-old boy and I'm good at Math and I like to draw.  It's nice to draw.  And also I'm a tall kid in my class.  My name is Owen.  \n\nWhy I'm sending this out is because it's not a good thing to be bullied.  You should stand up to that bully if they are bullying you or someone else.  If you see a bully bullying someone else, then you are a bystander and you should report the bullying, the same as if someone was bullying you.\n\n\nHonk and Freands - \"Jungle Gym\", full-color, limited-edition, 5.5\" x 8.5\", print.\nAuthor with Original Artwork (8.5\" x 11\", marker and crayon)\n\nMe and my dad are printing Honk comic books so we can send them out to people.  My dad has some experience making and giving comics to people.  He's a comic artist, he makes watches, and he even has some comics classes that he teaches.\n\nMy parents asked me how much money I would be happy with.  $20 sounds like a lot to me, so that's what my dad put as our goal.\n\nAfter we make the books, then we will send them out to people who would like the Honk comic.  My dad has this weigher thing just for mail, so we can weigh it and then we will know how much it costs to mail it.  Then we can just mail it to people who want it.  \n\nThis is the way we think our plan will happen:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHm...well, some risks and challenges that I might include are that the comic we send off to you in the mail might come a little bit late, because our mail service is a little behind these days because a lot of people don't want to go to the store. So, the mail people have a lot on their shoulders. Like me, I had to wait for a remote control stunt car that took 3 more days than what they told me. So when we mail the books it might take a little while. But to help that, me and my dad are saying, \"Maybe it'll take one or two weeks longer,\" just so we have enough time. He says this is a contingency. \n\nSomething else I wanted to say is that the entire comic book is already drawn, so you won't have to wait for me to finish that.\n\nAnother risk could be, you know, what if our printer doesn't have any printing-out stuff. But to make sure that doesn't happen, we have an extra load of that stuff that helps the printer print stuff out. \n\nMy dad is also helping me a lot by printing the comic and typing what I say here. My mom said she would help, too, but I don't know with what part. Maybe stapling the comics and packing them up. So, it's not just me working on this.

Jaded after millenia of destruction and death, Xolotl hid away and watched his family sacrifice themselves in the name of hope for life beyond themselves.\nXolotl, alone and ashamed, became racked with guilt, causing him to weep so intensely that his eyes fell from his head and descended to the center of the newly forged universe: the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.\nSeeing an opportunity to redeem himself, to honor the sacrifice of his family, Xolotl guided the Aztecs to forge two macahuitl, imbued with a piece of his own godhood. The Left and Right Eye of Xolotl, entrusted to twin siblings to wield together in defense of the Fifth Sun, became known as...The Twin Blades.\nArt by Julio Suarez and Rocco Langg, logo by Andrea Rosales\nNow in the year 2108, the blades are entrusted to twins Xiomara and Basilio Gutierrez who inherited them as children. Xiomara is strong willed, determined, and believes in herself. She's committed to her role as wielder and her sworn purpose of defending the Fifth Sun...but Basilio? Well, there isn't exactly a bunch of threats to the Sun running around and he's ready to move on with his life. Leaving his role as Wielder behind to pursue his goal of becoming a teacher, Basilio strains his relationship with his sister. \n\nUnfortunately, things are rarely so simple. The Lord of the North himself TEZCATLIPOCA sees a distracted pantheon and a set of divided Wielders as an opportunity to mobilize his pawn YAOTL: a resurrected traitorous Jaguar Warrior now obsessed with never returning to Mictl\u0101n, the land of the dead. Yaotl is bestowed with a blade forged from the primordial Black itself and sets out to destroy the Fifth Sun and create a new universe for Lord Tezcatlipoca.\n\nCan Xiomara and Basilio stop arguing long enough to stop Tezcatlipoca's champion? Even if they can...will it be enough?\n\nTHE TEAM\nThe Twin Blades is a latine story and is proudly produced by an entirely latine team of creators:\nWritten by Jarred Luj\u00e1n: Jarred is a Mexican-American comic writer from the promised land of Texas. A 2019 Mad Cave Studios winner, he broke onto the comics scene with the four-issue mini-series Dry Foot. He likes the Wu-Tang Clan and existentialism. \n\nArt by Julio Suarez: Julio Suarez is a Mexican illustrator, having worked his whole life towards becoming a comic book artist, his passion for drawing has allowed him to work for companies such as Upperdeck Ent. and Cryptozoic Ent. as a sketch card artist, working with licenses such as Marvel and DC Comics, as well as freelance illustration work the last couple of years, now making his debut in the comic industry with \u201cThe Twin Blades\u201d as an artist, he is ready to show the world what he can do!\n\nColors by Rocco Langg: Based in Mexico City, she has worked on several comics ranging from commercial work for Mexican companies to her interactive IG comic Goodbye and Fuck You! She has a passion for sci fi and vibrant colors.\n\nLetters by Gabriela Downie: From California, Gabriela has been in the comic industry for 7 years. She's done a little bit of everything including production art, cover art, and lettering. Her work includes Harleen, Beast Boy Loves Raven, Punchline, and Batman '89.\n\nTHE SWORDS\nThe LEFT EYE of XOLOTL, wielded by main character XIOMARA\nThe RIGHT EYE of XOLOTL - Wielded by main character Basilio\nThe blades of THE TWIN BLADES\nTHE PREVIEW PAGES \nTHE PRONUNCIATIONS\nWhile you wait for THE TWIN BLADES to hit your eyeballs, learn to pronounce some of the more intimidating words for English speakers:\nXolotl\nTezcatlipoca\nMacuahuitl\nXiomara", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are minimal.

Dance is something that is seen as beautiful, but many don\u2019t think about the pain that is done to one\u2019s body to truly be a dancer. Martial arts are thought of as violent because it\u2019s a form of \u201cfighting\u201d, but there\u2019s also a dance like quality to this work of art.\nBut once you dig deeper, the reader will quickly realize that The Dancer is actually a story about mental health. Mia is forced to face her own childhood trauma of witnessing her parents\u2019 murder when she becomes the enemy that she once dedicated her life to fight against.

He's a heroic firefighter, father of five, SWAT trainer, amateur MMA champion and armored combat enthusiast. Daniel is also a former military sniper, with combat, security, rescue and recovery experience in the middle east and Tibet. Frankly, Daniel is as close to a superhero as there is! \nBut SOLDIER is about much more than him. In the past 8 years, he's lost 9 of his close friends to suicide. And that\u2019s the reason he's partnered with me to tell his story. \nPLAY\n\nThis is a story about getting back up.\nDaniel wrote this to me early on, and it's worth repeating here. \"This isn\u2019t just a story about war\u2026 or being a veteran. This is a story about suffering through trauma. This is about a world of people who silently struggle through the pain of PTSD. It\u2019s about those of us who get up, focus our sights on the horizon\u2026 and soldier on.\" \nWe're going to be getting into this stuff. I'll be interviewing family, friends and coworkers. We'll all be talking about loss and fortitude... straight up and honestly. And we'll be filming a lot of awesomeness! For example: one of Daniel's current pastimes featured below.\nPLAY\n\nThis is a story about action.\nI\u2019ve been making award-winning films for almost 20 years, and I\u2019ve never been more focused on a project. I have a largely volunteer team of incredible creators working with me to record all aspects of Daniels\u2019 life, and we\u2019ve received permission to capture some of the most amazing things you\u2019ll ever see on film. We're talking everything from SWAT courses to one-on-one armored combat trials in a literal ring of fire.\nI've also gathered - and am working with a team to professionally scan - thousands of pictures, along with archiving countless hours of old footage of Daniel's life and travels. \nDaniel's favorite photograph.\nThis is a story that deserves to be told. \nI've spent almost half a year building the team, outlining the 2021 schedule and shooting tests for SOLDIER... and we are ready to launch! Our budget includes everything to make the film I want to make: multiple field and interview days, storage drives for an extraordinary amount of 4K footage, archival still and video clean-up, editing, audio mixing, an original score, color correction sessions... and even an initial round of film festival submissions. It ALSO includes the 10% that goes to Kickstarter and charge fees, as well as taxes. Come join us on this adventure.

Absent for centuries from the far-off galaxy of the Morrigen people, the Solavore had disappeared into the realm of myth. But now, with one of their solar systems facing a cosmic loss, the Morrigen are learning that the Solavore is not only real... but hungry.\n\n WHO IS HUNTING IT? \nFor years, the Galactic Kingdom of the Morrigen had been protected by its latest ruler, the brave and brilliant KING THEOSIS. Committed to the freedom and safety of his people, King Theosis has lead the Morrigen through decades of darkness, striving toward a future of progress and peace. But after so many battles, Theosis's beard has gone white; the grip on his sword has grown weaker.  And after a devastating personal loss, Theosis must summon a strength he's never known to defeat the worst threat the Morrigen have ever seen.\nFortunately for Theosis, his husband ABBINOIR will be there to help. Wise and compassionate as any ruler his people have served, Abbinoir is Theosis's personal strength. While the king is looking out for the kingdom, Abbinoir looks out for its king. And though he's been doing it for all of Theosis's reign, every new threat weighs more on his mind, none more so than the Solavore. After all, how can you protect a man who must protect a kingdom?\nNot that he won't have help. In facing this unheard-of crisis, Theosis will have at his command some of the best warriors in the entire galaxy: his own royal guard and the elite female warriors known as the VALKINAE. Together, they make up the best defense the Morrigen have.\nBut will they be enough?\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nCheck out some of the (not finalized) pages of HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE.\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n WHO IS CREATING HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE? \nLANE LLOYD - Creator of the weird and zany, Lane is an up and coming artist with an energetic, off the wall style. After being featured on Comic Book Yeti, Outright Geekery, and The Driving Creators Network, Lane's comic GOD-PUNCHER smashed its way onto Kickstarter, receiving more than double the projected amount of funding.  With HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, Lane uses their skill of designing strange, larger-than-life characters to tell a story that's both firmly planted in the horror genre and stretched to the outer limits of science fiction.\nGRANT DeARMITT - Grant's tales of the sinister and strange have been published at Haw Creek Horror, Crystal Lake Publishing, and Black Hole Entertainment.  A lifelong fan of weird fiction and fantasy epics, Grant hopes HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE will present the human side of cosmic terror; an otherworldly story that hits home.\n\nWHY ARE THEY CREATING IT?\nKing Theosis's ship. For interplanetary travel... and beyond.\nLane and Grant have spent two years developing the shocking showdown of Theosis and the Solavore. They made this Kickstarter to bring that story to life in the form it deserves: the comic book format.  But there is another reason. \nHUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE is just one story of thousands set in this all-new universe that Lane and Grant have cooked up. Getting it created, printed, and into the hands of readers like yourself is the first step in telling those tales. We believe that comic fans are hungry for new worlds and new terrors, and we believe we have some great ones to offer.\nSo by backing this project, you're not just helping us make a comic.

See the new stretch goals in the Rewards section below!\nLondon, 1914 - Major Sheffield Holmes, nephew to the great detective, and his mysterious American partner Capt. Imogen Watson have uncovered a secret society known as \"The Moriarty,\" a dark cabal that has vowed revenge on the Holmes family. Joined by the gruff Det. Inspector Agamemmnon J. Brick of Scotland Yard and the resourceful mechanic Juliette McKinnon, the new Holmes and Watson must defeat the zealot known only as \"The Scholar\" and prevent Europe from descending into war!\nMAJOR HOLMES & CAPTAIN WATSON #3-4 picks up right where we left off and completes the first arc of the series, known as \"The Adventure of the Vengeful Scholar.\" Having discovered the existence of the villainous cabal known as \"The Moriarty,\" fanatical followers of the long-dead Napolean of Crime, the new Holmes and Watson must rely on their friends and their skills to uncover their nefarious plan and rescue someone very important to Sheffield Holmes.  But will the dark secrets in each of their pasts unravel the nascent 6th Special Intelligence Service? Issue 3 is a 24-page thriller that continues the tale, and the jam-packed 36 page Issue #4 brings the shocking conclusion to life. That's 60 pages of comics, what a deal!\n\nMajor Holmes & Captain Watson is a true labor of love for me, as a writer. I've wanted to tell this story since I was 9 years old when my Grandmother gave me a copy of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. I fell in love with the Great Detective then, and have reread his adventures over and over.  When (most of) the Holmes canon became public domain, I decided I wanted to put a new twist on the old tales, to create a new Holmes and Watson that shook up old ideas. Sheffield Holmes and Imogen Watson are equals, more than anything else, real partners and friends who rely on each other. They are both great detectives and skilled spies as well, and England will soon need them. They also each old dark secrets about themselves...\nCheck out a preview of Issue #3 below. \n\u201cI could tell from the first page of the preview art that I'd be into this\u2026 take(s) well-worn characters and remix(es) them in surprising ways\u201d - SYFY Wire.\n\n\"Stepping out from the shadow of giants is hard, but Jeff and Ismael have done a tremendous job in doing just that. A story that feels Sherlockian, but steps onto its own path with its own characters in its own story\" - Jarred Luj\u00e1n, writer - DRY FOOT (Mad Cave Comics)\n\n\u201cMajor Sheffield Holmes is not the Holmes you\u2019re expecting\u2026 Like his famous uncle he\u2019s intelligent, inquisitive, and quick-witted. Also like his Uncle his secrets run deep\u2026 Ismael Canales makes excellent choices regarding character expressions and level of detail.\u201d - WhatchaReading.com \nissue #3 cover by Ismael Caneles and Roger Sorruca\nIssue #4 cover, by Ismael Canales and Roger Sorruca\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\nWe breezed past the goal so quickly we barely got time to tease these, but they have been added now! \nTHIRD STICKER DESIGN / PHONE CALENDAR WALLPAPERS ADDED!\n We'll be adding the third sticker to every tier that gets the pack. Every physical tier that doesn't include the whole pack will get at least one random sticker! And the digital tiers will be getting very cool digital phone wallpapers as well.\nThe NEW Major Holmes Sticker pack. Check out that Brick sticker!\n\nTHIRD NEW INTELLIGENCE PRINT ADDED, ALL PRINTS INCREASED TO FULL 8\"X10\"\nIn addition to intel on the villain known as \"The Scholar\" and Holmes & Watson's famous motorcycles, we'll add the detailed file on the Armaments of the 6th S.I.S. to the Special Dossier.  We're also increasing the size of these prints to full 8x10!\nWe're adding two VERY LIMITED EDITION Artists COMMISSION TIERS to the campaign. \nSeries artist Ismael Canales will provide FOUR one-of-a-kind 8x10 Commissions for lucky collectors! Each will feature one character of the backers choosing, be it a favorite from Major Holmes & Captain Watson, or any other character you're a fan of. Each Commission will feature ONLY a single character and, to quote Ismael \"I always add something in the background, to add context; I don\u00b4t like the character to be \"floating\" in the blank of the paper.\" Check out the image below to see something similar Ismael did for me personally!\nClick the image to see a higher-resolution version. It's really quite something.\nThese tiers have a slightly higher shipping cost, as all the commissions have to be shipped from Spain to Florida to be added to packages and then shipped on to backers. They will also deliver a little more slowly, as Ismael will wait to ship them to me until they are all complete. We'll keep backers updated on shipping dates, we think we've overestimated so as not to disappoint.\nAt this level, we're upgrading all the physical books to an upgraded 80# Premium Covers Stock. This will give every issue a premium look and feel beyond a typical floppy comic and make these Kickstarter Editions true collector's items. This is the same grade cover stock we upgraded to for #1-2, but we MAY go with a less glossy page and more of a matte to make them easier to sign! THESE BOOKS WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE in this format from us!\n This is really something special. At this level, we're unlocking PHYSICAL printing of the 2nd Major Holmes & Captain Watson prose short story available in our top TWO tier sets. This will come in a collectible 5.25\" x 8\" booklet with a 10pt gloss cover with special cover! But we're not just giving cool things to the top-tier folks. The DIGITAL PDF of the short story, written by series writer Jeff Rider, will now also be available in EVERY DIGITAL REWARDS PACKAGE. That's right, every single backer will get some version of this story now! In addition, every package that includes all 4 issues will get the digital version of the FIRST Sheffield Holmes prose short \"The Adventure of the Errant Slipper\" by Jeff Rider. \nCheck out our latest update for all the details on Add-Ons, now available directly on the Kickstarter platform!\nNew Swag!\nWe've got some really great stuff planned, both for folks who've already read our first two issues and newcomers who want to get hold of the entire first arc.  There are also early bird tiers and some special add-ons and new stretch goals coming.  Here's a quick peek at the prototype 6th S.I.S. pocket notebooks! \nThe 6th S.I.S. Officers Field Notebook, lined on the inside (pen for scale only, final product may vary)\n The \"Brick Series\" alt-covers return!\nWe're excited to have two new alt-covers featuring fan-favorite character Agamemnon J. Brick, Scotland Yards biggest, baddest Detective Inspector! With art once again by Michael Dorman, these rare editions will feature colors by Anthony Lee. They'll be previewed here and added as stretch goals and add-ons once the campaign is live. Here's a  preview of the Alt Cover for #3, it's a work in progress, and we'll update this as it develops, but this is pretty close to the final version!\nBrick got SHOT, and he is NOT happy about it!\n Check out the Special Dossier packaging and print sets, with new prints for this campaign.\nPLAY\n\n Here's the full list of Rewards! Plus we'll open the Add-On store with more awesome stuff like the Alt-covers once the campaign has funded!\nJeff Rider - is a writer living in Orlando who publishes his comics in print and digitally at CloudwranglerComics.com and on ComiXology. Jeff has been telling stories since he could talk and loves collaborative art in all its forms. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson he\u2019s the writer of the urban fantasy series The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast with artist Davide Puppo (successfully funded via Kickstarter), the sci-fi adventure Gravity Matters with Sean Dillon (also a successful Kickstarter), and many more comics to be collected in an anthology of shorts coming this year.\nIsmael Canales - Ismael has worked with independent publishers both from the USA and Spain (ECV Press, Diabolo Ediciones, NowEvolution, Marauder Film), mainly in comic book anthologies with short stories. He started collaborating with Butxido Agency, and since then he has worked in the comics Athena Voltaire (ActionLab) and The Catch (Kickstarter) and is also currently working on a graphic novel for Dolmen Editorial (Spain). He lives in his hometown with his lovely girlfriend and their little (and evil) bunny, Guantes.\nRoger Sorruca - Roger Sorruca is an Illustrator, digital artist, and comics colorist living and working in Barcelona, Spain. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson, he is the colorist for Athena Voltaire (Action Lab.)\nJustin Birch - Justin Birch is a  2018 Ringo Award-nominated letterer born and raised in the hills of West Virginia. Lettering comics since 2015, he is a member of the lettering studio AndWorld Design and has worked with DC, IDW, Dynamite, Lion Forge Comics, Mad Cave Studios, Action Lab Comics, DMC Comics, Source Point Press, Z2 Comics, and numerous indy publishers. Justin still lives in West Virginia, only now it\u2019s with his loving wife, daughter, and their dog, Kirby.\nEveryone knows that comics don't get made cheaply. When I created these books, I wanted to make sure that the artists got paid for their work upfront, and at a fair market rate. The majority of the money raised during this campaign goes to cover those artistic costs, cash that goes straight to Ismael, Roger, and Justin plus all the talented artists making art for Alt-Covers and stretch goals. They're the folks who made this story so awesome to read and look at. The rest are costs associated with the physical production of the books and other rewards like packaging, prints, etc. As the creator of Major Holmes & Captain Watson,  I don't take a page rate for myself on these books. Rather, as with every other campaign, any money raised beyond our goal goes to fund future issues of Major Holmes & Captain Watson! Rest assured, while these books are the end of this story arc, this is only the beginning of their adventures. \n (This is subject to change, and we'll update this section as the campaign progresses.)\nFeb 16\n\u2022 The campaign launches, with issue #3 already complete. \n\u2022 Issue #4 writing and line art also already complete.\nGoal reached\n\u2022 Orders for swag and other non-book rewards go out to suppliers as SOON as we hit our funding goal! These are sometimes slower than printing, so we don't want to wait.\nBeginning of March\n\u2022 Coloring work on issue #4 begins.\nBeginning of April\n\u2022 Issue #4 lettering begins.\nMid-April\n\u2022 Issue #3 and #4 go to the printers.\nEarly-Mid May\n\u2022 Rewards begin shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far the risk and challenges to Major Holmes & Captain Watson #'s 3-4 are very few. As you can see from the timeline above, the books are already very nearly complete. Coloring and lettering of issue #4, back matter creation, and layout are the only things left to complete before the books go to the printer. Some additional digital and comics perks like prints, custom packaging, and stretch goal rewards will be the only items to be created after the project ends, due to needing to know the total number of backers and so forth.\n\nThese orders will come while we're still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we're working with a printer we trust, and they assure us delays are unlikely. This is our second time with this particular printer and they were great back in Nov 2020, so we expect more of the same.\n\nThis is also my fifth Kickstarter and the second for the Major Holmes series and is similar in scope to our previous projects. Those projects funded quickly, and all digital and physical rewards were shipped within the promised deadlines, less than three months after the end of the campaign. I've learned the value of making sure that the comic is almost entirely complete before launching a campaign means a really quick turnaround time and rapid rewards delivery. The few hiccups from our earlier endeavors became teachable moments for this one, so I expect even more smooth sailing. As always, should the unexpected happen, we'll keep everyone updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "See, and Observe", "descp": "Get a DRM free PDF of Major Holmes & Captain Watson #3 and #4.

We\u2019re thrilled beyond belief that so many of you joined us in White Ash to get to know Glarien. If you missed this kickstarter, we\u2019ll be back again soon with more White Ash.\n\nHello everyone, we're thrilled to be back on Kickstarter for the 8th time to launch GLARIEN, an all-new comic book miniseries for mature readers set in the White Ash Universe. \nWritten by Charlie Stickney, with art by Romina Moranelli, colors by Fin Cramb and letters by Conor Hughes, the 40 Page first issue of Glarien follows the early days of White Ash's most dangerous elf, as told through the eyes of Rachel, a young woman living in 1970's New York City.  Think Red Sonja meets Taxi Driver... but with Elves and demons.\nGlarien: Chapter One cover by series artist, Romina Moranelli\nIf you\u2019re returning to the White Ash Universe, THANK YOU so much. We owe everything to our Kickstarter community. If you're new to White Ash, WELCOME.  Glarien is a stand alone miniseries where you don't have to be well-versed in White Ash lore to enjoy the ride. But, if you want to get caught up on all things White Ash, we'll have tiers for that, or you can grab the single issues directly from Scout Comics. \nSo beyond the tagline, what's Glarien about?  \nGlarien follows the stories of two women and the different paths they take to overcome life-altering tragedies. Jumping from the elf realm of ancient Alfheim to the gritty streets of New York City circa 1971, two seemingly-unrelated tales will slowly weave together to reveal a critical piece of White Ash's complicated past. Oh, and because Glarien is involved, expect carnage... lots and LOTS of carnage. \nFor those readers coming from White Ash, we do want to reiterate, Glarien is a more MATURE book.  White Ash follows Aleck and Lillian, two PG-13 characters in an R-rated world.  Glarien is an R-Rated character... in an R-rated world.  And as such, to appropriately tell that story, there are themes that are intrinsic to her character that need to be explored. But perhaps the best way of showing you all what Glarien is all about is to jump right into an...\n EPIC 15 PAGE PREVIEW \n That's a good question.  And you'll find that answer inside...\nWe appreciate the motto, \"Go big or go home.\" All of our books are solid reads.  Not wanting to buck that trend, Glarien: Chapter One clocks in at --  FORTY-FREAKING-PAGES.  And that kind of content deserves a premium paper weight.\nWe print DOMESTICALLY (so you get your books quicker) on a heavy 80 lb glossy paper stock with a cover on 100 lb glossy cover stock. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the  difference.\nTo help introduce Glarien to a larger audience, we've brought in a slew of talented women (and White Ash's Conor Hughes) to do variant covers for us to showcase her stylings. \nThe first variant cover is a virgin variant from Rosi K\u00e4mpe (Spider Gwen, Extraordinary X-Men, Destiny NY) focusing on the dual worlds narrative of the Glarien storyline. \nRosi K\u00e4mpe Variant Cover\nOur second variant comes from the jaw-dropping color pallet of Liana Kangas (Star Wars Adventures, 2000 AD, TRVE KVLT, She Said Destroy).\nLiana Kangas Variant Cover\nUp third, we have a haunting, Rachel-centric cover from White Ash's Conor Hughes. \nConor Hughes Variant Cover\nAnd last, but certainly not least, from Yishan Li (Hellboy, Buffy, Swing), a virgin variant of Glarien in action.\nYishan Li Variant Cover\nJUST UNLOCKED.  A COVER BY IVAN TAO\nIvan Tao Variant Cover\nThis stretch goal cover is even more limited.  We only have 35 available to backers as a reward tier.  However it CAN be selected as part of the Pick Two reward and comes as part of the ALL FIVE (now six) COVERS reward.\nWe love packing our campaigns with extra goodness.  IN ADDITION to Glarien: Chapter one, our reward tiers are filled with goodies.  Here's what you can get this time around.\nAll backers receiving physical rewards will get a 6\" x11\" print of our kickstarter page banner image on glossy card-stock.  On top of that, Conor will sign & number copies for the first 300 print backers.\nGet to know Glarien.  All backers will receive this digital bundle of Glarien's previous appearances (White Ash 1/2, Glarien 1220, and Glarien 1880).\nHeads, NYC. Tails you're in Alfheim. No matter how it lands, you win, as ALL physical backers in the Variant Cover Tier (or higher) will receive this limited edition, 1.5\" commemorative Two Worlds Coin. It can also be added on to any physical tier.\nNew to White Ash?  Catch up in style with our 200 page, oversized (7.75\" x11.25\") hardcover collecting the first arc of White Ash.  That's over 2lbs of White Ash goodness delivered straight to your door.  This is a beautiful book you'll be happy to have on your coffee table or adorning your shelf. \nGet a sketch cover of Glarien: Chapter One  drawn by White Ash series artist, Conor Hughes.  Conor will take (reasonable) requests as to the subject mater. There are ONLY 20 of these available. A must have for collectors.\nWe know what it's like to open up a package and find a mangled Kickstarter comic inside. We pack our books with the care that we used in making the comic and the love that we have for our backers.\nEach comic is bagged, boarded front and back and sent in stay-flat packaging. Multiple issue orders will be mailed in our custom-made, comic boxes. Made in White Ash means everything from the content, to the mailers we use, meets our standards of quality.\nWe LOVE stretch goals.  And if we're lucky enough to reach our initial funding goal, we'll unlock a slew of really cool mystery extra rewards for our backers.\nStretch Goal #1 ($15,000) Thank you, thank you very much UNLOCKED\nEvery physical blacker will receive a 6x9, custom Glarien Pin-up by Yasm\u00edn Flores Monta\u00f1ez commemorating the campaign reaching its funding goal. \nStretch Goal #2 ($20,000) Stuck though you UNLOCKED\nEvery physical backer will be receiving a contour-cut sticker based on Glarien as she\u2019s featured on the cover of the Scout one-shot.\nStretch Goal #3 ($25,000) Step by Step UNLOCKED\nThis one is for all the process junkies. Every backer will receive a behind-the-scenes PDF showing the different stages of 16 curated pages from Glarien as they go from script, to layout, to inks and finally to color.\nStretch Goal #4 ($30,000) Might I Have Some More, Sir UNLOCKED\nEvery backer will receive an extra, all-new, digital Glarien short story drawn by the incredible Emily Pearson. This will be added to the haul you\u2019re already taking home. \nStretch Goal #5 ($36,500) Cover Upgrade, UNLOCKED. \nWe are adding a spot UV finish to to the main Romina Moranelli cover.\nStretch Goal #6 $40,000 Get to know us faster UNLOCKED\nIf you back at a catch up tier, we will be mailing those books out first.  That way, you can dive into the White Ash universe and have something to read while we're getting Glarien ready for print.\nStretch Goal #7 $46,000 Who wants another cover UNLOCKED\nA new cover by Ivan Tao has been unlocked.  You can select this as a reward.  It also can be selected as part of the pick two package.  And our ALL FIVE covers is now our ALL SIX.  Anyone who pledges at the ALL FIVE COVERS Tier will automatically get this one as well. \nStretch Goal #8 $52,000 MYSTERY STRETCH GOAL\nWill This Series Be Available Through Stores?\nYes!  But not for a while (at least until mid-2022).  We LOVE our partnership with Scout Comics.  Scout has expanded the reach of White Ash, putting us into shops across the country.  In fact, we're betting some of you reading this now, may have just picked up the Scout Glarien one-shot last week. (NOTE: THIS SERIES is all new) But we also have a very loyal audience here on Kickstarter that's been with us since the beginning.  And we want to honor that legacy by bringing new White-Ash related content to you first.  \nThrough limited-runs and exclusive-editions on this platform, we're able to put together the high-quality content that our fans are used to, and make sure our collaborators are paid wages commensurate with their talent.  Simply put, without Kickstarter, we (and many other creators working today) couldn't afford to make these issues at the level of quality the story deserves.  \nMeet the team.\nCharlie Stickney is Co-Publisher of Scout Comics, and writer of comic books like White Ash, The Game and The Adept.

My name's Jeff McClelland, and I write books like The Tick and the Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. In 2020, I funded the just-shipped Planet Comics #1 right here on Kickstarter. That was such a blast that we're here to do it again with the all-new Planet Comics #2!\nPlanet Comics pays homage to the original 1940-'53 title from Fiction House, which featured futuristic stories of daring heroics with a mid-century design. This new series is presented in an oversized, magazine format, with lots of room for high adventure!\nThe book\nSome talented friends and I have gathered back together to share some new stories with you. Issue #1 led off with \"The Bulwark\" from Andrea Schiavone and myself, and we continue this story in our second issue! Here's a preview of the new story:\nThe Bulwark preview\nThe Bulwark preview\nIn this issue: an original Grumble story!\nThis issue also features a very special original \"Grumble\" story from the entire crew - Rafer Roberts, Mike Norton, Marissa Louse and Crank! This story is all new and has never been published anywhere else!  \nGrumble preview\n Continuing from issue #1 is \"The Old Man and The Sea of Love\" by Jeff McComsey!\nThe Old Man and The Sea of Love preview\nAnd debuting this issue is a story about the coolest dog you've ever met, \"Badges O'Keefe, Canine Time Thief\" with Dani Grew and Larry Franks!\nBadges O'Keefe preview\nThis issue also features another in-depth article by Diana Krueger on the life of Matt Baker, Golden Age artist and designer, plus a few more items that I hope to add if we get past our initial goal!\nRewards\nThe biggest reward for this campaign is, of course, the book itself. Whether you go in for the physical copy or digital, I hope you'll feel that your pledge is well spent on these new sci-fi tales.\nThis issue comes with two covers: a regular cover with art by Adri\u00e1n \"Bago\" Gonzalez, and a Kickstarter-exclusive variant cover by Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1os Setz! You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \"making of\" publication, with a behind-the-scenes look a the creation of this issue. You'll also get your name printed in a \"thank you\" section in the book, and you'll get a digital copy an original Planet Comics issue from the 1940s!\nThere are some other, limited, physical rewards that you can get from this campaign. Here are a few!\nThere'll be a short run of hand-screened shirts that'll look something like this:\naccessorize!\n There are also some acrylic pins to be had!\nit's a pin!\nYou can also stock up on some other book that I've been involved with!\nGet a bunch of comics!\nThere's a limited crochet alien reward that goes well with the last campaign's rocket ship!\nI mean, look at this guy.\nBulwark artist Andrea Schiavone is drawing a limited number of social media profile images as a special, limited reward!

The thief who became a detective who became a thief, \nonly this time she steals from crooks.\n Mia Raven: swarthy, strong-willed woman who cares less about the law than she does recovering stolen items. Mia Raven: gun-toting feminist icon with a troubled past, bad attitude and tattered psyche. Mia Raven: CEO and founder of Recovery Incorporated, a company that will help you get your (valuable) stolen item back when the police can't. Or won't. For a hefty price, of course.\nRecovery Incorporated is a 24 page, over-sized 9x12 inch European formatted comic, part 1 in a 4 issue mini-series.\n My name is Michael Penick and I've been a professional artist and writer for over twenty years now, a freelancer in the advertising, film, illustration, comic book, motion graphics, and interface design industries. A jack of all trades, really, but my first love has always been visual storytelling, and at 51, I'm tired of letting all the stories I've been developing and writing languish alone in my imagination and on my computer. \nThanks to all the wonderful and generous support I've received so far, its time to interrupt this regularly scheduled kickstarter page and introduce some stretch goals! If so many stretch goals seem generous, then you're just going to have to live with it! \ud83d\ude09 I'm so grateful for how my campaign has gone so far that I want to help you get as much extra stuff as I can!  \n Recovery Incorporated - Another Day At The Office marks the beginning of my journey to bring those stories to you. It's the first of a four issue mini-series. I've been working on issue 02 since the beginning of the year. If you'd like to keep up with my progress, you can sign up for my newsletter here.\nThe first issue of Recovery Incorporated is finished. In fact, it's been finished since 2012! I was hired, at the time, to create a story for a British magazine. I brought my long time friend and writing partner Dean Deckard along with me to help in the creation process. The story would unfold in eight page increments each month. \n Unfortunately, the financier of the magazine, who lived in Eastern Europe, had trouble getting funds to the UK, which meant the editor there couldn't get funds to me! In light of that, I felt i had no choice but to stop my comic from running in the magazine. It was only a few months later that the entire magazine folded. It was a sad, but not uncommon affair, in the comics world.\nI \"shelved\" the story at the time because, well, I really needed to find work and make up for the months I had just spent working for no pay, but I also felt it wasn't really something American comic book readers would be into. In the time between then and now, however, the independent comic book market in the US has truly flourished, as has the Kickstarter platform. So here I am.\n Because I've been around. Ive seen what the publishing world looks like and what the contracts look like. I think, more and more, that Kickstarter is the future of comics and, potentially, publishing. I think this is the place to be. Even with an industry publisher I'd have to do my own marketing if i really wanted my book to be successful, so why not just do the rest of the work while I'm at it? And if I'm really, brutally honest with you, my ADD makes it easier for me to work for myself than under the deadlines imposed by the comic book industry most of the time. I'm a self-motivated guy - I don't require artificial stimulation to motivate me. Kickstarter provides me with the one link that was missing in my ability to complete my own production chain.\nTo answer that, let me ask yet another question: what makes Mia Raven different from all the other Femme Fatales you've seen in recent years? A lot of things. \n First off, she's a thief, not a spy. \n Second, she's into using her brains far more than she is using guns or sex. \n Third, unlike other people in the modern world of storytelling (think storytellers whose names rhyme with Bay Bay Haybrams), I like to plan ahead - I know what happens to Mia through each of the 4 planned story arcs. I know her character arc from before issue 01 begins through where we leave her on the final page of her saga. \n     You know what allows me to do? It allows me to put clues in issue 01 for which you won't see a payoff for another 10 issues. Those are the kinds of stories I love reading, so those are the kinds of stories I endeavor to write. \n I also like to do my research. Everything you'll find in these stories - every piece of tech, every security system or vehicle or any other such thing - either exists or is technically plausible. I love science, so I love to get it in wherever I can. I also hate when stories do ridiculous stuff I know is impossible - I don't write 80s Bond films, okay? \ud83d\ude09 \n     To up the ante even further, I served in the army, in the infantry, for a little over 4 years. I fast-roped out of Black Hawks, skydived out of all manner of military aircraft (even at night), trudged through the jungle on moonless nights wearing NVGs with an IR laser attached to my rifle - I got to do a lot of high speed stuff in my 4 years, stuff that not only allow me to bring a lot of knowledge and accuracy to my stories, but authenticity to my characters and the things I put them through.\n I've just shown you the first eight pages of my comic. Why? Because this is like the opening scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark - it introduces you to the character and the kind of thing she does, but the actual plot of this story doesn't begin until the next page.\n     One thing you might notice about Recovery Incorporated is that it's not drawn to typical American comic book proportions. It was commissioned for european standards, which I love, so that's the way I plan to print it. That means Recovery Incorporated will be printed at 9x12 inches, making my comic as wide as typical American comics are tall. I want the work to be presented the size it was intended to be shown. Not only will you be getting a larger comic than normal, but you're getting more story per page than typical American comics. There's plenty of story left in 16 pages, and I plan on having issue 2 ready to go once you get issue 01 in your hands. \n     A word of caution, however...\n     While there's no nudity in Recovery Incorporated, there's adult language and reference to adult situations. This isn't for kids. It would be irresponsible for me to not let you know that up front.\n     So what are early readers saying about the first issue of Recovery Incorporated?\n Andy Jenkins - \"It's a polished book with some really fluid dynamic art and well thought out panel and page structure... it's exciting, builds up the characters well and has enough little twists and turns to keep you reading and looking forward to the next issue.\"\nRandy Stone - \"I knew going in that with Michael Penick's art, this would be a great looking book, but I was equally impressed with the story he did with co-writer Dean Deckard. The ideas were fun and the pace was exciting. This is a blockbuster on the page!\"\nMark Freeman - \"Recovery Incorporated is everything I love about independent comic books. The story itself is fresh and different. The characters are written as real people with real-world issues. The artwork is crisp, clean and easy to follow, while the writing has layers of complexity. This makes for a fun and engaging read. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next.\"\nDanny Gorny - \"The action is compelling. It's a pleasure to read a globetrotting heist story with such an elegant setup. The art and colouring are great - featuring excellent use of dramatic shots during the exposition scenes, and the backgrounds and setting are exciting. The colouring choices, especially during the flashbacks, is inspired.\"\nGabriel Hernandez - \"Recovery Incorporated starts strong and gets stronger with each page. It's a refreshing update to  the 'Gentleman Thief' legend for the 21st Century.\"\nI'm not asking for a lot. I'm keeping it simple because I want this to succeed. If i can pass my funding goal, I'll shoot for some simple stretch goals like a nicer cover stock and a couple of other things I'll introduce later in the campaign. What I am asking for is covered in the graphic here:\nAs you can see, there's nothing fancy here. No thrills, no frills - nothing outside what it costs to run this campaign, print the books, and get them to you.\nHere's what you can expect from me once the campaign has ended. You can see the plan right here; I'll keep backers up to date as each step here comes to pass so you'll know everything is going as scheduled. If there are any hiccups, I'll let got know immediately and tell you how that will affect the schedule.\n2/11 - Campaign ends \n2/26 - Receive funds from Kickstarter \n3/1 - Place ptint order\n3/15 - Receive print order at my house \n3/29 - All orders packed and shipped\n5/23 - Domestic orders received by mail\nMedia mail can take 8 weeks to arrive - that's why the long shipping window. Many packages may arrive quicker than that, but I'd rather have you're package arrive earlier than I told you than later. During this time I will be busting my hump to get issue 02 pencilled, inked, colored, and ready to go so that I can launch the campaign for issue 02 right on the heels of you getting issue 01 in your hands. If you want to follow my progress along the way, my newsletter is the best place to do it! If you missed it before, you can sign up for it here.\nI'm offering three covers for my first issue of Recovery Incorporated. The main cover, drawn by me, will be used everywhere. The two alternate covers will only be available here on Kickstarter, possibly only during this one campaign. I will never offer them anywhere else - that's a promise. So let me show you the covers:\n     As I mentioned before, my longtime friend and co-writer Dean Deckard helped me create Mia Raven and the story that covers this first mini-series. We\u2019ve been the closest of friends for 30 years now. We challenge each other over everthing, make each other think, and work well as writing partners because neither of us care about ego. All we care about is story.\n     My only other collaborator on this issue was the Eisner award winning colorist John Rauch. I can't begin to tell you what a joy it is to get pages back from John. I've worked with him on several projects and never once have I had to fret over a single thing. Its like he reads my mind, but more clearly than I can. My biggest hope for this campaign, in fact, is that I can raise enough funds to hire him to color issue 02 for me as I get the pages ready - that will allow me to get issue 02 to you in the shortest time frame possible. That's one of those stretch goals I mentioned a second ago.\n     Now let's take a look at the pledge levels I'm offering up. I've tried to keep them as simple and easy to understand as I could. \n Update: Funding goal bonus reward - all backers at every level will now receive free access to an audio commentary of me talking my way through issue 01 as both a writer and an artist \nAllow me to take a moment and explain the \"Prior Work Bundle\" limitation. I don't have 10 bundles in reach of the three tiers I'm offering it in, I have ten total. If a person pledges for one in one tier, it reduces their availability in all three tiers together. To reiterate: I only have 10 Prior Work Bundles in total. \nOn top of these support tiers, you can add any of the following items to your pledges (in case you're wanting to build your order in a way I haven't thought of in the tiers, want more of one thing, or even two forms of original art):\nFor the sketch cards, pin-ups, original pages of art, and covers, I will contact each person in the order that they pledged to choose which piece of art they want from the available choices. \nThank you so much for your time, and, if I get your support, for helping me get this ball rolling. You are an essential element of my future and I value you more than I can say. Every day when i get up and work, I will endeavor to make sure i have given you more than your money's worth.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as risks and challenges go, the book is ready to go to the printer, which I've already chosen, and is here in the US, so turn around time will be quick. I'll pay for insurance on the shipping so if anything were to happen, I'll be covered to get another print run done. That just leaves getting your packages to you. I've taken lessons from the most experienced kickstarters and have gotten the best materials to make sure your books reach you as safely and perfectly as possible, and while this is only my first kickstarter, I've been a professional artist and writer delivering jobs on time for over 20 years now - you don't stay in business if you don't communicate well, get your work done, and delivered on time.

It tells the story of high school senior Elliot Morgan: a massive comic fan with graduation and Major Voltage Adventures on his mind, when he's astonished to discover he has superhuman abilities of his own. \nWhen he almost immediately goes out and makes a public display of his new superheroic abilities, he's amazed to be confronted by his favourite comic book characters staring him down in the real world. As if that wasn't crazy enough, they reveal the truth about themselves - they're his parents and they reveal that they are refugees from the world of his favourite comic book escaped to this world when he was just a baby. \nWhat follows is revelation after revelation, after more and more of the family's secrets come to light. Just how many secrets can one family be keeping?\nThe Miracle Family by Luciano Vecchio\nElliot Morgan aka Miracle design by Vince Underwood\nElliot Morgan a.k.a. Miracle - Elliot is an average teen boy, and a bit of a geek. He\u2019s an outward optimist but harbours within him some anger. Elliot's anger seems to revolve around the idea that so much about himself was kept secret from him, but there's more that he's keeping inside himself. He is a believer in taking a responsibility for his home with his new capabilities, and with those newfound reality-warping abilities, there's little that he can't do.\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath design by Vince Underwood\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath - Elliot\u2019s younger in age but bigger in size brother, Ayden is much more quiet, introverted and sullen than Elliot. Ayden has been dealing with intense mental health issues, that may be connected to his empathic abilities, and he has to learn to come to terms and learn to live with them.\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage design by Vince Underwood\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage - Elliot\u2019s father, Evan was his world\u2019s leading superhero. Proud, tough, but with a warm, open heart, he\u2019s always been troubled by the fact he and his wife kept their kids\u2019 true nature from them. Defending his family has been his sole purpose since taking refuge in this world, so he now has a less ostentatious profession than 'superhero' to help stay hidden. However, he holds some pride in his son taking up his old line of work.\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms Phantom design by Vince Underwood\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms. Phantom - Kate is Elliot and Ayden\u2019s mother, and is the one responsible for hiding their true natures from them using her telepathy. She\u2019s almost the opposite of Evan in that she\u2019s quieter, seems sadder, and the escape to their new home and what it led to took its toll. However, she is fiercely protective of her family, and would go to any length for them.\nJessica Lectron a.k.a. Superia design by Vince Underwood\nJessica Morgan a.k.a. Superia - Elliot\u2019s cousin, Evan\u2019s niece, Superia was another great hero of their home reality. She was bright, bushy tailed and brash, but in the \u2018real\u2019 world has become more serious, grimmer and reserved. Much of this comes from the trauma of the move over to the new world, and she has withdrawn from the main family significantly, implying there might be more to her pull away from both the family and from her previous life as a superhero than is known.\nElliot Morgan is your average teenage outcast, keeping his head down as best he can to get through High School. One thing that's been a source of comfort to him all his life has been his love of comic books, particularly one comic book: the mysterious final issue of Major Voltage Adventures. An issue written by a reclusive British comics writer, that sees the heroes in a tense stand-off with their arch-nemesis Maestro during a reality-shattering Catastrophe. The story is left unresolved and is a major topic of debate and theorising for decades. Elliot doesn't know why he's so obsessed with it, but it's the one comic he comes back to read again and again. \nThen one day, the strangest thing happens: Elliot starts exhibiting unnatural, superhuman abilities. From there, Elliot's world is turned upside down, with revelation after revelation, not least of which being his parents are Major Voltage and Ms Phantom, and his family came to this world from the fictional world of his favourite comic book. \nSuperia designs by Andrew Sebastien Kwan\nNow deciding to use his great gifts for good in the 'real' world, just how will that work for a superhuman refugee from a comic book? And what other skeletons are the Morgans keeping in their closet?\nWe're going for a mix of soap opera drama and large scale superhero action adventure. Think The OC crossed with The Incredibles. Fantastic Four mixed with 13 Reasons Why. This Is Us meets X-Men, by way of Invincible. \nEmpath/Ayden design by Zoe Thorogood\nThe Miracles is a story I've been working on and wanting to tell since I started writing The Pride. The Miracles has been a comic series, a book, a mini-series, and over the years I've worked with numerous artists to develop the idea including Gavin Mitchell, Kris Anka, Zoe Thorogood and Andrew Sebastian Kwan. Now, having found the perfect team to finally make this project a reality, we'll bring it out as an Original Graphic Novel so everyone can finally have this tale of families, broken realities and the secrets we keep. While we touch on a number of issues including refugees, the role of a hero in the world, personal responsibility to one's home, whether born there or found, the main core remains family and secrets. \nOriginal Character Designs/Sketch by Kris Anka\nJoe Glass - Writer\nJOE GLASS - Writer - Joe is the writer and creator of LGBTQ+ superhero team series, The Pride. Originally self-published, The Pride was the first ComiXology Submit title that got upgraded and continued as a ComiXology Originals series. He's also released superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses and glitter noir, queer grindhouse revenge fantasy, Glitter Vipers. A staunch advocate for inclusion and representation in comics, Joe does whatever he can to make that happen. Joe lives in South Wales, UK with a belligerent cat named Oliver. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nVince Underwood - Artist\nVINCE UNDERWOOD - Artist - Vince is an American comic book artist. His credits include Elk Mountain and Page Turn (both available on Comixology). He has also done comics work for transmedia horror company Cold Room Entertainment and illustrated for NBC Sports and the San Francisco Giants. Vince lives with and by the grace of his wonderful wife Hannah, their two dogs Cassie and Millie, and their cat Derek. You can follow him on twitter. \n\nHARRY SAXON - Colours - Harry is an illustrator and comics colourist from Greece. He is currently 38 years old and irreversibly trans. You might know his work from titles such as Vault Comics\u2019 Vagrant Queen and its successor Vagrant Queen: A Planet Called Doom and Test and Black Mask\u2019s Sex Death Revolution. If you don\u2019t know his work, this is an excellent way of getting started. You can check his website and follow him on twitter. Friendship and discounts offered if you\u2019re into Doctor Who.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU - Letters - Hassan is a British/Algerian letterer of comics. He's worked on things like Quantum & Woody, Undone by Blood and First Knife. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and the editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nWe'll also have a cover by amazing artist, the fabulous Kevin Wada, and the logo has been designed by the incomparable Dominic Xavier Crewe.\nCover Artwork by Kevin Wada\nThe book is still being made as we speak and raise funds, and we are planning/expecting to have it ready for release and posting to backers for the third quarter of 2021, looking at October 2021. We're about 10% complete as of now, and are on schedule to hit this goal. \nWe want as many people as possible to be able to get and read The Miracles. As such, we are keeping a cheaper digital option available for those on a budget who still want to read our action-packed, amazing superhero family story. \nMock-up for the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition\nWe also want collectors to feel like there's something extra special for them too. As such, there'll be a very limited edition hardcover version of the book, for those that want something a bit more special to sit on their shelves, that will be exclusively available to Kickstarter backers. Containing the 120 pages of story, plus further behind the scenes pages and designs, creating an overall book size of 160 pages!\nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm hardcover, 160 pages plus end pages and cover, matt lamination outer cover, 170GSM uncoated endpapers, 130GSM silk main pages, full colour throughout\nMock-up for trade paperback edition\nOn a larger print run, we'll have a trade paperback version available too, filled with the 120 page story, plus extras and more, such as design work and sketches making for a 140 page book. \nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm trade paperback, 140 pages, 300GSM silk and matt laminated cover, 130GSM silk internal pages, full colour throughout\nSticker\nWe'll also be making a sticker of the main The Miracles logo, so this will be available on a number of rewards tiers.\nEnamel Pin\nThere's also an enamel pin, of a stylised version of the series' emblem. A nice, shiny little mark of being in The Miracles Family. \nThere are also a couple of retailer tiers too, so if you are a store and would like five or even ten copies at a discount price, please check out those tiers! NB: It will be the TPB version of the book in those tiers, the hardcover is Exclusive to the Kickstarter only. \nWe even have been given access by Kickstarter to allow ADD ONS, which will include some of my back catalogue of titles, including superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses; glitter noir queer grindhouse revenge fantasy Glitter Vipers; and the last few copies of the original, limited edition self-published The Pride collection, collecting the first ten comics made before the series was picked up by ComiXology Originals. \nThis is a BIG project, possibly one of the biggest I've ever done, and so we need all the help we can get to cover this. The total of this campaign goes to paying the creative team to make the art and design, and to cover printing costs and delivery. It's a high goal, but with enough support, we can do it.\nWe're also teaming with a fulfilment company in the US to help bring down costs for international backers, and speed up fulfilment too! White Squirrel will be helping us deliver speedily and cost effectively, handling the US backers. I've found that the largest part of my audience is based in America, so I've taken this measure to help keep postage costs as low as possible for the region, as well as helping me keep costs down for all other regions too.\nA rough breakdown of how the funds are distributed\n\nMost of the money raised is going on production on the book, specifically the art team. The next biggest chunk will be for printing and postage. These are big expenses, and always increasing, but with your help, we can do it. \nIf we manage to surpass our goal, we'll look into Stretch Goals too, but for now, our main focus is hitting our goal. \nI am so excited about this story and bringing it to you all, I think it's one of the strongest stories I've ever created. \nBut don't just take my word for it! Check out some early pages below!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third campaign run during the pandemic, as well as my ninth campaign overall, so by now I have a lot of experience with running these things. \n\nThat being said, postage/shipping is something that can often catch people out, myself included in the past. So, for this campaign, being my biggest campaign to date, I've partnered with a fulfilment company to handle the US backers, which will also mean we can keep the price down for those international backers that are the most expensive to ship from the UK too. \n\nLife factors can sometimes delay production, even in the midst of lockdowns and the like. I've done my best to factor those in, but as always, some things can never really be planned for. However, if and when anything like that happens that will cause a delay in production or delivering rewards, me and the team will communicate that to you right away. \n\nUltimately, barring any huge, sweeping changes to postage costs or with the pandemic situation itself, this will all be handled on time and with professionalism.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Support Tier", "descp": "At this tier, you're just showing your support and drive to help us make this project you happen.

With stylish storytelling and gorgeous rendering, he makes a genre that has in recent years been relegated to the back shelves of entertainment fun and compelling again. I can't wait to see what he and Athena have in store for us.\" \u2014 Mark Schultz, creator/writer/artist, Xenozoic Tales  |  writer,  Prince Valiant  |  illustrator, Conan of Cimmeria \n\"Athena Voltaire is a wonderful pulp throwback. A return to the heady days of the adventure comic. Swords, guns, airplanes, sand, jungles, dens of villainy, conspirators, cutthroats, treasure, and all 36\"- 24\"- 36\" of the most dangerous woman in the genre.\" \u2014Tim Bradstreet, cover artist, The Punisher, Hellblazer\nIn the knuckle-dusting style of classic pulp adventure comes Athena Voltaire, the globetrotting aviatrix who takes on Nazis, secret societies, zombies, and unspeakable occult creatures! From sunken galleons to haunted mountain-top lairs to hidden jungle temples, our heroine faces peril at every turn as she races to save the world!\nLaunched online in 2001, the series has earned an Eisner Award nomination, a Russ Manning Award nomination, and three Harvey Award nominations, and has had a publishing home at Ape Entertainment, Dark Horse Comics, and, currently, Action Lab Entertainment. \nAthena Voltaire and the Terror on the Orient Express finds the heroine reconnecting with an old friend during a personal trip on the famed train line. When an old foe sets a plan in motion, the voyage turns deadly, as Athena must find the source of horrific slayings that are terrorizing the passengers!\nPlanned for issues 9\u201312 of the Action Lab Athena Voltaire ongoing series, the prologue follows Athena on a mad dash to the train station. This sequence serves as a framing sequence to tell tales of the adventuress' past.\nOnce onboard, it's apparent that something is wrong, as passengers begin to perish at the hands of a creature who stalks the train. \nObviously, someone has to do something...\nLike every other volume in the series, Athena Voltaire and the Terror on the Orient Express works as an excellent introduction to Athena and her world. Each volume tells a self-contained adventure. Of course, when combined with the other volumes in the series, a larger story begins to take shape. \nBest of all, Athena Voltaire and the Terror on the Orient Express is already written, drawn, and lettered, and the colors will be completed by the time that funding is completed! \n LET'S LOOK AT THE REWARDS! \n\n\nMoney raised will go toward artist and colorist fees, printing, backer rewards, and shipping.\nSHIPPING AND PACKAGING\nIf you support a Kickstarter campaign, the last thing you want is for your books to arrive damaged! With that in mind, all of our physical packages are being shipped in Gemini Comic Mailers. These things are practically nuke-proof, insuring that your comics arrive in great condition!\nThe Collector's Box and the Mystery Box will each be shipped, bubble-wrapped, in Priority Mail boxes.\nAnd oversized original art rewards will be placed between 2 sheets of masonite, bubble-wrapped, and shipped in 12x18x2\" corrugated boxes, to insure they won't be bent.

Where young Mattie Moore has always had many friends, including the renowned Captain Terrific, the world\u2019s greatest superhero! Because of this close shared friendship, Mattie is always the first man at any crime scene they call Captain Terrific to. He records the captain\u2019s acts of heroism for the world to see on a channel lovingly called \u201cSUPER BEST FRIEND.\u201d These videos have garnered Mattie fame, celebrity, and friendships with all the superheroes in the world. However, it\u2019s Mattie\u2019s friendship with Terrific that means the most to him. \nCaptain Terrific chats with his best friend, Mattie.\nHowever, everything changes when Mattie makes a grave mistake! He records Captain Terrific during a personal moment, accidentally revealing his secret identity, Calvin Cobb, to the entire world!\n\nHORRENDOUS!

It wasn\u2019t until 2018 that I started writing this story and convinced George to draw the adventure of Mattie and Captain Terrific. My time hosting DC All Access inspired this idea of online media consumption and superheroes.

Thank you for supporting Thirsty!\n\nTHIRSTY is a graphic novel made up of four sexy stories that overlap in fun, exciting ways.\n\nImagine a date that ends with an enlightening discovery behind your date's closet door...\nImagine a sex shop of the future, where you can customize your desires...\nImagine a woman setting out to create her own sexy videos, on a quest to find just the right partner for the job...\nImagine a late-night drive in a car designed to read your deepest fantasies...\nThese four comics, drawn by some of comics' top talent, make for the spiciest graphic novel you'll read this year. If you're a fan of comics like Sunstone or Smut Peddler, you'll love THIRSTY's hilarious, emotional, exciting, character-driven erotica.\n\nTHIRSTY is a 56-page graphic novel from the team that brought you DESTINY NY, PRISON WITCH, and more. We are writer team and married couple <3 Pat Shand and Amy Shand, and this is our 17th Kickstarter. \nHere are normal, everyday pictures of us.\n\nWe think that stories about sex can be every bit as nuanced as stories about love, stories about fantasy, any kind of story, and we are excited to bring these new ideas to you with THIRSTY.\n\nWe will be writing THIRSTY specifically for four incredible artists:\n\n CHIARA COLASANTI: After working together on DESTINY, NY Chiara's delicate but strong style made us excited to tell more stories with her.\n\n DAPHNE RED: A newcomer to erotica comics, she will be delivering a lush, soft, romantic style to a funny tale about how sex and anxiety can collide.\n\n KELSI JO SILVA: Kelsi submitted some of the spiciest sample pages we have ever seen and we fell in LOVE with her art. We can't wait for you to see her take on an online entrepreneur! Kelsi has also supplied the artwork for our two SWEET and SPICY prints.\n\n ELENA OMINETTI: Elena takes on a story about how the customization of a sex shop in the future leads to a real-life romp.\n...and JIM CAMPBELL, who has lettered and designed every book we have done to perfection from the start!\n\nThat's not all, though. In addition to our standard cover by the incredible Romina Moranelli (pictured above), we have a Kickstarter-exclusive version of THIRSTY with an incredible variant cover by superstar artist JENN ST-ONGE.\n\nJENN ST-ONGE VARIANT\n\nAnd we have TWO prints by the amazing KELSI JO SILVA who also does the interiors.\n \"SWEET\" PRINT\n\"SPICY\" PRINT\nPREVIEW PAGES!\nHere's a preview of each story in \"Thirsty\" with certain areas *~*~*~*flower emojied*~*~*~* for Kickstarter. \n\"Art Dolls\" illustrated by Elena Ominetti\n\"Only Friends\" illustrated by Kelsi Jo Silva\n\"Cascading\" illustrated by Daphne Red\n\"Automatic\" illustrated by Chiara Colasanti\nIn addition to the main tiers, you can manually adjust your pledge to add these awesome items. \n\nNow, add-ons have been added officially through Kickstarter, so you can do this ON YOUR PLEDGE with a new menu!\n\nHere is everything we have available.\nFirst, is the main series I fund through Kickstarter, my long-running Destiny, NY graphic novels. This series follows Logan McBride, a girl who was the subject of a prophecy as a child. She completed this prophecy when she was just 13, and now she's entering her 30s trying to find meaning in her life post-Destiny. That's when she meets Lilith, the last surviving daughter of a mystical crime family... and from this point on, their lives will never be the same.\nYou can see more about each volume through the original campaigns;\nDestiny, NY Volume 1\nDestiny, NY Volume 2\nDestiny, NY Volume 3\nDestiny, NY Volume 4\nDestiny, NY Short Stories Collection 1\n Gangster Ass Barista (A Destiny, NY Spinoff)\nAnd now, earlier this year, we funded a new spinoff, Cherry Gilbert: Necromancer.\nAll of these can be added to your order!\n\nIn addition to Destiny, NY I have funded two other series along with a few standalone graphic novels on Kickstarter. In doing this, I have formed the company Space Between Entertainment to produce these comics, a podcast, video content, and more. Here's our current slate of available graphic novels that you can add to your order:\n Prison Witch: A mystical thriller about the magic that happens behind bars at a women's prison. Two volumes so far, with more to come. Volume 1 has a cover by Jenn St-Onge, and Volume 2 has a cover by Natasha Alterici. Written by Amy Shand & Pat Shand, illustrated by Erica D'Urso.\n Afterglow: A post-apocalyptic epic about a girl and her giant, radioactive cat. Written by Pat Shand, illustrated in full color by K. Lynn Smith.\n Spooky Girls: A full-color, graphic novel made up of 4 new monster comics, each written by Pat Shand and illustrated by different artists: Jenny the Werecat, Vicky Slime, Punk Teen Demon Queen, & Tarantula Twins.\n Modern Dread: A horror anthology about modern anxieties. Created by Ryan Fassett & Pat Shand, including contributions from ARMY OF DARKNESS artist Larry Watts, THE WALKING DEAD (TV Series) writer LaToya Morgan, & more.\n Clonsters: A young Earth Nugget attempts to find her lost Splat in this all-ages adventure about monsters made out of clay. Written by Amy Shand & Pat Shand, with illustration by Vanessa Cardinali. Two Volumes so far!\n Vampire Emmy & the Garbage Girl: In this horror/rom-com, a vampire falls in lover with her sanitation worker who has a secret of her own.\n\nAnd you can also add-on any of the items from the campaign:\n\n\n $13,000 (UNLOCKED!): Now, each story will get its own illustrated cover page in both the digital and print versions of Thirsty.\n $16,000 (UNLOCKED!): Major upgrade! Now, the standard cover of Thirsty will be treated with spot gloss so it really pops in your collection.\n $20,000 (UNLOCKED): NOT FINAL ART IN GRAPHIC. All print backers will receive a saucy bookmark illustrated by KATE KASENOW! \n $25,000 (UNLOCKED): Finally, our ultimate stretch goal... a brand new comic. DESTINY, NY: THIRSTY will be a digital-only, full-color (for the first time) exclusive featuring our Destiny, NY characters made specifically as a Thirsty tie-in! In this story, Logan dreams of the... memorable early days of past relationships.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween this and the projects I've funded over at our collaborative Space Between company page, this is my 17th Kickstarter campaign. In a creative endeavor of this size, possible challenges could be delays in production or printing depending on the current situation with the quarantine, considering we ship overseas. However, we have successfully Kickstarted multiple projects before as creators AND as a team, which has given us the utmost confidence that we'll meet and exceed your expectations, no matter what is happening in the world. When hiccups are hit, we send updates. When we receive our shipment, we get them our to backers immediately without delay. I mean, why would we want to hold onto the books when we're so eager for YOU to read them?\n\nOne thing that we can't control is customs charges and the price of international shipping. We pay more for international shipping than we charge, but some countries will charge an extra customs fee based on the prices of the items included. Our advice there would just be to be aware of that.\n\nOur backers deserve the absolute best, and we promise to deliver the highest quality, the best communication, and all questions answered quickly -- ALWAYS!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "THE BOOK - Digital", "descp": "A PDF of \"Thirsty\" for our digital readers.

So let your favorite retailer know that they can get JON SABLE, FREELANCE Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus Volume 1 before anyone else!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nRETURN OF A CLASSIC FOR A NEW GENERATION\nMike Grell's JON SABLE, FREELANCE was a trailblazing comic book in the 1980s. \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE, the story of a former African hunter in the concrete jungle, was one of the earliest successes among independent comics of the 1980s.  A top seller, SABLE often saw higher sales and critical praise than Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Avengers, and many other mainstay titles. It was one of the comics of the era that helped redefine what the medium could achieve.\nAfter successful Kickstarter campaigns to revive Mike Grell\u2019s MAGGIE THE CAT and his collaboration with actor/writer Mark Ryan on THE PILGRIM, Grell\u2019s Masterstroke Studios imprint is giving one of his most popular creations a massive new release: JON SABLE, FREELANCE.\nIt is notable that SABLE has never gotten the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus treatment it deserves. IDW released a series of trade paperbacks in the early 2000s, and Comicmix published smaller sized paperback omnibus editions in the last decade. Masterstroke is upping the game by going for over-sized editions that will be definitive versions of the legendary series.\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nHERE'S THE PLAN:\nOver the next couple of years, Masterstroke Studios will be releasing JON SABLE, FREELANCE, the definitive omnibus collection in 5 volumes, with the final volume being launched in time for Mike Grell's 75th birthday in September of 2022.\n\nEach volume will consist of approximately 400 pages of content, including all of the issues, all of the covers, and heaps of bonus materials (some never before seen). These editions will be over-sized (think DC Absolute Editions), showing the pages bigger than they have ever been seen before. Each volume will have a dustjacket with new art by Mike Grell. Key issues will have commentary from Grell about the story and behind the scenes insights. And there will be lots of other goodies thrown in as well (including a companion book of original letters column pages, old house ads, and other rare bits and pieces from the history of JON SABLE, FREELANCE!)\n\nVOLUME 1 covers issues #1 - #13, completing the first major story arc of Sable, from his origins as an Olympic athlete, to his life and lose living with his family in Africa, to his personal death wish as a gun-for-hire upon his return to America. The first volume concludes with Sable's return to Vietnam to find a man missing in action.\n\nGrell's gritty, yet emotionally grounded tales are a slice of mid-1980s current events, politics and intrigue, blended with action and adventure. The entire series is a unique time capsule of an era, while also remaining relevant and fresh for a new generation. \n\nTHIS KICKSTARTER\nThis is where it all begins. This Kickstarter is to fund the creation and production of Volume 1 (and possibly Volume 2 if we cross $100K on this campaign) of the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus series.\nWe've spent months planning every detail of this campaign to make it as efficient and straightforward as possible.\n\nWe've set the price point at a comparable retail market price for other similar volumes rather than elevate the price point on Kickstarter, as so many projects do.  It is not uncommon to pay upwards of $30 for a single issue of a comic on Kickstarter (which is based on the cost of creation for writers and artists. Comics are not cheap to create and publish, no doubt about it). But since this material already exists, the costs are a bit lower for us. This means we can focus on making the presentation of the material the best it can be. We can also begin advance work on the next volumes, as we prepare to launch them in the coming months.\n\nWe see fans who contribute to projects get frustrated when they see the same books available months later for a fraction of what they pledged. And while these editions will be made widely available later on down the line, you will pay the same price to support it here that you would to buy it next year in your local comic shops and other retailers. AND... these editions will contain Kickstarter exclusive aspects that those others won't. These will be the first, and rarest versions of the omnibus set, guaranteed. \nA unique page of art in the front of the book will be exclusive to this Kickstarter, and some copies of this Kickstarter backed volume will come with an exclusive bookplate that will be signed and numbered. As well, the names of backers of this project will be listed in the back of the book, thanking them for their frontline support of Mike Grell's work. As well, some fans can get special recognition, including sketches of their likenesses being used for an exclusive trading card set! \nThere are many perks beyond just getting the book. You can get a limited number of original Grell commissioned sketches (some of them inside the book itself, making your copy all the more unique).\n\nThis is a massive project that we're breaking up over two years and five volumes, that, when complete, will be the final word on the original JON SABLE adventures.\nEarly bird pricing saves you even more. If you pledge in the first 48 hours, you end up saving an additional $25 on the book, which will retail for $100 down the road when offered for Local Comic Shops.\n\nWhat you get: \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE Masterstroke Edition Volume 1.\nThere are many other pledge levels that include sketches, other Masterstroke publications you may have missed, and a whole host of other unique opportunities to be backers at higher levels and get even more out of this amazing project!\nAs we surpass our funding goal, and unlock Stretch Goals, there are even more great surprises in store, from trading cards, a Sable poster, a feature length Mike Grell video interview, trading cards, art portfolio prints, and even a chance to get Volume 2 of the omnibus set at a discounted rate after we pass a certain funding goal.\nLots of cool things await! And this is just the beginning.\n\nEARLY BIRD BACKER BONUS!\nThe first 100 Backers will get an exclusive Sable art print by Mike Grell that will be exclusive to this campaign! A one of a kind (well, one of one hundred) piece, this will be a great bonus for fans!\n\n DID YOU MISS THE OTHER MASTERSTROKE KICKSTARTERS?\nFear not! You can catch up on everything Grell right here with this campaign.\nThat's right. You will be able to get Maggie The Cat, The Pilgrim, Jon Sable black and white bonus comic, Rules of The Hunt, The Mike Grell Sketchbook, The Legion of Super Heroes Sketchbook and Sketch Cards, and more!\nThere's a pledge level that catches you up, but we will also be announcing ways to add on individual items you may have missed along the way!\n\nSOME OTHER SURPRISES AWAIT\nWorking from original plates of the page art, Mike Grell will be able to go back into select issues and pages, and clean up some of the art, making it sharper, clearer, and better looking than ever before.\nWe're mindful of not altering the original art, but rather we are planning to lovingly improve the art, colors and pages where needed to make this the best looking, and most definitive version of Sable.\nIn future volumes of the set, there will new color added to some issues, as well as new artwork. (Keep reading...)\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nEach of the planned five volumes will clock in at around 400 pages. They will be larger than we\u2019ve ever seen SABLE, measuring approximately 8.5 by 12.25 inches (the same size as the DC Comics Absolute Edition releases) with glossy interior pages, rare materials (including never before seen artwork), all new covers, and dust jackets that will line up to form a complete image when placed in order on a shelf. Each volume will retail for $100.\n\nJON SABLE'S Back!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nThat's right! Mike Grell's classic is making a triumphant return in a deluxe hardcover format for the first time!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nThe original cover to JSF #1 from First Comics back in 1982!\nA gallery of original covers for the issues that will be contained within Volume 1\n This two page spread from Jon Sable, Freelance #1 has been lovingly preserved, while also increasing the quality from the original newsprint pages to a bright glossy finish! This is the best Sable has ever looked!\n The original cover to the SABEL novel from 2000. It has been revised and re-edited for an all new release, and you can get it digitally though this campaign!\n\n But it shouldn't scare you, the fans! It should excite you! Jon Sable's triumphant return will be a FAN driven publication! By the fans, for the fans! This is the ultimate presentation of JON SABLE!\nThis is how the original series stacks up. Now, imagine it bigger, bolder, brighter, and more badass than ever before! \n\n THE FUTURE\nWith 5 total volumes needed to collect the entire run of 56 original issues, 12 additional issues, and other bonus appearances (anyone remember Mike Grell's 5 page in \"Word Warriors\" literacy awareness comic in 1987? How about that 5 page Hero Initiative benefit comic in 2014? The black and white \"Rules Of The Hunt\" bonus comic from the \"Maggie The Cat\" Kickstarter? Yes, we will have it ALL!) of Jon Sable, each volume will be approximately 400 pages in length, with extensive bonuses.\n\nAstute fans will recall that late in the original run of JSF, Mike Grell left the art chores behind, bringing in a host of talented artists to draw the issues. They were all great artists in their own right, but it just wasn't the same without Grell at the pencil.\n\nWell, we're about to make an announcement that will blow the minds of fans:\nVolumes 4 and 5 of this omnibus series will feature issues of JSF, redrawn by Mike Grell himself!\nWe've got Stephen B Scott along to assist with finishes to Mike's pencils for some of the backgrounds and some of the issues. Mike will be fully drawing several of the key issues, and providing pencils for the rest. This will be like seeing 13 issues worth of JSF the way that they were meant to be, for the first time in over 30 years! This is a unique opportunity for Mike to go back and do those issues the way he envisioned them from the start!\nI'm excited just typing that. Honestly, as a fan (and editor for the project) I feel like we're going to discover a lost treasure of Mike Grell art! And I don't know of any other instances of artists reaching that far back and redrawing whole issues of comics.\n\nBut it all starts here, with Volume 1. We need to fund this project, and get the printing presses rolling on this set of omnibus editions. In many ways, this campaign will be the foundation upon which all future Mike Grell Masterstroke Studios projects will be built. So, we need you, the fans, now more than ever! The more successful this initial campaign is, the more poised for bringing you the absolute, ultimate, best SABLE possible.\nThis is the moment all Grell fans have been waiting for!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $56,000! When we hit this goal, we will include an exclusive JON SABLE Omnibus collection bookmark, and an exclusive Kickstarter JON SABLE sketch card from Mike Grell!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $58,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a digital video file of a nearly 2 hour live filmed docu-interview with Mike Grell, filmed in 2018!

This \"Inside The Actors Studio\" type interview is a perfect companion to the Eisner Award nominated \"Life Is Drawing WIthout An Eraser\" book from TwoMorrows Publishing! A must for Grell fans. (If we cross $100K, look for this film to go from downloadable, to a full DVD!)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3: $60,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a JON SABLE Companion, volume 1. This will include reprints of all the original letters pages from the issues within this volume, as well as a Who's Who style section of characters, and a guide to guns as seen and used in the pages of this volume, plus more bonus content like rare in-house ads from the original run, etc. A unique companion to the omnibus collection! 24 pages of color and black and white images!\nSTRETCH GOAL #4: $65,000!  When we hit this goal, we will include the first set (in 5 total sets) of JON SABLE FREELANCE trading cards! Unique collectibles, with characters from the series. By the time we produce all 5 volumes, you'll have a full set of  25 cards, but it all starts with this initial set of cards.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5: $70,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a brand new Mike Grell Jon Sable art print that will have a classic cinema poster look to it akin to classic James Bond film posters!

Once all 5 volumes of the omnibus are finished, there will be a full portfolio (in a unique slipcase) of 10 art prints. \nAND WE HAVE EVEN MORE STRETCH GOALS PLANNED, SO KEEP AN EYE OUT....\nWe have some MAJOR plans for Stretch Goals that go up to $100,000, and include some amazing items! So help us get funded, and we will reveal a new Stretch Goal each day over the next 5 days following hitting our funding goal!\n* Note: Stretch Goal rewards are only available to backers who pledge on physical levels, not digital.\n\nMILESTONE GOALS:\nBe sure and keep an eye out for bonus items being offered when we hit certain milestones along the way!

Now, to make ends meet, Jemele takes an offer from a mysterious person named Spencer Avery.\n\nSpencer needs he and his special cargo driven from Dayton, OH, to Las Vegas within a small time frame to satisfy his client, Mr. Wolf. And no one denies Mr. Wolf.\n\nFor Jemele, there's no turning back, and what seems to be a high-speed job could end up being even more than she ever imagined. Get ready for a ride of a lifetime. \n\nWelcome to IGNITION: ISSUE #2!\nIGNITION is a comic book mini-series written by Shawn Pryor & Jenna Lyn Wright, with sequential artwork and lettering by Kelly Guillory.

With your support, we can be successful and continue to give you all more for your money. IGNITION: Issue #2 will be printed in a 5.5\" x 8.5\" digest-sized format, on a nice 80 lb matte laminated paper stock, with a 130 lb matte laminated cover.\nWHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING\nThe money raised for the IGNITION: Issue #2 campaign will go towards paying our series artist, Kelly Guillory, printing costs, backer rewards, and shipping costs. If we end up smashing our initial goal, all additional funding will be used to produced awards from our campaign stretch goals, additional content for the series, per-page-rate bonuses for the creative team, possible future content, and more. We'll give you the best that we have with every issue, always.  \n\nREWARDS & STRETCH GOALS\nIf you missed IGNITION: Issue #1, don't worry because we're offering a 2nd Printing of Issue #1 for this campaign!\nAnd you'll also be able to add-on additional items to your pledge during this campaign!

So, essentially, you're now getting about 16 different comic issues and a print for this one pledge. \nTHE PEACEKEEPERS is a new comic book series from writer Rylend Grant, artist Davi Leon Dias, colorist Iwan Joko Triyono, and letterer HdE... the same twisted team that brought you 10 rip-roaring issues of Action Lab: Danger Zone's critically-lauded political action thriller ABERRANT.  Aberrant won a Mike Wieringo Comic Book Industry Award (for BEST VILLAIN) in 2019 and was nominated for two others (BEST WRITER & BEST SINGLE ISSUE).\nThis campaign will fund a gorgeous 64 pg perfect-bound comic book collecting Issues 1 & 2 of THE PEACEKEEPERS and hopefully we'll hit a few stretch goals along the way so we can give you more bang for your Kickstarter buck.\nAll hell breaks loose in a quaint northern Michigan community when a team of in-over-their-heads bank robbers kills a beloved Sheriff\u2019s Deputy. In a small town with BIG secrets, local detective Richard Holton races to peel back the layers of a depraved down home conspiracy before the bungling Federal Agents assigned to the case send everyone involved to ground. \nFROM RYLEND: I\u2019m a screenwriter by trade. For over a decade, I\u2019ve made my living writing smart, mind-bending thrillers for directors like JJ Abrams, Ridley Scott, Justin Lin, John Woo, Luc Besson, and F. Gary Gray, so I can\u2019t help but think of things in cinematic terms. The Peacekeepers is a dark, quirky crime drama in the vein of Fargo or No Country for Old Men. It\u2019s a love letter to case-a-season police dramas like True Detective and The Wire, to Elmore Leonard novels, and to comic masterpieces like Criminal and 100 Bullets.\nNow tell us that doesn't sound cool!\nNot ready to dive in just yet? Well, then check out this pu pu platter of wicked and wild previews!\nMEET THE ROBBERS... \nMEET THE COPS... \nMEET THE WRESTLERS...\nMEET THE GIRL NEXT DOOR...\nI know what you're all thinking now. \"That was TONS OF FUN, but what do we get if we pledge?\" Well, I'm glad you asked. First, there's--\nWe're looking to print THE PEACEKEEPERS on a heavy 80 lb paper stock with a 100 lb glossy cover. This thing is perfect bound. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the difference. This is very much a Cadillac. A heavier stock and perfect binding also makes the comic less likely to be damaged in transit.\nHere is the \"regular\" cover by Davi Leon Dias and Iwan Joko Triyono: \nWe're also offering three UBER-limited variant covers you'll only be able to procure here on Kickstarter. Feast your eyes on these:\nTHE HEAT HOMAGE VARIANT - Dias & Triyono\nFor those who sometimes just have to get it on. For those who will rock 'n roll at the drop of a hat. For those who are prepared to walk out on anything in 30 seconds flat if they feel the heat around the corner.\n\nTHE FARGO HOMAGE VARIANT - Dias & Triyono\nOh Geez... this is a good one, don'tcha know... a no-rough-stuff-type deal.\n\nTHE POINT BREAK VARIANT - Dias & Triyono\nHere's one for the reader who only lives to get radical. Admit it... you want this one so bad, it's like acid in your mouth. Vaya con Dios, compadre!\nGREAT covers, right? Having trouble choosing just one? Well, why not GRAB THEM ALL?!\nNOTE: Special \"Early Bird\" tiers are available for ONLY the first 48 HOURS of the campaign.

BEST SINGLE ISSUE and BEST WRITER (alongside Jeff Lemire, Scott Snyder, Brian K. Vaughn, and Brian Michael Bendis).\nAnd here's what the critics had to say:\n\u201cGo home, other comics people. Rylend Grant and Zsombor Huszka just killed the game\u2026\u201d (Charles Pulliam-Moore \u2013 i09)\n\u201cABERRANT offers an intense, near-cinematic reading experience that incites excitement and inspires interest for issues to come.\u201d (The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cAberrant flat-out works. You have visceral action scenes. Personalities practically ooze out of the page. Honestly, this is the kind of storytelling that the big publishers are missing.\u201d (Big Comic Page)\n\u201c\u2026a bleak, dangerous and serious story with a lot at stake\u2026. If you like revenge tales, military thrillers, and superheroes, \u2018Aberrant\u2019 has it all.\u201d (Spartantown)\n\u201cABERRANT #1 is a game-changer at Action Lab: Danger Zone. You\u2019ll become captivated almost immediately\u2026 The creative team put together one of the most seamless, cohesive, and dynamic collaborations I\u2019ve seen this year on the indie scene.\u201d (PopCultHQ)\n And ABERRANT was quickly optioned for television by 24 & FELICITY Executive Producer Tony Krantz! \nRylend's last book - the dark and decidedly wicked superhero noir, BANJAX - was just nominated for FOUR 2020 Ringo Awards including BEST SERIES.\nIt made over a dozen ten-best lists and the critics raved:\n\u201cThis is the most amazingly well done first issue of a series I have ever seen. Point blank. Period\u2026 You cannot read this and come out if the same way you went into it\u2026 So effin\u2019 good.\u201d (Steven Leitman, Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\u201cBanjax has all the action, violence, grit, and heart of a classic.\u201d (David Pepose, Creator of Spencer & Locke)\n\u201cQuality, engrossing material embedded with a cinematic feel. Gifted storytelling and breathtaking artwork. Banjax will instantly have you screaming for more!\u201d (Jason Bennett, PopCultHQ)\n\u201cBanjax hits incredibly hard. Intense, thought-provoking, wildly entertaining. It\u2019s near perfect. For those looking for something unique, Issue #1 is a must-read.\u201d (Charlie Chipman, The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cRiveting. Refreshing. Heart-breaking. Ultra-violent. Honestly, a bit unsettling. The artwork of F\u00e1bio Alves is everything a dark and gritty comic should embody. Edson Ferreira\u2019s color work adds an extra punch to really emotional panels. Don\u2019t miss out on this bloody good time! A+\u201d (Andrew Huard, You Don\u2019t Read Comics)\n\u201cHoly crap this is good. This book hits all the right notes. It\u2019s marvelously done, such a compelling story. It\u2019s the best comic I\u2019ve read in a long time. Honestly? Bendis could take some notes here.\u201d (ComicCast Podcast)\n\nAnd our last Kickstarter effort, THE JUMP, took the site by storm...\n\u201cOut of this world. Grant delivers another cinematic thrill-ride. THE JUMP is a beautiful medley of fascination and wonder, filled with engaging characters, sprinkled with humor and heart, a healthy dose of intrigue, all wrapped up with a compelling premise.\u201d (Jason Bennet - PopCultHQ)\n\u201cTHE JUMP is a massive good time. The pacing is phenomenal. The line work is superb. The color work is brilliant. The is fresh, new, and unique. This is why we love comics.\u201d (Steve Leitman - Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\nMUCH MORE LOVE TO COME ON THE PEACEKEEPERS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE PEACEKEEPERS is brought to you by a team of steadily working professionals that has collaborated previously and delivered an exceptional, critically-acclaimed, Ringo Award-winning book.

Murder books typically include crime scene photographs and sketches, autopsy and forensic reports, transcripts of investigator\u2019s notes and witness interviews. They chronicle the life of a case, from the time the murder is reported until an arrest is made.\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is an original graphic novel about crime and consequence. It\u2019s written by me, Ed Brisson (Old Man Logan, Uncanny X-Men), and lusciously illustrated by Lisandro Estherren (Redneck, Strange Skies of East Berlin). This stand-alone graphic novel will be published in an exclusive hardcover edition for Kickstarter backers.\nCover by Lisandro Estherren\nAfter nearly half a decade away from writing crime comics -- a genre I love more than any other -- I\u2019m making a return with the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition of CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY. This book is near and dear to my heart, and probably the most pure distillation of the kind of book that I want to write.\n\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is about a thief who concocts a plan to sell a stolen car not once, but several times, by luring unsuspecting buyers to a remote location and robbing them at gunpoint. His plan hits a snag when he encounters a student, who needs a fresh set of wheels to travel to his new life out West. When things go south, they go south hard, and now our car thief stands on a precipice where he has to make a choice that will affect not only his life, but that of his co-conspirator and their two victims. The story is an examination of one man\u2019s guilt and how far he\u2019s willing to go to stay out of jail. \nArt by Lisandro Estherren\nWhen I started writing the script -- the longest MURDER BOOK story to date -- I knew that there was only one artist who could do it justice: Lisandro Estherren. He and I had previously worked together on THE LAST CONTRACT for BOOM! Studios and have been looking for an excuse to team up once again. Thankfully, he was into the story and happy to come aboard to breathe life into this story about a deception and redemption.\nArt by Lisandro Estherren\n\nTHE TEAM\nEd Brisson has been creating comics in one form or another since 1994. He\u2019s best known for his work at Marvel on books such as UNCANNY X-MEN, IRON FIST, GHOST RIDER, OLD MAN LOGAN and X-FORCE. He also has a long history of writing creator-owned books such as COMEBACK (Image), SHELTERED (Image), THE LAST CONTRACT (BOOM!) and THE VIOLENT (Image).\n\nEd first started to gain recognition from his self-published series MURDER BOOK, which was collected and released by Dark Horse in 2015.\nLisandro Estherren is a comic artist based in Argentina. His work includes graphic novels, series, and illustration for publishers and magazines such as Editorial Pictus (Argentina), Aurea Editoriale (Italy) Di\u00e1bolo (Spain) and Mojito (Uruguay). In the US, he has produced series for Red5 Comics (Spook) and BOOM! Studios (The Last Contract). He is currently working on REDNECK for Skybound Comics.\nHassan Otsmane-Elhaou makes Strip Panel Naked, a YouTube series focusing on breaking down comic art. He also does this a lot on his twitter (@HassanOE). He might make films that you'd like.\nLinney Incorporated is run by editor/writer/producer Nate Cosby, who's worked on Cow Boy, Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more books.\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nI\u2019ve been a fan of the Kickstarter publishing method for years now and have always wanted to bring a project here, where we can cut out the middleman and create a book for readers, backed by readers.\n\nKickstarter allows Lisandro and I to maintain complete control over the story and production of the book, creating a work that is as purely a product of our love for the genre and medium.\n\nThe money raised through this campaign will be used to pay the creative team and for printing of the hardcover book.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN GET\nWe are delighted to print this stand alone story in a Kickstarter exclusive deluxe hardcover, as well as a digital edition of the book. CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is a 72 page book, printed at standard comic size (6.625 x 10.25 inches).\n\nAside from the book itself, we have plenty of fun rewards including commissions from Declan Shalvey and Micheal Walsh; script reviews from Matthew Rosenberg and Kelly Thompson; original artwork; and even a chance to appear in the book yourself!\n\nA NOTE ON SHIPPING\nBecause of how quickly shipping rates can change and the unexpected nature of the world, shipping costs will be added on later, when we ship the book out to you in 2021. You will get a survey from BackerKit where you will be asked for your address, and shipping costs will be calculated at that point. We will do the best we can to make shipping as affordable as possible. Our current shipping estimates are as follows (but these may change if shipping rates increase): $4 US  / $10 Canada / $25 EU, GB and elsewhere. \nCanadian orders will ship from Canada, all other orders will ship from the US.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you to our families and readers for getting us this far!\nKickstarter Campaign Manager: \nLaser Malena-Webber lasercampaigns.com\nMusic credit for video:\nDoomsday Clock by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5402-doomsday-clock-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny project has its risks in creation, manufacturing delays, and the unexpectedness of the world.

The purpose of this campaign is to finance the completion and printing of  the Menagerie: Declassified Anthology.  The core of this science fiction anthology contains ten original stories by some of the BEST voices in comics.  From Marvel and DC to IDW, Zenescope, and yes, Kickstarter, these writer and artist teams have never worked together before, but have been paired up to bring unique corners of the Menagerie Universe to life.  Brandon Easton (Transformers: War for Cybertron - Siege, Agent Carter, Judge Dredd: False Witness, Thundercats), Geoffrey Thorne (The Avengers: Black Panther's Quest, Black Panther [MARVEL], The Librarians, Leverage), Bryan Edward Hill (Batman & The Outsiders, Killmonger, Zone 414, Postal, The new unnamed Power Rangers movie) and MORE contributed to this book.\nSo, yes, this anthology is the main event and you don't have to read the series to follow along or understand the meanings of these powerful, subversive and often cautionary tales.  \nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology - Main Cover (REWARD TIER 3)\nThe very first issue of Menagerie was funded on Kickstarter just a few short years ago and since then, you have helped us bring to life over 100+ pages of that story, set in a world of endless wars and the struggle to establish freedom. The Menagerie Universe has been a lot of fun to build.\nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology Cover D --> (REWARD TIER #3D)\nIF YOU'RE ONLY HERE FOR MENAGERIE #5 \nWell, first we think you're missing out on the best series of prequel stories we could have put together by top talent that is writing for Marvel, DC, and the major movie studios.  BUT we totally understand if you want to finish the first \"season\" of the series before you get to that or you're on a budget.   So, we definitely want to accommodate return readers by including these new Reward Tiers (since launch) under the [REPEAT BACKER] designation.  So you can get either a Digital or Physical copy of Menagerie #5 with either of those two Reward Tiers.\n\nHERE'S THE COVER ART FOR MENAGERIE #5:  \nMenagerie V: Main Cover by David Monge Bautista (Now Available by selecting \"Here for the Add-Ons\" Tier and then choosing Menagerie #5 as an Add-On (for $8 + Shipping) when prompted at check out.\n\n We've had so much positive feedback, and with our epic conclusion to the first arc here, we wanted to address a question that constantly comes up:\n\"When will you be bringing in outside talent to write for Myth Division?\" \nWell, the answer is: NOW!\n\nFor the first time, Ram\u00f3n, the writer, creator and editor of the Menagerie series has put together this Anthology, a series of eight page sci-fi stories set in the Menagerie Universe. He asked some friends who work in the comic book, film and television industries if they'd contribute a story. \nThey agreed and each of their stories features one of the main characters we've already met in the first four issues of Menagerie.\nSo who are these characters again?\nThe Mutineers are all ready to start over.... but who were they before they deserted the war? Find out in this Anthology.\nSince the fifth issue is the final issue of this introductory arc, we decided to ADD it along with this campaign!  So whether you've got all four issues and have been waiting for the fifth or if you've never read an issue and want the whole set, you can catch up with ease.  All of this is in addition to the 100+ Page Anthology.\nThe only catch is we currently aren't offering is the DIGITAL COPY OF MENAGERIE ISSUE #5!!  *GASP!* \nWe know!! It's a heartbreaker for a few loyal backers, but we assure you, this isn't meant to slight anyone especially our supportive readers!!  It's more of a necessary effort to combat future piracy, so we're actively looking for a better way to deliver these rewards & protect the future sales of these stories.  (After all, we want your Kickstarter Exclusives to be WORTH SOMETHING down the road). \nThe good news is that the digital conclusion to the five issue arc WILL be found in the printed collection of MENAGERIE: Volume 1 (REWARD TIER #2) and we hope you'll pick up a copy of that, which will include some sketches, notes and other cool behind the scenes content in the back of the book!!.\nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology Cover A --> (REWARD TIER #3A)\nNow, that's just the first nine stories.  There are up to fourteen stories in total to UNLOCK, each taking place BEFORE the events of our first Menagerie Series Arc (#1-5), which is available as a Trade Paperback (REWARD TIER #2) or if you're lucky you can still snag one of the rare add-ons compiling the 5 individual issues.  These stories are a prelude or mini-prequels to the ongoing series, really.  It's a great way to finish up the first arc.\n\n9 STORIES COLLECTED INTO ONE: \nTHE ANTHOLOGY\nWe've invited many of our recurring collaborators to participate along with a few new creators that we've wanted to collaborate with for some time.\nThese stories are the \"Declassified\" tales of First Contact with non-human, intelligent life throughout the explored Galaxy, featuring the people we meet in Menagerie #1-5. \nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology Cover C --> (REWARD TIER #3C)\nA lone wolf searches for a pack in the frozen wasteland of an outlier planet.\nTHE GLUTTON by Omar Morales & Erwin Arroza\nThe Glutton Interiors.\nA man wrestles with his decision to disobey his father's wishes when he is asked to do the unthinkable.\nLOST ONE'S by Robert Jeffrey II, Bruno Lima, & Fahriza Kamaputra\nLost One's Interiors.\nSometimes we're reminded that what we want isn't remotely close to what we might need. Brandon Easton's other Comic titles and Television Series include: Transformers: War for Cybertron - Siege, Judge Dredd: False Witness, Marvel Action Spider-man, Thundercats, Agent Carter, Miracle Man (DC Future State), Incidentals, and more...\nEclipse Interior Art by Ricardo Arreola, Juan Castro & Sean Lee.\nEclipse Interior Art.\nIn the face of certain death, it's not often we learn more about the Universe than ourselves.\nINFINITY TREE by Madeleine Holly-Rosing & Edgy Ziane\nINFINITY TREE Interiors.\nViolence isn't usually the answer, but sometimes it can even spell total destruction for all involved.\nBREATH OF A PREDATOR by Carrie Tupper, Abel Cicero & Edgy Ziane\n\n\n\nInvasion isn't always a cut and dry formula. Sometimes, the enemy is not what you think.

We were blessed to have raised approximately USD $11,000. Thank you again to all of you who supported THE RESURRECTED, even it that meant simply sharing our campaign with your friends. \nBut now, it's time for MURKY WATERS!\nCover by Tula Lotay\nMURKY WATERS is a full-colour 56 page anthology. The creative team hails from across the globe, making this a truly international project. All stories are complete and the electronic file is just about ready to send to the printers. The next step is to print and distribute the anthology; which is where you guys come in. With your support, we can take pre-orders and print the book soon after.\nOur goal of \u20ac3,000 will cover the printing, and a chunk of the packing and shipping. Also included in this amount are the fees that Kickstarter and Amazon take for using their services, and of course, domestic taxes...\nTHE RESURRECTED's writing/editing/lettering team and cover artist are back!\nWriter/Creator: Christian Carnouche is an Australian working at an international organisation in France. He wrote all eight stories in the anthology and is also the writer/creator of The Resurrected mini-series.

Digital tier backers will receive a digital version of the print. I'm not sure what drawing Lucy has up her sleeve yet, but I'm 100% certain it will be something special :)\nLucy is from the UK and is the writer/artist of the smash-hit graphic novel 'Barking.' Not only is Barking an incredible piece of work, but it's themes and atmosphere tie in closely with those of Murky Waters. I absolutely recommend you read it. Lucy is also the artist on the upcoming comic IND-XED (with Fraser Campbell - a sincerely brilliant writer - check out his comics here - https://alexautomaticblog.wordpress.com/) and is currently drawing a short story for the hit anthology series Razorblades.\nCheck out some of Lucy' work here - https://lucysullivanuk.com/\nAnd some samples of her work: \nSECOND STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED!\nWe've hit 5000 euros, so all physical backers will receive a Carnouche Productions fridge magnet! \nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL ANNOUNCED!\nWe're now aiming for our third stretch goal of \u20ac6000, which is that all physical backers will receive a mini-print of Tula Lotay's stunning Murky Waters cover. Digital backers will receive a digital version. I've had several people mention they'd like Tula's cover as a poster and I really can't disagree.\nIMPORTANT NOTE ON ORDERING ADDITIONAL REWARDS\nOnce the Kickstarter is finished, all backers will be sent email surveys to confirm what they ordered. YOU MUST FILL OUT THE SURVEY TO RECEIVE YOUR REWARDS.\nWe will also be using 'backerkit,' which will allow you to add rewards to your initial order, even after the Kickstarter campaign has finished. If you do choose to add to your order, postage costs may increase based on the parcel weight.\nYet again, we will be using high-quality offset printing to produce our books.

The series follows a group of children cast aside by their families and society\u2026until they were possibly the only ones capable of saving it.\nStandard Kickstarter Edition Cover by Emma Kubert\nVariant Cover by Emma Kubert\nSpecial Limited Bleeding Cool Variant Cover by Emma Kubert\nYears in the future, a virus has been weaponized by a Russian government hell-bent on destroying America from within. This deadly new strain has been perfected to kill within 24 hours of contact, and only small groups of children carry an immunity to the effects. They are the Foundlings; a diverse group of children under the age of 16, who alone carry the hope for a possible cure, and a solution to extinction.\nFoundlings centers around one very special group of kids, all who still dream of the families that long ago abandoned them, and instead find family in each other in order to survive and find a way to save the Earth from destruction. The story is inspired by The Foundlings Hospital in New York City, which is a real-life home to children, many of whom are challenged with physical and emotional issues. The story is rich with themes of empowerment and inspiration for teenagers and adults alike, in a fun adventure story that recalls some of the most beloved films and television series.\nJohn Stanisci is a New York Times best selling artist and writer for DC, Marvel and IDW Comics having drawn such characters as Spider-Man, Batman, Constantine, Justice League Dark, Judge Dredd,  X Files and many more. In 2011, John's book for DC Comics, Batman Beyond: Hush Beyond, premiered at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list for graphic novels. John\u2019s original graphic novel, Lifedeath, received a major announcement in The Hollywood Reporter and is under development for film/tv. John\u2019s published work has appeared throughout the world in many countries including Germany, England, France and others. John is also a Broadway/Off Broadway playwright, actor and producer. John\u2019s original plays have been named as finalists for the prestigious Woodward/Newman Award for drama as well as the Eugene O\u2019Neil Playwrights Conference and others. www.johnstanisci.com\nEmma Kubert is a freelance comic book artist, writer and graduate of the Kubert School (2018). She has freelanced for various companies such as DC Entertainment, Dynamite Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Image Comics. Emma recently penciled, inked and colored for DC Entertainments\u2019 DC SUPERHERO GIRLS and TEEN TITANS GO!, and drew layouts for the company\u2019s young adult graphic novel RAVEN. She is currently working on her Image Comics\u2019 creator-owned series INKBLOT with Rusty Gladd and developing sci-fi fantasy FOUNDLINGS with John Stanisci.\nAdditional Credits:\nLettering: Rusty Gladd\nDesign: Jason Ullmeyer\nVideo: Olivia Oguma\nWe decided to go direct to Kickstarter comics supporters because we have seen such a strong statement from this platform\u2019s users in favor of diverse content from both well-known and up and coming creators. We see the opportunity to make the case for Foundlings to see publication as a full graphic novel, and eventual graphic novel series with the community we can create here. We also needed to help pay for the continued development and creation of this story in lieu of other paid work for hire comics work. We have plans for not only the Foundlings graphic novel, but possibly developing this story to other media and you will help us shape those decisions, and have an exclusive window into the process and the journey of Foundlings.\nThe story of Foundlings is inspired by the idea that heroes aren\u2019t always the people we might expect, and must rise above their own struggles to meet the challenge presented to them. In that same spirit, you can be the co-founders of tomorrow\u2019s pop culture. By backing Foundlings, you not only support the creation of this independent comic book, you help us send a message to the industry that you want more stories that explore heroes of all kinds and their journeys of trial and triumph.

We\u2019re incredibly thankful to our Kickstarter community and we're going to do our best to pack each campaign with as many cool exclusives as we can for you.

(We have some exciting ones lined up that we\u2019re dying to tell you about.) If you were with us for issues 1 and 2, the story continues here. If you're new to THE CATCH, both issues are available in this campaign, and here's a quick overview ...\nWhen super-villains like Galactoid, Dron the Conqueror, or Professor Kill are defeated, they're sent to a government maximum security facility. But what about small-timers like Phileas Frost, The Grappler, or the random jump-suited agents of H.A.R.M.? What happens to the bank robbers, jewel thieves, and anonymous henchmen?\nThey post bail.\nAnd sometimes, they skip town afterward. That's where Lucy Chase comes in.\nLucy comes from a family of law enforcement folks, but spends her days working for bail bondsman Leon Tilman, chasing down costumed criminals who jump bail. Keeping super-powered lowlifes in line is a dangerous job; especially when you don't have super-powers yourself. Bounty hunters who specialize in supers are few and far between, keeping Lucy in high demand.\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Jack Devlin is Lucy\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest. Jack\u2019s assigned to the Federal Powered and Supernatural Crimes Joint Task Force, but he sometimes provides unofficial backup when Lucy has a bounty.\nSo far, Lucy and Jack have crossed paths with some colorful folks who are very interested in their activities.\n And now everyone\u2014criminals, the authorities, and Lucy & Jack\u2014are all on a collision course.\nMoney raised will go toward artist and colorist fees, printing, backer rewards, and shipping. If we're lucky enough to exceed our goal, all additional funding will be put directly back into the book in the form of additional rewards and production of the next issue.\nIn English...\nAnd in Espa\u00f1ol (digital)\u2026\nMain cover by Ismael Canales and Mireia Girbau.\nVariant Cover by Steve Bryant and Jason Millet.\n\"Movie Poster\" Variant Cover by Ismael Canales and Jason Millet.\nWe have a wide variety of rewards lined up, from digital comics, to physical comics and variant covers, to \"Catch-Up\" combos that  bring new readers up to speed, to Collector Boxes, to original art, and more!\nIf you support a Kickstarter campaign, the last thing you want is for your books to arrive damaged!

You\u2019ve probably seen his work go by in a pixelated blur on your DVR.\n\"THE CATCH is the kind of gleeful, clever deconstruction of a genre that can only be pulled off by creators who secretly love it. The freshest take on super-heroes and super-villains in the \"real world\" since POWERS. I'm mad I didn't think of it myself!\" \u2013 Phil Hester, cartoonist\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a superhero crime caper that blends the best of both genres to create something wholly new, engaging and memorable. Bryant, Canales, Surroca, and Murrin expertly weave a story that evokes greats like Elmore Leonard, Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker without feeling like a carbon copy. As someone who enjoys all things noir and super-powered, THE CATCH is a perfect match.\u201d - Alex Segura, acclaimed author of BLACKOUT\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a great looking book with a fun premise. The team of Bryant, Canales, Surroca, and Murrin have a winner on their hands.\u201d \u2013 Jamal Igle, co-creator of THE WRONG EARTH from Ahoy Comics.\n\u201cA little bit sci-fi, a little bit superhero, and a little bit good-natured procedural on top of it all, THE CATCH is such an obvious idea, I'm mad I didn't come up with it myself! Engaging, fun, and with a ton of potential -- you're gonna like spending time with Lucy Chase.\u201d \u2013 Erik Burnham, IDW\u2019s GHOSTBUSTERS\n\"Lucy Chase is a new era Karen Sisco in this action-packed and thrilling take on bounty hunting super-villains. Full of finesse and suspense, you won't be disappointed reading THE CATCH!\" \u2013 Shawn Pryor, CASH + CARRIE\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a fun, sexy caper in the style of 70s classics like THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. Sleek and slick.\u201d \u2013 Wendi Freeman, DOUBLE PAGE SPREAD", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter campaign comes with risks and unforeseen issues.

I mean \"Hack Slash\"\nAt the end of every horror movie, one girl always survives... in this case, Cassie Hack not only survives, she turns the tables by hunting and destroying the horrible slashers that would do harm to the innocent! Alongside the gentle giant known as Vlad, the two cut a bloody path through those who deserve to be put down... hard!\nCreated in 2004, Hack/Slash has now corrupted the minds of thousands upon thousands of readers, horror fans, aspiring comic book creators, cosplayers, and people just looking for a good time, but it has NEVER been presented in a prestige format like the BIG HACK ENERGY edition. \nAs for Comic Shops - YES this will be getting a release from Image Comics. \n \u201cWhy Kickstarter?\" \nAre people still asking \"Why Kickstarter?\" Just in case, here\u2019s the basic rundown. Sure, this comic has built up this huge cult following over the years, but it still takes a lot to put it together, it all has to come out of the creator\u2019s pocket up front, and even with all of the love we get from fans, it\u2019s still an indie comic. So when it comes to doing something really big like this hardcover edition (like, literally, it\u2019s a really big book), it only made sense to come to Kickstarter to help make it happen. The other reason is why wouldn\u2019t we? This has become such an amazing community for cultivating independent comics, and a place to find our most hardcore fans with something beyond social media. Plus, we get to offer some really fun extra perks that wouldn\u2019t be possible to do otherwise.\nWill This Book Be Available Through Stores?\nYou bet! Like all of the other Hack/Slash comics, this will be available from the one and only Image Comics some time early next year. BUT... it will not include a lot of the cool unique swag you can get here, nor the signed book plates from Tim Seeley himself. We also may be adding some fancy glossy accents to the cover depending on what we decide to do with stretch goals. \nBy supporting this kickstarter you help us get this book done so that the stores CAN have it. You're actively playing a part in making it a reality, whereas without you, it likely just wouldn't happen. You may receive it before the stores, or slightly after, because it takes time to sign everything and pack and ship. That's not the point of the campaign. If it's SUPER important to you to get it ASAP, though, we understand, in which case please place pre-orders at your local comic shop or book store.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile everything in this campaign is set to move forward very quickly after the campaign ends, we understand that circumstances out of our control may happen. It is always possible that printing and manufacturing delays can happen, product can get lost in the shipping process, global pandemics, currency collapse, alien invasions, robot rebellion, or human error may cause something to not be sent. That's why we've worked so hard to create an iron-clad system to cater to Kickstarter backers. We use the latest state of the art software along with an awesome warehouse team to track everything.

He has created a wide range of short subjects, such as the Spike Jonze-endorsed parody, Being Ozzy Osbourne (with Christy Stratton Mann), the L.A. Indie Film Festival Winner Come and Knock: The Other Ray Charles and many more.\nSchrader\u2019s first comic book work, Baby Badass, published by Action Lab Danger Zone in 2018, quickly became a cult hit, with Volume 2 set to be released in 2021. He is also the co-writer of Rafael Garcia: Henchman, which recently funded on Kickstarter.\nFollow him on Instagram and Twitter @schraderopolis and @thebabybadass\n\nCLAY ADAMS has acted in two feature-length horror movies, BLOODLINE and THE SHADOW WALKERS, both released by LionsGate.

He also has funded and fulfilled eight projects on Kickstarter with FRIED Comics. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times.

A gas station attendant with 3rd degree burns all over his body. I thought about what could have caused this to happen to him, what life did he lead before, what life could he lead after? \nOriginal Character design by Rossano Piccioni\nThis is the story of Willy Boyd, a one time high stakes gambler who now lives life as a mild mannered gas station attendant... \n\nPage 1\nPage 2\n\nOne night while going back and forth to the pump to serve customers a car pulls in to his station driven by one of the men who lit Willy's body on fire years before.\nPage 3\n In the back seat of the car is a woman, gagged and bound. As the car rides off into the night, Willy must decide if he\u2019s ready to be some sort of hero...or at least get his revenge. \nPage 4\n BURN RESIDUE is what is left in this world. Everything that happens is an aftershock from the moment the flame ignited Willy\u2019s body and left him scarred forever. It is about how in every one of us there is a beast of rage that only needs permission to take over. Burn Residue is about the dark and brutal world that lies inside the human heart. The world is bleak and the characters are chewed up by life. This is the dark side of noir, the side that never makes it to the sunlight. \nBURN RESIDUE will be presented as three 32 page issues and is the culmination of what comics mean to me, the importance of the page, the page turn, and giving the reader a substantial reading experience.\n\nYou can back BURN RESIDUE in a few ways. \nThere is the single issue format that you will come right to your door monthly (first issue shipping shortly after this kickstarter ends) the other is an exclusive Graphic Novel version of the story with bonus content topping off around 100 pages.\nThe Collected Edition of BURN RESIDUE will feature a cover by Eisner Winning artist Jacob Phillips (THAT TEXAS BLOOD, PULP, MY HEREOS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN JUNKIES)\n\nOGN cover by Jacob Phillips\n\nWe will also be raffling a one of a kind piece of original art from STRAY BULLETS creator David Lapham who called the first issue of BURN RESIDUE \"Twisted...\"\n\nA glorious piece of art of Willy Boyd by David Lapham\n\nOne of the most important things to me when creating any project is having it finished and ready to go. Issue 1 is completely done and ready to send out to the printers. By the time this campaign ends Issues 2 and 3 will be pencilled, inked, and colored.\n\nThe only risk you have backing this project is if your stomach can handle what you find in it's pages. If you are horrified of it, you should be... \n\nBURN RESIDUE is ready to melt into your hands.\nNow with an ISSUE #1 review by  Monkeys Fighting Robots \n\nTHE TEAM\nJonathan Thompson - Writer of the sci-fi anthology TALES FROM THE DEAD ASTRONAUT and the serialized sci-fi short story MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TIME BOX. My first major comic influence growing up in the 2000s was 100 BULLETS by Brian Azzerallo and Eduardo Risso, which then esclated with STRAY BULLETS and CRIMINAL...so that should tell you a lot right there. I've always been drawn to noir crime fiction so it was only natural that I came to this place. \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/cmdrofzed\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/spacestationzed/\n\nRossano Piccioni - Artist for Edizioni Inkiostro, famous in Italy for his book THE CANNIBAL FAMILY...Rossano's art immediately jumped out to me when I first saw it and I knew that I had to get him with the right project. What has developed between us is a great working relationship. His pages energize me and push me in directions with the story that I wasn't prepared to at the start. His work is dynamic and perfectly suited for the world we are building.

Coping with loss, responsibility, command, addiction, withdrawal and more. It also features social commentary, PTSD, corporate interests and much more, in a Dark Fantasy setting \u2013 all of that, in a striking visual package.\nIt is Asterix \u2013 Mister Robot \u2013 Samurai Champloo - The Witcher books, Promethea and the game GRIS, rolled into One.\nIts as if the harsh reality of real life problems were informed by a world with Dragons and Spell-casting. Sometimes this can be the solution to all our problems and sometimes it can be the sole cause for them. In this particular case, we're stuck in the middle, with Astrid, our protagonist, not knowing where to turn.\nFinished Page 01 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper - Notice the layout attempts and process ideas, on the border ;)\nFinished Page 02 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper - sequence progression and process ideas, at the top ;)\nFinished Page 03 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper\nFinished Page 04 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper - More sequence process progress at the top ;)\nYet another page finished - all in glorious 11x17\" Traditional Acrylics\nRdw is also a story about a journey. A journey of acceptance, and how the world reflects our inner behavior. And while the journey will take us to dark places and subjects, it will also feature a world ripe with stories and folklore not often seen, like Mozambican, Brazilian, First Nations of the Americas, and much more. It is my opportunity to shine a light one these, as much as I do the protagonists story. \nThe book follows Astrid, a free-company commander, a Leader currently without an army, her struggle with addiction to the enhancing drug that makes her Free-Company unique and the burden of leadership.  \nThe drug acts as some sort of juiced-up methamphetamine - the story will be delving deep into the effects the drug has on the body, the mind and the social circles, of those affect by it.\nAlong the way she\u2019ll interact with different characters, settings, ideas and views and it is THAT interaction \u2013 how the world and her companions react to Astrid \u2013 what this story will be focusing on.\nAs the story goes  and  develops, on further books, we will navigate issues of mental health, discrimination, corruption, neo-colonialism, to name a few. \nThe World, this setting, is as much a protagonist as Astrid. Riddled with Living Forests, Mythical creatures (from African, South-American, European Lore), Magic-lead Corporations and warring Nations, we get a glimpse of all that and more, through the eyes of a troubled addict.\nThe initial idea behind \"Tales of Lost Fantasy\" is to create a world a living, breathing world in which Fantasy and folklore walk together with \u201creal life stories\u201d and through which we use metaphor, humor, different cultures folklore and pop-culture to tell stories about past, current and future society, about escapism, about friendship true and false, about love, true and false and focusing that nothing is ever so black-and-white as it seems. No love is truly immaculate and no evil is without reason or sometimes evil, at all.\nThis initial volume is but the beginning of our adventure.\nWhile Volume One of RDW serves as a good entry point to the story  being told - it is a part of a bigger story, one i hope to continue, once this first volume is released. Our main character is a product of many realities, that of an Army officer, A leader, A friend, a child of an interracial couple, and an addict, in recovery. All these elements, and more, are discussed as the story goes, even if for this first volume we are introduced to her immediate quest: what happened to her troops, specifically what happened to Menhir - a rock Troll/Berserker - and just what Is happening to her.\n Kickstarter, as well as funding dreams and making ideas into realities, allows creators the opportunity to shed inhibitions about those ideas and put them to practice. In this particular case, shape a story in any way we chose to and grow our audience in a catered fashion, in complete and direct communication between creator and audience. I am beholden to you and no other interests and that suits me just fine.\nThis campaign will fund the execution of the project, editorial staff, Lettering, all the production, printing and shipping. This will allow me to fully dedicate myself to it and make it the best and most visually stunning it can be, without gig for bills distractions.\nSo far, this Volume One has its 40 pages of story fully written, with all of them pencilled and partially painted (4 pages finished). Further volumes are already in production, Vol2 fully written and pencilled (with 5 pages already painted)and Vol3 halfway through - 130 pencilled and written pages - with Lots more, to come. But our focus here is Volume One. I am spreading the production of the book in the span of a full year, which allows me to fully commit to Each page and Each step of the production, and you will be tagging along with me, with each step, with constant updates EVERY WEEK.\n\n My name is Marco Rudy and i need a cup of Tea.\nRight, i am Marco. I am a Mozambican-turned-Canadian Comic Book Artist, Painter, Illustrator and off-beat Storyteller. I have been working in the comics industry, for the better part of 13 years now, with longer tenures at DC (Swamp Thing, Action comics, The Shield) and Marvel (Marvel Knights: Spiderman; Bucky Barnes: The Winter Soldier, Avengers, Uncanny X:Men), among others. I am mostly known for my use of traditional medium (watercolors and acrylics) and a very Non-traditional way of visual story-telling, in which the Layout, Design and Color palette of a page and sequence, tells the story in equal amount as that of the action in Each panel. I take my influences in my sleeve and i finally have the chance to tell a story which involves my reality as a Mixed-Race person, as Mozambican out of place, a creature of the world and a child of conflict, mixed in with the Art and folklore of those not often featured or seen, in these types of books.\n\nA page from the Short Story that preceeds RDW - in this sequence both the action In the panels is interacting with the layout and panel bordering, with the action heating up and the layout not only made of the blood, resulting from the panle to panle action, But the this very layout somewhat being a Result of this very same action. The layout And the action in the sequence, both interacting, inviting the reader to see thee story, in a more dynamic way.\nI've always been a storyteller. I grew up reading whatever book I could find and always re-imagining that very same story or creating similar stories, on paper, afterwards. I'd even go as far as retelling that very same story to my friends, or better yet, the one Friend, and family.\nI'd create atmosphere and embellish everything I could, trying to make the most mundane things become fantastical.  And when power outages would happen in Maputo, where im from, it was my time to shine, by the candlelight and share in my weird adventures with them. On of the particular effects is that I would invite my captive audience to participate in the story being told. Interactivity in storytelling.\nThroughout my years in this industry, i've developed a particular way of visual storytelling, in which a page, is much more than a sequence of panel, in which the action happens. The page layout, the color palette In the layout is conversing directly with the action In the panels and Inviting the reader to somehow participate in it. That interactivity in storytelling I mentioned.\n\n Taylor Esposito Words and VFX Merchant - Taylor Esposito is a comic book lettering professional and owner of Ghost Glyph Studios.

I have slowly accumulated 7 stories ranging from hellified to sci-fi that will shock and horrirfy. We have a diverse and talented team that hails from all over the globe that I am very proud of. We even have been fortunate enough to have had the Bram Stoker estate accept our \"Dracula: Lord of the Future\" story as actual Count Dracula cannon, thanks to our talented colorist/writer Chris McAuley!! \n\n\nThis is absolutely an adult book, with graphic violence, and adult themes/language. There is a comedic horror story and several that are much more grim, making it a perfect Halloween Anthology purchase! \nA lot of people have worked very hard to get this volume ready for publication and I think you're going to be pleased with the end result. If we get the funding we need for this Volume, then expect #2 to be ready by October 2021!!\n\nLuci & the Doombringers\nThe cover story was written, drawn & colored by Bayron Calderon, with script assistance & lettering done by Phoebe A. Xavier. It follows one of the Devil's daughters on her quest to break free from her cell in Hell and arise as a heavy metal guitar goddess on Earth. This one has both action & comedy with incredible art!\nInexorable\n\"Inexorable\" is a tale of a thief who has crossed the wrong people at the absolute worst time. It was written by Vesa Vltlkalnen and drawn/colored by Juho Sivonen. They both hail from Finland! The story is a twisted one like many in this collection are.\n\nOne Way Ticket\nBoth \"One Way Ticket\" and \"Patient Xero\" were done by the same creative teams: Phillip Butehorn as writer, Juan Manuel Almiron on Lineart, Chris McAuley as colorist and Phoebe A. Xavier on letters. The first is a tale of a demon and his host on a train destined for Hell. The other is a one page pandemic tale that hits very close to home in 2020.\nThe Damned\nWritten by Juan Bertazzi , drawn by Hernan Gonzalez & colored by Chris McAuley, \"The Damned\" is another quick story that packs a werewolf clawed punch. Hernan & Juan hail from Argentina, while Chris represents Ireland & Canada.\n\nESC POD\nWritten and lettered by Phoebe A, Xavier, drawn by Renan Balmonte and colored by Chris McAuley, \"ESC POD\" is a karma slap sci-fi horror short.\nDracula - Lord of The Future\nOur other sci fi horror short \"Dracula - Lord of the Future\" is the debut of a chapter in Dracula's epic that takes place far in the future, in a dystopian starscape. It is written and colored by Chris McAuley and drawn by the incredibly talented Collin Maxwell. This pair of Irishmen will continue the story in a one shot in the future! \n\n123GO!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point the book is 80% done , with mostly just some coloring and lettering to be done.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit.

This my first webcomic, and it's been both more fun and a bigger success than I've ever imagined.\n\nIf you're new to Urban Animal, and given that a lot of people know me from my work at Image Comics on things like Luther Strode, Spread, Dead Body Road and Reaver, it's about a normal kid who finds out he's not so normal when he turns into a sabertooth tiger. Things just get stranger for Joe from there. Much, much stranger.\n\nUrban Animal is fun, funny, action packed, and I think if you dig my other stuff you'll dig it too, since I think it's one of the best things I've ever done. You can check it out online at Webtoon but now we're bringing it to print.\n\nI wanted to thank everyone for reading the book and for checking out this Kickstarter. We're super proud and very grateful to be able to finally bring our little beast to print.\n- Justin\n\nMeet Joe Gomez. He\u2019s got high school on lock \u2013 good grades, a cool band, and girls digging his vibe. But just when he\u2019s got the world figured out, he goes and turns into a saber-toothed tiger. A shape-shifting nature spirit known as a Chimera, to be specific. Now Joe needs every single one of his new powers to help save the human race \u2013 whether he wants to or not.\nUrban Animal is an ongoing webcomic on LINE Webtoon with nearly half a million subscribers. This is your chance to be the first to get your hands on the reformatted print edition of volume 1, which collects chapters 1 through 27 of Urban Animal - approximately 200 pages of content!\nThe goal of the Kickstarter is to get the comic into your hands as quickly as possible! The more we raise, the more content goes in the book, the more stretch goals are unlocked, and the more add ons we can offer. We'll reveal the stretch goal that's available to hit next, and when it unlocks, we'll reveal the next one. Ditto with the add ons, and we think everyone will be pleasantly surprised with each!\n\n\nSo, what am I getting for my pledge? First, all backers at the $24 Urban Animal Volume 1 Graphic Novel level will get the collected edition, printed at 5.7\"x8.2\" with a matte finish wrap around cover. Each page of the comic will be carefully reformatted to provide the same quality of reading experience many of you have already had online. \n\n Scroll down for more pages! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Please note that shipping costs are not included in your pledge. We are working with CRWN on fulfillment services and you will pay actual shipping depending on your region and the size of your order during the BackerKit survey phase.\nPlease see our FAQ for more details around shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is little risk in that this book is being published and the art has been completed. The team running the Kickstarter have worked with the vendors and printers before and have confidence in the quality and timeline we've outlined. However, during production mistakes can happen and some of the vendors are overseas.

As a young deputy, Percy walked its halls, he saw the mysterious Fisher King within whose mystical wound makes the West a Wasteland...and he saw the Grail. It changed him forever.\nNow: it's 1886. A deadly winter that went down in history as \"The Big Die Up\" ravages the country. Percy is no longer a lawman, but a disgraced gunslinger who has hunted the castle for decades. He longs to return there, to see the Grail again, to heal the Fisher King where he once failed. And to restore the West from the wintry Wasteland it has become.\nBut Percy isn't the only one after it. An ex-Union, Colonel Kurtz-like war criminal known as The General leads an outlaw army in his holy war for the Grail. Percy nearly dies dueling him...but is saved by three new unlikely allies. Grant, a deputy sheriff who's as noble as he is naive. Fire Eyes, a Sioux bounty hunter hellbent on killing the General. And Rosa, a devil-may-care Mexican outlaw who double-crossed the General.\nPercy, Fire Eyes, Rosa and Grant embark on a quest across the Old West for the Grail. The General and his outlaw army hunt them every step of the way. The deputy, bounty hunter, and outlaw must overcome their differences and learn to work together with Percy who's played all three parts in his time. Or die in the vast frozen Wasteland of the West. \nHoly West is an adaptation of the quest for the Holy Grail. It's loosely based on Parzival, but draws from all of chivalric romance, from Grail stories which involved pursuing the highest spiritual ideal: compassion. It's also a love letter to Westerns, to those cowboys and gunslingers who are the American equivalent of Britain's Arthurian knights.\nHoly West explores the bloody history of the frontier and how we made it a Wasteland. The West is where the American soul was forged, for better or worse. At the same time, we drape a veil of magic over the West, just as medieval romance mythologized British history.\nHoly West is magic realism meets Spaghetti Western. Sergio Leone meets David Lynch. It's an action packed, psychedelic odyssey through the Old West; a visionary quest across the vast wilderness, all to heal the spiritual Wasteland of 1880's America. All for the Grail.\nThe Grail calls to you. Come find it with us. \nHOLY WEST #1 PREMIUM EDITION\nVariant cover by Simon Roy for Holy West #1 Premium Edition, colors/design by Daniel Irizarri\nHoly West #1 Premium Edition has a variant cover by Simon Roy, Image Comics writer and artist (Protector, Prophet). Simon's original art for this cover is available as a reward.\nThe premium edition comes with over 10 extra pages of bonus material. Including: a back up comic with art by Vlad Legostaev, a short prose story with a Dime Novel cover by Goran Gligovi\u0107, and even more narrative content that enriches the story of this issue while revealing new clues to the mysteries of Holy West and what we'll see in future issues.  \nDime Novel cover by Goran Gligovi\u0107, included in Holy West #1 Premium Edition, colors/design by Daniel Irizarri\nThis is Goran Gligovi\u0107's cover for a Dime Novel story that will be included in Holy West #1 Premium. It'll be written in the style of an authentic, 1880's Western themed dime novel, and uncover new secrets behind the occult phenomena that surround the Grail Castle and the wounded Fisher King who dwells there.\nIf some generous high roller backs the \"Good, Bad, and the Grail\" reward tier and our funding exceeds 6K, I will write a novella length, 25,000 word version of this short story that will come with this cover and go out as a print copy to every backer above the digital tier.\nHOLY WEST: T-SHIRT EDITION\nMOCK-UP version of the T-shirt, design by Daniel Irizarri\nMOCK-UP version of the T-shirt, design by Daniel Irizarri\nTHE SEEKERS\nWriter: That's me: Seth Jacob.

He illustrated Judge Dredd at IDW, a short story in IDW's Star Trek: Waypoint Special 2019, Cloudia and Rex at Lion Forge, and the back up story Greetings from Verde Luz which appeared in the Image Comics series Prophet.

He'd be more game for the case if he didn't suspect the man he's sweet on\u2014Johnny \u201cPlink\u201d Plinketts\u2014has been keeping secrets from him and might be mixed up in all this somehow. \nArtwork by Delia Gable\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nWhen Zita is tied to the scene of a shocking murder, Dash begins to see that the seemingly unrelated parts of his life are connected in ways he never anticipated. The pieces to a much larger puzzle come into focus that could spell the end for Dash and everyone involved! \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nAided by his wise-cracking secretary, Cindy Crenshaw, and his pal on the police force, Sal McGillicutty, Dash must confront the monsters of the past and \ufb01nd the only thing capable of stopping a terrifying future! \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nThe Case of the Mysterious Zita Makara  \nThe gay, noir detective comic series DASH was written by Dave Ebersole and drawn by Delia Gable and Vinnie Rico. Northwest Press is shipping issue six to comics stores at the end of this month to close out the first story arc, a love letter to noir crime and classic horror pictures.\nNow we're collecting that first adventure, \"The Case of the Mysterious Zita Makara\", into a deluxe, 224-page graphic novel with a cover by Tana Ford!  \nCover artwork by Delia Gable\nIn addition to the main story, the collection will also include three brand-new stories:\n\"The Case of the Man Behind the Mask\", a 20-page story drawn by Sean Von Gorman. Dash takes a case in which he has to dig into the life of Hollywood\u2019s biggest up and coming stars, and finds a piece of his past there.\nFrom \"The Case of the Man Behind the Mask\", art by Sean Von Gorman\n\"The Case of the Best Friend on the Police Force\", an 8-page story drawn by Vinnie Rico. Officer Sal McGillicutty discovers his best friend has been hiding a huge secret from him, what will he do with the truth?\n\"The Case of the Wisecracking Secretary\", an 8-page story drawn by Vinnie Rico. Cindy Crenshaw broke and about to give up on LA, finds a car pulled over on the side of the road in the middle of the night, which could be just the opportunity she\u2019s been looking for! \nFrom \"The Case of the Wisecracking Secretary\", art by Vinnie Rico\nWe're proud that DASH will be the 20th book published by Northwest Press, and a great way to celebrate our tenth anniversary publishing great LGBTQ comics!\nMore About the Cast  \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nDash Malone was a rising star in the LAPD before he was outed in headlines on every paper in L.A. Managing to elude jail, Dash fought back by becoming the only thing lower in society\u2019s eyes than a homosexual, a private investigator.\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nNow, spending his days looking through other people\u2019s dirty laundry, Dash has developed a shield of cynicism and a gumshoe's jaded attitude. When a new tragedy strikes unexpectedly, Dash starts to think there's nobody in this world he can trust.\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nDash must somehow put his trust in a fantastical mythology in order to stop a killer, and will have to lean on the people he\u2019s closest to in order to get to the truth\u2026 and he's never been good at leaning on anyone. \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\n Zita Makara attempts to hire Dash to make an exchange for her. Zita has an ancient, stolen artifact she's looking to sell, but Dash sees right through her. Concerned she's just another femme fatale in need of a sucker, Dash finds out he already knows the man he's supposed to meet.\nZita knows more about Dash than she's letting on, and she's involved in something far more dangerous than just dealing in antiquities.   \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nCindy Crenshaw, Dash\u2019s feisty secretary, has been with him since he opened his firm, after he was kicked off the police force and outed to the world. She\u2019s determined to help Dash make the business succeed in the face of all the hate thrown their way. (Maybe she's even more determined than Dash, himself. Where else will she get paid to hate-read Gone with the Wind all day?)\nWith a mind even sharper than her quipping tongue, Cindy often catches on to the secrets bubbling under the surface long before Dash does.\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nJohnny \"Plink\" Plinketts is a former crook who Dash caught conning rich, elderly people into buying fake antiques from his \u201ccollection.\u201d But when he nabbed him, before him down to the station\u2026 Dash ended up taking him home. \nArtwork by Delia Gable\nDash doesn\u2019t know that Plink is a smuggler of antiquities, mostly stolen, who's determined to make one final score. Plink wants to use the money to get himself and his lover far away from the seedy underbelly of L.A. But can he get Dash to trust him long enough to make his plan work?\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nMore Great Rewards!\nThe main rewards in the campaign feature copies of the graphic novel itself, in print and digital, but there are some other great rewards you can choose.

Holden's cover image\nMadius Comics and Mad Robot Comics are proud to present Hell In Stalingrad - the first collaboration between writers Rob Jones (Griff Gristle, Tragic Tales of Horrere, Paperbacks and Inkstains) and Matt Hardy (Murder Most Mundane, Cadavers, Last Exit to Brighton).\n With an eye catching cover by 2000AD and BattleTanks artist P.J. Holden - and gritty, realistic art from Horrere alumni Russell MacEwan. \nHell in Stalingrad is an 80-page pulp horror graphic novel, in the vein of classic war story comics such as DC Thomson's Commando.\nIt is a complete story - told in one A5 sized, softcover or hardcover collection - utilsing black & white and single colour artwork. \nSet in the midst of the Battle of Stalingrad - with the Soviet Kessel slowly engulfing the German forces. We follow the story of a German soldier, Ernst, andVassily, his Russian counterpart, as they must set aside vast ideological differences in a bid to thwart an otherworldly threat. \n UNCOMICMAS - \"The story is highly addictive...[the] art is certainly daring and risky...\"\nFANDEMONIUM - \"Like Commando Comics, but viewed through a blood-smeared lens.\"\nTHE DREAM CAGE - \"It says War Is Hell on the cover but rest assured the comic looks absolutely heavenly.\" \n BIG COMIC PAGE - \"what you\u2019d get if Event Horizon was set in the middle of one of the bloodiest most horrific battles in the history of modern warfare.\"\nAP2HYC - \"anachronistic horror makes [Hell in] Stalingrad colourful and twisted and brutal...\"\nTHE VALKYRIES - \"The writing, along with the artwork is gritty and just as dark. Full of dark humor and characters that feel both well rounded and fully believable...I\u2019d be amiss if I didn\u2019t mention the frankly immense artwork from Russell McEwan. It\u2019s so multi-layered and intense, each page shows so much horror, movement, and energy.\"\nCan these two men from such radically different backgrounds, caught up in one of the bloodiest battles of the Second World War, prevent a demonic force from crossing over and plunging the world into the fires of Hell?  \nComplete with lettering by Jones (his lettering credits include 24 Panels for Image Comics, Nicnevin and the Bloody Queen for Humanoids and multiple issues of Commando Comics - including the reissued Ramsey's Raiders) - this is a must have for fans of horror and war comics alike. \n *NOTE* - Just for clarification, we would like to take this moment to say that none of the creators involved support the oppressive ideologies which are prevalent in this book, such as Nazism or Stalinism. The context of the story came about due to the ferocious nature of the battle in and around Stalingrad, which is why we felt it would be a good setting to choose for our story. The idea of War breaking down the barriers between our reality and the kingdom of Hell seemed most apt in the theater where Nazism and Stalinism clashed so brutally. The idea of two men on either side of such atrocious ideals, thrust into a war they did not wish to wage, at the behest of those with such extreme viewpoints, seemed like an interesting story to explore.\nBOOK PREVIEW \n\n'Vassily' print by Russell MacEwan\nInterior artist Russell MacEwan's variant cover.\nA DRM free Digital copy of the comic.\nDigital artbook of process work from Russell MacEwan\nA physical copy of the graphic novel.\nGUEST PIN UPS FOR STRETCHGOAL PRINT PACKAGE (ALL UNLOCKED!)\nPrint by guest artist Lucy Sullivan (Stretchgoal Print Package)\nGuest Pin-Up Print by artist Iain Laurie (stretch Goal Print Package)\nGuest Pin-Up Print by artist Russell M.

Technology was advancing at an unparalleled pace, the world was becoming more connected than ever before, and demons were finally becoming accepted as a regular part of society. Hmm? You don\u2019t remember the demons? No, trust me, they were everywhere. It\u2019d been a rough few decades since the portals opened, what with the supernatural suddenly unleashed upon the mundane world, but it had gotten so much better! Lesser imps were little more than brimstone pigeons, old superstitions were suddenly a lot scarier, and an untold number of hell dimensions had become just another series of exciting vacation spots. Truly, the world was a much more magical, if infernal, place!\nBut being a broke teen is the same in any reality, so what good are cursed relics and ancient evils when you can barely afford gas money? Desperate for any opportunity to bring some devilish delight into their lives, best friends Victor, Miri, and Reeves buy a cheap, do-it-yourself summoning circle from a mall kiosk. Their goal? To call forth their own personal demon and bind it to their souls. Because really, what better way is there to end summer vacation in style than a blood sacrifice between friends?\nCover Art\nCreated by Jordan Alsaqa and Ray Nadine, Raise Hell! is a coming-of-age comedy about the confusing emotions, messy relationships, and strange explorations that come with the last few years of high school. Also, demons. Oh, so very many demons.\nRaise Hell! follows the adventures of Victor Beck, Miriam Elrahal, and Ashley Reeves, a trio of high school juniors just trying to survive to graduation in the city of Eklund. Victor is an excitable goof around his friends and mom, but he's riddled with social anxiety and easily embarrassed in class and on his own. That doesn't stop him from rambling on for hours about his love of ska and the infernal, or from Naruto-running everywhere unironically. Reeves is skeptical of just about everything, and her temper has a way of getting the better of her, especially around her seemingly unflappable stepmom, Karen (UGH... Karen...). Call her by her first name at great risk to your personal well-being. And Miriam is a voice of reason among the insanity, a keeper of the peace within her friend group and in the world at large. That doesn't make her any less quick to freak out over a rare anime import DVD or at the possibility of her devoutly religious father learning about her occult interests.  \nOur lovable teens\nThis unlikely trio of punk teens think they're ready for whatever the underworld has to throw at them, but nothing can truly prepare them for the mischievous imp Alistair that the hellfire spits up...\nWith this campaign, our goal is to raise funding to complete and print a physical copy of Raise Hell!. As a thank you for supporting the project, we have a number of reward levels, including digital and physical copies of Raise Hell!, previous books from Jordan and Ray, stickers, an enamel pin, art prints, script edits from Jordan, and physical commissions from Ray. At the top level, you can even appear in the book enjoying a meal at the Eklund Park Mall's food court!\nIncluded below are several preview pages from early in the book as our heroes head to the mall to make their fateful purchase!\nClick the image to better read the pages!\nWriter Jordan Alsaqa is an N.C. State graduate with a degree in Creative Writing. He\u2019s successfully funded numerous comics through Kickstarter, including Terminal Protocol, Finding Peace, and We Have to Go Back. His current comic, Welderkin, is published digitally by Comicker Press. His work can also be found in numerous anthologies, including Alloy Anthology: Electrum from Ascend Comics and You Died from Iron Circus Comics. Jordan\u2019s high school years were spent playing video games, creating a ridiculously complex stick figure comic mythology, and listening to way more third-wave ska than any teen probably should\u2019ve in the late 2000s. You can keep up with Jordan's other projects on Twitter and at his website.\nArtist Ray Nadine has been drawing since they could hold a pencil, and has been making comics since 2013. They're currently working on a graphic novel that they're contractually obliged not to say much more about, and also illustrated Messenger on Webtoon. They've had stories featured in a handful of anthologies, notably Everything Is Going Wrong (edited by Mark!) and Local Haunts, edited by Kara Lais.  Ray's also created the webcomic Dollhouse, and several short comics including Anchored, The Collector, and The Ties That Bind. When Ray isn't working, they're playing too many video games, cooking, or rough-housing with their cats. Their favorite band is My Chemical Romance and they still listen to all the same crap they listened to in high school. Keep up with their art and projects on Twitter and their website.\nEditor Mark Bouchard is a non-binary writer/editor in Chicago, by way of New England who has been self-publishing comics since 2016. They are the editor and creator of EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG: Comics On Punk & Mental Illness, and their writing has been published in a number of comic anthologies including A Wave Blue World\u2019s Dead Beats. They are currently writing a horror graphic novella due out in early 2021. Outside of comics, Mark enjoys curry and black coffee, often at the same time. They also write satire for The Hard Times and Hard Drive. You can follow them on Twitter for updates on their work and their dog, Juicebox. To read their short comics, and learn more about their past work, visit their website.\nFor funding, $500 will go towards paying Ray's remaining page rate for drawing, coloring, and lettering the story. Roughly $800 will go towards printing the book itself, with an additional $300 going towards producing the additional campaign rewards; got to get those swanky stickers, pins, and art prints! $700 will go towards shipping and fulfillment costs, while the final approximate 10% will go towards Kickstarter fees.\nBelow, you can get the full rundown of all the various reward levels available for this campaign. Each backer is taking a chance on this very personal passion project, and we plan to give it our all to show our thanks at every level. Domestic US shipping is included in each total, with international shipping costing an additional $15. And for the first 48 hours, the Physical Copy and Enamel Pin levels are available for a special early bird price!\nAt the Supporter level, in addition to our personal thanks, you'll be included in the Thank You section at the back of the book. You'll also have access to any behind-the-scenes material posted for backers in the campaign updates.\nAt the Digital Issue level, you'll receive a PDF copy of Raise Hell!. The digital copy will include all the same material as the physical book, including all pin-ups and stretch goals.\nWith the Digital Collection level, you'll receive additional PDFs of stories either written by Jordan or written/illustrated by Ray: Finding Peace by Jordan Alsaqa & Marie Enger, We Have to Go Back by Jordan Alsaqa & Sally Cantirino,  A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing by Jordan Alsaqa & Kacee Navarro, Dollhouse by Ray Nadine, Anchored by Ray Nadine, and The Ties That Bind by Ray Nadine.\nAt the Physical Issue level, you\u2019ll receive the print edition of Raise Hell!, signed by writer Jordan Alsaqa. You'll also receive a Raise Hell! sticker!\nAt the Art Print level, you\u2019ll get a special 8.5\"x11\" riso print of the Raise Hell! cast, designed and printed by Ray Nadine!\nArt not final\nAt the Enamel Pin level, you\u2019ll get a special 1.5\" hard enamel pin of Victor's GREATEST SKA MIX OF ALL TIME cassette tape.\nAll horns, all the time\nAnd now that both alternate pins have been unlocked, EVERY TIER that includes an enamel pin will now be able to choose which of the three pins (Victor, Miri, or Reeves) that you want included in your reward package. For the current Enamel Pin tier, if you should want two or three of the pins, we've added two new reward levels, the Double Pin tier ($40) and Triple Pin tier ($50), so you can simple upgrade your reward tier to assure you receive all the pins you want.\nFor all higher level tiers, as well as the Early Bird Enamel Pin tier, you just need to add an additional $10 to your pledge total for each pin. For early birds, this will maintain your initial savings while still allowing you to receive all three pins.\nThe Art Print tier and below WILL NOT be eligible to add pins on. You'll need to at least pledge at the initial Enamel Pin tier in order to receive any pins.\nLastly, given the popularity of the pins themselves, we've added a Just the Pins tier ($30) \nAt the Back Issues level, you'll receive physical copies of several past works from Jordan and Ray, including Finding Peace by Jordan Alsaqa & Marie Enger, We Have to Go Back by Jordan Alsaqa & Sally Cantirino, Flame & Flood Atop the Mountain by Jordan Alsaqa & Christine Skelly, Dollhouse by Ray Nadine, Anchored by Ray Nadine, and The Collector by Ray Nadine.\nAt the Editor level, Jordan will work with you to help edit and refine either a comic script (max. 24 pages) or pitch document that you\u2019re working on. This includes two rounds of edits and the option for an hour-long web or phone call. Jordan has eight years of previous editing experience, including numerous comic script and pitch edits, as well as work-for-hire rewrites. \nWant a Ray Nadine original to add to your collection? At the Art Commission level, you can do exactly that, commissioning an original 5\"x7\" traditional art piece from Ray. The artwork will be pen, ink, and spot color Posca. When you back at this level, you\u2019ll be contacted to make sure Ray is comfortable with the subject you\u2019d like to have drawn. You can see an example of this level right below!   \nFinally, why not enjoy a meal of\u2026 middling quality with your comic? At the Food Court Cameo level, you can appear in the book as one of the customers of the Eklund Park Shopping Mall! In addition, you'll receive a social media icon drawn by artist Ray Nadine.\nThis could be your face\nThe initial funding goal has been reached! Time for... STRETCH GOALS! \nUNLOCKED! - Stretch Goal #1: At $4000, we'll be producing an additional six-page story that'll be included in both the print and digital editions of Raise Hell! The short will follow Victor as he works his part-time job at the local used bookstore and ends up having a chance encounter with... the Demon Lord of Ska!\nUNLOCKED! - Stretch Goal #2: At $4500, we'll include a variant pin design! This one features Reeves's mixtape to go along with Victor's. Just some bands you've probably never heard of. When we send out the backer questionnaire, we'll ask which pin you'd like. If you'd like multiple pins, just add $10 per pin to your pledge! \nUNLOCKED! - Stretch Goal #3: At $5000, we'll include a second variant pin design! This one features Miri's mixtape, full of her favorite anime openings. Same as the other pins, we'll ask you which pin you'd like in the backer questionnaire, and if you'd like multiple pins, just add $10 per pin to your pledge!\nStretch Goal #4: At $6500, we'll be including two additional guest illustrations from artists Skylar Patridge and Vivian Truong in the book!

Presented exclusively as a deluxe format oversized hardcover, it's a dark, atmospheric tale set at the dawn of the Ottoman Empire -- a rich, grisly world of dazzling arts and brutal massacres, opulent palaces and bloodthirsty kings. \nDRAGON tells the story of Adil, a fallen old Muslim warrior, and Marjorie, a zealous young Christian nun, two scarred heroes who must overcome inherited bigotries and mutual distrust to hunt a demonic creature that wears the skin of a prince -- Vlad the Impaler, known to history as Dracula. \nA NOTE FROM AUTHOR SALADIN AHMED\nI can't tell you how excited I am about this! \nDRAGON is the Dracula story I've wanted to tell for years, full of everything that matters to me -- horrific creatures, rich history, wildly different characters coming together to confront evil. It's a story centered on the sorts of heroes that are usually pushed to the margins -- heroes who must reach across gulfs of culture and faith to face down the world's most terrifying monster.  \nCertain stories scream for certain artists, and as soon as this tale began to form in my head, I knew I wanted Dave Acosta to draw it. The way he goes from period details through pulp horror and classic comic influences is just breathtaking. He's outdoing himself with DRAGON, bringing to life Ottoman palaces and haunted forests in a way that will completely immerse the reader.  \nWhat you see here is just a taste, and I can't wait for you to experience his art -- along with Chris O'Halloran's dazzling colors and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou's brilliant letters and design -- on massive, gorgeously printed pages. \nA STUNNING BOOK, A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN\nFor years readers have been asking me to launch an original story on Kickstarter, and I've finally taken the plunge! DRAGON is a story that demands total control by the creative team and begs to be rendered as a beautiful physical object. And Kickstarter is the ideal  way to maintain that control and get such an object directly into fans' hands.\nThis will be a lavish book, published as a Kickstarter exclusive. An oversized, slipcovered deluxe format hardcover printed on high quality paper and crammed with extras from creators' notes to concept art to script and pencil pages.\nThere are currently no plans to release DRAGON in trade paperback or digital. For now, this special event hardcover is the only way to experience the story! \nWe're offering a discounted early bird reward tier for those who support the project in the first 24 hours, but our campaign for DRAGON is deliberately very straightforward, with no bells and whistles. It's all about making a jaw-dropping book that showcases an intense story, and getting that book straight to readers.\nOUR TEAM  \nSALADIN AHMED won the 2017 Eisner Award for Best New Series alongside Christian Ward for Black Bolt. His short fiction has been anthologized by George RR Martin and performed by LeVar Burton. His novel Throne of the Crescent Moon was nominated for the Hugo Award and was cited in the Dungeons and Dragons Player\u2019s Handbook. Abbott, his creator owned comic with Sami Kivela, was nominated for the Bram Stoker award. Saladin currently writes Miles Morales: Spider-Man and The Magnificent Ms. Marvel for Marvel Comics. \nDAVE ACOSTA is a sequential artist from Metro Detroit, known mostly for his work on Elvira: Mistress Of The Dark for Dynamite. Dave has also illustrated Vampirella, The Shadow, Doc Savage, and the serial killer-thriller Twelve Devils Dancing.\nCHRIS O'HALLORAN is a colorist from Cork, Ireland. He colors Ice Cream Man from Image and has worked on books for Marvel, Dark Horse, Boom, Dynamite and others.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU is a comics letterer, half from Algeria and half from England. He's lettered cool comics like Red Sonja, X-O Manowar, and Protector. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine.\nNATE COSBY is an editor and writer, that's worked on Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more. \n**A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON SHIPPING**\nShipping fees are not included in your pledge. Rather, all shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, just before the book ships.\nThis allows us to make sure you are paying the lowest possible shipping fees.

This anthology title featured futuristic stories of heroic adventurers with a mid-century aesthetic, and it is well-loved to this day, often for its lush, high-quality, imaginative covers. Just look at this winner from issue 71: \nPlanet Comics #71 from 1953\nHey everyone! My name\u2019s Jeff McClelland, and I write comics like The Tick and the 2019 Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. With this new iteration of Planet Comics, I\u2019d like to tell fun, imaginative stories under a sci-fi umbrella. To that end, I\u2019ve asked some of my friends to help out and I\u2019m really happy with the result. If you agree, then I hope you\u2019ll help us send this issue to print! If the campaign for this first issue is successful, I\u2019d like to publish a total of four issues on a (roughly) quarterly schedule.\nAs an added throwback, this issue will be presented in an oversized, magazine format, leaving lots of room for wide landscapes and immersive action!\nThe book\nSo what\u2019ll be included in this first issue? First, we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Bulwark\u201d, from myself and artist Andrea Schiavone. This story will be the book\u2019s continuing feature, told in serialized chapters along the way. Here\u2019s a quick preview!\nThe Bulwark preview\nThe Bulwark preview\nNext up is \u201cThe Old Man and the Agean Sea\u201d from my good friend and frequent collaborator, writer/artist Jeff McComsey (Honcho; Grendel, Kentucky). Jeff brings an aesthetic to this tale that is somehow both foreboding and warm, and this complete story features some of his best work yet.\nThe Old Man and the Agean Sea preview\nThen we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth\u201d from Jennie Wood (Flutter; A Boy Like Me) and Duane Redhead (2000AD; The Tick), both wonderful, creative people. I\u2019m thrilled that Planet Comics will be the venue for their first collaboration, and this complete story is so wild \u2013 I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see it all! \nThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth preview\nAlso included is an article by Diana Krueger on one of the pioneers of the original Planet Comics: Lily Ren\u00e9e! Diana highlights the life and times of Ren\u00e9e, one of the most prominent female artists from the mid-century run.\nI\u2019ve got a few more (secret!) plans to add some pages to the book if we get past our initial goal!\nREWARDS\nIt's a space ship!\nThe biggest reward for this campaign is, of course, the book. Whether you go in for a physical copy or electronic, I hope you\u2019ll feel that your pledge is well spent on these new sci-fi tales.\nThis first issue comes with two covers: a regular cover with art by Pietro, and a Kickstarter-exclusive variant cover by Matthew Dow Smith! You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.  \nPlanet Comics #1 Kickstarter exclusive cover by Matthew Dow Smith\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \u201cmaking of\u201d publication, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this issue. You\u2019ll also get your name printed in a \u201cthank you\u201d section at the end of the book, and you'll get an electronic copy of an original Planet Comics issue from the 1940s!\nThere are a few additional, limited, physical rewards that you can get in this campaign. The first is a neat vinyl sticker of this updated Planet Comics logo, designed by Alan Gallo!\nI\u2019m also offering up prints of Matthew Dow Smith\u2019s variant cover image, sans logos or other text.\nAnd you'll have a chance to get one of the last few copies of Black Terror: Social Insecurity and maybe a few other books I've written!\nThe Black Terror: Social Insecurity\n*Also! The first 30 backers - at any physical level - will receive a signed copy of The Tick 2020 FCBD Special!* \nFree to the first 30 physical backers!\nTHE CAMPAIGN GOAL\nMy first goal with this campaign is to be able to pay the creators a decent rate for their work. After that, I hope to offset some of the printing and shipping costs that otherwise might be prohibitive.\nIf this campaign exceeds its initial goal, all of the extra funds will be funneled directly back into the book, adding pages and helping us get started with issue #2!\nFollow me online!\nIf you\u2019re looking for more content, progress reports or just to see pictures of my dog, you can always follow me online by clicking the images below:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re currently about 75% finished with the art for this book.

I'm Daniel Kalban, and I'm the creator/writer of AmericanDreams. Now you may ask yourself \"What the heck is American Dreams?\" American Dreams is a superhero comic set in New York City at the turn of the Twentieth Century. With my publisher, Short Fuse Media Group, LLC., I have released two issues of this series. Working with me on this book is the amazing art team of Dody Eka (pencils), Tebe Andry (inks), and Warnia K. Sahadewa (colors), with Matt Bowers (letters). Netho Diaz (GI Joe) provides the variant cover, and Tommy Shelton colors both the main and variant covers. \nToday, we're bringing you the opportunity to get all caught up on this amazing series while also offering issue #3 for the very first time. Short Fuse Media Group helped get the issue #1 released after some issues with a previous publisher and we released issue #2 direct at Baltimore Comic Con last year!!! With comic conventions shut down due to Covid-19, I decided to hop into the driver's seat and bring the entire series to Kickstarter. If you like superheroes, alternative history, or both, you are in for an exciting read.\nGreetings From American Dreams!\nTHE STORY SO FAR\nJake Gold is a poor Jewish immigrant living on New York's Lower East Side with his parents, siblings, and grandfather in 1900. He's a worker in a sweatshop by day; by night, he's fighting as part of a never-ending turf war between rival ethnic gangs for whatever scrap of the territory they can get. For him, the American Dream is a fairy tale; one a poor immigrant can never live.\nPage from American Dreams issue 1\nThomas Edison, however, truly believes in the American Dream; and he's made sure to get his way to the top by any means. He has found an old design by his old employee-turned-rival, Nikola Tesla: a machine to harness the energy from the stars. \nPage from American Dreams issue 1\nWith JP Morgan's financial backing, Edison sets up his machine in Central Park and throws the switch.\nPage from American Dreams issue 1\nThat, of course, is when everything changes for Jake, Edison, and the rest of New York City. And dark forces will do anything to take power in the midst of chaos.....\nPage from American Dreams Issue 2\nSurrounding Jake is a cast of characters with names both unfamiliar and world-famous. This is the time of Harry Houdini, Emma Goldman, and other characters from this turbulent time in American History.\nSet against the backdrop of the Gilded Age, American Dreams is superheroes-meets-historical fiction in an action-packed adventure. It also speaks some harsh truths of the realities of that seemingly long ago era...and how things might not have changed as much as we have liked.\nA SNEAK PEEK INTO THE PAST\nLet's take a dive into American Dreams, shall we?\nPage From American Dreams Issue 3\nPage from American Dreams Issue 3\nPage from American Dreams Issue 3\nPage from American Dreams Issue 3\nSO WHY KICKSTARTER?\nYour Kickstarter contributions help fund future issues of American Dreams!

Example: If you're interested in an enamel pin ($12), a tote bag ($20) and a banner ($55), choose the banner ($55 + $8 shipping) reward tier to start.\nSTEP 2: Now you'll be adding the funds needed for the rest of your items. The guide shows each item and their cost + shipping. Add the necessary funds for each item you choose to pledge for. Example: An enamel pin is $12 and shipping is free. A tote bag is $20 + $5 shipping. $12 + $20 + $5 = $37 gets added.\nSTEP 3: Add all your numbers together. Starting reward tier + additional item total + additional shipping total = PLEDGE TOTAL. Example: $55 starting (+$8 shipping) + $32 (added item cost) + $5 (added shipping cost) =  $100 TOTAL.\nHave any questions? Do the numbers not quite add up, or does your shipping seem off?

So they strap up, hit the streets and are ready to fight back against bigotry with a sequin baseball bat and some bad ass righteous fury! \nThe fabulous Bi Phallicia\nFollow the most fabulous street gang in the world as they patrol the Gay Village, step up to bigoted politicians and bash down the bashers. And in the midst of it all, they discover there's a conspiracy behind it all!\nThey're sick of being seen as victims! Sick of having crimes against them ignored! The Glitter Vipers are here to fight back!\nThe story is a brisk 60 pages, with a few behind the scenes extras thrown in too to give you a great little package in a glitter grindhouse revenge fantasy!\nThe gang's all here! Art by Katie Fleming\nWho Are the Glitter Vipers?\n Bi Phallicia  - Bi Phallicia, real name Jason Filson, is a Manchester drag queen of some repute, who as well as her weekly shows runs a support group for those that have been victims of abuse, bigotry or hate crimes. Unfortunately, she finds herself becoming not just the organiser but also one of the members. She takes on the lead in the Glitter Vipers gang when they decide to fight back. \nJesus Moretti - Jesus is a Colombian immigrant living in Manchester, UK and close friends with Bi and her group. He's dating Anton Bakunin. He's a broader, tougher looking man who came to the UK to live a more open and free life as a gay man. \nAnton Bakunin - Anton had a rough upbringing, finding it a lot harder to hide who he is as a gay man. An Eastern European immigrant who fled his home where being gay can result in being 'vanished', Anton came to the UK to try and find peace. Unfortunately, homophobia isn't just something that happens 'somewhere else'. \nMelissa 'Mel' Carter - Mel is a garage worker in Manchester, and is dating Bri. They are attendees of the support group after the pair were attacked by homophobes on a tram.  Mel is very tough, and has been harbouring a lot of anger over the surprise attack they suffered, and is eager to make sure nothing like it ever happens again.\n Bryony 'Bri' Stonehouse - Manchester born and bred, Bri has been dating Mel for nearly two years now. She also felt more anger than anything else after they were attacked, but she abhors violence entirely. Instead, Bri uses her smarts and community spirit to build the community support group stronger than ever before. \nCallum 'Cal' Wilkes - Cal came out much later in life, as his life in a biker gang didn't feel like the safest place to be openly gay. In fact, it turned out he was right when he did get outed to his gang and he wound up kicked out and alone. Struggling at first to find his tribe after this rejection, Cal is now a regular of Manchester's leather scene and brings his gruff, take-no-guff attitude to the local queer community. \nQueenie Iwobi - Queenie is a trans woman from a Nigerian family, she moved from her home in London to Manchester for council work years ago. Now, she takes part in the support group as a way of managing the daily micro-aggressions she faces as a proud trans WOC in this world, and to help support others like her. Also not a fan of violence, she joins Bri at the homebase, creating a helpful, safe space for the community and using her skills as a community support worker. \nAlbert 'Alby' Prince - a 16 year old trans masc kid, Alby has been sneaking out to the gay scene for a while to find a safe space to be their authentic self, away from their home where they are not out. Alby became a big fan of Bi's shows, and Bi took them under her wing so she could make sure Alby was having a safe experience. Alby prefers he/him or they/them pronouns, but is not yet out to their family.\nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nContent Warning\nWe are aware that the topic of hate crimes, bigotry and assault are sensitive topics, that we as a queer community often face far too often. Sensitive to this, the book will contain content warnings so that readers can be aware going in what to expect. \nWe are also aware that it can be annoying to be seen as just the victims all the time. And while there can be a lot of emotions that are discussed after these kind of things, one emotion is often overlooked or swept-under-the-rug: anger. \nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nSometimes when we see these things happen, or when they happen to us, there can be a strong sense of justified anger, and we look at that through the medium of revenge fantasy grindhouse action and explore what sense of resolution or satisfaction can be found there. \nAll the while telling an entertaining, thoughtful action story in a very modern world. We'll have fun, but won't be making fun. \nWho's It For?\nHave you ever seen the news and just felt so angry? Then you, for sure. \nBut seriously, I think anyone who has felt that kind of strong reaction to things that happen in the world, whether it be a story of injustice they've seen in the news, or an article of a hate-fuelled attack, or worse, have had personal experience with that; I think anyone who relates to that will find something to relate to in Glitter Vipers. \nQueenie Iwobi by Katie Fleming\nAnyone who has stood up to or is aware of organised hate, systemic violence and bigotry in this world can maybe find something in Glitter Vipers that speaks to them. We've all felt angry: this is about our right to that rage, and finding an outlet for it.\nWe all get told that we should not let that anger rise, that we don't have the right to our anger or how lashing out is wrong, but see the same things happen again and again. Glitter Vipers will explore that anger, it's justification and how it too can have a role in recovery, for good or ill.\nGenerally suitable for teens aged 16 years of age or older, the book has some light use of course language, violence, and as mentioned, sensitive topics around bigotry, hate crimes and assault. If you are buying for someone else, please do bare that in mind. \nCover by James Gifford\nWho's Making It?\nOne thing that we wanted to achieve with this book was the keep the whole creative team as queer identifying people. It's an LGBTQIA+ focused story, so it only felt right to have it be made by LGBTQIA+ people. \nThe team is as follows:-\nJoe Glass - Writer\n Joe Glass - Joe is the writer and co-creator of popular LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series, The Pride, now a successful ComiXology Originals series. He's also the writer of Acceptable Losses, a mature, political thriller with a dark edge. Most recently, he's worked with RuPaul's Drag Race star Manila Luzon on a countdown Instagram comic for her single, Robbed! Joe lives in South Wales with his family, and a petulant cat named Oliver. You can find his website here. \nKatie Fleming - Art\n Katie Fleming - Katie Fleming is a queer artist from Dublin, Ireland.  She began creating comics with her Partner with their LGBTQ+ comic '100 Times' and '100 More Times'.  since then she's worked on numerous anthologies and comics, such as 'Heart of Steal', 'The Black Rubric' and the webcomic, 'Ship Wrecked'. Glitter Vipers is her first graphic novel and she's super excited. When she's not making comics she's spending her time as a Werewolf. Her work can be found here. \n Kelly Fitzpatrick - Kelly Fitzpatrick is known for her work on books such as: Bitch Planet, Supergirl: Being Super, Wonder Woman: Tempest Tossed, Shade the Changing Girl, DC: Bombshells, Archie, and Josie and the Pussycats. Nominated for the esteemed Hugo awards, she is also a past nominee for Autostraddle, Ghastly & Prism awards and has worked on titles nominated for the GLAAD and the Harvey awards. Her client list is available on her website and includes such prestigious publishers as DC Comics, Archie Comics & Dark Horse Comics. \nLucas Gattoni - Letters\n Lucas Gattoni - Lucas Gattoni is a seasoned graphic designer and typesetter now pursuing his dream job of comic book lettering. He has lettered GLAAD nominated Liebestrasse for ComiXology Originals, Twin Worlds for Action Lab, Eskimo Kisses for Scout Comics and is currently lettering the Spanish version of Sonic The Hedgehog for IDW. He lives in his home country of Argentina with his husband and their three unnamed goldfish (oops, make that two now). His website is here.\nTed Brandt - Editor\n Ted Brandt - Ted Brandt is best known as an inker, working with his partner Ro on the Eisner- and GLAAD-nominated CROWDED from Image Comics. He likes long walks on the beach, and eating too much pizza. Ted is using his editorial hat on Glitter Vipers to help make the book the best it can be. \nJames Gifford - Cover Artist\n James Gifford - James Gifford is a cis gay illustrator and storyboard artist who lives in London. He's a wayward pirate, plundering whatever illustration jobs he runs ashore on, never resting in one spot for long. A lone creative, a side-spitting gunslinger. The moment you think you have him pinned, he slips through your fingers like smoke. He's earned coin from Cartoon Network and Marvel comics and is currently creating content for Dungeons and Dragons in his spare time. You'll chip your teeth on his tough exterior, but deep down his heart is gold. His website is here. \nSpire Eaton - Spire is a graphic designer, artist, animator and comic creator based in Florida. He designed the Glitter Vipers logo for the book. That fabulousness is all down to him! You can check out his work here.\nHow Far Along Is It?\nAt time of launching the campaign, the book is entirely written, final inks are done for about roughly 20% of the book, with a further dozen pages ahead prepped too, and colours and cover work is starting in conjunction as the rest of the pages are drawn.\nAlby Prince by Katie Fleming\nWe estimate that by the end of the campaign the book will be half way or more complete, and have allowed a roomy space of months between campaign end and delivery in an effort to ensure prompt delivery of the finished product. \nBy following and/or backing the campaign, we will keep you updated with new pages and art as they happen, so you'll be the first to see more as it comes!\n How is the Money Spent?\nA Breakdown of How the Goal Amount is Split\nThe majority of the goal amount is to pay for the art production of Glitter Vipers: this includes the drawing/inking, the colours and the design elements of putting the book together. \nThe next biggest elements are the printing costs (currently based on a modest-to-large print run) and the shipping costs of sending copies out to those who back for physical reward tiers. Costs of shipping have been worked out based on impending Royal Mail price changes taking effect on July 1st 2020. Due to COVID-19 and changes in legislation for USPS in America, international shipping will be rising significantly, but we are baring this in mind in the planned goal amount and postage prices. \nThe smallest element is to go on extra rewards elements, like the stickers. \nAs such, the greatest overall chunk of the the goal amount we are asking for is to cover the production cost and to make sure our art team get a good, speedy payment for their hard work. \nSample colours by Kelly Fitzpatrick\nWhat Can I Get?\nWell, naturally we are looking to provide both digital and print options of the book as reward tiers. In this day and age, there's no excuse to not offer both options to backers, so both will be readily available. \nThere is also a tier to get multiple copies of the book, at a discounted price! This is primarily for comic stores that would like to support and stock the book, but also libraries and heck, if a group of friends all want to support but are on a budget, or you think you know a group of friends or family who'd all be interested in a copy, you can back at that level to get multiple copies at discount. This level is limited.  \nThere are options to get signed copies of the book, signed by writer Joe Glass, but again these are limited due to the time and energy taken in signing a lot of books can take.\nWe also have Glitter Vipers stickers available, so you can grab reward tiers with those included. \nSample of the Embroidered Patch\nOr, why not grab an embroidered Glitter Vipers patch! This is a very limited reward tier, so once it's gone, it's gone. Get it while you can! \nPlus, there's just the positive energy of knowing you've supported a great, queer focused comic project by queer creators, and that's worth everything, right! \nFinally, we have been sure to include the price of postage so when you back, you'll know exactly how much it will be in total. We've based the postage prices on the updated Royal Mail pricing coming into effect on July 1st, 2020, based on the planned sizing of the book and estimated weight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSometimes life gets in the way, and unforeseen obstacles pop up causing a delay in getting the products shipped in time. In this campaign, we have estimated a lot of time for completion and printing, so all things being equal there shouldn't be a delay to the books going out, but as ever, it is an estimate. \n\nLikewise, as far as postage goes, we have sourced good, strong, tough packaging that should withstand any handling from delivery services. Similarly, we have taken into account the new postal rates for sending to the United States from the UK, and have priced accordingly. This does mean International postage costs are higher, but with the changes in USPS and increases in general post costs due to COVID-19, it is worked out to be as fair and cheap as possible, while still maintaining a relatively speedy and well-handled delivery. \n\nThe biggest challenge is the goal amount: while it can seem large, the goal is what it is to allow for making sure the team are all paid fairly for the books production, the printing of a good sized print run and shipping. The biggest help to overcome this challenge is to share and spread the word of the campaign, so for all of you deciding to support, we hope you can help us in spreading the word too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Our unending thanks for helping us on our fight back!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "A digital copy of Glitter Vipers\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["195 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Print Copy", "descp": "You'll get a print copy of the book and a digital copy too!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy\nPrint Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a314 or more", "title": "Sticker!", "descp": "At this level, as well as your print and digital copies of Glitter Vipers, you'll be able to mark your membership to the GV gang with a shiny holo-sticker!

We are grateful to walk this path with you.\nTHE ADEPT is a new comic book series written by Tasha Huo and Charlie Stickney from an original story by Peter Shiao and featuring artwork and colors from Yishan Li and letters from Gabriela Downie. The 42-page first issue tells the deep and personal story of a young woman who begins a journey to become the adept to an ancient martial tradition which has been lost to the ages. It is a story of action, transformation and mystery, but at its core it is about homecoming. And what\u2019s homecoming without a chance for redemption?  And you know what ALWAYS comes with redemption\u2026?\nKUNG-FU - ok not always. But ours does! \nWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to kick off this limited series, the first in the Immortal interconnected Wuxia content universe.\nIt might sound unfamiliar, but Wuxia has influenced contemporary pop culture's most impactful stories from Crouching Tiger to The Matrix to Star Wars.  Wuxia is a fantasy genre of romanticism and poeticism from the East. It is the realm of the outsider, the wandering hero, who is compelled by circumstance to stand against injustice and champion the common person.\nWelcome to... \nTHE ADEPT is about Amy, a young Chinese-American who runs away from an abusive home, destined to be another orphan street thug. \nBut then she is visited in her dreams by a Shaolin Kung Fu Master, who begins to train her in the wilds of this Dreamscape, preparing her to face an unnamed evil that he'll never speak about.  The dreams give her meaning \u2013 purpose \u2013 the training empowers her \u2013 and she learns to cope.  But why her?  \nThen, with no warning, the dreams just stop. And just as suddenly as he came into her life, he's gone.  Was he just a figment of her imagination?\nIt\u2019s now been ten years and Amy comes home again, hoping to rekindle the relationship with Ali, the younger sister she once abandoned. Ali has had her own trauma and pain in that time, but she covers it up with a carefree, carpe-diem attitude.  If you don't think about your pain, did it ever really happen? \nAmy scores tickets too a benefit concert for Ali's favorite singer - Sasha True. An international sensation, famous for catchy lyrics, flashy dance moves and a beat with a killer hook.  (Sasha is more than what she seems, and when the going gets tough her \"true\" colors will be revealed)   \nWhat could possibly derail the reunion of the estranged sisterhood?\nBad guys. When a kidnapping attempt targets Sasha, Amy has no choice but to break out her Shaolin skill learned from her dreams.  But this is no amateur kidnapping, it's a well-organized attack from a shadowy operation. \nAnd then, among the commotion\u2026a surprise. She comes face to face with the Shaolin Master from her dreams. Wu-what indeed.\nWe can\u2019t wait to introduce you to Amy, Ali, Fa Sheng, and Sasha and we\u2019ve got much to unpack over this series. Where has Amy been? Why did the dreams choose her? What is this shadowy organization and how is it connected to the Shaolin Master? And hold up, the Shaolin Master is real?  \nStandard Cover by Adept #1 Artist Yishan Li\nTHE ADEPT is the first project from Immortal Studios, a new comic-first content studio.  We are creating an interconnected universe of modern and elevated Wuxia stories. Ours are stories of transformation, a content ethos built on empowerment, self-discovery, and connection with the world around us. We are setting these stories in today's world - full of diversity, modern concerns, and reflective of the moment. Our \u201csuperhero\u201d stories are guided by one core principle: in each of us is a hero of our own choosing.  Let's Awaken the Hero in Everyone. \nIt\u2019s fitting that our ambitions get, well, kicked off with a Shaolin story. Shaolin is the birthplace of kung fu as we know it today and really grounds us within this world where physical combat and spiritual enlightenment are one in the same. This is what makes it different from mixed martial arts, boxing, or a street fight. \nIt is a 1500 year old tradition that has been carried right into modern day as the source of contemporary pop culture fascination with martial arts \u2013 from Bruce Lee to the Last Airbender. We are excited to be adding to that tradition with our own take that really goes to the transformational roots of this legacy.\nWhat we hope will really set this series apart is the attention to the authenticity of Shaolin forms depicted in our panels.  To recreate the intricacy of the forms, we learned from Gene Ching, a 32nd generation layman disciple of the Shaolin Temple and master of martial arts, who worked with Conor Hughes to meticulously plot and layout the action sequences. \nWe are proud to present here fourteen pages of Adept #1.  These pages are the result of a lot of life experience, hard work, and collaboration from a talented bevy of artists and teammates, old friends and new friends, and now hopefully you - our community.\nUm, do you want to be a rockstar?\nWe\u2019ve got some awesome things lined up. Variant covers from two amazing guest artists, collector\u2019s items, and\u2026you know whenever you\u2019re like ready to be world famous we hear there are some openings in Sasha True\u2019s Band.\nFirst, the variant covers...\nTHE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE is brought to you by the imaginative hand of guest artist Zi Xu.  We love this perspective from the baddies as they charge Amy and Fasheng, poised in their martial stances.  And with that look in their eyes, I think I'd sit this one out.  Zi Xu is an illustrator, concept artist, and matte painter who has worked in film, advertising, and games.  Check out more of her work at https://www.zixu.co/ \nThe Adept Kickstarter Variant Cover by Zi Xu\nOur 2nd Variant hails from a little town called White Ash.  We were gobsmacked by the work Sam Beck did on White Ash #5 that we didn't think we could pull her over to our corner of the universe.  And oh, does she have a doozy of a concept for you.  Starts with a DIE and ends with a HARD.  The cover is still in the works, but you can see that aforementioned White Ash cover below.  Check out more of Sam's work right here - https://sambeck.ca/ \nVariant Cover by Sam Beck\nIn addition to these hot variants, we've cooked up a few other tricks to pull you into the world of The Adept. \n All of our backers receiving physical rewards will receive a commemorative Sasha True Benefit Concert ticket, the most exclusive ticket in town and a major setpiece featured in Issue #1. For the first 100 print backers, the ticket will be signed by one of our creatives.  And...who knows...what\u2019s a ticket if it can\u2019t eventually get you into something\u2026 \nYeah, essentially our bat signal.  This collectible pin of the Immortal logo is molded in hard enamel and will be at least 7/8th inches long.  Wear it proudly.  Who knows,  if we ever cross paths and you\u2019re wearing your pin and we're wearing ours\u2026well what a meeting that could be. Each pin comes with a laser etched number.  Someone out there is getting #1.\nWe are super proud of this set of Adept Trading Cards featuring authentic Shaolin forms. We have tried really hard to make Shaolin tangible, meticulously researching and integrating real forms into the pages of our issues. This set of three cards will feature authentic Shaolin forms that are featured in Issue #1. On the front of the card is the move in its dynamic form from actual panel art. On the back will be a step-by-step progression of the form and a introduction to the history and significance. We hope we can convey the intricacy and history of this ancient martial art. New trading cards will be issued with each issue. Collect them all.\nWould you like a piece of original art?  Yishan Li will create by hand a 6x9 fully colored and inked exclusive just for you.  Choose from one of your new Adept friends - Amy, Ali, Fa Sheng, or Sasha.  Want to see yourself in art?  No problem.  Want Yishan to do a character from ANOTHER universe?  We won't feel too hurt.  Speaking of Yishan...\nThe Sasha True Benefit Concert Package.  This is essentially our everything package. You get the book, you get the variants, and the pin and the trading cards. But also some exclusive items. We're making a poster and a t-shirt out of this fabulous depiction of Sasha by Yishan.  It\u2019ll feel just like you spent a sweaty night at a Sasha True concert...minus the kidnapping attempt from a nefarious global organization...spoiler alert.  We\u2019re only printing a limited number of posters and t-shirts and we have very big plans for Sasha, so let these items prove you were on the Sasha train from the beginning. \n Well, there is only one other way you can get closer to Sasha. Join the band. In this most exclusive of packages, we will draw your face on one of the band members for Sasha True. You got to be ok with us taking a bit of a pop rock interpretation of you, but we promise that you'll be recognizable to all the Sasha fans in your life. What\u2019s more Sasha and her band are in line to play quite a roll throughout the Adept series, and there you\u2019ll be for the full of it.  We apologize in advance: music agents can be quite the annoyance.\nOur final last most exclusive can't get it anywhere else premium-est reward.  We'll gather together Peter and Charlie and (schedules permitting) any of the other creatives for a video conference chat about the making of Adept #1.  You will have unfettered access to the creative minds behind the story as we go page-by-page through the issue reminiscing about the inspirations, choices, and kung fu that went into making The Adept.  Learn how the team translated the intricacy of Shaolin form to comic panels.  Hear about the beginning of Immortal Studios and the future of the martial arts storyverse.  Have your own questions about the biz?  Launching your own project?  We're happy to share our experience and advice.  \nWe are so grateful for this all-star lineup of incredibly talented creatives who have brought this project to life.  Allow me to gush.  (Starting with Conor Hughes, who did these sweet portraits) \n You might know Charlie Stickney from White Ash, the astoundingly successful independent comic book that started right here on Kickstarter (prob with the help of many of you). He is a writer/producer residing in Los Angeles who\u2019s been fortunate enough to work for companies including: Sony Pictures, Revolution Studios, Universal Pictures, Hulu and Scholastic Productions. He\u2019s developed and created animated shows like Cosmic Quantum Ray and Horrible Histories. While in college, Charlie interned in the editorial offices at Marvel. \n This was Tasha Huo's first big dance in the comic book world, and boy did she learn the steps and teach us some as well.  Tasha was an assistant at Universal when her spec script DARKNESS was chosen as the first project for a Warner Bros / Black List partnership.  Tasha has written for EuropaCorp, Gaumont, and Ubisoft where she adapted CHILD OF LIGHT for television.  And ooooh, if I could just utter one little word about her next movie project...  \n If someone can explain how we were able to pull Yishan Li, please end the mystery - email contact@immortal-studios.com We're bowled over by this match of style and content.  As you can see, this entire page is a paean to her style and finesse and you haven't even seen the issue-ending boss sequence.  She has worked for DC and Dark Horse (something called Duffy or maybe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, perhaps you've heard of it).  She also wields the creator pen, having summoned Sugar  for Top Cow and Paradox Girls for Image. \n Peter's vision infuses everything we do.  Peter Shiao is Founder and CEO of Immortal Studios and career-long innovator in entertainment and media ventures between East and West.  Peter spent his childhood reading Chinese Wuxia novels and took to core those transcendent martial knights.  Steeped in the sphere of politics, Peter pivoted to a new career in media as a means of expressing his mission for social transformation through stories.  He founded and built the US-China Film Summit, founded the first Hollywood-China investment fund, and produced the first US-China film co-production.  He was chosen by the Shaolin Temple to be their brand builder and has worked with Shaolin on content development.  His original idea was developed into The Adept.\nImmortal is committed to authentic depiction of Shaolin, and Gene Ching brings the authenticity.  He is a 32nd generation layman disciple of the original Shaolin Temple.  He was the publisher of Kung Fu Tai Chi, the largest newstand magazine devoted to Chinese martial arts until it ceased printing.  He is also a military Provost master at Fencing and the author of Shaolin Trips. Gene served as a weapons expert for the TV show Man at Arms: Art of War, appearing alongside Danny Trejo and Robert Rodriguez.\n Another steal from the town of White Ash, Conor Hughes translated the intricacy of Gene's choreography into layouts for the martial.  Conor's breakout work has been the popular Kickstarter comic White Ash. Previous to that he was one of the winners of the Millarworld art contest as well as being published in the Anthology Graphic Canon and Twisted Savage Dragon Funnies.\nYou can troll him on twitch at twitch.tv/conorhughes where he can often be found making comics as well as a home in Hopewell NJ, with his amazing wife and giggle monster baby girl.\nOur letterer, Gabriela Downie, was born and raised in Los Angeles, daughter to Central American immigrants, and is at the helm of diversity and inclusion in the comic book industry. Her skills range from print production, digital illustration, world-buidling development, writing, graphic design and lettering. There\u2019s not a component in comic book crafting she hasn\u2019t tackled. Her name can be seen on the shelves of every comic book store, and even listed on the New York Time\u2019s Best in Comics. Her goal is to spread the message of love, forgiveness and inclusion, for all artists, of every color, background, age or gender. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, what a moment we\u2019re in. Certainly when we started this journey, we had no inkling of what would hit us all by March. And while on the day of this writing, life begins to nudge towards normalcy, it is uncertain what the future brings. We urge all of our family \u2013 artist and vendors and you readers \u2013 to return to your own normal at your own pace. That being said, we have some really dedicated people behind us who want to see this thing breathe as much as we do. We will continue to monitor the situation and will communicate at every step of the way.\n\nOf course this is our first Kickstarter. And though we are learning a bit as we go, we couldn\u2019t have a better Kung Fu Master in Charlie. This will be Mr. Stickney\u2019s eighth Kickstarter campaign and he has been an absolute champion in teaching us all the moves. (But any mistakes are ours alone!)\nThe script is finished because Tasha is a PRO and Yishan is already well into the art. We\u2019ve got our rewards vendors lined up and Charlie has walked us straight into some of the most reliable printers in the biz.\n\nWhatever goes down, we\u2019ll keep you informed. We overcommunicate (honestly, how long have we been scrolling here?). We are available to answer questions and concerns. We want you to be with us for the long haul. We feel so strongly about what we can create together and we are poised to do what we can to earn and keep your loyalty. Really, we just see this as the beginning of loooong relationship.

We join them as they begin to unravel and push forward with a plan that they believe will allow them to live forever, free from any constraints. The key to it all is hidden in their basement...can they unlock eternal life before it's too late?\n\nAeonian 3 picks up where issue 2 left off. After learning the struggle the family is going through and their wish to live forever by any means necessary, we dive deeper into the dynamics that drive the children and the parents' relationship.
