[{"backer": "Willem van der Horst", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We were comrades, we were family.\nWe were once the heroes of this galaxy. We stood against the tide of darkness and prevailed, again and again. \nBut our family fell apart. Our shared past is full of shame,  trespasses, and secrets. We parted ways, vowing to never see each other again.\nAnd now, our greatest enemy has returned. Manipulating from the shadows, they grow stronger than ever.  No one else believes the threat is real. Only the Captain has a chance at defeating this enemy, once and for all. But the Captain can't do it alone.\nIt's time for the crew to come together again, just like old times. But will they go into the void once more? Can the crew trust the Captain again, who left disappointment and heartbreak in their wake?\nThe Last Time We Touched\n\nOur Inspirations\nOnce More Into the Void is inspired by the television show Star Trek:  Picard, and the video game Mass Effect 2.  One of the players is a  Captain who must make amends, face the consequences of the past, try to regain the loyalty of their crew, and together take on impossible odds. The rest of the players make up the crew who must learn to believe in the  Captain and in each other again or risk losing it all.  Reminisce about the past, fall in love, get in messy entanglements, and see if you can survive the final mission!\n\n\nOur Game\nOnce More Into the Void is based on the brilliant structure of MOBILE FRAME ZERO: FIREBRANDS by Meguey and Vincent Baker.  This means you don't need to prepare a plot in advance or have a Game  Moderator (GM). Instead, it is made up of mini-games, each one guiding a single dramatic scene or a small group of them. The mini-games are easy to pick up and play, players make interesting choices for their characters and follow evocative prompts while answering laser-sharp questions. Everyone collaborates to tell an emotional and heroic story together. Everything culminates in one final mission,  that may end in tragedy or triumph!\nThe game is best played across two sessions, but this new edition will feature options to play for one session, or up to four sessions! To play you only need tokens to represent the loyalty of each crew member, and a deck of playing cards that help set the scene or introduce an element of risk.\nPlayers choose from six simple playbooks to create a crew. Each playbook gives you a compelling base to start telling your story with...\n The Captain, a leader who must grapple with the burden of redemption\n The Veteran, an old timer who must prove they still have what it takes\n The Reformed, a traitor on the run from those who serve the void\n The Believer, an innocent who has always dreamed of being a hero\n The Broken, a cynic who is consumed by vengeance and pain\n The Strange, an outsider who is pure marvel, wonder, and beauty\n\nMockup of the Broken\nChoose from 9 mini-games to play, starting with the Recruitment Montage and ending with the final mission, Once More Into The Void. \nEach mini-game helps you roleplay your characters, reveal their complex emotions and desires, and drives them towards points of tension and revelation. The game is built on themes of regret, redemption, despair,  hope, loyalty, the complexity of relationships, and what it means to be a  hero. Once More Into The Void is a game that creates compelling and emotionally intense stories, that builds up to a heart-stopping climax.\n \n            The mini-games are:\n Recruitment Montage - getting the crew together\n Just Like Old Times - a battle to prove ourselves\n Only One Shot To Make It Right - a training montage\n Blowing Off Steam - a night out with the crew\n Who Do You Think You Are - a confrontation\n The Last Time We Touched - possible intimacy\n I Never Did Trust You - possible betrayal\n Only If We Have the Time, Captain - loyalty mission\n Once More Into The Void - the final mission\nMinigame - Who Do You Think You Are?\n\n\n\nOur Testimonials\nJay Dragon of Possum Creek Games, creator of Wanderhome:\n\"Nedjadi has done it again: balancing iconic characters,  high-stake scenarios, and tension so thick you could cut it with a knife with a poise and elegance that makes the whole game sing in harmony.\nOnce  More Into The Void doesn't just create characters \u2014 you will have a  found family of misfits and heroes, and by the end you'll have fallen in  love with every single one of those perfect daring foolhardy bastards.\"  \n  Logan Dwight (they/them), Co-Founder and CEO of Role (playrole.com)\n\"Once More Into the Void was my first introduction to Jammi\u2019s work, and soon also became my go-to game for introducing new players to the art of role-playing!

I still reference this game in work and conversation every week, and it serves are a consistent source of joy and inspiration.\u201d\n\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or gay/ghem), Creator of Thirsty Sword Lesbians\n\"Once More Into the Void aims for the heart in all the best ways.

Just reading Once More will make you a better RPG player and  designer.\"\n\nSherri Stewart (she/her), co-host of the Gauntlet Podcast\n\"Once More Into the Void is a familiar story that has never been told before: it's your last chance, your unstoppable foe, your fractured found family, your singular leader.

This book will contain a total of 9 illustrated mini-games. This our minimal goal to pay for all development costs and basic manufacturing.\n\n Our base goal for this project is the realistic minimum amount to pay for the development expenses for the project. Jammi has worked hard to produce this beautiful game, and we have hired some absolutely stellar artists to present the setting.  Producing the game will also result in some hefty printing and shipping fees.\nIf we reach our base goal, we will compensate Jamilla for the Design ($825), Writing ($1,650), Art  Direction ($165), Layout ($990), and playtesting ($330) for a total of $3,960. \nWe will compensate Avery for her design consultation on the project to make it the best version of itself for $210. \nWe will compensate our in-house editor, Christopher, for his editing work on the project for $825. \nReimbursement for Genesis of Legend\u2019s investment in the fantastic cover by Adrien(ne)  Valdes and two interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $1500. \nCommissioning seven additional interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $1500. \nWe will provide Jason Pitre with a nominal consideration for project management and administration on the project ($1). The standard rates for such labour are higher, but Jason has chosen to waive the additional minimum compensation for this.\nWe will allocate the remaining $6,400 for a minimal print run, and shipping by the most economical methods possible.\n\n Stretch Goal 1 - Extended Edition ($20K CAD)\nThis stretch goal will increase the number of print copies to 500 copies. It will also add three additional illustrated mini-games, bringing the total up to 12 and paying additional development costs.\nCommissioning three additional interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $650 \nAllocating $2950 towards additional printing and shipping costs.\nThe new minigames are titled:\n  Before We Lose It All - An attack on your home\n What We Once Were - A flashback\n What We Built Without You - A look at the years since\n\n\n\n Stretch Goal 2 - Legendary Edition ($25K CAD)\nThis stretch goal will increase the number of print copies to 1000 copies. This stretch goal will include additional art for the book as well as improved production values. It will also add two additional illustrated playbooks and paying additional development costs. \nCommissioning additional interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $650 \nAllocating $3,350 towards additional printing and shipping costs.\nAllocating $500 to buy all crew members copies of Mass Effect, Legendary Edition. For research purposes. \nThe new playbooks are titled:\n The Bound - a member of an ancient order who broke their code.\n The Keeper \u2013 An outsider and a companion in the Captain\u2019s life since the tragedy.\n\nStretch Goal 3 - Collector's Edition ($30K CAD)\nThe COLLECTOR'S EDITION at 30k CAD will allow us to add some additional GM resources and setting information to the book which should increase the book-length by about another signature. This will include information on a variety of different potential types of Enemy that might threaten the galaxy, some sector maps, sketches of certain facilities, and some information on iconic equipment your characters might wield. This will include more development work from Jammi and a pile of additional art from Adrian(ne) Valdes.\n\n\n Additional Funding (Over $30K CAD)\nAll funding above $30k will be temporarily used as contingency funds in case of cost overruns on other components of the project. Any funds not spent on development, manufacturing or fulfillment will be rendered to  Sword Queen Games as profit to support their future game design efforts.\nAny revenue from sales of After the War as an add-on will be provided to Genesis of Legend Publishing.\n\n\nInterviews and Actual Play\nDo you want to learn more about Once More Into The Void?

We have extensive experience with managing kickstarter projects and how to mitigate some of the risks associated with them. \n\nThe main text for ONCE MORE INTO THE VOID is complete at this point, as well as some of the illustrations for the product. If personal emergencies prevent our artists from contributing, we have backup options. Both publishers are experienced in graphic design and layout, doing the work in-house at lower risk. \n\nAt our base goal, we may use Print on Demand services (Lightning Source) to produce the books. There can occasionally be quality control issues with their services, but we will replace and substandard books produced. If we secure enough funding, we will be able to afford a proper print run with a well-regarded, professional, and experienced printer, but we have several backup options.\n\nAnything that goes through the mail system can go astray, but we will replace any missing copies at no cost. We will do our best to mitigate these risks and will do our best to work within the existing shipping budget.\n\nRunning a kickstarter campaign during the COVID Pandemic of 2021 is likely to cause unforeseen disruptions or disasters which we will try to adapt to.

Who do we listen to? Who\u2019s ignored and who pays the price? What do we care about and what do we fight for?\nThat's what Kingdom is all about. It's a game about communities and how the people in them decide what they stand for.\nI've been playing Kingdom for years, but it has never felt more timely than right now.\nWHAT'S A KINGDOM?\nA school for wayward wizards\u2026\nA revolutionary pharmaceutical company\u2026\nAn anime fan club\u2026\nThe first settlers on Mars\u2026\nThese are all examples of Kingdoms. When we sit down to play, we create a community or organization\u2014our Kingdom\u2014that ties all our characters together. It's the center of the story we are creating.\nBut the path forward may not be easy. As we play, our Kingdom will confront Crossroads, key decisions we must make to choose the course we take and what we stand for. Does our company release our new wonder-drug before it's fully tested? Do the settlers on Mars raise the flag of Earth's nations or make their own?\nAnd we may not agree what path our Kingdom should take. Can your vision of the Kingdom work with mine? Can everybody get what they want, or will our differences tear the Kingdom apart?\nKingdom requires no preparation and no GM. Read the book, then sit down (or go online) with friends and start making your story.\nPERSPECTIVE, POWER, OR TOUCHSTONE?\nKingdom is designed so that everyone at the table has a voice. Even if your game is about injustice and society falling apart, at the table I wanted every player to have the chance to contribute equally. That's one of the core design principles: no matter what happens in the fiction, in the real world the ground is level and the table is round.\nWe each get to chose our character's place in the Kingdom by picking one of three roles. Your role also determines how you influence the story as a player. Perspective understands the Kingdom and can predict the consequences of our decisions. Touchstone shows us how the other people in the Kingdom feel. And Power has authority over the Kingdom\u2014when Power gives orders, the Kingdom obeys, whether we like it or not.\nAs we confront our Crossroads, all our contributions swirl together in unpredictable ways. Does Touchstone show us everyone still wants our newspaper to publish that scathing editorial, even if Perspective warns us we'll lose sponsors? And what happens when Power doesn't listen to either of them?\nAnd instead of a neat balance of one person in each role, we can have any combination we want. Two Perspectives could disagree about the consequences of the Powers fighting for control, but no one has Touchstone so we only find out what the people really want when it's too late.\nAs our characters grow and change, they can change roles or even overthrow other characters and take their roles for themselves. Tired of everyone ignoring your dire warnings? Switch to Power and raise an angry mob to storm the castle. Speak truth and lead that revolution.\nHouse Galiana is about to go boom\nWHY DO A SECOND EDITION?\nKingdom was first released in 2013, but this is a new and entirely revised edition.\nWhy rewrite it? At its heart, Kingdom has always been fantastic. We had amazing games from the moment we started playtesting the first edition ages ago. But I don't think I did the best job putting the game down on paper the first time around. I didn't capture and distill the essence of Kingdom, which is basically my entire job as a game designer. The original version was too long, too wordy, and encumbered with extra bits and pieces that were logical but didn't really ignite the magic. And when you're sitting down at the table to play, time is precious. Wading through text eats into your fun.\nFor years I've been itching to go back and take a machete to the text until it reflected the jewel Kingdom has always been\u2014to make it easier for people to pick up and play so the fun flows more naturally. So over the last few years that's exactly what I did: I revised and played and revised and played.\nAnd I couldn't be happier with the results. This new edition has been playtested by over 90 brave souls since the start of this year, including a ton of online play, and that wealth of feedback has gone right back into making the rules hum. If you've played Kingdom before, this new version will make your games even better. And if you haven't, you'll have a much easier time picking it up and getting straight to the fun.\nThe New, New Modernist movement. We might sell out for a good book deal.\nKINGDOM, LEGACY-STYLE\nIn addition to revising all the old rules, I've added a brand new layer to the cake: Legacy Kingdom.\nLegacy turns your normal Kingdom into a whole interconnected campaign, exploring the past and future of your community to see how it changes across time. Go back to find out why your school of wizardry was really founded or leap forward and see how it has survived after the warlord has conquered the land. You play each chapter like a stand-alone game of Kingdom with a different cast of characters, but each is connected to what you already know about all the other eras of your Kingdom, creating a rich expanding world.\nWhen I first made Legacy, I figured it would be a neat way to keep digging into a Kingdom I enjoyed. What I did not expect was that it would be so good it would lead to the longest running GMless game I have ever played\u201427 sessions so far and going strong. It is surprisingly fun.\nCretaceous Kingdom theme park. Now with authentic bitey dinosaurs.\nFROM POLITICAL PARTIES TO PETTING ZOOS\n\"Can I just make a fun Kingdom? I do not need more doom and gloom right now.\"\nWhy, yes, you can. Another one of my goals is always making games that you can play over and over again and use to tell a lot of different stories. Kingdom is always about a community, but you have huge latitude about the kind of community you make and the kind of decisions it faces.\nYou can play intense and serious games with knives-out scheming and regicide, but you can also make Kingdoms that are about romance, teen drama, or hilarious hijinks. We've played slacker lifeguards at a community pool, pizza delivery drivers fronting for mad scientists, and toy-making elves going on strike because Santa doesn't love them anymore.\nPizza Delivery Kingdom. So delicious you'd swear it was a laboratory experiment!\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nHi, I'm Ben Robbins. I designed Microscope, Follow, Union, and of course Kingdom. Long before that I created the West Marches campaign to give my players more say about what happened at the table.\nOne of the sharpest influences on my thinking about game design grew out of running Story Games Seattle for eight years. Sitting down with total strangers every week at a public event and teaching them to play games they've never tried before shows you a lot about what makes the fun flow. I would not be where I am now without all the hundreds of people I've gamed with across the years.\nNow I try to make games that share what I've learned.\nAnd see that fantastic cover art? That's the work of Al Lukehart (www.lukehartstudio.com), who did the lovely art for Follow, and also plays a great game of Kingdom.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's 2020, so of course only a fool would try to launch a project, but here I am.\n\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter, so by definition it is not my first rodeo.

It\u2019s the nexus of all the \u2019verse, where eternal planes and infinite primes meet. It\u2019s a rough home for cutters and bashers, hungry for coin and glory. It\u2019s a battlefield between the city factions as they fight over territory. It\u2019s a city of gods, demons, and stranger things which lurk. No wonder that scoundrels and freebooters flock to the Nexus of the verse.\nIn the City of Blades, you will play Freebooters who work for one of the minor political factions of Sig. You will help your faction rise the ranks, seize territory, and get ridiculously wealthy so you can retire in luxury.\nIn the City of Blades, you might:\nEliminate a couple of troublesome Enforcers who are causing trouble in your neighbourhood.\nSteal important ritual object from the Goddess of Rivers and Sacrifice to weaken her hold over the docks.\nConvince the Dustkeepers to help you steal the territory currently held by the League of Exterminators.\nNegotiate an alliance with a community of irate refugees who just arrived in the city.\nThis is a game about clever spies, renegade sorcerers and reckless smugglers. You are going to get rich or die trying, so let\u2019s get started.\nSig is a city of contrasts and strange bedfellows. This setting was originally presented in Sig: Manual of the Primes by Genesis of Legend Publishing. The system used is derived from Blades in the Dark, published by Evil Hat Productions. These two elements come together to form Sig: City of Blades.\nThis game is Forged in the Dark, designed to enable bold heists and backstabbing faction politics. Of course, any game set in the nexus of the verse is bound to have a few changes to the rules. Here are a few of the newest elements.\n\nModular Characters\nSig: City of Blades has modular characters, with each Freebooter consisting Culture, Lineage, and Devotion. Culture reflects your Freebooter\u2019s identity and upbringing. Lineage represents your family that shapes your prowess, whether it be by blood, ichor, adoption, or choice. Your Devotion represents your character\u2019s religious obligations and/or faith in one of the immortal Powers of the City of Blades. Each of these provides a pair of potential Advances to choose from, ratings in four Actions, and a Drive (which you can use to reduce stress).\nA sample character sheet of Phentan the Unifier (Draft)\nSample Faction Sheet: Daughters of the Raven\n\n\nThe Map of Sig\nThe city itself has an important role in the game. The game comes with a map of the city which is divided up into 48 distinct pieces of territory which function as claims. Every claim is controlled and defended by one of the many factions of the city, who maintain their position (Tier) and gain benefits associated with them. As Freebooters, your mission is to \u201cliberate\u201d claims from your rival factions though audacious heists and subtle schemes. If you want a workshop, you better seize one from someone else!\nLiving with Consequences\nEnemy actions, bad circumstances, Planar Bargains, or the outcome of a roll can inflict consequences on a PC. Consequences may be minor, moderate, or major in severity, leading to different impacts on the Freebooter\u2019s initiatives. As characters suffer stress, they also expose themselves to more severe consequences based on the GM\u2019s discretion and the fiction.\nMinor: A stumble, unwanted attention, an expense, or a minor injury.\nModerate: entrapment, a curse, collateral damage, or a moderate injury\nMajor: Betrayal by someone you trusted, duress, imprisonment, or a life-threatening major injury.\n\nEvery player portrays a Freebooter; a scoundrel and adventurer who lives in Sig.

We are bringing this project to kickstarter to raise funds to cover off these development costs and support a proper print run of 6\"x9\" full-colour, hardcover books for you to enjoy.\n\n\n\n\nAt $10,000 CAD, we reach our base goal. This will cover us to cover the existing development costs for the book. This will enable us to produce digital copies of the book. We will also use Print on Demand services to print and ship hardcover copies to backers.\n\n\nAt $15,000 CAD, we will commission more art! Alex Louise Hill will illustrate over a dozen inhabitants of the City of Blades to grace our pages. Take a look at one such citizen of Sig, one of the Waterborn!\nPhentan the Unifier, a weary Riverborn labourer with secrets to hide.\n\nAt $20,000 CAD, we will have enough funds and demand to support an offset print run of the book by our friends at Bang Printing. This will give us higher quality and greater quality physical copies. This will also unlock discounted physical copies for those suffering economic hardship. \nAt $25,000 CAD, we will commission a set of missions for your Freebooters to perform. Quinn Murphy will be the writer and designer behind these new jobs and I am eager to see what he will come up with.\nAt $30,000 CAD, we will create two additional playable crews who represent the Recyclers Cooperative and the Portalsmiths respectively. This will bring us up to a total of five playable factions.\nAt $35,000 CAD, we will commission a four-episode limited series Actual Play podcast of the game. Jeff Stormer, of the Party of One Podcast series designer of Mission: Accomplished!, will coordinate these sessions and show the game off to the world.\n\nBudgeting in tabletop roleplaying games is fraught with difficulty and discourse. We are sharing our preliminary budget in the interest of transparency and a conviction that creatives deserve to be paid for their labour. All of our compensation is derived from the minimum wage of the publisher\u2019s jurisdiction, which is $12.50 CAD, or about $8 USD per hour. Contributors all receive at least this amount.\nCurrent Project Budget\nAll of our internal contributors receive compensation at that rate, which is equivalent to a per-word writing rate of 8 cents per word. Our total internal expenses are $4,480 representing 14 days of writing work (Jason), 10 days of development (Jason), 10 days of Layout (Jason), and 10 days of editing (Christopher).\nAll of our external contractors receive compensation at 150% that rate, which is equivalent to a per-word writing rate of 12 cents per word. The total external contractor amount is $3,520 This includes 10 days of cover illustration (Juan), 10 days of internal illustration (Juan), and 2 days of design consultation (Avery)\nOur base goal also includes a printing and shipping budget of $1,000 CAD based on the minimal print numbers to reach those goals. This base goal also includes budgeted kickstarter fees of $1,000 CAD. If we reach our stretch goals, we will be allocating more money towards internal illustration (Alex), Printing/Shipping, writing/development of missions (Quinn), and a podcast AP (Jeff).\nWe are keeping this campaign simple, with only five reward tiers for you to consider.\n$1: Retailers and Merchants: Back at this level to get notified when the product is available for purchase, and to receive a complimentary PDF of the game along with all other backers.\n$5: HIVE: Community Copy:  Individuals suffering from economic hardship or other forms of marginalization can back at this level to get the game in PDF and ebook formats at a significantly reduced price.\n$15: PRIME WORLD: Community Copy:  Individuals suffering from economic hardship or other forms of marginalization can back at this level to get the game in print, PDF, and ebook formats at a significantly reduced price.\n$25: TETHERWARD: Standard Digital:   Backing at this level will get you the full digital version of the game in PDF and ebook formats.\n$50: RIVERWARD: Standard Print & PDF: Backing at this level will get the full digital version in PDF and ebook formats, as well as a professionally printed, full-colour, hardcover book.\n$75: ETERNAL PLANES: Generous Print & PDF: Backing at this level will get the full digital version in PDF and ebook formats, as well as a professionally printed, full-colour, hardcover book.

She has been creating table-top RPG content for over a decade and currently manages the Happy Jacks RPG network of streams and podcasts After playing and GMing dozens of systems, she developed a fondness for TTRPG systems that included collaborative world and backstory development. That fondness gave her the idea for a system-agnostic game that could add these elements to any RPG system. Thus, was born Decuma. When she is not playing, writing or talking about TTRPGs, she can often be found creating costumes and dressing up as Wonder Woman.

Formed in 2018, the owner Kimi Hughes, wanted to create games and roleplaying tools that empower players and excite the imagination. \nIn 2019, GLG released its first game, Virgins & Vixens, an RPG about breaking the tropes of women in fairy tales. It received critical praise and was the top-selling physical game on itch.io from May 19th - June 1st, 2019.  \nAlthough Virgins & Vixens was released first, Decuma was actually the idea that launched Golden Lasso Games. It's slow growth from a funky idea and some scribbled notes, to a cheap tarot deck with question stickers on them, and finally to a beta-test document and some prototype cards was a long one, but it paid off!\nIn addition to the amazing team of women listed above, Golden Lasso Games would like to thank: Sam Balcomb, Element Mill, Jason Mills, Stu Venable, Kairaku, Foundry 58, Story Games Glendale, Strategicon Conventions, the entire Happy Jacks RPG community, Mel Caylo, Jennifer Kretchmer, Moe Poplar, Clara Allison, Laurie Goldfarb and everyone who has played in games and provided feedback along the way! This couldn't have happened without you!\nFind Golden Lasso Games online:\ngoldenlassogames.com\n Facebook \nItch.io\nWhere is the money going?\n  The majority of our funds are going to two things: paying our artist to do these amazing cards one-by-one and physical production. Each card takes several hours of work and we are dedicated to paying our artist a fair wage. The remainder of the funds are going to pay Kickstarter's fee, paying the rest of the Golden Lasso Games team, and all the rewards for backers.\nHow long will this take?\nWe are estimating that the completed deck will be delivered by the end of 2020. The exact production time is hard to estimate until we know how many of the stretch goals get unlocked. Drawing 78 individual cards takes a bit more time than drawing a more basic deck.\nDigital rewards will be sent to backers sooner than the physical rewards.\nShipping Info:\nShipping costs will be charged after the Kickstarter ends in the pledge manager. Damage may occur during transit by the various shipping carriers used. We wish this was not the case, but it can happen. We are a small business that relies on shipping companies to fill our Kickstarter campaigns.\nPLEASE email us if you have major issues with delivery/loss/damage that cannot be resolved with the carrier (i.e. always try your local post office first) and we will help assist you in resolving them. We will need your backer number, a photo of the damaged item, address and backer name in the email. We request the opportunity to make things right before you give us a negative review. \nThere are many advantages to using a Pledge Manager, such as late add-ons, the ability to change your address as much as you like until we lock them, and a more accurate cost for you, the backer, on delivery costs. \nWe are partnering with CrowdOx for our pledge manager and shipping. \nCrowdOx is our partner for pledge management and add-ons!\nKickstarter Terms:\nThe following Terms are accepted by you, the backer, when you pledge, so we can ensure smooth delivery for all. Surveys not filled in after 2 months of final delivery (from the \"we are shipping\" update) or missing reward requests after 2 months of your game shipment will be treated as a no reward pledge. Please help us get you your rewards by emailing us with any issues you may have and filling in your survey in a timely manner! Watch for updates on all shipping statuses. All our major communications will be via Updates. \nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look of the project and the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the possibility of a general release copy. We will always do our best to provide exactly what was pictured, but sometimes small details change or a design is removed and replaced with another, etc. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- This is the first Kickstarter project by Golden Lasso Games.\n\nWhile the Decuma team collectively have been involved with many successful Kickstarters, this is our first under the banner of Golden Lasso Games. We have carefully planned out every aspect of this project to ensure that we are able to create a high quality product and fulfill our obligations on time.\n\n- Partnering with an outside company for production.\n\nWe are working with a well-known and trusted company in the manufacturing industry to print our card decks. They have a long record of high quality work and produce goods for a number of large-scale retailers. However, things sometimes happen that cause delays or disruptions. We have confirmed production cost breakdowns with this company, set timelines that give some padding to ensure that we are able to get the product shipped in a timely fashion. \n\n- We are human.\n\nGiving our incredible artist, Samantha, the necessary time to create dozens of individual card designs is large part of the project timeline for Decuma. She is an industry professional with many impressive credits to her name working for companies such as Blizzard, DC Comics, and more, so she is very skilled at project management. However, despite rumors to the contrary, Samantha is not a robot. Even with an expertly planned development schedule things can happen that may delay her work. \n\nIf something happens and Samantha is unable to complete the artwork for this project, we have another artist on standby to take over.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PDF & Digital Thank You", "descp": "At this level you will receive a PDF version of Decuma, which you can use with any traditional deck of tarot cards.

Event details are here.\nWhy this strategy book now?\nHi, my name is Mark Pollard (Instagram, Twitter, website). \nI\u2019ve spent over two decades trying to understand people. \nI\u2019ve conducted research for product launches and I\u2019ve interviewed some of the world\u2019s best underground rappers for my old magazine Stealth. \nI\u2019ve worked on strategy for websites and I\u2019ve written brand strategies and creative briefs for brands in Sydney and New York. \nI host the Sweathead community of over 7,000 strategists on Facebook and I\u2019ve interviewed over 150 working strategists and marketers for the Sweathead podcast. \nI\u2019ve written for Vice, Quartz, and the Wharton Future of Advertising Program. I\u2019ve spoken at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity. And I\u2019ve run strategy training sessions in over 25 cities around the world. \nHaving done all of these things, here\u2019s what I believe:\nStrategy (or account planning) is a compelling and challenging profession.\nYou don\u2019t need to have \u201cstrategy\u201d in your job title to do it well.\nYou need to practice to get good at it.\nStrategy gets lost when it takes itself too seriously and dresses itself in fancy words.\nThe advertising world has lost its focus and is selling what it can rather than what it needs to, and strategy done well can address this issue.\nStrategy skills are life skills and all strategy careers need time to focus on themselves because many strategists can live a vicarious existence hoping their thinking affects someone else\u2019s thinking and for that thinking to get approved and to end up in public.\n  Strategy is Your Words - Cover and spine\nWhat this book is\nStrategy Is Your Words is a book about focus. \nThis first edition - which will be beautifully printed, 400 pages, 80,000 words, 6\u201dx9\u201d, and hardcover - wants to land on desks in offices everywhere. It wants to help you help your teams understand each other and get back to why you exist: to do incredible work.\nIt\u2019s 99% written - I\u2019ve finished my fifth edit (shoutouts to my editor Lauren Wilson). It\u2019s 95% designed - my friends at April77 in Sydney and I have a little more work to do. The design is minimal but, where the design is most apparent, you\u2019ll see the book travel from unfocused to focused, like a strategist doing strategy.\nThe book will go to print within days of the Kickstarter ending.\nI don\u2019t believe in the idea that business books are business cards. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t written a business book. Call me fancy, but I\u2019ve tried to write a literary art book, which is to say I\u2019ve tried to write a primal scream and to mix this scream with absurdist metaphors and utterly practical techniques.\nI also believe that we need to create new ways of living, ways of living that are closer to our truths. That\u2019s why I am publishing this book myself. I want direct contact with my readers and I don\u2019t want to hand over the fate of this book to someone who hasn\u2019t spent years with it. I want to take responsibility for it. Responsibility is the way.\nWhat this book contains\nThe first half of the book addresses the words strategists use in their heads. Words like \u201cclarity\u201d, \u201clone wolf\u201d, \u201cimpostor\u201d, \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cmeaning\u201d, \u201crejection\u201d, \u201cempathy\u201d, \u201cart\u201d, \u201copinions\u201d, and \u201cpatience\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to channel hundreds of experiences and conversations with strategists into these pages in a way where some people who\u2019ve read them have said, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re in my mind right now.\u201d Good. I want this book to feel like it\u2019s reading you as much as you\u2019re reading it.\nInsights Are Survival\nThe second half of the book compiles my go-to techniques for doing strategy. These are techniques I\u2019ve cobbled together and developed under extreme pressure to pitch in a day, respond to a brief in an hour, or run a workshop with no advanced notice.\nQuestions the book attempts to answer include:\nWhat is strategy?\nWhat is an idea?\nWhat kinds of ideas do we have in advertising?\nWhat makes ideas difficult?\nHow are the ideas of a strategist different to the ideas of a creative department?\nWhat is an insight?\nHow can you write an insight?\nWhat are useful problems to solve?\nHow do you articulate what makes a brand compelling?\nHow do you write an inspiring creative brief? (Hmm maybe \"inspiring\" isn't the word)\nHow can I write strategy? (Hint: there are at least 11 ways)\n   You can read the introduction here. You can listen to the introduction here:\nProblems Are Worth Having\nThere are tens of exercises suitable for individual work or for your next workshop. They build around The Four Points, which is this diagram:\nThe Four Points\nThis book is not for the dogmatic. Its voice is sharp but it speaks from a place of love. And, as I focus the rest of my life on helping people who think for a living live, I\u2019d love your support to get this book onto desks and into brains around the world.\nI am aiming to raise $15,000 to help me print the first edition and cover most of the costs to date.\nThe rewards - USA launch\nI\u2019ve tried to keep the rewards straight-forward.

By raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production. Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.\u201d\n--MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n10 Workers United is a tabletop roleplaying game that explores the power of solidarity for equitable livelihood. The game requires 4-6 players, one of whom plays the role of The Company and the others who play the role of The Workers.\nThe Company will create the details of the work, its environment, and its purpose in being. The Workers will define their unique skill and what drives them to a breaking point.\nThe game is played out over 10 scenes that are uniquely framed. During the scene Workers will Move to Have a Seat at the Table and when successful earn more power. By the end of the game, The Workers have organized all of the negotiation power they need and the game ends as they present Grievances.\n#RecognizeKSRU\n I want to express my support for Kickstarter staff, who are working to form a union. The success of this and so many Kickstarter projects is due in part to the hard work of the company\u2019s employees, and I believe in their right to unionize.\nAt this time, union organizers are not calling for a boycott. Instead, they\u2019re asking supporters to raise their voices and make our solidarity known. Here\u2019s how we can help:\nemail Kickstarter\u2019s senior leadership:\nkickstarter-sot[at]kickstarterunited.org\npost your support using #RecognizeKSRU\npost a picture showing your solidarity and tag @ksr_united\ndownload a version of our logo to use as your icon on Kickstarter, Twitter, and anywhere else\nback projects that show solidarity with Kickstarter United\nhave another idea? get in touch!\nI call on Kickstarter\u2019s senior leadership to recognize the union now, and I hope you\u2019ll join me.\nSolidarity forever \ud83e\udd1d\nGame System\n10 Workers United is heavily inspired by Ten Candles by Stephen Dewey at Cavalry Games. Those familiar with Ten Candles will find it familiar, however, the mechanics work in reverse. Player Characters begin with no hope, but then end the game with all of the dice. Those that have never played will easily be able to pick it up and play.\nThe game is facilitated by The Company who, in the beginning, has all ten of the dice. Following the initial scene,  The Workers will frame and then play out scenes in the workplace and whenever they run into conflict with The Company, they roll to Have a Seat at the Table. When they succeed (by rolling a 6 on one of their dice), The Workers get an additional die from The Company. By the end of the game, they hold all ten of the dice.\nThere are ways for both The Company and The Workers to manipulate successes throughout the game.\n The Company can use The Charter and Job Descriptions to decrease the chance for successes by The Workers\n   The Workers can use Skills or their Breaking Point to negate The Company or to increase their chance for success\n The Workers can use Solidarity to increase another player's chance for success\nIn general, 10 Workers United is a story game and relies a lot upon the players to create the scenes and actively exchanges narrative control between the players.\nGame Production\n10 Workers United is already written and ready to go. This small Kickstarter will allow me to add some art and finish a layout--and, of course, will fund distribution. It is a small twenty-page game but is packed with a powerful and memorable experience. Built on a tried-and-true chassis, it is ready to go out of the box.\nAll backers (even at the $1 level) will receive the unedited advance draft with no layout or art. I'll need a month to get all the systems in place, and then I'll distribute through my website. The game will be distributed through Itch.io and DriveThru RPG, but I'm handling fulfillment directly with LightningSource.\nWhy This Game\nAs our society has increasingly swung in favor of corporations and private interest at the expense of personal freedom and wellbeing, I think it is more critical than ever to use art as a way to meaningfully connect with the issues, by developing empathy, so that we can make a systemic change from within.\nI love me some fantasy RPG--and I like to chuck dice with the rest of them. However, games can do more than only entertain. They can help us connect with issues larger than ourselves. I hope that 10 United Workers is a timely and thoughtful exploration of some of the many issues we are confronting in our time.\nAbout Christopher Grey\nI am a tabletop roleplaying game designer, publisher, author, and marketer.

This is the story of a community caught up in a sudden revolution, their messy personal lives and their attempts to create a utopia in the face of impending death. How far would you go for what you believe in? Would you stand firm even if it meant your death?  \nRed Carnations on a Black Grave is a freeform roleplaying game for 4-6 players that brings to life the 72 tumultuous days of the Paris Commune.  A game is playable in a single session of four hours or less. Each player portrays two characters during the two months of the Commune, one of whom must die during the French Army's all-out assault on Paris in the last week of May, 1871. Special cards guide your play, providing questions about how the characters are related to each other, historical incidents to serve as the basis of scenes in the game, and the ultimate fate of your surviving characters. \nThis game was made for people who love Paris, history, revolutions, and resistance, or tragic roleplaying games like Montsegur 1244 and Ten Candles. Help us spread the word of the revolution! \nEach player selects two characters to play. The available characters include historical figures such as the schoolteacher and revolutionary Louise Michel or Jos\u00e9phine Marchais, a washerwoman who was accused of arson during the chaotic attack by the Army. The characters are diverse and include Dominique Rousseau, an Afro-Carribean physician from Martinique and Tariq Tannoudji, an Algerian cavalryman who fought with the French army.\nBrief passages read by each player and Inspiration cards (many of which were based on actual posters) bring the history of the Commune to life. \nExamples of the cards used in the game\nA game of Red Carnations consists of three rounds of scenes during which each player frames at least one scene. Each round has its own mood which helps focus play on the more and more desperate situation of the Paris Commune, until the third round--The Bloody Week--results in the death of one of each player's characters.\nAfter the Bloody Week, each player must choose a possible fate for their surviving character--to Attempt Escape by fleeing in the confusion, to Cooperate with the authorities and hope for a lesser sentence, or to Remain Defiant and face their harshest punishment. No matter what is chosen there is no guarantee that fickle fate will give the character what they desire.   \nYou can listen to an actual play with Catherine and the fine cast of One Shot podcast starting with this episode.\nCatherine joined Senda, Andi, and River to play Red Carnations on a Black Grave on the She's a Super Geek podcast.\nCatherine  joined Alex Roberts to discuss the Paris Commune and Red Carnations on a Black Grave in this episode of Backstory.\nAngel Garcia interviewed Catherine on this episode of Story Always on the Hijos del Rol Youtube channel. \nThis episode of the Gauntlet Podcast includes a segment about Red Carnations and some other great talk about games.\nThe Paris Commune (March 18-May 28, 1871) was the last great revolution of the nineteenth century. The Commune was a decentralized and radically democratic government controlled by the workers of the city. Among the reforms it pursued were the separation of church and state, free education to both boys and girls, abolition of the standing army, debt relief, the creation of workers' cooperatives, and attempts to reduce inequality in all aspects of life. Women had an unusually loud voice in all of the Commune's affairs, including fighting from the city's defenses.\nThe Commune united (sometimes uneasily) anarchist, socialist, and communist revolutionaries under its plain red flag. Emerging from the disastrous defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), it offered a new vision of true social revolution for all of Europe. The government of the nascent French Republic, from its temporary capital in Versailles, assembled an army and unleashed it on Paris. Between 10,000 and 30,000 citizens died at the hands of their own people during the last week of May, 1871; another 40,000 would be arrested and sent to prison or deported to the colonies.\nThe Commune's legacy continued to inspire revolutionaries in the decades to come, including Lenin and many of the revolutionaries during the era of decolonization. \nThis game emerged from my love of history and of the city of Paris, plus my own deep interest in revolutionary movements throughout time. The game itself was influenced and inspired by some of the great early Indie story games such as Montsegur 1244 and Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne. I was also inspired by Mary and Bryan Talbot's fine graphic novel The Red Virgin and the Vision of Utopia and Mike Duncan's superb Revolutions podcast (which has an excellent series on the Paris Commune). The works of the members of the Commune themselves also inspired me, especially Louise Michel's own autobiography and memoirs of the Commune.  \nCare is being taken to provide the best possible components for the game. This include a book that contains both the game's rules and historical background for the era and the Commune in particular; five decks of full color poker-sized cards with original art by Juan Ochoa and tarot-sized cards for each of the characters in the game. PDFs of the reference sheets will be available for free download. \n A copy of the rules in a 6\" x 9\" perfect bound book\n12 Tarot-sized character cards\n80 Poker-sized cards for the different decks used in the game\nWe anticipate $10 shipping to the United States and $15 shipping world wide. \n We successfully funded! Thank you to everyone who has backed so far! \nWe've been able to hit some amazing stretch goals so far: six new optional historical characters, color art, and expanded history of the Commune to add more depth to your games.\nOur final stretch goal is now up: a Live Action Roleplaying adaptation of Red Carnations on a Black Grave! Larpwright Susanne Vejdemo will be working with me on bringing the experience of the Commune to life in a short LARP! We had an initial brainstorming session about the adaptation this weekend and I am very excited about this project!\n\"A story game about the Paris Commune, inspired by Montsegur 1244! This is the most excited I've been to hear about a new game in development in a very long time.\"\nAvery Alder, author of Monsterhearts, The Quiet Year, and Dream Askew\n\"I've played this game and it delivers on its premise. If you like sad history and dying alone, Red Carnations on a Black Grave will make you very happy and then destroy you.\"\nJason Morningstar, author of Fiasco, Grey Ranks, and Night Witches\n\"Red Carnations on a Black Grave is a game full of drama, tension, and heartbreak. It is an amazing look at a very small slice of history. The characters are flawed in wonderful ways that make them believable, human, and a joy to play. The overall story is one of tragedy, but you can't help but to be hopeful for them at the start and mourn their fate at the end.\"\nPhil Vecchione, Misdirected Mark podcast and author of Hydro Hackers\n\"I played two of Catherine's games and that is all it took to fall in love with her design. Her games are amongst my favorites examples of gaming as journalism, anchoring their rules and lore in a specific time and place and making you feel this slice of our world. Be it the crossdressing subculture of the 90s or the Paris Commune. These well researched games combine a sense of history with an emotional truth, I would want from great TV series or articles about these slices of time. They are one-shots that make you feel like you want to spend more time with your characters and the world. But they drive towards the inevitable conclusion, that is out of your hands.\n\"Red Carnations on a Black Grave does not depict the glorious revolution or the fantasy of heroism that single handedly changes the world, but shows the real life heroism of revolutionaries in a doomed attempt to do so. It allows for genuine sadness and made me relate like few other games did.\"\nJasmin Neitzel, Community Manager for Ulisses Spiele, author for The Dark Eye and Itras By\n\"Red Carnations is a triumph of historically and emotionally intelligent design. I recommend this game to everyone who cares about marginalized communities and political resistance.\"\nLucian Kahn, designer of Visigoths vs. Mall Goths & Dead Friend: A Game of Necromancy \nCatherine Ramen (Lead Designer) has been playing role-playing games for almost four decades.

Most of the budget has been allocated to making sure that the creative people involved have been paid a living wage for their work, and for bringing the highest possible quality to the printing of the game components.\n\nIn any project such as this unexpected and unforeseen delays may occur during the printing process but backers will be kept up to date about any issues during any unforeseen delay.

It\u2019s a true multicultural hub, made up of thousands of points of interest, a multitude of strange delights and vibrant people. Ancient pubs sit in the shadows of towering skyscrapers. Long-forgotten paths open up into new avenues. History peeks out from behind every rooftop, daring you to become a part of London's legend.\nThe London Masters Guide is the world\u2019s first tour book that blends real-life travel with the magical genre of fantasy.\nThe book is an essential guide to one of the world\u2019s most storied cities, filled with curious attractions, macabre history, and legendary destinations. But this isn\u2019t your regular travel book. It\u2019s full of original artwork that brings London to life through the lens of fantasy and is written in a way that makes your upcoming trip a part of the city's history.\nThe London Masters Guide serves to inspire your imagination, fuel your wanderlust and give you all the tools that you need to plan your very own adventure. \nCome intrepid adventurer! There are many sights to see!\nDo you slay dragons in your spare time? Do you travel off the beaten path, searching for adventure? None of the above but fancy a sweet new travel book?\nThen this is the book for you. It\u2019s a tour guide written FOR nerds - BY nerds.  \nTaking inspiration from all things nerdy, the London Masters Guide is a multi-verse mashup of epic proportions. Chock full of familiar fantasy tropes, each page will be bursting with pop-culture references and irreverent humour that will make your upcoming trip a quest to remember.\nInstead of a dreary and uninspiring list that drags you from A to B, the London Masters Guide will be your very own yellow brick road, guiding you through the city whilst adding a dash of magic along the way. Full of recommendations, geographical guidance, hidden city knowledge and dry humour, it will make travelling through the city a journey to remember!\nThis book will be split into FIVE main sections:\nThese are the five sections of knowledge around which that the London Masters Guide will be built. However, like all good adventures, we may stray off the path from time to time...\nAs well as being your one-stop-shop for all-things-interesting-and-nerdy within the city, the book will feature something that you don\u2019t see in your regular tour book \u2013 original fantasy artwork. \nThe London Masters guide will be full of beautifully realised fantasy art that will surprise and delight you at each turn of the page. This unique artwork will be a genre-bending-fusion of real-life destinations and the wonderful genre of fantasy like you\u2019ve never seen before. Full page spreads will depict scenes and locations from the city\u2019s history with a twist - blending the modern with the magical.  \nThis artwork will be crafted by fantasy character artist, Stephen Nickel who will be putting pen to paper and working his wizardry into every page.\nImagine the city of London brought to life in glorious fantasy art like this...\n...Imagine. Events from London's historic past given a little fantasy twist...\n...Imagine. Iconic London landscapes transformed into a living and breathing fantasy diorama....\n\u2026Imagine. Real-life locations given a fantasy makeover\u2026\n..Imagine. Heroes and villains of London\u2019s past and present, brought to life in glorious fantasy technicolour\u2026\n...Imagine. London like you've never seen before.\nWhat is a city without its tourists? The London Masters Guide will play host to a diverse cast of fantasy characters as they run amok through the streets of London. These sketches will be skillfully brought to life by our illustrator Conor who, through his vivid line based style, will populate this tour book with a vibrant personality.\nImagine barbarians at Baker Street, trolls under Tower Bridge and witches in Westminster. They'll be joined by famous heroes and villains of London's past, present and future.\nThese character sketches are just a few examples of what the character design will look like throughout the London Masters Guide.\nThey'll be present throughout the book and will sit alongside the narrative within.\nThe London Masters Guide will be an a5 \u201c5.8 x 8.3\u201d softcover book, printed in premium colour and paper quality so that the pages come to life. As the guide is an art and information book hybrid, it\u2019s super important that the quality and feel of the book is the very best it can be.\n\nPROOF OF CONCEPT.\nBelow are a few pages of the original London Masters Guide prototype. These are included to give you an idea of how the final book will be presented and the content within. These pages are in no way the finished article and should be viewed as an example only. The finished product will have it's own visual identity and layout that substantially differs from the examples below.\nAs mentioned above, the images below are just a proof of concept to show you a rough idea of how the London Masters Guide will look and the writing style it will be based upon.\nWill you travel to the temple of the Cybergoth?\nOr to planets forbidden?\nDo you know nothing? Well, now you don't.\nBe wary. Ghosts haunt these pages.\nOne of the main drivers of this Kickstarter is to raise money for our talented artists. Being able to see the vivid streets of London, transformed into full fantasy insanity is vital to the project. The funding goal represents the minimum needed for this to happen.\nMost of the funding raised will be going into the production of the London Masters Guide. The book needs to be as awesome as it can be, and we as a team need to give it the love, thought and attention it needs to truly sing. We'll be hitting the ground running and throwing ourselves into production as soon as the campaign is funded. London is a big place with a rich and vivid history and she demands that we do her justice. \nWe want this to be something that our team and all that support us are proud of.\nWe're excited to offer a set of campaign only perks that will let you become a part of the London Masters Guide story. We've set it up this way so the majority of our funding goes on creating the book so it's the best bloody travel book you've ever seen. However, we've got a whole bunch of legendary items that would be fit for any adventuring party.\nFurther details of all rewards will become available once the campaign is funded. Rest assured they will be of the highest quality and standard.\nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means each time we unlock a new campaign stretch goal, the London Masters Guide is only going to keep getting EVEN MORE EPIC!\nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates as to how the London Masters Guide is coming along, receive some pretty sweet rewards, and be the first to know when this one of kind travel tome is released into the wild.\nSHARE with your friends and family (and anyone you know who might like a book like this).

As well as the character work, he's drawn book covers, adventure module covers and play mats.

We have been preparing for this confrontation, but we must not neglect our instincts in this battle. Let us get to know each other and rediscover each other after all these years. Tonight, let\u2019s share our experiences so that tomorrow those who will survive can tell the stories of those who will succumb.\u201d  \nRead the FAQ here. \nFacing the Titan is a GM-less roleplaying game in which you\u2019ll play as the Companions, the ones who will face the Titan that reigns over the world. It\u2019s a story-game set for one-shot games. Each game will feature a different cast of Companions, a different Titan, a different Setting. This game is a discussion, and as the Companions, you will recall your journey before facing the Titan.\nFacing the Titan is not a game of tactical combat. It doesn\u2019t feature a riddle to solve in order to win the fight. It\u2019s a game to tell the stories of the Companions and the Titan. And the epic fight that will ensue. The Companions are set to win this fight, but at what cost, with what consequences?\nFacing the Titan will be released as a PDF and as a Print-on-Demand softcover book. The book will feature the rules for running the game, advice on how to play the game and six Titans. Each one of the six Titans will be illustrated by Roger Heal and will be included in a micro-setting, ready to play. The book will be around 160 pages, in a 6''x9'' format.\nFacing the Titan is a game Descended from Monkeydome, and share some rules and principles with Monkeydome, by Epidiah Ravachol, as well as with other games that followed it: Swords Without Master, Sorceress Bloody Sorceress, With Great Power, Invisible Empire. Other games that inspired me to create this game are Fiasco, Protocol, Death of Legends, Summer Camp.\nWant to know more about the game?\n Read the current draft of the game rules \nA preview of Vamakaskan, the Beast of Origins and its associated Setting\nA Warm-up Workshop that will help you understand how Motifs work\nWhat did I learn from the playtests ?\nAn overview of the first physical proof of the softcover book\nAnd many more informations on the official blog \n\n\nKickstarting this project allows me to purchase the art and cover by Roger Heal.

I\u2019m 35 years old, and been in RPG since I\u2019ve discovered Hero Quest and the Fighting Fantasy books at the age of 12.\nOutside games, I like to watch sports, have been a soccer player for 20 years and a fan of Liverpool since almost ever. I like to read fiction and sports/explorer biographies. Also a big comic book reader. I like being outside, walking in the nature. I enjoy good beers (IPA, Stouts, Crafts\u2026).\nI always created stuff for the RPG I played (and for other games too). During the last years, I started releasing translations (in French) of story games and micro-RPGs. I also started to work on my own stuff, like Fiasco playsets, Monster of the Week mysteries, and one-page RPG (Gangs of Mutants of New York, Crime Scene Investigators, You are all Duncan!). I also joined RPG-Creation contests (Game Chef, French ThreeForged Challenge, 200-Word RPG\u2026).\nFacing the Titan is my first attempt to get a full RPG in a neat book and PDF.

Each additional Titan added to the game will be illustrated. Roger proved to be able to make awesome Titans in schedule by the past.\n\nThe layout of the book is already in the work. The main templates are done and already used in the promotional material. Some parts are already done, and this is a work that will be continued during the campaign.\n\nI already made a physical proof of the book to try out the DriveThruRPG process of printing. I know what I need to care for and what needs to be corrected.\n\nSome stretch goals are already planned and partially written. It will save time to have them included in the book. I have a list of Stretch Goals ready to be added to the book, and other ideas if we go very well. In this case, I will plan a later release of a second PDF/book with later stretch goals for late 2019/early 2020.

Experience the rush of unquestioning loyalty to a darker power and charging into danger with reckless abandon! Raid villages, scout ancient ruins for artifacts, and protect the dungeon from homicidal adventurers.\nInstead of a well established world, the game uses principles taken from Powered by the Apocalypse style games and improv comedy to create the setting. For the Dungeon! relies heavily on player created prompts that are interpreted by the Game Master to reveal the details of the world.\nThe game is designed to be fast-paced, with a focus on creating memorable moments. Because the game is light and has a greater focus on the story, anybody can pick up and play with minimal effort. The fun is created more through the unexpected scenarios the players get themselves into than by studying rules.\nSo how do you play? Characters are represented by a set of short descriptions called traits. They cover a character's skills, equipment, and motivations. Traits provide an easy way to know both who your character is and what they're good at.\nSomething inherent to being a minion is their penchant for chaos. Critical failures are a core part of what makes the game unique and fun. Whenever the characters critically fail the player provides a prompt that the Game Master uses as inspiration for whatever hilariously unexpected misfortune befalls them.\nWith failure comes experience. When a minion rolls a critical failure they write down what they learned from the experience instead of tracking experience points. These experiences can be used just like traits, but only as long as you continue to succeed.\nIn addition to playing as a minion, all players get to influence what is going on in the dungeon. During downtime, players choose from a handful of dungeon actions that alter the world to naturally create interesting story hooks to pursue.\nThere's a lot more that goes into making the game what it is. Feel free to download the Quick Start to get a better idea of the rules of For the Dungeon!\nThere are two ways to get your hands on a copy of For the Dungeon! The digital copy is a PDF and a great option for anyone looking to save some money. The physical copy is a paperback book with original art from our wonderful artist Jared. If you want to see more of his work feel free check him out on Instagram. We ship to most of the world, if your country isn't currently listed reach out either by message or comment and I'll be sure to add it. Here's what you're getting inside the book:\nAbout 70 pages full of original full-color art\nA guide to creating characters and selecting traits\nA List of abilities that define minion playstyles\nHelpful tips for using prompts to create the world\nAdvice to help GM's run the game\nThe game also includes a guide to creating alternate settings other than fantasy. Simple rules for altering and creating new abilities, items, and downtime actions allow Game Masters to run any kind of game they want with the system!\nWe now have add-ons! To receive any of the following just add the listed amount to your pledge total. We will have options for marking add-ons during the end of campaign surveys, but you can always send us a message to make sure we know which add-on you wanted or that the amount pledged is correct. There are currently two available add-ons.\nThe Deck of Many Prompts  ($14 U.S. / $24 Other Countries) - This deck is for those who want to add a bit of randomness to the game without the pressure of thinking up prompts on the spot. Whenever the situation calls for you to establish details simply draw a card and roll a die. The GM will then work the result into the fiction. Note: the image shown is just a placeholder and not the final product.\nMap of Discovery ($16 U.S.) - This is a 11\"x17\" foldable dry-erase map featuring thematic imagery, that players get to explore and discover. It is also a great way to track the consequences of dungeon actions. Whenever the group angers a village or causes mayhem the consequences can be recorded for future use.

You're not fixing the system from the inside. You're not even saving up to retire. You're going to ride this executive elevator of blood and agony just as far as it goes.\nThis is your story, and it doesn\u2019t have a happy ending.\nThe Bad Guys Won. Welcome to the Firm.\nDeniable Assets is a tabletop RPG about the unglimpsed mid-tier villains of the cyberpunk genre. As rank-and-file megacorporate rats you'll blow money you don't have, fund technology you can't control, lie to everyone, and dodge spies, grifters, and kill-teams as you strive for power in a rigged and amoral system.\nEvery character's goal is the same: win one real leather seat on the top floor's Executive Board. Board members don't die of old age anymore, so replacing one takes some real vicious stick-to-itiveness. Falling off that ladder means being ruined, arrested, or murdered at best. Those who beat the odds and claim their throne are promoted into hellish, immortal NPCs that help bring about your next character's downfall.\nFortunately for you, you're not your character's friend. You're their witness. Their spectator. Their enabler. You give them what they want and let it ring in their doom; you play to see what happens next and enjoy the mayhem. \nThere will be fireworks. You'll be holding the match. The question is, who goes up in the blaze?\nUnlike their characters, everyone playing Deniable Assets is very much on the same team: Team Outrageous Spectacle. That means the player characters and GM (aka \"The Board\") work together to create the best story possible.\nPlayers generate a setting, corporation, and \"floor\" of NPCs and player characters with an eye for scattering as many ticking time bombs as possible. They can customize these completely, tick off preset boxes, or use provided scenarios. Once the maze is complete and the rats are scurrying through, The Board throws down poisoned cheese and land mines to keep things interesting.\nNobody can predict how a session of Deniable Assets will go, especially not The Board. There are no unimportant rolls. Whenever the dice clatter, things will happen.\nLet's consider one of the central moves of The Keymaster, one of the many playable archetypes in the game. Keymasters are the heads of security for their divisions, so their special moves control force, safety, and information. Obviously these create drama when they're misused--and they will be--but even if the Keymaster has the best of intentions, the dice might have other plans.\nIn the first session The Keymaster customizes her team of \"security\" mercenaries to be well-equipped but brutish. Whenever she gives them orders, she rolls to see how well they follow through. If she gets a full success:\nThey neutralize a target, contain a breach, or secure an area.\nThey don\u2019t make a mess.\nThey don't pull any heat onto The Keymaster personally.\nBut if she only gets a partial success, she gets to pick exactly one of those things. Based on her choice, and the qualities she picked out for her team, The Board and player dictate where things go wrong. \nIf the roll comes up a full-on failure, everyone really gets a show. Blown rolls are always welcome in Deniable Assets. \nAs in other Powered by the Apocalypsegames, The Board never rolls dice. The Board presents dangers, opportunities, complications, twists, and outrageous situations. It's up to players to determine how their characters respond and the dice to keep things tense and volatile.\nConflict, plot twists, hard choices, and unforeseen consequences are baked into every roll in Deniable Assets. You can't have an uneventful session...even if your characters wish they could.\nLet's break down the rewards. All the standard Deniable Assets content there is will be available to backers who give at least $5: \nIn the first week of the Kickstarter, you'll get your very first Deniable Assets playtesting kit. This will be a micro-version of the game suitable for reviewing or enjoying with your group. You're free either to enjoy it for what it is or submit feedback through a provided Google Form.\nThroughout development, you'll receive regular rounds of playtest updates and errata as they become available, right up until the game's final and polished release as a handsome .pdf complete with:\nFull overview and rules tutorial\nPremade characters, corporations, and scenarios\nSucculent lore nuggets to steal and repurpose\nPrinter-attractive playbooks and references\nOptions and best practices for running a game about the megacorporate future\nAfter the game's release, any content expansions guaranteed by stretch goals will be developed and delivered to all backers at or above $5.\nYou can get custom-designed content like NPCs, character classes, and even entire campaigns by backing at the higher levels! Availability for these is limited, so get in early.\n\n\nI'm Adam \"Rutskarn\" DeCamp.

Throughout his 30 year career he has worked at the  smallest hills and the most expansive resorts in North America.  He has left his mark in South America, Australia, Asia and Europe too.   And even if you have never shared a bottomless powder day with him, he has always been close by.  Maybe even in your pocket.  \nResearching terrain in the Alps\nJim has extensively researched, photographed and illustrated nearly every ski map used in North America over the last three decades.  Nearly 200 in total!   It is because of Jim that trail maps from Aspen to Whistler have the same look and feel.   Ski Magazine regularly ranks the Top 50 resorts in North America.  Jim has hand painted 45 of them.  His tools of choice are a camera, a notepad, a paintbrush and a canvas.  Every painstaking detail - peaks, cliffs, trees and shadows \u2013 is painted by hand.  Jim's large and beautiful paintings have helped generations of skiers navigate and capture the unique character of each mountain. He has had more impact on the image and feel of skiing than almost anyone, yet few people know his name.  \nThis project is a celebration of Jim's life work and his contribution to the ski industry featuring some of the greatest mountain terrain in the world.  His work, built on the foundation of artists that came before him, provides the connective tissue that links together millions of ski memories over the last three decades. \nThe Project\nThe project was born out of Jim's desire to have a definitive catalog of his work and every skier and snowboarder's desire to remember their great ski days.  Whether you have skied one area for your whole life or have travelled the world, you have used Jim's maps.\nThe coffee table book is the definitive guide to Jim's work.  The book includes background on trail map making, Jim's career, Jim's impact on the industry, and nearly 200 ski resorts - the full catalog of Jim's work.  Its full color, timeless design provides an art book that will look great at your home or your favorite ski cabin.\nThe art prints are high quality printed reproductions of some of Jim's most popular works.  They are printed in the US with archival inks.\nNearly 200 Ski Resort Maps Painted by Hand   \nJim has hand painted some of the most iconic ski areas in the world.  This book will celebrate his collection.  \nEvery tree, every slope painted by hand\nThe Team\nJames Niehues is the man behind the map and the creator of the over 200 ski map paintings featured in the project.  This beautifully designed hardcover coffee table book is a compilation of his life's work.\nJason Blevins is the lead writer and has over 20 years experience covering skiing and outdoor adventure sports.  He is a founder of the Colorado Sun, a journalist-owned news outlet based in Denver.  \nCory Grosser + Associates are the lead designers.   Cory is a former ski racer and heads a multi-disciplinary, boutique design agency based in Pasadena California. His studio work includes; architectural design, furniture and product design, design strategy and creative direction.\nJared Greenbaum is an experienced marketer and strategist with a background in entertainment, nonprofits, and higher education. \nLindsay Pierce Martin is an award-winning documentary filmmaker  and photographer based in Denver, Colorado. \nMeghan Lyden is an Emmy and Pulitzer Prize winning multimedia editor and producer based in Denver, Colorado.\nTodd Bennett and Ben Farrow are passionate skiers who are honored to help make Jim's dream a reality.

It\u2019s all about different people working together to overcome challenges and build amazing successes \u2014 and then celebrating the camaraderie of their shared achievements.\nThe best cooperative games are like that too. If you love cooperative board, card, and dice games, and you want to know more about how they work, Meeples Together is for you.\nMeeples Together is a book about how and why cooperative games work. It's a 384-page, 6\" \u00d7 9\" trade paperback with more than 150 illustrated figures. It's also available in digital editions.\nMeeples Together is for gamers. Whether you play games as a lifestyle or a more casual pastime, and whether you\u2019re just interested or you want to get better, this book will help you understand how cooperative games work, how you can play them better, and which games might be your next new favorites.\nMeeples Together is also for aficionados. Champions and connoisseurs of tabletop gaming can never get enough of thinking and talking about games. If you\u2019re the kind of person who logs your plays on BoardGameGeek and always tries the new hotness at Gen Con or Essen Spiel, this book provides crucial fuel for thought and discussion.\nMeeples Together is for critics too. The gaming community has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to writers, reviewers, podcasters, and pundits. This book moves the state of the art forward in terms of understanding this key subset of tabletop gaming, making it required reading for anyone with a serious critical interest in tabletop games.\nMeeples Together is for game designers. Not only does it break down existing tabletop designs in exhaustive detail so you can understand what specific mechanics and concepts make them tick, it also highlights ideas for game development with icons in the text, and appendices cover both the basics of game design as well as game design dilemmas.\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, aficionado, critic, or game designer, Meeples Together is for you.\nMeeples Together contains 14 chapters about the nature, mechanics, theory, and frontiers of cooperative gaming.\nAlong the way, 14 in-depth case studies (or more, depending on stretch goals!) of cooperative gaming\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 from Pandemic and Battlestar Galactica to Contract Bridge \u2014 demonstrate the concepts and ideas.

He's founded several companies focusing on social software, including Skotos Tech, an online game company where he aided in the design of Castle Marrach, Grendel's Revenge, and Lovecraft Country. His Life with Alacrity blog talks about the principles of cooperation, collaboration, and governance while his Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops imagine the future of collaboration on the internet.\nShannon Appelcline writes about games. He regularly contributed to the defunct board-gaming magazine Knucklebones, while his eurogame-focused Meeples & Mechanics blog contains over a decade worth of game analysis. He's also long been involved with the roleplaying field, working for Chaosium and supporting lines like Call of Cthulhu and Pendragon. He's best known for Designers & Dragons, a four-book history of the roleplaying industry.\nGameplaywright publishes books about games, stories, and the work of making them. Its co-founders are Will Hindmarch and Jeff Tidball. This is their seventh Gameplaywright release. \nFeaturing interior figures by Keith Curtis, editing by Renee Knipe and Colleen Riley, cover design by Will Hindmarch, and interior layout by Alex Mayo and Jeff Tidball.\nWe think every store in the world that sells board games can sell Meeples Together.\nWe\u2019re positive that we won\u2019t reach every gamer, aficionado, critic, and game designer in the world in the 30 short days this Kickstarter runs. For the 20 years after that, we hope game stores will continue to sell Meeples Together to people who love cooperative games.  If you have a store, our \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier is for you.\nThis campaign is retail-friendly because:\n* The price is the price. What it costs to back the campaign is also the MSRP we\u2019ll put on the back.\n* Your customers get everything. We\u2019ll give you access to the digital edition so you can pass it along to your customers who buy physical copies of Meeples Together from you.\n* We won\u2019t tie up your capital. You'll choose your quantity and pay the balance \u2014 with your pledge counted as a credit \u2014 the month before we ship. You\u2019ll even be able to add other Gameplaywright titles like Friendly Local Game Store and The White Box.\n* You\u2019ll get the discount you expect. Your discount is 50%, with shipping pegged closely to our actual cost.\n* You\u2019ll get it before your competitors. We'll ship to retail backers at least four weeks before we ship to general distribution.\n* You\u2019ll have long-term access. Through Gameplaywright\u2019s distribution partnership with Atlas Games, physical editions of Meeples Together will be available through distribution, so you can make it available for years to come.\nRetail backers must be established, brick-and-mortar, retail game stores. \nThe Gameplaywright titles offered in our \u201cPlus,\u201d \u201cDesigner,\u201d and \"Everything\" tiers are described briefly below. Also described are titles that will be available as add-on purchases via BackerKit, after the campaign ends.\nThe White Box is a game design workshop in a box, a 208-page book of 25 essays about how to design and publish tabletop games, and a kit of more than 400 generic components \u2014 cubes, meeples, dice, chips, punchboard \u2014 to get you started right away. ($29.95 as an add-on)\nThe White Box Essays is the book from The White Box. It's not available on its own as a physical edition, but its digital editions are part of the Digital Designer pledge level. ($7.95 as an add-on)\nThings We Think About Games collects bite-sized thoughts about games. It spans the breadth of games and the depths of gaming, offering insights about collecting, playing, critiquing, designing, and publishing. ($19.95 as an add-on)\nThe Bones: Us and Our Dice gathers writing about fandom and family \u2014 about gamers, camaraderie, and memories \u2014 and ties them together where they meet: our dice. Contributors include Wil Wheaton, Keith Baker, John Kovalic, Ken Hite, and Chuck Wendig. ($18.95 as an add-on)\nFriendly Local Game Store is a book about how to earn a middle-class income opening your own game store and creating a community for gamers. It\u2019s written by Gary L. Ray, author of Quest for Fun, the go-to blog for all things FLGS. ($24.95 add-on)\nHamlet\u2019s Hit Points presents the beat system, a toolkit for storytelling in RPGs \u2014 and any other form \u2014 by classifying story beats and letting you track their ups and down from hope to fear and back. Includes full-length analyses of Hamlet, Dr. No, and Casablanca. ($19.95 add-on)\nBeating the Story expands the story beat system by defining different types of beat-to-beat transitions, and providing practical guidance on topics like conceiving your story, creating its hero, mapping its beats, writing drafts, revising, and even editing the work of others. Includes extended analyses of Maupassant\u2019s \u201cThe Necklace,\u201d the Mad Men episode \u201cHave a Seat, Shut the Door,\u201d the X-Files episode \u201cHome,\u201d and a scene from The Color Purple. ($19.95 add-on)\nShipping charges for all \"Print\" tiers and the \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier will be collected after the Kickstarter concludes using BackerKit, a post-campaign pledge manager. \nThis is likely to help us to generally reduce the costs of shipping by allowing us to add more international fulfillment hubs based on demand. It also keeps your money in your pocket longer.\nWe\u2019ve estimated the following shipping costs by region and tier.\nUnited States (including Puerto Rico) Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $3-4\nPrint Plus: $6-7\nPrint Designer: $12-15\nEverything in Print: $12-15\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nCanada Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $10-12\nPrint Plus: $12-15\nPrint Designer: $15-20\nEverything in Print: $15-20\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEurope Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAustralia and New Zealand Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEverywhere Else Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $20-30\nPrint Plus: $30-40\nPrint Designer: $35-50\nEverything in Print: $40-60\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAs you can see, shipping physical objects around the world is expensive. We don\u2019t like it any more than you do.\nWe won\u2019t profit from the shipping costs for the various tiers of this campaign. Rather, we\u2019ll wind up modestly subsidizing shipping to most destinations. After re-shipping lost and stolen packages, we\u2019ll spend a little bit more. This is what we expect, and it\u2019s fine with us.\nPlease expect that shipping charges will increase if you respond to the pledge manager after shipping has begun. Make sure your inbox is set to receive backer updates, and look for them after the campaign ends.\nTo avoid shipping charges, consider the digital tiers. You can also wait until Meeples Together\u2019s public release, anticipated for April, 2019. If you buy the book in a store, you won\u2019t pay shipping charges. Other online merchants\u2019 shipping prices vary; you\u2019ll know better than we will what you might expect to pay in the future.\nThere isn\u2019t another scheduled opportunity to get digital editions free with printed editions. This isn\u2019t an option we routinely offer at Gameplaywright via any of our distribution channels, including direct sales. So if you want digital and physical editions together for one price, now\u2019s your chance.\nFor customs purposes, assume the worst case scenario that your rewards will ship from the United States. We are not willing to fraudulently claim that campaign rewards are gifts in order to help avoid duties. If the campaign does well, the possibility exists for fulfillment from within Canada, the European Union, and Australia. That said: It\u2019s a possibility, not a guarantee. If backing at physical levels is contingent on fulfillment from within your local region, we recommend backing at a digital tier now to get access to the post-campaign pledge manager, when you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your pledge if you wish.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is already done and through its first round of editing.

He is rather nondescript, with a receding hairline and glasses. He doesn\u2019t explain himself or his nature unless really pressed, but he does welcome a bit of chitchat while waiting in line or on the train. Most people think \u201cMonday\u201d is just his name, rather than his very being. And if someone\u2019s looking for a larger context, he can\u2019t give it to them. \u201cI think I saw Thursday on a train, once,\u201d he\u2019ll admit, but that\u2019s about it.\nThanks to a few glamours Anestra discovered, the word \u201cApostate\u201d now floats above her head in glowing letters. It follows wherever she goes. Exactly as she wanted it. She wears a sinsuit made of wrath and a bit of envy. A candle of numina burns upon her shoulder. Long brown dreadlocks cascade around her face and down her back, but a minor charm keeps them from the dangers of the candle flame. One day, after a keyfall, where keys of all shapes and sizes rain down from the heavens, she found a key. Not just a key, but a so-called wicked key that can open anything. Using this key, she unlocked the door of a library far more ancient than that of Rhol, the Left-Handed God. So ancient, in fact, that it no longer existed. And within this long-gone storehouse of knowledge, Anestra found what she was looking for: the secret name of a demon so obscure and so lost that no one living or dead remembered it.\nInvisible Sun is an amazing and visionary new tabletop roleplaying game from Monte Cook that introduces new modes of RPG play, a truly unique and original setting, and an unprecedented physical production weighing in at over 30lb (14kg). It released in the summer of 2018 to its Kickstarter backers, through retail game stores, and on the Monte Cook Games website, and it sold out immediately. Now, due to overwhelming demand, we are planning a reprint of this groundbreaking, but very hard-to-find, piece of RPG history.\nDo you think you live in the real world?\nYou don\u2019t.

Awaken, and return to the Actuality and to Satyrine, the city under the Indigo Sun. You are a vislae, a wielder of magic; a shaper of reality; a student of secrets and the real truths that lay hidden within the Actuality. You sought shelter in Shadow to escape the war, but the war is now over and your home has called you back.\nA roleplaying game of surreal fantasy\nInvisible Sun player characters are vislae\u2014wielders of magical power\u2014recently returned to their true home: the Actuality, a world that seems like a surreal dream to those of us toiling aimlessly in the boring, grey realm you and I falsely believe is the real world. These characters face incredible challenges, visit breathtaking places, and discover secrets so astonishing that the only ones who can cope with them are those who understand the truth that powers the universe: Magic.\nMagic: A power that can be pursued, studied, and even mastered, but never completely understood or controlled. It is fluid, unpredictable, and ever nuanced in effect. Its secrets are boundless. But that does not mean it is without rules and methods. There are four orders, major schools of magical thought and training. Vances study their spells carefully, believing they are, in their own way, intelligent in and of themselves. Makers, as the name suggests, use magic to create powerful items. Weavers cast spells with a fluid and improvisational sort of sorcery. Goetics use their magical skills to summon demons, angels, and other creatures to do their bidding. Outside of the four orders, Apostates are vislae who find their own paths and methods for wielding the power of magic, rejecting the hierarchies of the orders.\nIt is a rare vislae who does not have a house. Your house is as integral to your being as your spells or character stats. The houses of vislae are often haunted, filled with mysterious unknown rooms, bigger on the inside, or possessed of their own intelligence. And in Satyrine, a house is defined as much by what goes on around it as by the contents of its walls (assuming, of course, that a vislae\u2019s house even has walls). Local personalities, sites of interest (or danger), organizations or factions, and ongoing conflicts all affect a vislae\u2019s house and life. And all of this is determined as part of the character creation process.\nBonds, character arcs, echoes of your life in Shadow, a secret Soul, your role within your order, and your relationship to other player characters are all addressed during character creation through a fun, interactive process that engages the entire gaming group. It also leads to PCs with incredibly rich backstories, inner lives, motivations, and relationships\u2014and a vast array of adventuring hooks.\nFinally, for Invisible Sun characters, even death is not the end. For in the Actuality, death is simply the realm under the Pale Sun, another world along the Path of Suns.\nWalk the Path of Suns\nWhen exiled to Shadow, you probably believed there was just one sun\u2014but there are in fact eight. Nine, actually\u2014but even many learned people don\u2019t know that, for the ninth is a secret. Invisible. As a vislae, that is one of many secrets you know.\nThe Path of Suns is a representation of the way magic works, the known levels of existence, the stages of a life, and the makeup of the mortal soul, all in one. It is a symbol. A metaphor. A diagram. A map. Each sun represents a different concept, a different \u201cplace\u201d and a different fundamental aspect of the universe. These different concepts are signified by the color of each sun, so that color ends up representing the sun and its attendant ideals.\nThe suns are also planes of existence\u2014literal places that vislae can visit. Each realm reflects the nature of the sun that illuminates it, and is guarded by wardens and peopled by creatures great and terrible, mysterious and, very often, dangerous. Magical power flows like a rushing river from the Invisible Sun through the other suns. (While the main current follows the Path of Suns, not all do.) Powerful vislae travel the Path of Suns to master these different currents and better hone their spells, but to do so they must parlay with the wardens of the Suns and face the perils within their realms.\nThe Path of Suns connects all eight suns, Silver to Green, to Blue, to Indigo, then Grey, next Pale, and Red, and finally Gold. The Invisible Sun is not a part of the path, but rather outside, above, and around it. There are some, however, who follow the Nightside Path, which is the Path of Suns in reverse. In the Nightside Path, each sun has an altered, often darker, aspect. It would be far too simple\u2014and erroneous\u2014to call the Path of Suns \u201cgood\u201d and the Nightside path \u201cevil,\u201d but some do.\nAs a vislae, you might travel the path of suns, visiting these realms, parlaying with their wardens, encountering the glories and horrors within, and unlocking their secrets. Or your adventures might never take you beyond the borders of Satyrine, a surreal city rife with intrigue and conflict following the terrors of the recently concluded war.\nA New Way to Play RPGs\nConventional RPG game play, with everyone gathering for a few hours every week or two, is what makes RPGs a great experience. It\u2019s also one of the greatest obstacles to a successful campaign, for our modern life rarely makes it convenient. Conventional play is the centerpiece of Invisible Sun, but the game also accommodates the realities of our lifestyles, rewards engagement with the game away from the table, and is deliberately made for differing player styles.\nPlay doesn\u2019t have to stop when the session is over. Players can keep the game going\u2014individually or in groups\u2014by creating side-scenes that describe high level actions that their character want to take. They can also create flashback side-scenes that reveal actions their characters have already taken. This also means that even if they can\u2019t make it to the regular session, they can still move their character\u2019s story forward. A side-scene might cover what Shanna\u2019s character does while she\u2019s absent from the regular session.\nPlayers can even play if the GM isn\u2019t available. A side-scene could involve the entire group taking an action that they discuss in person and then communicate later to the GM. The GM resolves the action(s) by giving them a turn of a Sooth Card and then responding to the players\u2019 actions and intentions. The free Invisible Sun app, for iOS, Android, and web, facilitates these modes of play.\nWhile Invisible Sun is aimed primarily at those of us who love deep, complex characters, there are options for when your cousin shows up from out of town and wants to join in for a session. And whether you\u2019re an out-loud extrovert who\u2019s happy to tell the world about your character, or a quieter player who keeps your character development mostly to yourself, the game is deliberately designed to let you get the most out of it.\nYou can learn more about the Actuality and Invisible Sun gameplay at these links:\nHere's a detailed \"How to Play\" video that introduces the games mechanics.\nWant to see Invisible Sun in action? The Raven Wants What You Have is a live-play video series with the MCG design team.\nHere's a great unboxing video by Matt Steele (a backer of the original Kickstarter).\nVisit invisiblesunrpg.com for more info on Invisible Sun in general.\nHere's an article about Weavers, one of the orders of magic, from the original Kickstarter campaign's updates. Flip through those updates for articles on Vances, Makers, Goetics, and Apostates, as well as other topics relating to Invisible Sun rules.\n Tour the Path of Suns, and visit the Silver Sun, here. Then click through other updates from the original Kickstarter to visit all of the suns\u2014as well as their nightside versions.\nAnd download the free PDF preview of Invisible Sun for a peek inside the gamebooks, the cards, and other aspects of the Black Cube, here.\nA literal black cube nearly one foot on a side, Invisible Sun is an unprecedented physical production, filled with massive amounts of content for a unique roleplaying experience. The Black Cube and its contents were upgraded through multiple stretch goals in the original Kickstarter campaign, and all of those upgrades will already be part of your Black Cube. It contains (and this is not an exhaustive list):\nInvisible Sun is a game about discovery and secrets. There may be other content awaiting your discovery in the Black Cube.\nItems Outside the Black Cube\nIn addition to the physical game itself, every backer getting the Black Cube also gets:\n The Key in PDF. The Key is one of the four game books in the Black Cube, containing character generation rules and other information frequently referenced not just by the GM, but by all the players (particularly when conceptualizing and generating characters). A second copy, in easily-referenced PDF form, is handy. The Key in PDF will be delivered to you in early 2019.\n We Begin at the End, a standalone adventure for Invisible Sun optimized for new players and GMs, in digital format. (Backers of the original Invisible Sun Kickstarter: If this campaign funds, you will also get a copy!)\nThe Rules Primer. A short introduction to the rules of Invisible Sun, to prepare you for the game with some of the general concepts. While it's not enough to play, it is enough to start thinking about your character or your campaign. The Rules Primer will be delivered to you before the end of 2018.\nThe Invisible Sun app. A web app that supports your group and Invisible Sun's unique away-from-the-table play.\nThe Digital Rules Reference. This is an easily-searchable text file containing commonly-referenced rules and text. It will be delivered concurrently to the Black Cube.\nImagine this: You\u2019ve decided to run an Invisible Sun campaign. You\u2019ve got the rules and setting down, and some great introductory material. But wouldn\u2019t it be cool if Monte himself provided you with a bunch of unique ideas? And those ideas came with new artwork, maps, and handouts for your players, and even a few new clues to mysteries in the game besides? And what if, month after month, he kept sending them to you, tailoring the content to your narrative and the decisions your players make\u2014and even occasionally sending you physical packages with even more deluxe props and cool stuff for your game?\nOr, imagine this: You\u2019re a player in an Invisible Sun campaign. One day, you go to your mailbox and there\u2019s a letter addressed to your character. Inside is an in-world missive about some new opportunity for your character\u2014an invite to an exclusive party, a welcome letter to a hidden society, or a love letter from a secret admirer who would like to meet your character. You show up at the next game session with this, and suddenly it becomes a part of the game, and a part of your character\u2019s story arc.\nThis is the Directed Campaign, and it\u2019s an option for Invisible Sun.\nAs an Invisible Sun GM, you tell us when your narrative starts, and you tell us a bit about your group. Then you\u2019ll get access to a website with valuable content updates and discussion forums. For the next twelve months, you\u2019ll receive a new set of PDFs and digital content with plot elements, artwork, and ideas for what could happen in the continuing story of your game. Expect enough content to keep your gaming group busy through a month of play (at a typical RPG pace).\nBut there\u2019s more. Sometimes, this download will be accompanied by a physical package we\u2019ll mail to you with actual game props (items the characters might discover) like a ring, a booklet, or a matchbook with a scribbled clue. You\u2019ll get about four of these shipments in the course of the year.\nAnd there\u2019s even more to it than that! With your permission, we\u2019ll also send the players (up to five) a physical message as well. Say you\u2019ve identified your friend John whose character likes joining groups. We\u2019ll send John\u2019s character (at John\u2019s address) a beautiful but mysterious invitation to come to a meeting of a secret society in the game. John will become even more immersed in the game and you\u2019ll have a plot hook to run with!\nAnd here\u2019s the best part: At several points throughout the narrative, you\u2019ll update us with information about your players\u2019 choices and the direction of your story. Your future content will be tailored to those choices and events. And along the way you\u2019ll have access to the Directed Campaign forums, where we share early (and sometimes exclusive) information, and you can interact with directly with Monte, the design team, and other creative Invisible Sun GMs.\nThe Directed Campaign runs for twelve months, with enough new content each month (very roughly speaking) to give your group plenty of material for weekly game sessions. You choose when it starts, in any month up to June 2020. (And even if you don\u2019t start your narrative, once you\u2019ve subscribed you can access the forums for exclusive interaction with the design team and other Invisible Sun GMs.) The content will be tailored to information you provide us about your players, their characters, and various choices or directions your campaign takes over the course of the Directed Campaign. Your Directed Campaign will not be specifically customized to you, but the content you receive will be specific to the information you report to us, and it\u2019s entirely possible that no two Directed Campaigns will be exactly the same.\nThe Invisible Sun app supports the unique gameplay aspects of Invisible Sun, facilitating side scenes, away-from-table gameplay, and the play style of players who like an alternative way to share character and story details. Meeting a player for half an hour at the coffee shop or the park? The app gives you a portable version of the Sooth Deck. Or maybe a player wants to conduct a side scene with the GM\u2014or with just the other players. The app gives them a chat platform to discuss, or completely carry out, the scene. You can even use it at the game table, as a quick reference regarding the meanings of Sooth Deck cards. \nThe Invisible Sun app is free with your Black Cube. It\u2019s web based, and runs on any modern web browser, making it usable on your phone, tablet, or your PC.\nInvisible Sun is being supported by a line of supplements. Book M, the first supplementary book, comes with a slipcase, which will hold Book M itself, plus Secrets of Silent Streets, Teratology, and The Threshold. If you pledge for (or add on) the supplements, you\u2019ll receive the five books already planned, plus any additional supplements funded by this campaign.\nBook M: Even its name is a secret. Some say it comes from the Sodality of Vryn, which identifies thirteen currents of magic and gives each a letter designation\u2014M is the 13th and most powerful. Others say the title refers to the original writer of the book, while still others believe it stands for mystery, or\u2014perhaps most simply and obviously\u2014magic. This 120-page hardcover comes with 200 spell, ephemera, and object of power cards, plus a beautiful and handy slipcase with room for the next three supplements.\nSecrets of Silent Streets: Like any metropolis in any realm, Satyrine isn\u2019t one city but many. Even a vislae can\u2019t know the entirety of it, no matter how many lives they live there. Fartown, the Marquis Quarter, the Strangeglass District, the Hollows, and the vast abandoned stretches\u2014all offer different experiences and moods as well as unique landmarks, resources, denizens, and dangers. Satyrine is something different to every citizen and visitor who explores her streets. travel the seventeen districts of Satyrine, each detailed through dozens of points of interest and illuminated through its own unique atmosphere, social expectations, and traditions. Along the way you\u2019ll find scores of plot hooks, NPCs, creatures, and of course plenty of magic.\nTeratology: There are many creatures cataloged within the Black Cube, but the Actuality is a big place. Every day, new entities and surreal beasts are discovered by explorers, conjurers, and other (often unfortunate) individuals. Numerous vislae have given their time, effort, lives, and so much more to compile this ever-growing collection of creatures, which most in the Actuality consider to be the greatest resource on the topic.\nThe Threshold: A hardcover campaign sourcebook with story arcs and in-depth material about the Actuality and the Labyrinth. The Labyrinth is a mystical, metaphorical, ever-changing, always-shifting crucible for testing the cleverest, most powerful, and most adept among the vislae. Crossing its threshold might be akin to suicide, but it also might just be the path to true revelation. And carefully hidden within the pages of this book, in fact, might just be the greatest secret of the Actuality . . . What lies beyond the Labyrinth if you pass through it entirely?\nThe Nightside: A book that isn't like the others. A book unafraid to touch the untouchable and speak the unspeakable. A book for those willing to deal with devils, truck with demons, and learn the ways of unclean spirits. A book containing secrets, spells, pacts, secret names, words of power, and more for those who aren't necessarily servants of the darkness, but are not afraid to look it in the eye (and have a drink with it at Zeros). The Nightside won\u2019t fit into your slipcase (and you wouldn\u2019t want it there, contaminating the other books). Instead, it comes in a special warded satin bag\u2014and wise vislae keep it there.\nThe Vislae Kit\nThe core Invisible Sun game (the black cube) contains everything a full gaming group needs to play a complete narrative, including all the materials for the players as well as the GM. But sometimes the players want their own stuff. And some of the game elements, like character tomes and grimoires, are consumable, so GMs and players alike may want additional copies. \nThe Vislae Kit is a player companion to the Invisible Sun game, containing all the materials a single player may want. The custom Invisible Sun dice, a Sooth Deck, a grimoire pad, character tomes, tokens, and more come in a very cool box that is practically a collector\u2019s item in its own right. Like the Black Cube, the Vislae Kit is out of print, but this Kickstarter funds a reprint concurrent to the Invisible Sun reprint.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWhy a Kickstarter campaign, if Invisible Sun has already been made? Invisible Sun is an unprecedented production; a very difficult and expensive game to make. A Kickstarter campaign not only funds an costly print run, it also helps us judge demand to ensure we make the right quantity. Too many is wasteful\u2014not only of our resources, but at 33lb per game, of the world's as well. Too few leaves us in exactly the situation we're in now, with gamers clamoring for a Black Cube that we can't give them. A Kickstarter campaign helps us get the number just right.\nEven more importantly, it gives us another opportunity to offer items that haven't been made yet to new backers, and to potentially expand the range of the Invisible Sun line with new titles. And, of course, to broaden the Invisible Sun community as we reach hundreds or thousands of new players.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" does not mean free shipping. It's Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support this project. If you are outside the US and getting physical rewards, see below.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT Soon after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when a reward is ready, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know it is time to log on to your account on the MCG Shop and redeem your rewards, which you will do for free with coupons. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address at that time. (So if you\u2019ve moved, or want to send the reward to a friend as a gift, you\u2019re providing a totally up-to-date address.) If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\n*The UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nThe Black Cube is a large, heavy item, and international shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the thirteenth game-related Kickstarter campaign for by Monte Cook Games. All of our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards. Most of those campaigns are completely fulfilled, and we\u2019ve delivered several hundred thousand rewards to backers, generally on schedule and always meeting or exceeding expectations. We\u2019re experienced creators, and while challenges always arise, we know how to overcome them.\n\nInvisible Sun is not a new product. The original Kickstarter is one of the few of ours that ran into delays, but the production, shipping, and fulfillment challenges that caused those delays have been met and resolved already. A product as complex as this can\u2014in fact, almost certainly will\u2014run into issues, even in a simple reprint. But we\u2019ve built time into our schedule to allow for those, and we know how to deal with them when they arise.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record. Of course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, T-rex attacks, or catastrophic solar flares. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once. Unless the planetovores breach into the universe of normal matter to consume the Earth without Carter Strange around to save us, we are confident that the project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 43 or more", "title": "Look Beyond the Grey", "descp": "I possess the Black Cube already, or my GM has already obtained it.

When it was released over twenty-five years ago, it influenced a generation of game designers and spawned countless campaigns on Al Amarja.\nToday, we\u2019re bringing Over the Edge back with a new vision, new era, and new stories. We want you to be a part of that effort.\nReturn to the island you only think you remember.\nDesign not final\nWHAT IS AL AMARJA?\nThe setting of Over the Edge is a fictional, modern-day island in the Atlantic Ocean that\u2019s home to the weirdest city in the world, the Edge. All sorts of conspiracies, paranormal entities, mad scientists, secret agents, and more lurk here. It\u2019s the front line for the Last War, a conflict that rages unseen and unknown to most of its inhabitants. You remember Al Amarja, but not like this.\nWHO AM I WHEN I\u2019M HERE?\nWe believe you're going to be more invested in a unique character you create yourself. Over the Edge helps you draw on modern pop culture and paranormal traditions to craft these exciting characters.\nWe also believe it\u2019s fun to get into trouble, and so characters in Over the Edge are defined not only by their distinguishing traits, but by the ways they leap from the rails and subvert expectations. They question their own core truths, and everyone gets to see what happens next.\nFor example, you might play\u2026 \na jet-setting grifter in Al Amarja to pull off the greatest caper in modern history.\na psychic super-child in pursuit of the remnants of a shadow government.\na reincarnation of an Atlantean Priest of Excess ready to indulge in the island\u2019s forbidden tastes.\nCharacters are the best part of Over the Edge because\u2026\nThe modern-day setting makes it easy to create characters that are relatable and that have depth.\nThe paranormal-friendly setting makes it easy to use your imagination to create a unique role.\nWithout even knowing the rules or the setting, you create your alter ego from scratch using concepts and words, not numbers, lists, or templates.\nWHAT\u2019S FAMILIAR AND WHAT\u2019S ALL-NEW?\nIf you\u2019ve played Over the Edge before, you might wonder what\u2019s different this time around. We know you like touchstones and something to connect to, but you also want to feel as if there\u2019s a reason to pick this edition up.\nThe major conspiracies and characters of the previous editions are still here, but they\u2019ve all been reimagined and rewritten. The new game is inspired by the original material but not limited by or derivative of it.\nA few re-imagined concepts include\u2026\nThe police are still corrupt, but now, instead of being paramilitary officers with grease guns, the rank-and-file cops are schlubs with only their legal standing going for them.\nOne district is still patrolled by thugs with baboons, only now the baboons also roam on their own begging for food and sniffing out troublemakers.\nThe poorest neighborhood is still the turf of Lucifer\u2019s Glorious Lords of Passion, a ruthless gang of metal heads, but now the gang is also a bona fide heavy metal band, and they use their music to solidify their hold on the district.\nFREEFORM, STORY-FORWARD RULES  \nWe believe the island of Al Amarja is best experienced through light, free-wheeling mechanics.\nOver the Edge uses a simple, easy-to-understand game mechanic called \u201ccasting lots.\u201d You throw two six-sided dice to resolve any decision, choice point, or challenge. This generates both a succeed-or-fail result as well as the possibility for a special result: good, bad, or both.\nA single casting of lots can generate the results for\u2026\nA week of surveilling a shady target.\nAn evening burgling a house for loot and information.\nA moment of deadly struggle in a big climactic fight.\nDive deep into the action or pull back and resolve only the key choice points of any situation. Over the Edge lets you determine the scope and stakes of any casting of lots and provides tools to tailor any scenario to the expertise of the player characters.\nWe believe in gorgeous, evocative books. This Kickstarter features a single rulebook written by original Over the Edge designer Jonathan Tweet. It also features assistance from writer Chris Lites, development by Cam Banks, graphic design by Thomas Deeny, art direction by James Mosingo, and editing by Jaym Gates.\nThis new edition is also inspired by 25 years of other game designers\u2019 work, including Robin Laws, Ron Edwards, Luke Crane, Vincent Baker, John Harper, and Jason Morningstar. Many designers say that the original Over the Edge inspired them to design roleplaying games in a new way. We embrace that creative feedback loop by re-incorporating some of their amazing innovations here.\nA developer draft of the manuscript for the rulebook is available to all backers. The link is in the first update.\nThe rulebook includes\u2026\nHigh-quality production values throughout.\nStylish graphic design and layout, emphasizing readability and utility on every page.\nHelpful GM and player advice alongside setting material.\nThe rulebook comes in three formats\u2026\nThe tablet-ready Core Digital edition.\nThe full-color, hardback Core Print edition.\nThe high-quality, Kickstarter-exclusive Core Luxe edition.\nPLEDGE LEVELS FOR DIGITAL NOMADS\nCore Digital is the complete 264-page core rulebook in PDF, Epub, and Kindle formats, easily accessed at your table or for online play, tablet-optimized and hyperlinked.\n$20 OTE Core Digital: Just the files, please.\n$45 OTE Digital Retro: Includes the Retro Pack, PDFs of the previous edition\u2019s books and supplements.\n$55 OTE Digital Retro with Pips: Includes the Retro Pack plus a set of ten six-sided dice in five colors.\nPLEDGE LEVELS FOR PRINT PIONEERS\nCore Print is our full-color, 264-page hardback rulebook.

During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.\nTang Garden is played in a variable number of turns. In each of these turns, the player will be allowed to pick only one action between expanding the garden and decorating the garden: Both actions balance each other, putting the player in the position of making simple and profound choices simultaneously.\nBringing Tang Garden to reality will only be possible with your support. \nMake the game better for everyone. Stretch goals will enhance the final quality and content of the game, the more we fund, the more we can upgrade. We will also offer a serie of Kickstarter Exclusive Stretch Goals.\nThe Deluxe edition contains a Limited Edition numbered Expansion. It won't be possible to get it in distribution. \nGet more value of what you pledge and a competitive discounted and tracked shipping rate.\nWe have planned the size and weight of the game after the Stretch Goals are unlocked and the shipping box will weight around 4 to 5 Kg.

As a village founder you'll invite people from all walks of life to live and work in your expanding community. If you can recruit the right people to form lucrative production chains while balancing your food production and building capacity, your village will become the most prosperous and you'll win the game!\nIn solo mode, a lone village must prosper against the machinations of the very ill-tempered Countess.\nBasic villagers - the backbone of any good village!\nStretch goals are divided into three camps: base game upgrades, expansion pack content, and upgrades to the Coin Box. Any expansion content we unlock during the campaign will be included in a free expansion pack for everyone who pledges to receive the game. The expansion pack and Coin Box will be sold separately at retail.\nNo money was exchanged for any of our reviews.\nIf you'd like to see the work-in-progress rulebook, you'll find it here.\nTom aka Slickerdrips plays through a two player game:\nVillagers is played over several rounds, each with two (or sometimes three) phases. \nIn the draft phase, players take it in turn to take villager cards from the face-up or face-down cards of the central road area. Whenever someone takes a face-up card, it is immediately replaced from the leftmost stack of face-down cards. The number of villagers a player can take in the draft phase depends on how much food their village produces. \nIn the build phase, each player places villagers from their hand into their village - putting them to work. You can play as many cards as you have builders in your village. \nThere are two market cards, tucked away under the second and sixth stacks of face-down cards on the road. When a market card is revealed, there will be a market phase this round, right after the build phase. \nDuring the market phase, players count up the total amount of gold produced by the people working in their village. At the end of the second market phase, the player with the most gold in their supply wins the game.\nAs you can see, Villagers is quite simple, but it's not that simple, there's some other stuff going on, so let's talk about...\nEach villager is part of a production chain. Villagers must be placed in the correct order in their production chains. Longer production chains give you more resources, but require more draft and build actions to put into play. \nSome villagers need special tools or equipment to start working, and they have padlocks on them. Padlocks must be unlocked by paying the bank, or a villager of the type specified - called the unlocker - 2 gold. If possible, this gold is paid direct to the unlocker, and the coins remain on their card for the rest of the game, scoring extra gold during each market phase. This interaction makes it possible to profit from what other players are doing. \nA silver coin icon indicates that some villagers score a conditional amount of gold at the end of the game. They offer many extra scoring opportunities, and you can play two of the same to double your bonus! \nSpecial villagers can make a big difference. Some are like wild cards, helping you create your production chains, while others can create scoring opportunities, or help you in the draft phase. \nIn solo mode, a lone village must stand against the evil Countess, an AI opponent who seeks to restore her former glory at any cost. The early rounds take place in Summer, but fair weather does little to lull the fury of the Countess. And when Winter comes, she really loses her temper... \nAs an optional extra we are offering a fabulous Coin Box - a set of 110 coloured & printed wooden coins to replace the cardboard coins that come with Villagers as standard, all packaged in a magnetically fastened cardboard treasure chest that fits inside the Villagers game box. \nDesign subject to change.\nWhat's more, you can use them in almost any other game that would benefit from the addition of some classy wooden coinage! Quantities and dimensions (correct at time of writing, but subject to change) are: \n30 Ones - 16 x 4mm\n30 Twos - 18 x 4mm\n10 Fives - 20 x 4mm\n10 Tens - 22 x 4mm\n15 Twenties - 24 x 4mm\n15 Fifties - 26 x 4mm\nIf you'd like extra sets of coins, click on \"Manage Your Pledge\" at the top of the page, and add the appropriate multiple of \u00a38 / \u20ac9 / US$11 / CA$14 / A$14 to your pledge amount.\nClick to go to Villagers on Tabletop Simulator (via Steam)\n                             We are shipping Villagers to backers ourselves. Armed only with a spare bedroom, a Royal Mail Business account and a can-do attitude, we will aim to get every pledge out of the door and into the postal system no more than one week after taking delivery of the games.* We're based in the UK, and Brexit hasn't happened yet, so shipping will be EU friendly.\nTo keep shipping costs low, parcels will not be tracked. Items sent within the United Kingdom will be sent by 2nd Class mail, and will take 2-3 days to arrive from the date of posting. Items for Europe will take 3-5 days, and Rest of World 5-7 days. Obviously, these are estimates, and actual delivery times can and will vary.\n\nShipping for all pledge levels is free for UK backers, and subsidised for backers anywhere else on the planet. Please make sure you enter your shipping address correctly - we cannot be held responsible for missing packages sent to incorrect addresses. You'll have a chance to double check your details and correct any errors before shipping begins.\nCurrency conversions estimated at the time of writing.\n *When this was written, before the campaign, we expected no more than 1000 backers. We have obviously surpassed that by some margin. We will still mostly fufil Villagers ourselves (besides the spare bedroom, we have a very large quadruple garage, and failing that, we'll rent some warehouse space), but it might take longer than a week. If we need to draft in extra help to get your game sent out in a reasonable timeframe, we will.\nOur current plan is to get our factory to pre-package the vast majority of games before they ship to us. The factory confirms this is something they can do. This means all we'll have to do for about 95% of pledges is print a shipping label and have Royal Mail collect from us every couple of days until we're finished. It will still be an intensive and very involved process, but nowhere near as insane as if we had to physically package every single pledge ourselves. Whatever happens, we have plenty of extra hands to call on, should we need them.\nWe will work with Snakes & Lattes to fulfil pledges to backers in Canada, and VFI for backers in China. It is also possible that we will use an Australian fulfilment company for Australia and New Zealand, and we'll do our best to prevent anyone from having to pay import fees & customs charges.\nWe'll communicate the entire process via project updates, photos, videos, psychic waves etc.\nWe are pleased to have BackerKit as our pledge management partner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first rodeo for Sinister Fish Games. It's our second, go us! Maybe second-and-a-half, if you count the Removable Sticker Set for Gloomhaven, which is a large and ongoing project, but wasn't on Kickstarter.\n\nWe have a good working relationship with our Chinese manufacturer, Whatz Games, who we worked with on Great Scott! and the Removable Sticker Set for Gloomhaven. They'll be taking care of the international freight shipping. We literally give them an address, pay them some money, and games appear a few weeks later. It's a pretty sweet deal.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter project, the usual risks apply. Things can and do get delayed for a multitude of possible reasons. The estimated fulfilment date of February 2019 allows some buffer time for mishaps to happen in, so you might get your stuff before then. Whatever happens, we will keep you in the loop via project updates.\n\nI should probably mention that my partner is expecting our first child at the end of July. At that point I will mainly just be coordinating with Haakon (designer & artist of Villagers) and the factory, which won't be a 24/7 job, so things should still run fairly smoothly.

Thanks so much to all my backers! I am so grateful that you made this project possible!\nThe Mountain Witch second edition, a critically acclaimed tabletop RPG that combines elements of of Japanese mythology, horror, and film noir in a tale of trust, betrayal, and confronting one's fate.\nWhat is The Mountain Witch?\nThe Mountain Witch is a self-contained role-playing adventure in which players take on the role of ronin in mythical medieval Japan. Outcast and unemployed, these samurai accept a job that no one else would take\u2014to assault and kill the dreaded O-Yanma, the Mountain Witch of Mt Fuji. But can these individuals\u2014who are haunted by their pasts and by dark fortune\u2014be trusted? Can they overcome their differences and move together against the Witch? Or will dark fate overwhelm them?\nThough moment-to-moment play is much like other role-playing games, this otherwise typical fantasy adventure quickly becomes complicated by character fates. At the start of the game, each ronin is given one of six dark fates. While these fates are generally described by the text, their details are left open to the imagination of the player. These fates pull the samurai's former lives into the adventure, creating ulterior motives for the characters.\nAt the same time, the conflict rules of The Mountain Witch uniquely revolve around the use of trust between characters. At designated points throughout the adventure, players must rate how much their character trusts the other members of the company. Then, based on that rating, the rest of the company may choose whether to help or betray the trusting ronin.\nIt is this dynamic between fate and trust that shapes the central tension of The Mountain Witch: the samurai must trust one another in order to survive, but can't trust one another because they all have ulterior motives. Make no mistake\u2014this is not a game that all the ronin are going to survive...\nDark Fate: Unholy Pact\nWhat Others Have Said About the Game\n\"I gotta say, playing The Mountain Witch has changed my future game designs. Like, other games have shown me how to do things that I thought were impossible; The Mountain Witch shows me something I didn't know about before.\" \u2014Vincent Baker, co-author of Apocalypse World\n\"The Mountain Witch is an important game in the history of tabletop roleplaying. Tim Kleinert's delicious combination of wide-open player agency and murderous constraint, all wrapped up in a mythic blood opera of honor and betrayal, blew a lot of minds, including mine. I have died on the slopes of Mt Fuji many times, at the hands of O-Yanma or my worst enemies or (often!) my best friends, and I can't wait to do it again.\" \u2014Jason Morningstar, author of Fiasco\n\"For a game so full of distrust and betrayal, [The Mountain Witch] somehow helps strangers to become friends and friends to be closer... An outstanding effect of 'Wham, Story' shared by everyone in play.\" \u2014Ron Edwards, author of Sorcerer\n\"I played a game of [The Mountain Witch] with several others back in '05 and the experience still sticks with me to this day.\" \u2014Robert Bohl, author of Misspent Youth\n\"The Mountain Witch ascends to the pinnacle of story-centric RPG design, while also being a sheerly beautiful physical artifact.\" \u2014Kenneth Hite, author of Trail of Cthulhu\nDark Fate: Desperately in Love\nWant to See the Game in Action?\nEric Vulgaris has a stream of the first session of play, covering character creation and the opening \"chapter\":\nThe Jank Cast has an audio recording of the entire game, played over three sessions: part #1, part #2, & part #3.\nDark Fate: Worst Fear\nMy Story with the Game\nHi, I'm Timothy Kleinert, also known as \"timfire\" across the web. \nI originally wrote The Mountain Witch for the Game Chef RPG design contest in 2004. Though my entry did not win, upon its broader release the game was met with immediate critical acclaim. In the years that followed, The Mountain Witch proved itself to be a major influence on the indie RPG movement, and to this day is still regarded as one of the premier games to have emerged from The Forge play and design culture.\nOver time, as I interacted with players, I developed new and more streamlined methods for explaining the game. This fostered a desire in me to write a new edition, but every time I attempted to do so, my life was interrupted with various hardships and personal losses. It began to feel as if The Mountain Witch\u2014much like the characters within it\u2014might be haunted by some sort of dark fate. So despite pleas from fans, I let the book fall out of print.\nOf course, time heals all wounds, and my life did level out. With things back in order, I was finally able to finish my long-awaited revision of the game. Only, this is where I need help from you all...\nDark Fate: Revenge\nWhy this Kickstarter Campaign?\nI am asking you all to help me fund the production of The Mountain Witch second edition. I am very excited about this new draft that I have completed, but I still need to send the text through the process of editing, layout, and\u2014the big one, of course\u2014printing. For this, I have set a base campaign goal of $10,000 [Achieved!].\nWith that amount, I will be able to publish the instruction book: a half-letter sized (5.5 x 8.5 in), perfect bound softcover, with full-color illustrations and around 150 pages.\nI will also be able to produce the game cards: an 18 card, poker sized deck of dark fates and zodiac signs, for use in character creation.\nAs a special offer for this Kickstarter campaign, I will also be producing a deluxe boxed set of the game: in addition to the instruction book and game cards, this set will also include color coordinated dice and trust tokens, as well as character and reference sheets.\nLastly, these funds will also help me produce a player introduction video: a 10-15 minute video that will outline all the major rules that new players need to know to jump in and start playing. No more need for the GM to spend valuable playing time explaining the game!\nDark Fate: True Motives\nStretch Goals\nSince per unit costs go down as production numbers go up, I will be able to bring in collaborators to contribute new and additional material as more backers join the project.\n[Achieved!] At $15,000, I will be able to bring in a number of writers to contribute additional mini-chapters:\nKira Magrann is lined up to write a piece on role-playing \"the outsider\" in feudal Japan, with a focus on gender and sexuality. Kira is a tabletop RPG designer, Youtube content creator, blogger, queer NB cyborg, and snake mom living in Columbus, Ohio.\nRafu is lined up to write a mini-primer on various topics related to traditional Japan. In addition to his gaming pursuits, Rafu also holds a MA in History of East Asia.\nI will also put together a digital supplement that contains alternate settings and rules variations conceived by players of the game.\n[Achieved!] At $20,000, I will be able to produce a short series of additional videos focused on GMing the game.\nDark Fate: Past Alliegance\nOther Contributors\nI want to recognize Joshua A.C. Newman (Mobile Frame Zero and Shock: Social Science Fiction) who will be reprising his role as layout and graphic artist for the second edition book.\nThank you for all the support, I am deeply grateful!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any printing project, delays or unforeseen costs may arise as I bring in contributors, send the text to editing and layout, or wait for the game components to be produced.

My name is Thomas Brush, and I've been making games since I was a teenager. Because of Kickstarter, the emotional story of an ex-minister's journey through Hell called Pinstripe was released to glowing praise in 2016 from Steam, The Washington Post, and TIME Magazine. After five years of solo development, I couldn't be prouder of what we released together.\nI\u2019ve also released two other award winning games, Coma (2010), and Skinny (2011).\nPete, Punky, and Jon are happy the grown-ups are gone. Simeon... not so much.\nAfter Pete wakes from a strange coma, he discovers things aren\u2019t exactly as he remembers. His home-town is overrun with naughty children, and the grown-ups have vanished.\nPete quickly learns of massive insects, child-eating zombie-parents, other-worldly puzzles, and intricate maze-like forts woven together throughout a large late-summer dreamscape. The same forts Pete and his gang built a year earlier are suddenly larger, stranger, and more dangerous than ever.\nThe adults are pissy zombies inspired by Gorey and Kenn.\nWith the help of your childhood pals, your pet bird, and your father\u2019s trusty razor blade, it\u2019s up to you to discover the secret of your missing sister and the bizarre world around you. To do this, you must learn various pieces of music written by your sister scattered across the world. Play them on your old piano to unlock secret passageways, clues, and new abilities for traversal across the increasingly threatening landscape.\nPete's razor blade is used for more than just shaving.\nLeave the safety of your home-town of Reddington, and fight your way through insect-ridden childhood forts, like The Spiderian Well, Bloodwick Hollow, Ashcliff, Fluffbucket Deep, and Blackfork Hospital.\nEngage your childhood pals in make-believe side-quests, like finding your best friend Preston\u2019s home-made Coma Cards, a fun little card game revealing secrets about the world, creatures, bosses, and characters, rumored to give you magical abilities.\nA piano-centric, beautiful soundtrack inspired by Debussy and Chopin. \nOld-school, simplistic Zelda-inspired adventure featuring hack-and-slash mechanics, monsters, and collectables. \nOccam's Razor aches for a painfully close shave.\nLearn to play the game\u2019s soundtrack on your piano. \n 6 Eyvind Earle-inspired, hand-drawn worlds (home-town, fields, water-well, forest, underwater, mountains, and more!) \nFight your way through a bizarre cast of enemy types and bosses! \nThat wonderful feeling of childlike wonder and exploration you used to get when you played games like Ocarina of Time, Super Metroid, and Super Mario 64. \nDid you and your buddies ever try and make a card game when you were kids? Pete and his buddies did, but they were stolen. Collect all Coma Cards for bonus abilities and outfits! \nEngage in hilarious dialogue trees reminiscent of Night in the Woods and Undertale. \nPete's friends are really mature.\nPete's been nominated by SXSW Gaming Awards and more!\nOnce Upon A Coma was lucky enough to be nominated by SXSW this year,  featured at PAX\u2019s Indie Mega Booth in 2017, and nominated for Best Action/Adventure at Denver DreamHack in 2017. I\u2019m extremely honored to be listed among some incredible games at these events. \nFollow me on Twitter!\nFollow me on Facebook!\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve wanted to make games. It all started when I was 3, watching my older brothers freak out when they opened the Super Nintendo on Christmas morning. But, believe it or not, after my first commercial release last year, I was burnt out, and wanted to quit indie game development altogether.\nSnake Head is mean, and reminds me of my insecure brain.\nPrior to Pinstripe's release, Serenity Forge and I began working on the bones of a 1:1 HD re-release of Coma, but I wasn't really feeling the project. Even worse, after Pinstripe's release, I found myself wishing I wasn't a game developer. I took some time off, and spent some time talking with Z at Serenity Forge, and my dad. They both encouraged me to look hard at what made Coma special. That's when I found the time to finally sit down and play the original, the game that millions of player enjoyed almost a decade ago. \nWe scrapped the original plan of creating an HD Coma remake, and decided on making a full-on sequel, with all new graphics, music, mechanics, characters, and a brand new plot. And that's when Once Upon A Coma was born.\nFrom Reddington Field to Ashcliff, Once Upon A Coma is super pretty.\nAlong with Serenity Forge, my friends and family continually reminded me of what made Coma so special, and ultimately, woke me up. They reminded me why my childhood dream of being a game developer was so important.\nThere\u2019s a very loud voice in my head that says I can\u2019t be lucky twice. To be honest, I\u2019m more frightened to launch this Kickstarter than the last one, because I know how important this is. Being an indie dev with a wife and brand new daughter is tough, but I know that I've proven myself to my fans, backers, and ultimately, myself, with my recent release of Pinstripe on Steam, Xbox, and PS4. I know that together, we can make an incredible game again, and this time, make it even better.\nAlthough it's a \"Thomas Brush Game\", some much needed coding and marketing support will be provided by some great friends.\nBecause of your support, and the support from Serenity Forge Studios, I can confidently flesh out Pete\u2019s strange adventure, and make it as epic as possible! I\u2019ll be partnering with a brilliant developer and a long-time Coma fan, Erik Coburn, who will code the game, giving me time to do what I do best: music, story, art, and game design.\nBless your heart, Preston. Too bad no grown-ups = no school!\nThe gaming community craves games like The Legend Of Zelda, but it\u2019s strange how rare games like these really are. Moreover, 2D adventure games done well are even rarer. My dream is to not only take inspiration from the Zelda franchise, but to also translate that into the classic side-scroller 2D space. It\u2019s a difficult challenge, but that\u2019s where your constructive criticism and encouragement comes in.\nExplore breathtaking environments.\nIt\u2019s also a story-driven adventure game about exploring a strange and beautiful world. That feeling that we all felt when we were kids is a huge theme in Once Upon A Coma \u2014 things seemed bigger, stranger, prettier, and more connected when we were children, and it\u2019s my goal to bring that sense of adventure to your PC, Mac, and Linux. \nOnce Upon A Coma is about 50% complete. The core mechanics, look and feel, music, and story have been completed. The remaining 50% of a game\u2019s development is notoriously known to be the most difficult, so your support through this expensive and exhausting phase is super important. \nSwingaroo across farting eggs like the good old days.\nFortunately, I've grown exponentially as a developer since my previous game's release. I\u2019m smarter than I was during the development of Pinstripe, and Erik Coburn and the team at Serenity Forge will ensure development is on schedule. Your support will pay for various production costs associated with making any game (localization, ratings, team salaries, equipment, etc.) \nWith your help, and the help of the team at Serenity Forge, Once Upon A Coma is scheduled for release in Fall of 2018 for Steam, GOG and GameJolt!\nCan we hit the Switch stretch goal? Let's do this!\nI've never considered myself a \"real\" musician. I can't really write or read music, but I know what makes me feel something, so I'll typically guess and check while I record piano until it feels right. That's why Once Upon A Coma's piano-centric soundtrack was heavily inspired by Claude Debussy's Clair de Lune. That song makes me feel something, and I knew I wanted to game to feel like that. \nEvery song you learn is part of the game's soundtrack.\nOnce Upon A Coma's prequel, Coma, and my other adventure game Skinny, received multiple music awards for their unique and atmospheric soundtracks. Like Pinstripe, Once Upon A Coma is unique in that the visuals, story, and music are all created by myself, leading to a rich world that is atmospherically cohesive and rich with emotion.\nFull transparency: Serenity Forge's investment in the game was a year ago, and revenue from Pinstripe is certainly helpful, but this is not enough to make Once Upon A Coma what I know it can be. That's where you come in. With your support, Once Upon A Coma can be taken to the next level. I can invest more time, energy, and resources into making it one of 2018's best indie titles, I know it!\nWhen I released the first Coma installment almost a decade ago, the game received resounding support from millions of players across the world, but Pete's world can be so much more.\nIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling to know that the Kickstarter community is, in a way, a safe-haven for indies like myself, similar to that of the Flash community years ago. An outlet that allows for not only pre-ordering, but also ways for you to get involved in the project, and ultimately ensure studios like mine can make great games, just like the good old days of Flash, Newgrounds, and Salad Fingers. Your support for games like Once Upon A Coma is essentially one of the few effective ways small studio\u2019s like mine can remain in operation.\nWith your help a beta build will be available for testing in July of 2018, and the final build in Fall of 2018. Once Upon A Coma will be released for PC, Mac, Linux, and maybe even Nintendo Switch, all because of you.\nBudget is subject to change.\nOnce Upon A Coma\u2019s total development budget including but not limited to this campaign is $158,000 USD (includes hours put in already + hours for this summer), coming from Pinstripe revenues and support from Serenity Forge. Serenity Forge will be providing development support from one of their brilliant developers, Erik Coburn, while also helping publish the project. Making a great game is difficult enough, so the support from Serenity Forge\u2019s marketing team will ensure the game is released to as many potential players as possible. \nThe Once Upon A Coma team is spread all across America. From the offices at Serenity Forge in Colorado, to the small home office of Thomas' Atmos Games Studios in South Carolina, we're small, young, but extremely dedicated to making profoundly impactful games. \n\"Nice to meet you 2018-Pete, I'm 2010-Pete. You're so handsome and dashing.\" Fan-art by @cremexbutter\nwww.atmosgames.com\nAtmos Games (aka Thomas Brush) is responsible for game design, story, art, music, and anything other than coding in Once Upon A Coma. \nwww.serenityforge.com\nSerenity Forge will be coding and distributing Once Upon A Coma. From near death experiences to rediscovering the American Dream, Serenity Forge makes games that are unique and meaningful.\nSome icons by on this page were designed by jr1018 from Vecteezy.

The unavoidable challenge of taking inspiration from a 3D adventure game and translating it into a side-scroller is certainly a challenge. Fortunately, I have a great team, including Erik Coburn, who is constantly researching, testing, and build a world that feels like Zelda, but works well in a 2D side scroller space. I've also had almost a decade of experience creating games of this nature, and feel confident I have learned what I need to to make an incredible side-scroller experience rich with Zelda-like mechanics and inspiration. \n\nI'd also like to be transparent about the schedule. Many of you know that my previous game Pinstripe took almost 5 years to make. An obvious challenge and question is: \"What's going to stop Once Upon A Coma from taking 5 years as well?\" Two things: first, my team. Erik Coburn is a genius developer, and has already built a system that would have taken me 2-3 years to create. I'm not kidding. Additionally, I've learned so much. About 75% of Pinstripe's creation timeline was due to inexperience, and frankly, learning on the job. I was also working part-time on Pinstripe. Now, I have a team, experience, and more than 40 hours a week to dedicate to the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Heartbeat", "descp": "I hear you!

He\u2019s a producer on the Netflix documentary series The Toys That Made Us (The Nacelle Co.), and in 2014, he released the documentary Plastic Galaxy: The Story of Star Wars Toys through his own production company, X-Ray Films. Plastic Galaxy is distributed world-wide by Gravitas, LLC, and is available on Amazon Prime, Hulu, iTunes, and most other digital outlets. Brian has written articles and produced videos for numerous magazines, web sites, and non-profits, including Guitar World (where he was also an associate editor), Future Music, Super 7, the music magazine Revolver (where he was also managing editor), and the New York Post. He is co-editor, with ArtOrder\u2019s John Schindehette, of the upcoming The Owlbear Almanac: The Handbook of the Owlbear Appreciation Society.\nCAVEGIRL PRODUCTIONS\nCavegirl Productions, headed by founders Kelley Slagle and Seth Polansky, began producing independent films in 2004, including 13 short films and the award-winning fantasy web series The Broken Continent, which successfully raised over $50,000 on Kickstarter. In 2014, Cavegirl released the award-winning dramedy feature film Of Dice and Men - \"a geek movie without the self-loathing\" - now available on Amazon Prime.\nIn 2016, Kelley was named a Docs In Progress Fellow, a selective program for emerging DC-area documentary filmmakers. Seth, a contracts, business and entertainment attorney, is also a sound designer and composer.\nBRIAN: I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the art of D&D. As a kid, the art was as important as the game, and I\u2019d spend hours just flipping through the pages and letting the illustrations inspire my own imagination. That love has stayed with me all these years, and the film is an opportunity to share it with the world. I also want to shine a light on all the artists who contributed to the game. Some have gone on to become recognizable names, but many deserve a lot more recognition than they\u2019ve gotten over the years. And finally, this is an opportunity to show how the art goes from concept to creation to publication - it\u2019s an insider\u2019s look at the process that goes into bringing this art to market.\nSETH: D&D has, for as long as I can remember, been a part of my life. My oldest, best friends are the people I\u2019ve gamed with throughout the years; some of my fondest memories include spending entire weekends curled up on my parents\u2019 couch just reading through the core books. In the intervening years, I\u2019ve come to realize that the images in those books have become an indelible part of my subconscious. This film is, in many ways, a love letter to my childhood - and an opportunity to share my love of the game and its art with the world.\nKELLEY: For the longest time, I was \"gamer-adjacent\" - and finally became a D&D player (and a miniature painter!) during the making of our feature film OF DICE AND MEN. The art of D&D is key to immersing yourself in these worlds and characters, and I'm thrilled to highlight this work and bring the behind-the-scenes to life!\n  With your help, we'll be able to complete post-production, including music composition and licensing, animation, and color correction. We will be able to submit EYE OF THE BEHOLDER to film festivals and gaming, sci-fi, and fantasy conventions. From there, we will seek distribution. Then, world domination!

Same game, but all-new Nations, Backgrounds, Advantages and Heroes!\nTwo years ago, 7th Sea: Second Edition broke every RPG record on Kickstarter. Now, 7th Sea: Khitai expands the world of Th\u00e9ah to the East, including new Nations like Fuso, Han and Shenzhou.\nKhitai is full of fantastic surprises: monster-filled mountains and seas, where gods walk the earth and spirits communicate with healers and mystics through ancient relics and visions.\nTwenty years ago, I helped tell the story of Rokugan\u2019s Clan War in Legend of the Five Rings. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve explored that territory, and this time, we\u2019re not just limited to Japan. We\u2019ve been talking about how to approach the the Pacific Rim for a long time. Now, we\u2019re ready to show you what we\u2019ve been planning.\nAnd if you want to look at 7th Sea: Khitai, you can download the Quickstart TODAY! It\u2019s got all you need to try out the game, including characters, mechanics, and a starter adventure!\nWhy Does It Matter?\nThe Big Question in 7th Sea is \u201cWhat does it mean to be a hero?\u201d I wasn\u2019t content with just the European answer. I wanted to include Heroes from all over the world to come play in our sandbox. 7th Sea: Khitai is a chance to allow the Eastern Hero into the world and bring more voices into the discussion.\nIn the East, the Hero\u2019s role is different than in The\u0301ah. The Call to Adventure is very real, a spiritual urge to travel toward one\u2019s destiny. It is not metaphor, but an inevitable pull all Heroes feel, a pull toward a duty that is greater than a Hero\u2019s own desires. The Song of the World brings these Heroes together to fulfill important roles.\nIn The\u0301ah, the Hero walks her own path. In Khitai, the Hero serves the World.\nIn The\u0301ah, honor is personal. In Khitai, it is supernatural.\nWhat\u2019s New?\n7th Sea: Khitai is a standalone game; you don\u2019t need any other books to play it. Khitai uses the same ENnie Award winning system from 7th Sea: Th\u00e9ah, but with new twists to make the game fit the concepts of the East.\nKhitai Heroes receive Hero Points based on duty rather than the Western Hero\u2019s passionate ideals. Eastern Heroes also have a new set of Traits: seven virtues players choose to personalize their own Hero\u2019s sense of duty to the World.\nAnd instead of Sorcery, Khitai Heroes invoke Mysticism: powers drawn from spiritual guides or your own unique past.\nKhitai character sheet mockup\nOf course, there\u2019s more. Each new Nation has its own unique Backgrounds with new Quirks and Advantages.\nBut most importantly, all the new mechanics from the East can be easily imported to your Th\u00e9an Heroes. All the rules in Khitai are 100% compatible with the rules from 7th Sea: Second Edition.\nWhat do you do in 7th Sea: Khitai?\nIn 7th Sea: Khitai, players take on the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and answering the Call to Adventure.\nAs a Khitai Hero, you might...\nSave the Daimyo of the White Fox Clan from assassination!\nLead the navies of Han against Fusoese pirates!\nTake on ten assassins with swords, knives, and guns all on your own!\nMake decisions that alter the very course of Khitai history!\nIn 7th Sea: Khitai, you are a Hero ready to live and die for causes that matter. You don\u2019t start off digging through old dungeons hoping to find a copper piece or two. No! You are noble samurai, a loyal yojimbo, or a mystical monk channeling the spirit of the World.\nIn other words\u2026 you\u2019re Sanjuro from Yojimbo, Yu Shu Lien from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Yeo Wol from The Pirates, and Zatoichi all rolled up into one!\nThis is a game of high adventure, mystery, and martial arts.\nThis is a game of intrigue and romance.\nThis is 7th Sea: Khitai!\nThe kingdoms of Khitai add a rich and diverse region to the face of the 7th Sea world. A more detailed description of each nation can be found in the Khitai Quickstart, available to download for free on DriveThruRPG.\nAgnivarsan Empire: A fertile, dense land made of tiny kingdoms, struggling to hold together among a dozen different courts and mysterious dense jungles.\nFuso: A powerful island nation devoted to military might and domination, standing on the brink of ascension to power\u2014if anyone can agree who ought to be in charge.\nHan: Once the cultural and cosmopolitan center of the East, but now little more than a province of Shenzhou, locked in a secret battle to reclaim its liberty..\nKammerra: A wild and deadly land, home to gigantic monsters, colossal animals, and ferocious supernatural threats, hiding a world of spirit as real to the locals as the material one.\nThe Kiwa Islands: A shifting collection of island nations across the southern Eastern Sea, where voyagers race to explore and claim territory, despite the danger of monsters rising from the turbulent depths..\nNagaja: A mandala of hidden kingdoms oft overlooked, where the ruler\u2014a god-king descended from serpents\u2014battles supernatural threats intent on overthrowing the government and taking it for themselves.\nShenzhou: The largest nation, diverse in geography and people, intent on bringing together all Khitai and then the rest of Terra in a single world nation.\nKhazaria: The gateway to Khitai, home of the great Khazar civilization that once controlled more territory than any other power in Terra\u2019s history.\nThe core mechanics of 7th Sea emphasize action and excitement. With a handful of d10s, a single Hero can leap from rooftop to rooftop, run along a tree branch, take out a group of brutes, intimidate the Villain, and flirt with the noble lord in the Villain\u2019s custody\u2026all with one roll!\nPlayers use Raises, which are sets of dice. Every Raise gives you one action. In 7th Sea, rolling dice doesn\u2019t tell you if you succeed or fail, but how much you succeed!\nThe GM creates Opportunities and Consequences for the players to deal with in each Scene. Players may have a lot of Raises, but they never have enough to deal with every problem in a Scene. So, they have to make difficult choices. Face down the Villain or rescue the farmer\u2019s family from a death trap? The players decide!\nCombine dice to create Raises\u2014sets that add up to ten. Every Raise gives you one action!\n  Khitai is not just a land of swords and spears. It is also a land full of mystery and mysticism. Players can take the roles of Heroic diplomats and mystics, hoping to find nonviolent solutions for Khitai\u2019s many problems.\nThe stoic monk who uses her ancient wisdom to calm the angry spirits. \nThe retired swordsman who only draws his weapon as a last resort.\nThe honorable diplomat who is the only honest heart in a den of vipers.\nYou can play all of these Heroes, plus many more, in the world of Khitai!\nPlayers can also explore the many mysteries of Khitai, including its mystical elements. Instead of sorcery, Heroes of Khitai invoke ancient spirits and ask for their power. Easy to use, but deeply evocative, the Khitai magic system rewards player creativity and roleplaying over everything else. One cannot simply command ancient spirits to do your bidding after all!\nOne book isn\u2019t enough! We want to explore all of Khitai and to do that, we need to hit some stretch goals. These allow us to expand the core line of sourcebooks and throw in some additional rewards for our backers. The last time we did this, we added eleven sourcebooks, a GM screen, three novels and even more. We\u2019re ready to do it again!\nWe\u2019re starting with one sourcebook already unlocked: Fuso!\nA land of valiant samurai, mystical nispa and mysterious kamuy. The Mikado and Shogun are in a covert struggle to control Fuso, but first, they must win over the Clans. Which side will you choose? The Fuso sourcebook contains more details on this Nation. New details on the Clans, more Backgrounds, more Advantages and Fuso\u2019s unique mysticism.\nHere's what we've got planned next...\n                 We hope to unlock even more stretch goals with your support! Stay tuned!\nWe're so excited to expand 7th Sea east of Th\u00e9ah and our reward tiers are packed with cool stuff. We\u2019ve got physical books, 2nd Edition PDFs, special play opportunities and beautiful treasures to fill an Emperor's chest!\nSince we\u2019re funding a whole line, we\u2019re handling rewards a bit differently than you might be used to on Kickstarter. When you back at a level that includes a sourcebook, you choose which sourcebook you get when the campaign is over through Backerkit. You're free to get any book you want or even snag multiple copies of the same sourcebook.\n****TRADING PDFs FOR ADD-ONS****\nPlease note that we are allowing $60+ backers to trade their 1st or 2nd Edition PDFs for a featured add-on at the end of the campaign. If you're not interested in receiving either PDF bundles, you will have the option of receiving a free featured add-on (dice, hero points, etc) from the list below. Thank you to all our awesome backers for their feedback!\nHere's a more detailed explanation of some of the other rewards you'll find in the sidebar of the Kickstarter page:\nSong of the World Adventures ($35 - PILGRIM and above reward levels)\nWe're expanding our 7th Sea Adventures line to include Khitai! These new adventures serve as a gateway to the East, with ready-to-play storylines and scenarios, allowing you and your friends a way to immerse yourselves in the game quickly and with a minimum of prep time.\nYou'll receive three (3) Song of the World adventures for Khitai as part of this reward level, two supporting the core rulebook and one supporting Fuso, our first supplement. As more sourcebooks get unlocked, we'll also be unlocking adventures to support each one, and you'll receive those too!\n7th Sea: 2nd Ed PDFs ($45 - SCHOLAR and above reward levels)\nHere's a list of all ten PDFs included from Second Edition, along with estimated official release dates for the last few books:\n7th Sea: Second Edition Core Rulebook \nHeroes & Villains \nPirate Nations \nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Volume 1 \nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Volume 2 \nThe Crescent Empire \nThe New World \nLands of Gold and Fire \nThe Colonies (Jan 2018) \nSecret Societies (Feb 2018) \nWe'll deliver these PDFs around December 1st, after everyone's pledges have cleared. In addition to these books, you get every Khitai PDF we unlock as we finish them, beginning with Fuso and continuing with everything we fund through this campaign.\nRemember that backers who are pledging at $60 or more can trade their 2nd Edition PDFs for an additional featured add-on. Thanks!\nFeatured Add-Ons ($80 - WANDERER and above reward levels)\nWe're starting our campaign with three featured add-ons: Khitai dice, Khitai hero points and a Khitai gamemaster screen. If your pledge doesn't include one for free (or you want more than one), you can add them on to your pledge for $20. \nChessex Jade Dice Proof\n  Hero Point Mockup\n  Khitai GM Screen. Art and design not final.\nLimited Edition Core Rulebook ($250 - MIKADO and above levels)\nWe are incredibly excited to present a new limited edition book for 7th Sea: Khitai:\nKhitai Limited Edition Core Rulebook\nEmperor's Chest ($250 - Mikado and above levels)\nIn addition the limited edition book, Mikado backers (and above) will also receive a collection of featured add-ons with their pledge: the Emperor's Chest. So far, the Chest includes:\nTen (10) Khitai Dice \nTwenty (20) Khitai Hero Points\nKhitai GM Screen\nPrint Map of Khitai\nWe'll add more to the Emperor's Chest as the campaign continues.\n1st and 2nd Edition PDFs ($250 - Mikado and above levels)\nHere's a list of all the books (39 BOOKS!) included in the 1st Edition collection (total retail value: $350+):\n7th Sea Villains Kit\n7th Sea: Compendium\n7th Sea: Game Master's Guide\n7th Sea: Game Master's Screen\n7th Sea: Players' Guide \nCathay: Jewel of the East \nChurch of the Prophets\nCrescent Empire\nFreiburg (Boxed Set)\nHeroes, Villains & Monsters \nIslands of Gold: The Midnight Archipelago \nKnights and Musketeers\nMightier Than the Sword \nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Avalon \nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Montaigne\nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Castille\nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Eisen \nNations of Th\u00e9ah: The Pirate Nations\nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Ussura\nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Vendel & Vesten\nNations of Th\u00e9ah: Vodacce\nRapier's Edge: Adventures in Th\u00e9ah\nScoundrel's Folly\nSecret Societies: Die Kreuzritter\nSecret Societies: Explorer's Society\nSecret Societies: Los Vagos\nSecret Societies: Rilasciare: The Free Thinkers \nSecret Societies: Sophia's Daughters\nSecret Societies: The Invisible College\nSecret Societies: The Knights of the Rose and Cross\nShips and Sea Battles\nStrongholds and Hideouts\nSwashbuckling Arcana\nSwordsman's Guild \nTangled Strands \nThe Arrow of Heaven \nThe Montaigne Revolution\nThe Sidhe Book of Nightmares \nWaves of Blood\nIn addition to these 1st Edition books, Mikado+ backers will also receive the entire 2nd Edition collection, including both Cities of Faith and Cities of Wonder (total retail value for both collections: $700+). Remember that backers who are receiving the 1st Ed collection can trade their PDFs for an additional featured add-on.\nWe've seen a lot of great questions about Add-Ons pop up during the campaign. Here are some answers to those questions!\nWill you be offering additional core rulebooks and sourcebooks as add-ons after the campaign?\nYes! You can grab additional copies of the Khitai Core Rulebook, any unlocked Khitai sourcebooks, AND the 7th Sea: Second Edition Core Rulebook and sourcebooks. The only books that won\u2019t be available as add-ons are the Limited Edition core rulebooks from both campaigns.\nCan I increase my pledge now and specify which add-ons I want after the campaign has ended?\nYes! The more that\u2019s pledged during the campaign, the more stretch goals we get to unlock! You can back at whatever reward tier you\u2019d like and enter a custom dollar amount when you select that reward. That amount will be added to your Backerkit account and can be used towards any add-ons you\u2019d like after the campaign has ended.\nI\u2019d like to adjust my pledge for an add-on. What add-ons are available now?\nThe Featured Add-Ons listed below are also eligible for the $60+ backer PDF trade:\nFeatured Add-Ons ($20)\n$20 - 7th Sea: Khitai Jade Dice\n$20 - 7th Sea: Khitai Hero Point Tokens\n$20 - 7th Sea: Khitai GM Screen\n$20 - 7th Sea: Khitai Map \n$20 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Bone Dice\n$20 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Hero Point Tokens\n$20 - 7th Sea: Second Edition GM Screen\n$20 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Deck of Heroes\n$20 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Deck of Villains\n$20 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Maps (multiple map choices available)\n Optional Buy Add-Ons\nWant to add an additional Khitai Core Rulebook or sourcebook onto your pledge? What about a Second Edition book you missed the first time around? Here\u2019s a list of additional Optional Buy Add-Ons available after the campaign:\n$60 - 7th Sea: Khitai Core Rulebook\n$40 - 7th Sea: Khitai Sourcebooks\n$60 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Core Rulebook\n$40 - 7th Sea: Second Edition Sourcebooks\n$25 - Sorte Deck\n$80 - Pirate\u2019s Booty Box (contains 7th Sea: 2nd Ed Dice, Hero Point Tokens, Deck of Heroes, Deck of Villains, and Sorte Deck)\n7th Sea is a game that spans the entire world, and our Kickstarter is no different. We're excited to send books to anywhere you are, including Europe, South America, Australia, and more! Thanks to Kixto Fulfillment, backers in the EU, CA, and AU won't pay any customs or VAT on their shipments.\nAfter shipping more than 15,000 books all over the world, we've got a good sense of what it takes to deliver on our Kickstarter promises. That said, each Kickstarter presents unique challenges for predicting shipping costs, including shipping across international borders!\nFor this project, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item. YOUR PLEDGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST OF SHIPPING. We will be using a pledge manager like Backerkit to collect information from backers and handle add-ons and pre-orders, but we will deliver each physical item by sending you a code you can redeem on our website, paying for shipping when you order the book. Each coupon will be valid for one year from the date of issue.\nWe\u2019ve used this coupon system for the last year to deliver rewards for the 7th Sea: Second Edition Kickstarter, and it\u2019s worked wonderfully to ensure that we are sending packages to backers\u2019 current addresses. In addition, you\u2019ll be able to group books together, saving on shipping by adding multiple items to one order.\nEstimated Shipping Costs\nDomestic Shipping: For traditional USPS shipping, we expect to charge $5 per package through our website. If you\u2019d like to get your package more quickly, we\u2019ll have new upgrade options to USPS Priority, UPS, etc.\nEU/AU/CA Shipping: We will (once again) be working with our fulfillment partners in the European Union, Australia, and Canada to ship books to backers with a minimum of fees. Typically, the cost to ship a 7th Sea package through these partners is $15-20. We will be offering new upgrade options that include tracking numbers, priority international shipping, etc.\nRest of the World Shipping: In general, we expect the cost to ship to the rest of the world to be roughly $20-25 per package. We will be offering new upgrade options that include tracking numbers, priority international shipping, but be aware that upgraded shipping will probably start at $100+.\nPDF Fulfillment\nWe'll be working with DriveThruRPG to fulfill your many PDF rewards!\nAfter you've added a PDF to your DriveThru account, it's accessible in your library forever. DriveThru has handled our PDF fulfillment for years and 7th Sea: Khitai will be no different!\nI founded JWP to give a platform for a wide spectrum of voices to show off their talents and contribute to our worldbuilding and game development, and I'm proud to continue that tradition for 7th Sea: Khitai.\nI'll be developing the corebook, but I've got a great staff working alongside me, including names you know from 7th Sea: Second Edition and some new folks we plan to bring along for the ride. I can't wait to show you what we've got brewing!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n7th Sea: Khitai marks the the eighth Kickstarter for John Wick Presents, following Wicked Fantasy, Wield, and\u2014of course\u20147th Sea: Second Edition.

If you backed 7th Sea: Second Edition, you know we\u2019re in the habit of keeping our backers up-to-date on changes and issues as they crop up, and we\u2019re experienced in fulfilling orders as rewards become available.\n\nIf there is any risk, it will be that of delays, as with any published product.

Beagle was turned into an animated movie. With music by America, voices by Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow, Christopher Lee, Angela Lansbury, Alan Arkin, and Tammy Grimes, and the immense talent of the animators and creatives who would later form Studio Ghibli, The Last Unicorn was an incredible film that gripped the minds and hearts of all who grew up with it. Though the movie was released decades ago, the music and iconic scenes and lines still echo through our minds. Sadly, there were only a small handful of things ever made for The Last Unicorn, many of them incredibly rare and hard to come by nowadays. \nViva La Classic 80s Movies!\nThat's where we come in! At Geekify, our mission is to capture the feelings and essence of those experiences that shape us and that we hold dear, and to create pieces of the fictional worlds we fall in love with. We recently acquired the licensing rights to create merchandise for The Last Unicorn as a personal passion of ours, and one which we want to share with the world. We've spent months drawing up plans, creating new artwork, building and designing samples and prototypes, and dreaming up the things we wanted to create. \nLast Unicorn Tarot Deck\nFrom collectible pin sets, to plushes and lifelike figurines, to tapestries and oracle decks, to costumes, we've got an entire lineup of new items in the works over the next year.  Our interactions with you and the community can help shape and create new things for all of us to enjoy. It's time for our generation to celebrate the greatness of The Last Unicorn, and for the new generations to learn what all the fuss is about.\nThe Last Unicorn Card - The Star\nOne of the ideas we've been turning around the longest has been a Tarot deck based on The Last Unicorn - the themes, the journey, the visuals, and the story all lend itself flawlessly to the nature and structure of a Tarot deck. Each character of the story is multi-faceted, facing their own challenges and having their own motivations, weaving a beautiful tapestry perfectly suited to the reflective and foretelling nature of the Tarot decks.  \nThe Last Unicorn Card - The Devil\nThe Last Unicorn Tarot Deck will be a full 78 card deck\n(no pip decks here!), laced with the lore and mythology of The Last Unicorn story as it pertains to the cycle and interpretations of the Tarot.  \nThe Rewards\nCustom art is pricey, and designing a full deck of 78 cards takes a lot of overhead, but the end result will be a gorgeous, fully complete Tarot deck, with each card printed on high quality glossy stock, finished with gilded edges, and shipping in a lovely box / bag for portability. These decks are true works of art, perfect for collectors, for dabblers, and for professionals.\nThe Last Unicorn Tarot Deck\nOf course, you'll need something to interpret your cards with, so also included is a card guide that provides interpretations for each of the cards of the deck, explanations of the lore, and how the art relates to the theme of your readings. This is where the symbolism of each card will get a chance to shine, and each guide will be sized to accompany the deck. \nCard Guide Example\nTo sweeten the pot just a bit, we've also got some lower tier rewards available to meet that sweet Last Unicorn merch craving you've had. We've got enamel pins and decals, available individually, or as mixed sets. Purchasing these further supports the Tarot deck project, though we will eventually offer these for sale in our store at a later date. \nPins - vibrant soft enamel pins to affix to your lanyards, your bags, your clothing. Metal-backed butterfly clasps with full coloring, these are made to draw the eye.\nThe Unicorn\nThe Red Bull\nMolly\nSchmendrick\nHaggard\nMommy Fortuna\nThe Butterfly\nPrince Lir\nThe Last Unicorn logo\nMagic Do As You Will (glitter)\nEnamel Pins\n  The Red Bull Enamel Pin\nDecals - high quality outdoor vinyls, perfect for a car or laptop, made to last several years (but removable without damaging paint jobs), in clean line art of the characters.\nThe Red Bull\nThe Unicorn\nThe Star\nThe Butterfly\nHave A Taco text\nMagic Do As You Will text\nand a few others, still to come!\nThe Team\nEach card is drawn by one of our creative team, with each artist is tackling a different suit. This project is being spearheaded by Adrianne Arachne as creative director for the deck. A professional astrologer, astounding artist, and Last Unicorn fan for life, Adrianne's talents and passions are perfectly aligned for this project, weaving the Tarot deck with The Last Unicorn story.\nAdrianne Tamar Arachne - Major Arcana\nhttp://www.facebook.com/adriannetamararachneart\nAnnika Burrell - Suit of Pentacles\nhttp://anikaburrellart.tumblr.com/\n\nHolly Federman - Suit of Cups\nhttps://hollyfedderman.carbonmade.com/projects/6237642#15\nSarah Barrie Fenton - Suit of Wands\nhttp://zealousceles.blogspot.com/ \nhttps://instagram.com/zealousceles/\nMedusa Dollmaker - Suit of Swords\nhttp://medusathedollmaker.com\nStretch Goals\nThe more money we can raise, the prettier we can make this project at the time of production. Foiling adds a level of expense to the cards, but the more we raise, the more dies we can make for foiling the cards. Other stretch goals will be upgrades for the existing tiers, including an ornate box for storing your cards in, upgrading the card guide and interpretation book to an exquisite leatherbound book, and fully foiling the cards. \n$20,000 - (UNLOCKED) Fully foiled backing for all of the cards\n$40,000 - (UNLOCKED) Upgrade to a fancy leatherbound guide book (faux leather / vegan option available!)\n$60,000 - (UNLOCKED) Ornate box for holding your cards\n\n$75,000 - (UNLOCKED) Fully foiled fronts for each individual card\n\n$100,000 - Signed deck card by Peter S. Beagle\nAt the encouragement of Peter himself, we are offering this as a $100,000 stretch goal. We will make a special 79th statement card to accompany your deck, which will be signed by Peter.

Beagle\n(John from Geekify here!)\nIn 2013, I had the honor of meeting Peter S. Beagle as part of the movie tour, and he was kind enough to answer every one of my questions, despite a long line of fans behind me, and take the time to make it a very personal visit. He was easily one of the humblest and kindest people I've ever met, and I was very fortunate to have met one of my favorite creative geniuses. \nJohn and Peter S. Beagle\nThere's been a lot of contention from fans and owners alike about the past and future of The Last Unicorn. Licensing and rights ownership are sometimes a murky thing, and creators don't always get the credit they are due. While our licensing agreement is with ITV (the rights holder for merchandise based on the movie) and is unaffiliated with Avicenna Development Corporation and independent of the recent legal contention, Peter has created something timeless for all of us, and we want to go above and beyond to show our appreciation.\nTo that end, to honor the author and creator we all love, we are voluntarily allocating a percentage of all of the proceeds directly for Peter's benefit, independently of our licensing agreement. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe good news is...we've done this before! We've already gotten our feet wet and our hands dirty with production and fulfillment a number of times, and even handled fulfillment for other Kickstarted companies, so we're launching into this with the full knowledge of just how challenging these things can be. From production slow-downs to supply chain backorders and development hassles, or under-budgeting for items and rewards, or spending all the Kickstarter money on too many pizza parties - there's a lot that can go wrong, and we've seen many campaigns fail for all the wrong reasons.\n\nLuckily, as a company that makes stuff, we've got the production and fulfillment part already in the bag. \n\nThe tarot deck is going to take an enormous amount of effort from our creative team, with several people working on it full time for months to get all the artwork done for a full deck of 78 cards, to do it the justice it deserves. We've lined up our production with factories we know and trust and have excellent working relations with, and have all of our production timelines in place, and we're budgeting six months for artwork and product completion. \n\nOur biggest hurdle is getting the word out there and getting awareness for the campaign, which we beg your help with.

A planet of flashing swords and choking sands, of winking courtesans and lantern-lit canal cities.\nMars, where fortune and heartbreak are two sides of the same obsidian chit, where lost cities and dry oceans stretch between the last bastions of civilization. Where the First Martians, the monument-builders, are but a haunted memory. Where the Red Martians become decadent and reckless in their last days. Where the Pale Martians rule the wastes, remembering a history whose weight would crush a lesser people.\n    Mars has canals... therefore, Mars must have Venice!\nCavaliers of Mars is a swashbuckling adventure setting from Rose Bailey, longtime developer of Vampire: The Requiem and other World of Darkness titles. Cavaliers draws inspiration from pulp fantasy and historical fiction, adding a modern edge and an exotic setting.\nCavaliers of Mars is powered by the DEIMOS system, in which a hero\u2019s motivations and approach to problems strongly influence her chance of success. In combat, heroes face off with their enemies in contests of tactics and chance.\nWHAT IS THE DEIMOS SYSTEM?\nIn the DEIMOS system, heroes are built from their Motivations (For Self, For Honor, and For Love), their Methods (With Cunning, With Force, and With Grace), and their Careers (such as Cavalier, Thief, or Courtesan). These traits are rated in die sizes, which are rolled as a pool against difficulty dice chosen by the GM. In Cavaliers of Mars, a hero's reasons and approach just as important as their background in solving a problem... or getting into yet more trouble!\nWhen our heroes must draw steel, players choose three dice to represent their character's actions, combining Strikes, Parries, and Stunts. All players roll their dice, then resolve actions in order from highest die to lowest. Players can also use their dice for special maneuvers like Ripostes or Disarms. Combining tactics, chance, and creative flair, Cavaliers of Mars evokes classic fight scenes such as those in The Adventures of Robin Hood, Scaramouche, and The Princess Bride.\nCavaliers of Mars is a new entry in Onyx Path\u2019s lineup of creator-owned games, produced in partnership with Rose Bailey and written by Rose Bailey, Benjamin Baugh, Dixie Cochran, Storn Cook, Steffie de Vaan, Meghan Fitzgerald, Jordan Goldfarb, Danielle Lauzon, Ethan Skemp, Lauren Stone, Travis Stout, Audrey Whitman.\nTo learn more about Cavaliers of Mars, you can check out the CAVALIERS OF MARS JUMPSTART RULES here at DRIVETHRURPG.COM:\nhttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?discount=9318cdfe08\nBACKERS ONLY:We'll be providing a link to the complete text for Cavaliers of Mars (barring last minute tweaks) in Backer Update #1.

All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Cavaliers of Mars is finished, and we are only looking at adding additional art to the book itself.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Cavaliers of Mars.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated on KSl.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via

The game doesn't limit your play with goals or objectives; you're free to have open-ended fun while you play with your food, without the mess to clean up afterwards. You are presented with scenes full of ramen noodles, boba tea, popcorn, and you mash buttons at will to interact with the food in curious and unconventional ways.\n  \"I'm hungry\" - Most people who play this game\nIn addition to foods, the game will also feature food related contraptions, such as the MEAT GRINDER, toaster, and more to be revealed. \nNour is the only game on the market that will find you questioning the ethics of putting a hoverboard in a meat grinder.\nThe controls in Nour vary from scene to scene. How do you find out what each button does? Experiment! Mash any key on your keyboard during the game and you'll get immediate feedback, which you can use to discover combinations of interactions throughout each scene. \nThe game features the Razer Chroma SDK, so if you have one of those fancy Razer Keyboards, the LEDs on the device will respond to the game! \nNour can also be played with the Midi Fighter 3D by DJTechTools! The kinetically satisfying buttons on the controller will make for a very tactile experience. \nHave a midi controller sitting around? Nour will respond to just about any USB midi controller that sends note signals! \nFeatured on Polygon and DR\u00d8ME magazine \u2727\uff65\uff9f: *\u2727\uff65\uff9f:*\n\"Ah yes, I like my toast extra burnt.\" - Pixelpop 2017 player\n  \"Hey wanna get some boba tea after this?\" - Pixelpop 2017 player\n   Many more scenes for the game are in the works!\nBento Box\nSushi\ndog food\nBlender\nAvocado Toast\nboneless pizza\nDonuts (this scene is going to be very dramatic)\nmore to be announced!\nI've been working on this project off and on for the past couple years. The idea has changed quite a bit from the first time I started modeling food. \nIn retrospect, boba tea was the real catalyst for the project. After trying it for the first time, I was so inspired by the flavors and various colors that I decided to 3d model it, just as an interesting art challenge. \nA lot of my influence happens to come from Asian foods. After creating boba tea art I followed up to it after having a real nice steamy bowl of ramen. After showing the ramen scene to friends both in real life and on Twitter, the response was unanimous; about everyone I showed the scene to said the same thing: \"I'm hungry now.\" So I decided to explore this idea: \nWhat are the exact colors that elicit the response of hunger? \nAnd that set me on the mission to create high-fidelity, interactive food art. The first time I made an interactive version of the game, it was controlled completely by keyboard: \n  Around that time, my pal Keiko introduced me to the work of Shawn Wasabi. I was completely entranced by the colors of the Midi Fighter, and knew I had to use it to control Nour. \nThanks to the kindness of Shawn and DJTechTools, they sent me a prototype of the Midi Fighter 64, and I hooked it up to Nour immediately! \nPLAY\n\n    I'm Tj Hughes. I like bright, saturated colors, bassy electronic music, and absurdist humor. Born and raised in St. Louis, and I grew up playing Sega Genesis and Gamecube. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Mortal Kombat II were the first games I remember playing, and since then, games have captured my interest as one of the most incredible, and widely unexplored creative mediums. I started making games when I was 13, after discovering the Unity game engine. After teaching myself through YouTube and Google, I started work on this really dumb FPS project that was gonna have multiplayer and zombies and RPG elements and all this other stupid stuff I honestly was never gonna finish. But it was a really great way to learn game design nonetheless! I used the knowledge I had gained to release my first complete game ever, Feesh. That was the first game I released under the name Terrifying Jellyfish.\nTerrifying Jellyfish is a solo Independent Games/Interactive company started in 2014! Based in St. Louis, I made it my goal to create subversive games, interactive experiences, live visuals, and merchandise, all based around aesthetics and color theory. Over the months and years, Terrifying Jellyfish has become associated with sparkly bright colors, endearing absurdity, and positivity. \nOther works:  \nFeesh (2016)\n  Technical Art on SmuggleCraft (2017)\n          I'm shooting for an early 2018 release! The alpha build of the game will be available as soon as it hits Steam! \nThe game shall be released on both Steam and Itch.io for PC and Mac!\nBefore this Kickstarter, I had committed to releasing this game no matter what, but this campaign will make the difference between Nour being just a fun demo, or a fully realized experience.\nMy goals with this campaign are to acquire the resources I need to realize this project to its fullest potential, spread the word about this niche & experimental game, and to put a ceiling over my head long enough to bring this project to completion. \nHaving been part of a successful Kickstarter in the past, I am confident that this campaign is what I need to make this game look and sound as delicious as possible. \nNOTE: All tiers above alpha takoyaki gets alpha access! \n  If you would like more than one of any of these add-ons, just add the total amount to your pledge! \n> 30k = Twitch Plays Nour\nExactly what it sounds like. If the campaign suprasses 30K, I'll use the power of the Twitch API to make a version of the game that'll be controlled via Twitch.tv chat. So viewers will be able to control the game by typing in commands like \"add noodle\" or \"fling chopstick\" or \"pop popcorn\". \n...\"add hoverboard\"\n> 65k = ???\nThis tier will be revealed once 30K is passed! \n- \nNour received the Pixelpop Select award this year at Pixelpop 2017!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs for the game being released, it's not really a matter of *if*, it's more about *when*. Because of how many different elements go into game development, unforeseen circumstances (like life) may cause the game's launch to be delayed. Though there are no technical hurdles, that is the main potential hitch. However, I plan on releasing the game no matter what. \n\nI have been doing game dev for about 8 years now, and I have been a part of two game releases, two Kickstarters, and one interactive museum installation. Which is to say, I know what goes into releasing a game, and I can be counted on to deliver everything I mention in this campaign. \n\nI am developing this project solo (aside from the music and sound), so it's on me to make the game as great as I can, and I believe the $25,000 goal will really allow me to do so. It'll buy me enough time to finish the game, and also hire the help I may need to make the best possible version of the game that I can. \n\nWith that said, thank you for your support. <3\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Steamy Ramen", "descp": "A digital copy of the game upon release, + Your name in the credits!

Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age.\nCultist Simulator is a narrative game that lets you play a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.\nWhat you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.\nSeduce; overawe; blackmail; recruit\nI'm Alexis Kennedy. If you've heard of me, it's probably because I founded Failbetter Games, where I made Fallen London (RPS: 'the bestest best words in gaming') and Sunless Sea (PCGamer: \"Haunting, sad, exciting and energising by turns... there's nothing else like it\"). Since I left Failbetter, I've been a guest writer at BioWare on Dragon Age, at Paradox on Stellaris, and Telltale on a mysterious R&D project.\nCultist Simulator is my first solo commercial release since Fallen London. It's as peculiar and experimental as Fallen London was back in 2009, but without the grind or the F2P business model. I've got a lot of it done, but I could use your help to make it sing.\nThe Door in the Eye, which illuminates, which navigates, which is not compassionate\nEACH HOUR HAS ITS COLOUR. EACH FLAME HAS ITS FUEL. DON\u2019T TRUST YOUR DREAMS.\nPluck at the surface of the world of Cultist Simulator, and you'll find succulent horrors wriggling beneath. The history we know arises from the struggles of the secret gods called the Hours: the Sun-in-Rags, the Red Grail, the Mother of Ants, the Witch-and-Sister, the Lionsmith...\nIn dreams, you can speak with the servants and aspects of the Hours. You may acquire inhuman appetites. You may find the doors of the Mansus, the place where the gods live and the dead go. They may join the ranks of the Long, the enigmatic immortals. They may rise much higher than that.\nSome Hours are malevolent. Some just embody passions too strong for human life. All are very dangerous. The Sun-in-Rags seeks to conclude endings beautifully. The Door-in-the-Eye illuminates the way, but is not compassionate. The Red Grail wants to devour and be devoured. The Lionsmith makes monsters, that he may grow strong and stronger.  Get mixed up with any of these, and the authorities may find you locked in your own attic, daubing paintings of impossible beauty on the walls. Or you might be the one to open the sky, and bring the cutting rain.\nThere's some Cthulhu Mythos in here. But there's less cosmic nihilism than Lovecraft, and more perilous longing. The setting also looks to the novels of Roger Zelazny, Mary Renault and Umberto Eco; to Anglo-Saxon poetry like The Wanderer and The Dream of the Rood, and mediaeval Welsh texts like The Battle of the Trees. And if you ever played the Mr Eaten content in Fallen London, or Salt's Song in Sunless Sea, you'll feel right at home.\nUnlike my previous work, CULTIST SIMULATOR may not feature cannibalism. It will however absolutely feature the ability to fling your sanity into your Great Work like coins into a well; and to destroy the world.\nThe Witch-and-Sister; who cannot be touched, who cannot be separated, who are pearl\nCultist Simulator is a narrative crafting digital card game, for release on PC, Mac and Linux. Choose an action, like Explore or Dream. Choose an object, like a Murmuring Amulet  or a Captured Investigator or a Moment of Contentment. Combine it with other objects to find new secrets and build up your resources.\nYou'll start with very little: your Passion, your Reason, some Funds, and a mysterious package from a benefactor. But you'll learn to combine them to unlock snippets of story, and grow your powers. Craft the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Recruit Believers and promote them to Disciples to serve as burglars, researchers, cat's-paws. Locate and pillage the Star-Shattered Fane or the Tomb of the Long. Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service.\nChoose your pawns carefully\nThe dangers are many. The Authorities have departments dedicated to suppressing supernatural menaces, like you. Investigators will track down the rumours of their loved ones' disappearance. Rivals will challenge you for occult pre-eminence. The Dead and the Names of the Mansus prey on unwary souls. And your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably.\nThe material world has both challenges and temptations. At the beginning, you'll need to make rent while you're haggling over forbidden tomes and transcribing your dreams. By the time you're running a mystic order, your disciples may keep you fed - or you may feed on your disciples.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere's a playable prototype here! This is early work - it has some placeholder graphics, placeholder audio, placeholder content, and only a fraction of the final content and mechanics. It doesn't have a save/load game option, it doesn't have variant starts and legacies, and there will be bugs. But it's a proof of concept.\n[Playable alpha]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"That terrible mood of depression of whether it's any good or not is what is known as The Artist's Reward.\" - Hemingway\nBut if you find success in your career? What if your colleague - or the investigator seeking your downfall - becomes your lover? The time may come when you have to choose between victory outside the world, and victory within it.\nThe Sun-in-Rags, which burns; which is distant; which is not as it was\nYou\u2019ll face trials and temptations. You\u2019ll be destroyed by inner demons, or torn apart by the red powers of the night, or ascend to the ranks of the Long and the Names and the Hours. But your heirs and students and victims may succeed where you failed.\nThe canonical way to succeed in Cultist Simulator is through enlightenment, ascension or destruction: learn the secrets of the Hours, become a higher entity yourself, or wreak vengeance on an uncaring world.\nOne step on a steep path.\nBut there are other endings - some more victorious than others. Retire peacefully. Start a family. Die, but haunt the dreams of others. Disappear, but leave your journal for another seeker. Betray your kind to join the Suppression Bureau, which prosecutes those criminals whose crimes exist only in dreams.\nOccultists don't get pensions.\nWhy would you do this? Often, because the story's led you to a place that feels like an interesting choice. But also, because it affects future characters. Legacies allow you to leave something behind for another character - a journal, a bequest, an orphan. The Adversary who destroyed you may remain - a threat but also a promise, like a story-driven corpse run. And you may become a Haunting -  a shell of your former self, there to torment or assist the new character.\nSuppressed books by the notorious Teresa Galmier\nIt\u2019s common for Kickstarters to offer (for instance) an alpha-access tier, a beta-access tier, a standard tier and a bunch of extra-in-game-content tiers. On top of that some Kickstarter games do Early Access or some other sort of paid alpha for non-backers.\nThis is a perfectly decent way to raise a bit of extra cash. Lots of well-run Kickstarters (including Sunless Sea) have done it, and done it well. But it\u2019s also a surprising amount of work \u2013 not just the admin of managing separate sets of keys and emails, not just the technical overhead of multiple builds, but also the work of communicating all this to the community. \u2018Uh, I bought the early beta version. Does that mean I get the lifetime DLC guarantee? or is that just for Early Access?\u2019\nSo Cultist Simulator has just one tier: Perpetual Edition. Perpetual Edition means: you buy the game before full launch, you get access to early builds and any and all DLC and expansions free forever.\nIf I release the game on Steam Early Access or itch.io\u2019s Refinery or GOG\u2019s Games in Development or anywhere else, that\u2019ll also be Perpetual Edition. I\u2019m probably leaving some money on the table by doing this, but I am also leaving a lot of confusion and busywork on the table. And it feels cleaner and more egalitarian.\nThe Thunderskin is among the chiefest Gods-from-flesh. He cannot be stilled; he demands the dance; he is beaten, like a drum.\nMartin's digital narrative card game: www.noprophet.com\nCatherine's portfolio: www.catherineunger.com\nTom and Sophie's D&D site coming soon: www.clockworkcuckoo.co.uk/inventory\nSarah's portfolio: sarah-gordon.com\n30K is a much smaller total than previous Kickstarters I've worked on. Sunless Sea raised 100K, and Sunless Skies [with which I'm not involved! but my old studio is] raised more than three times that.\nCultist Simulator is a game of deliberately modest scope. The main purpose of the funds is to pay my freelancers (and to finance the few physical rewards). Any funding over the target will help make the game better.\nBut every game I've helmed has been made in the open, and has been better for it. The funding is important, but the active participation of the audience is even more so. I want to make the game. But I need you folks to help me find what you'll love.\nAnd what you'll fear, of course, too. One of those things is stronger.\nGildersleeve's Latin Grammar and The Orchid Transfigurations: a feast\n03/09/2017 - I said above: 'Any funding over the target will help make the game better.' I've spoken to the current backers, and the response was overwhelmingly 'We backed the project, not the possibility of stretch goals. We want the best game possible. Don't do anything that might imperil the project.'\n\nConsequently, I've chosen ultra-low-cost extremely minimal stretch goals only... and a single slightly more ambitious one if we make it all the way to 100K.\nUnlocked so far:\nPlen-tea\nWYRM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPluses: My last Kickstarter (my third) was for Sunless Sea, which won awards and things, and managed an 81% on Metacritic.\n\nI have eight years of game dev experience and almost twenty years experience in tech. I'm being careful about the modest scope of the project. There's already a playable alpha of the game.\n\nMinuses: this is a one-person project. I have freelancers to help, but if I get seriously ill or am hit by a vehicle of significant size, they can't pick it up. This is the biggest risk.\n\nI have two days of work still scheduled with another Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshuameadows/alcyone-the-last-city-interactive-fiction-video-ga). But it's only two days.\n\nIt's possible that I may lose freelancers to other work. The thing about working with good people is that they're always in demand. Martin , my UI resource, is launching a game of his own, Nowhere Prophet, so his time on the project may be curtailed. But we're confident there should be enough time in his calendar, and I can always find another UI freelancer.\n\nI also have a smallish child, and occasional bouts of depression. So there may be delays. But I built Fallen London eight years ago with a baby in the house and no money, so the precedents are good.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "You'll get a Perpetual Edition copy of the game.

We all love games that help us express ourselves and our unstable tendencies, but nothing we played was quite as destructive as we wanted. We still had aggression to get out. We started working on the concept for a violent Unicorn game right away, and pretty soon the whole team was obsessed.\nWe spent months carefully calibrating and balancing the game through extensive play testing. Honestly, that was kind of selfish because it was super fun.

Most cards also feature:\nHumorous made-up quotes\nSilly objects\nVisual puns\nIf you're opposed to these things you will NOT like this game.\nWhen someone suggested I make an Itchy Feet-themed card game, I loved the idea but had no idea where to begin. Lucky for me, Canadian game designer, polyglot, traveler and all-around lovely human being Maxime Rioux (above left) volunteered his services. \nFor more than a year and a half we've been brainstorming, designing, scrapping, re-designing, experimenting, tinkering and testing, testing, testing.\nWe started long distance (I live in Germany, Maxime in Quebec), using a half-defunct web-based software called Tabloro to fiddle and test, including many very fun sessions with Itchy Feet fans over Skype (thank you, friends!).\nThen we played with handwritten flash cards, refining and re-jiggering and trying new ideas. We've been absolutely ruthless with it, only hanging on to the very best parts and cutting away any and all fat. \nWe wanted to create a game that was: \nSimple to learn\nInteractive\nFun to replay again and again\nNeither of us are huge gamers, so this was a high bar. It had to be something that we would love. With Itchy Feet: the Travel Game, we really believe we've succeeded. Our testers have been knocking our door down, wanting to keep playing. Everyone who's played it has been bowled over by its charm, simplicity, and good fun.\nWe really think you're going to enjoy it, too.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game is finished and ready to go, so I'm confident we can make this happen.

The touch of the sun burns your grey skin, and you hide from the light in twisting corridors, crumbling temples and the lawless undercity of the metropolis known as Spire. The high elves, rulers of the city, alien and capricious, allow you to live here as an underclass forced to beg for scraps.  \n\nYour religion, your culture, and your people are being destroyed all around you. You have seen your fathers, your mothers, your grandparents subjugated by the high elves, and you have had enough. You have joined the resistance: the ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, worshippers of a forbidden goddess.  \n\nYou have sworn in blood that the high elves will fall, that you will destroy them through subterfuge, and insurrection, and terror.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n\u00a327,000 - FUNDED! Secrets Kept From the Sun. A tome of elven opsec and spy-versus-spy skullduggery in the Spire, written by Chad Walker, author of Cryptomancer.

With Spire, he and Chris Taylor have carved out a compelling space for us to play in, too -- a dark, desperate setting that nonetheless has room for hope and beauty, and looks very different from the familiar worlds of mainstream roleplaying games.\u201d - merritt k, host of Woodland Secrets, designer of Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You \n\"I'm so glad you guys are creating another game together.\" - Rob Heinsoo, lead designer on D&D 4e and 13th Age\n\u201cSpire deals with skills in a way that makes every check as interesting and as much of a threat as combat, the world feels huge and unique, and the classes are just beautifully ridiculous.\u201d - Dylan Malenfant, playtester  \n\u201cSpire is a tinderbox of evocative potential weaved together to form the most compelling setting I've read this decade. It features the kind of resonance Neil Gaiman aims for on a good day.\u201d - Sean Smith, author of Exuviae \n\"This setting is really dazzling. I want to try out these characters!\" - Jason Cordova of The Gauntlet podcast\n \"So you're telling me one of the classes just comes with a hyena? 'Core abilities: Hyena' is what you should put on the cover instead of review blurbs.\" - General Ironicus of the Six Feats Under podcast\n  \u201cI've never said 'I want to use that' so many times as when making my Spire character. Every word reinforces the eerie setting, and the mechanics fizz with a perfect blend of weirdness, power and risk.\u201d - Clare Jones, playtester \n\"Grant Howitt always seems to be involved in the kinds of games that make me wish I had more time to play games \u2013 and more time to write games. Always inspiring and challenging. The Spire is no different, with a strong focus on storytelling, the mechanics geared towards great roleplaying in a world that offers something we\u2019ve not seen before. The sort of game experience that\u2019s not just fun, but actually rewarding to play.\" - Gav Thorpe, author of Inquisitor and, like, half the Warhammer 40k universe\nWHAT IS THE SPIRE?\nSpire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It\u2019s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. \nSpire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. \nIt is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. \nIt is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men\u2019s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians. \nThe book contains: rules for creating, advancing and playing a character; reams of setting information loaded with hooks and plots for your campaigns; advice on how to run a game of Spire (whether you\u2019re a first-time gamesmaster or a seasoned storyteller); loads of evocative art from Adiran Stone; and a smaller variant of the full, A2 map of the city. It's a beautiful book, too - we wanted to create the nicest possible thing to house our ideas. \nWhat's more, if you back us at a level that allows access to additional content past the core book, you'll be able to immediately download our quickstart adventure, Blood and Dust. Blood and Dust comes with all the basic rules, five sample characters (with some room to advance) and an adventure that should last around three individual sessions of play.  \nHaving run two previous Kickstarters, we've learned that shipping costs are almost always higher than you initially expect. In the past, we've gone with cheaper shipping options only to run into issues with delays and damaged products, so this time we've tried to find an option somewhere between hand-delivering every book ourselves, and throwing them out of a plane and hoping. We're using Mail Workshop in Nottingham for fulfilment, and they will be shipping out international packages using Airmail, in die-cut boxes with bubble wrap to minimise potential damage. We're making no profit on shipping, just covering our costs - and it means we can guarantee that shipping and fulfilment won't cause issues with the finances or with the delivery of the final products.\n THE RULES \nSpire uses a straightforward D10-based system to resolve conflicts. It focuses on storytelling over simulation: the more skilled and knowledgeable the character is about the action and the location it takes place in, the more D10s they roll, and pick the highest. Generally, rolling higher is better, but most of the time - succeed or fail - characters will accrue stress as part of the action. \nThe more stress a character has, the more chance that it will hurt them in the form of fallout - serious repercussions that they\u2019ve earned for pushing their luck too far. (Or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.) Spire doesn\u2019t weigh physical, mental or emotional damage differently - they\u2019re all treated the same, and they\u2019re all at stake when you work for the resistance. \n HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES?\nSpire offers players a chance to take part in a fantasy revolution, and to fight back against those who oppress you. Unlike many games, the monsters aren\u2019t out in the wilderness; they\u2019re living above you in obscene luxury, dominating your people in the aftermath of a brutal war. Spire tasks players with changing the city, whether for good or ill, and that\u2019s how they gain experience and new abilities. \nSpire has a unique setting, and the rules have been written from scratch to embody the fiction at all times. You don\u2019t just play a Ranger: you play a Carrion-Priest, a hyena-worshipping death cultist. You\u2019re not a Rogue: you\u2019re a Bound, and you pray to the small gods in your ropes to stop you from falling off the side of the city. You don\u2019t just play a Fighter: you play a Knight of the North Docks, a member of a long-fallen order of nobles who once upon a time defended the honour of traders and travellers, but who now swagger about in flashy quarter-plate and operate an alarmingly wide variety of bars. \nWe\u2019ve taken the common tropes of D&D (and other fantasy mainstays) and adjusted them to mesh with our own world, so while there\u2019s plenty that\u2019ll seem familiar to any seasoned roleplayer, there\u2019ll be something in there to surprise everyone, too. \nWHO ARE YOU? \nWe are Mary Hamilton, Grant Howitt and Chris Taylor, and our business name is Rowan, Rook & Decard. This is the third Kickstarter that we\u2019ve organised, and both previous projects - Goblin Quest and Unbound - funded well-over budget, and we delivered our products to people both online and in physical forms. \nGrant\u2019s solo work includes Honey Heist, The Witch is Dead, Royal Blood, One Last Job, Warrior-Poet and a wide variety of short-form, story-focused RPGs. He was also in the team that co-wrote the latest edition of Paranoia. Spire is his first opportunity to be part of a team writing a full original setting and the system to support it, and he\u2019s excited to share the results with you. \nWe\u2019re working with seasoned professionals who we know well. Adirian Stone  is creating the art, Alina Sandu is handling the layout, and Harry Goldstone is doing proofreading. They all did a fantastic job on Unbound and we\u2019re happy to work with them again. \nWe\u2019ve also teamed up with Tim Wilkinson Lewis, illustrator on Goblin Quest, to create an A2-scale map of Spire itself; every centimetre of the paper is crammed with detail and hooks for your stories. \nThis is Tim's map of Spire; as you can see, there's an absurd amount of detail here\n    We understand that the content of Spire mirrors real-world political, social and racial struggles, so we\u2019ll ensure that the manuscript is checked by several sensitivity readers. \nTim's also in charge of creating the exclusive newspaper clippings that come with the higher backer levels\nWe\u2019ve decided to commission a UK-based printer and fulfil from a single location this time. Our experience with Unbound showed us that distributed printing, while cheaper, comes with risks, and we want Spire to be the most beautiful book on your shelf. We\u2019re hoping to print with CPI, who have lots of experience with short run projects like this and are the printers working on Cthulhu Dark; if the game sells really well and we need a longer print run, we\u2019ve lined up Belmont, who print books for Games Workshop. \n WHAT AM I PAYING FOR? \nThe rules of Spire already exist, and we know that they work. We\u2019ve written, rewritten, tested, re-tested and designed a game we\u2019re genuinely proud of and that we think is beautiful. You\u2019re paying to make that game into a physical product that\u2019s as beautiful, dark and interesting as the rules and the world it contains. \nPrimarily, you\u2019re paying for the cost of art and layout, which we like to pay fairly for. You\u2019re also letting us access the economies of scale available when we order larger print runs of books. Finally, you\u2019re paying for Chris and Grant, the writers of Spire, to earn significantly less than part-time UK minimum wage, but still some money, for their work, and Mary, the producer, to take a small cut too. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs ever, unforeseen events can slow down or impede the progress of the game, but we\u2019ve done our best to leave room in our plan for them. This will be our third project on Kickstarter, and Mary has steered us successfully through bringing the previous two to fruition. \nThroughout Unbound, our previous Kickstarter, we worked hard to be transparent with our supporters and communicate with them to outline the ongoing status of the project, and we don\u2019t want to work any other way. We\u2019ll be updating you with news as and when we get it so you can stay abreast of what\u2019s going on with your book. \nWe\u2019re also running a Discord channel for backers who pick a deluxe package, so that you can talk among yourselves and also get access to sneak peeks, updates and new info as we go along. The rules and setting information sections - the bulk of the book - is entirely complete, and we\u2019re just putting the finishing touches to the GM section as the campaign runs.

James D\u2019Amato and the team at ONE SHOT took inspiration from sports and professional wrestling to create The Dungeon Dome. A fictional gladiatorial arena where teams of over-the-top heroes battle for wealth and glory, and the audience actively shapes the world.  \nInstead of telling the story of a single party adventuring in a fantasy world, The Dungeon Dome will follow several teams of gladiators as they face each other in death matches and challenges. We\u2019ll follow these characters in and out of the ring through live streams and podcasts. Season 1 will be at least 15 live streamed episodes that follow two main storylines.\nViewers will be able to affect the world of The Dungeon Dome by cheering for their favorite teams, which gives them inspiration and the ability to perform special moves in the game. Backers will be able to take their participation a step further by submitting ideas for items, relics, characters, and matches that will appear in the story.   \nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nONE SHOT currently has all of the basic materials we need to run this game except for time. Our studio is equipped with all the technology we need to give you the best view for the weird and wonderful world of The Dungeon Dome. The one thing I don\u2019t have is time. With a full time day job, I can\u2019t manage The Dungeon Dome in addition my other responsibilities at ONE SHOT.\nSo, in order to produce this ambitious game, the majority of the money raised by this Kickstarter will provide me with the income I need to leave my day job for good. The rest pays performers, crew, and provides us with a modest budget for props.\n$1+ Tailgate Crew\nJames will thank you in a special podcast episode where he thanks everyone who supported The Dungeon Dome.\n$10 Lower Circuits\nYou will get a copy of The Dungeon Dome PDF with all of the fan-created content after Season 1 has aired. This means you'll get stats for crits, fails, items, traps, monsters, and matches that you'll see on Dungeon Dome broadcasts.\n$25 Roaring Crowd\nEveryone in the live audience will be able to interact with the story and change the fate of the fighters. Backers get the opportunity to go further. You\u2019ll have the ability to send in ideas for critical hits and fails that get added to a pool that are randomly rolled or drawn in all broadcasts of The Dungeon Dome.\nSubmissions for critical hits and fails will be drawn randomly as we encounter critical hits and fails throughout the story of The Dungeon Dome. Because this is random, it means some submissions may not appear in the story. Submissions will be released digitally after the finale of Season 1 for all backers to use in their home games.\nThe majority of The Dungeon Dome will be broadcast live through Twitch. It will be a wonderful and interactive experience for everyone. However, the quality of streaming videos on Twitch is not perfect. To give our backers the highest quality experience we are making high quality VODs available exclusively to backers.\nRoaring Crowd backers will also get access to podcast versions of every Dungeon Dome event. We\u2019ll take the audio for every Dungeon Dome match and edit it to make sense as a purely audio experience.\n$35 Front Row Seats\nThe story of The Dungeon Dome is larger than the stories that will be streamed for general audiences. The full story of the champions battling in the dome will be told through supplementary podcasts that will be released between the streams. Backing at this level gets you access to them.\n$45 Honored Dead\nIn The Dungeon Dome fallen competitors who fell short of glory are given a second chance as animated skeletons. It\u2019s a practice that is a bit macabre, and probably works best if you don\u2019t think about it too hard.\nIf you back at this level you can join this bizarre tradition by providing a name for one of the skeletons that will appear Season 1 of The Dungeon Dome. Everyone who backs at this level will be able to name one skeleton that is guaranteed to make it into a match. We can\u2019t guarantee how effective your skeleton will be, because that\u2019s up to the dice!\n$50 Mimics\nIf you want to have a greater hand in the chaos in The Dungeon Dome, backing at this level will allow you to submit items that can be found in chests hidden throughout the arena. These items can be helpful, like healing items, or harmful, like cursed weapons. It\u2019s all up to you, if you back at this level.\nItems will be randomly drawn, so we cannot guarantee a particular item will appear in a match. However, like the critical hits and fails, items will be sent out in a digital packets so other Dungeon Dome fans will be able to appreciate your clever work.\n$100 Deadly Traps\nThe Dungeon Dome is more than a patch of grass where blood is spilled. It\u2019s a diabolical contraption built to challenge the wisest and bravest heroes. Part of that is the creative and diabolical traps hidden in every match.\nAt this level you can be a part of Dungeon Dome history by creating one of the traps that will appear in Season 1. This level is limited to try and insure every trap will be used, but it is up to players to trip them. No matter what, every backer generated trap will be immortalized the digital packet sent out to Dungeon Dome backers.\n$150 Dandelion Club\nThe monsters of The Dungeon Dome, like the champions, are willing combatants. The arena has a cast of popular and powerful monsters like Dandelion the bone devouring lich horse. Backers at this level will work personally with James to create unique monsters who will challenge Dungeon Dome champions over the course of Season 1. Monsters created for this level are guaranteed to appear in a Dungeon Dome event.\n$250 Box Seat Sponsor\nFans have been beating down the doors to see sponsors and care packages similar to the Hunger Games appear in The Dungeon Dome. Backers at this level will work with James to create an NPC or business that will affect the world by sponsoring fighter, monsters and events. Any characters created at this level are guaranteed.\n$400 Corporate Sponsor\nLike any other sporting association, The Dungeon Dome depends on the support of advertisers to mitigate costs. You can take advantage of this by becoming a real world sponsor of The Dungeon Dome. If you back at this level your logo will be hung on the dome set, a single match will have your logo displayed on screen, and we will produce a commercial with Dungeon Dome characters endorsing your product.\n\nSponsorship spots also come with a pre-roll ad on the ONE SHOT Podcast which costs $160 on its own.\n$500 Dungeon Masters\nThe Dungeon Dome thrives on creativity and guile. Most of the matches we see are devised by the wizard Kazoodle, commissioner and commentator for The Dungeon Dome. However, occasionally guest dungeon masters are invited to spice things up.\nBackers at this level will personally work with James to create a match guaranteed to appear during Season 1. It\u2019s a great opportunity for ambitious dungeon masters with something to prove to show off their stuff.\n$1000 A New Challenger Approaches\nYou and a friend will make characters and fight in a Dungeon Dome Exhibition match against a Team of your choice. If you are willing to travel to Chicago this match can be in person, otherwise it will be held online.\n\n\nRetweets\nDepending on how many times people retweet this tweet, we'll release the following rewards: \n100-I will film myself giving my dog Ollie a treat for being a good boy. -COMPLETE\n200- Compass Cats lineart shirt -COMPLETE\n250- Compass Cats promo\n300- We\u2019ll release the character art for our new team: The Ladies Disdain\n400- We\u2019ll release The Ladies Disdain team shirt design early.\nFacebook Post Shares\nDepending on how many shares this Facebook post gets, we'll release the following rewards:\n50- I will film myself telling my dog Ollie that he is a good boy. -COMPLETE\n100- Unlocks a Compass Cats logo shirt \n150- Starlight surprise promo\n300- We\u2019ll reveal Character art for our new competitors: The Nothing\n400- We\u2019ll release The Nothing team shirt design early.\nTeam Hashtags\nThe Team with the most people tweeting their hashtag with #DungeonDome will get a new team shirt before the End of Season 1.

Once its posted, email a link to: contests@oneshotpodcast.com\nWe\u2019re looking for entries as over the top and silly as possible. The winner will get to decide on a new shirt design for the ONE SHOT store.\n\n\n$18,000 Funded!\n$19,000 Tipping the 1s and 2s The stream operators like Pat and Mel work hard to insure you have the best view of the action. If we hit 19k we can give them better compensation for that hard work.\n$20,000 Better Sets We can afford more elaborate environments for the Dungeon Dome instead of using odd bits of cardboard and coins to represent abstract ideas.\n$21,000 Glorious Gird The Dungeon Dome will be guaranteed to have an official championship belt!\n$22,500 ???\n\nWe\u2019ll be drawing on some of the most talented folks in the\nimprov and gaming community in Chicago.\nArt by Will Kirkby\nStephen Kropa and Mike Migdall as The Compass Cats \nAtop the dark and rocky Cliffs of Armoire sits The Pale Moon Palace and the magnificent queen Felicia sits atop her throne. At her left and right hands are The Compass Cats, the greatest champions of Arimore. Percival the Unwavering who commands the Justice Legion to the East, and Small Benjamin who commands the the Suicide Squadron to the West. They fight for the glory of Arimore with the charisma and honor of warriors who are vampires and also cats. Did we forget to mention they are vampire cats?\nYou might know Mike Migdall and Stephen Kropa from their performances as Binbon and Jubna on the Campaign podcast. Mike Migdall is also a co-host of the NeoScum Podcast.\nArt By Beka Black\nKat Kuhl as Mega Starlight Surprise\nIn the final thrilling round of The Dungeon Dome Tag Team Championship a mysterious challenger entered the arena and battled Team Rocks Let just before they could claim their wish. Starlight is powerful, charismatic and brash. We don\u2019t know much about Starlight, but we hope to see more of her in The Dungeon Dome.\nKat Kuhl is the host and GM of the Campaign Podcast, and co-designer of Noisy Person Cards. \nArt by Aviv Or\nPat O\u2019Rourke and Aram Vartian as Team Rocks Let \nTeam Rocks Let is the first dark elf team to qualify for The Dungeon Dome, and nearly won the tag team championship. Despite their amazing story, they were not audience favorites due to their cruelty in and outside The Dome. Jessi in particular was nearly the only character voted down to die in the Tag Team Championships. Their skill is tantamount to their cruelty. Even without the support of the audience, Team Rocks Let easily defeat their opponents advancing to the champion spot. The only competitor who gave them pause, was Starlight Surprise.\nAram Vartian is the creator, host, and GM of the Godsfall podcast. You\u2019ll recognize Patrick O\u2019Rourke from his multiple appearances on the ONE SHOT Podcast and as the GM of The Dungeon Rats Podcast.\nArt By Donna B\nAli Barthwell and Liz Anderson as The Murder Small town heroes of the lower circuits, The Murder delighted fans by finally getting called up to The Dungeon Dome. Just the Miz is described by her fans and hype man Dandy Gorton as a hero and visionary. While this is debatable, their official stated reason for participating in Dungeon Dome events is to \u201cconstruct a flying machine.\u201d If they managed to pull that off, it would certainly change the world as we know it. \nAli Barthwell and Liz Anderson have been on multiple ONE SHOT series. Ali maintains a popular recap column for The Bachelor and Bachelorette on Vulture. \nDrew Mierzejewski and Bill as The Nothing\nBenjin Direweir and Claw\u2019dshare the most recent fighters sponsored by Asmodeus Lord of the Abyss and Prince of hell. Hellborn fighters typically do well in The Dungeon Dome, but they burn out quickly. Many do not last longer than a season. The Nothing has entered the Dome with the dramatic flair we\u2019ve come to expect from hellion fighters. Whether they will suffer the fate of their predecessors, remains to be seen. \nDrew is an actor, gamewright, and game master for Warda on the ONE SHOT Twitch stream. Bill is also an actor who can be found in local productions around Chicago. \nAly Grauer and Kate Booth as The Ladies Disdain\nFrom the dark and fey ruled wilds of The Incredibly Dangerous Forest, comes the shining nobility of The Ladies Disdain. Bealan and her partner Galatea combine ferocity and style, commanding a rabid fanbase outside The Dungeon Dome. Unshakable in all of their other exploits, it will be interesting to see how they stack up against some of the greatest fighters in New Celia.\nAly is an author, gamewright, and actress. You can find her first novel The Isle of Sound and Wonder on Amazon and select retailers. Kate is an actress, fight choreographer, and RPG enthusiast. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is probably the lowest risk Kickstarter I'll ever run.

Driver, you are clear.\n  Art by Robert Hebert\nHappiest Apocalypse on Earth is a tabletop roleplaying game that is part satire, part horror. Set in a fictional children\u2019s theme park called Mouse Park, the game allows players to customize the attractions in the park, the dangers that lurk there, and their own Mouse Park staff member. Collaborative storytelling and customized character and narrator moves create a wide range of terrifying incidents involving ancient horrors, demonic magic, and a conspiratorial plot to keep a bloodthirsty ancient god appeased. Ghouls, monsters, specters, and cultists abound, but they only scratch the surface of the true evil that lies far beneath. \nThis game is for horror lovers, monster of the week enthusiasts, and that huge population that thinks animatronics are scary. It takes popular notions of innocence and cartoonish morality and violently turns it on its head. It is part satire of nostalgic pop culture and it is part deadly serious X-Files and Supernatural. The satirical nature shines through in its ironic approach and sometimes humorous take on characters, but the mysteries and plots that unfold are all but trivial. \nThe game is built using the Apocalypse World roleplaying game framework created by Vincent Baker and adapted and modified to fit the setting. As a Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) game, The Happiest Apocalypse on Earth shines with the best of collaborative storytelling using mechanics that are familiar to the experienced and intuitive to the novice. It works well as a campaign, or a one shot, and can be the centerpiece of family games or adult ones. \n  Art by Robert Hebert\nHappiest Apocalypse on Earth is already in Beta; the mechanics have been playtested and the text is pretty much written. All backers will get a copy of the unedited beta version immediately upon funding, so you can get a head start on playing! Funds for the Kickstarter will enable me to finalize and produce the final product in just a few short months. \nPbtA Adapted to the Setting\nThe spirit and intent of the Apocalypse World roleplaying game engine was carefully preserved. There is an emphasis on moves that carry the narrative forward, the players are empowered to have control over the story and setting, and there is a codified manner in which the Narrator can affect the game play. It will serve well on the same shelf as many other PbtA classics such as Monsterhearts, tremulus, and Monster of the Week. \nBuild Your Own Park. Options to collaboratively create Mouse Park, the company behind Mouse Park, its location, and its attractions\u2014as well as the source of the dangers the player characters will confront. \nCreate Your Own Playbook/Character Profile. Character creation allows for a broad and in-depth range of customizations, where you can pick and choose your moves and stat bonuses based upon decisions you\u2019ve made about character backgrounds. \nSetting-Specific Moves. Character moves are designed specifically for the setting, taking advantage of the powers of Mouse Park, while paying homage to the source of the satire through pop culture Easter eggs. \nSanity Mechanics. Characters can be physically or mentally damaged and can use merchandise and moves to protect or heal from that damage. \nIncident Framework. Turn-key toolbox for Narrators to create interesting and horrifying sessions, as well as many sample incidents that can be played with no preparation.\n Game play is light and easy to pick up. Very little prep is needed. Even character generation and setting creation happens at the table collaboratively. The game is moderated by the Narrator, who sets up the scene and puts dangers into motion that the characters must confront. The Narrator does not control the plot, but rather controls the decisions that non-player characters make, and make moves against player characters that advance the plot, or complicate their decisions. \nTo set up, the Narrator and players use a tool to determine specifics about Mouse Park, where it is located and what attractions are there. The players then decide how they all work together at the park and complete \u201cMousineer applications\u201d which, through a series of choices, allow players to pick specific backgrounds, stat bonuses, and moves that their characters can do. Once that is done, the players ask each other questions to figure out how they feel about each other and how well they know each other. \nThen the game begins. \nCharacters have the following stats, which are used as a bonus to a roll of two six-sided dice: Brave, Stout, Sweet, Wicked, Wise. The dice are rolled when the character does something that has an uncertain outcome. Many times, these moves are formalized into basic moves that have specific effects on the story, such as: Be Bold and Daring, Help a Friend Get Unstuck/Stick it to a Friend, Find Something There That Wasn\u2019t There Before, Break Some Femurs, Dig a Little Deeper, Charm a Heart Into Deciding, Bare Your Teeth and Ambitions, Go the Distance, Wish Upon a Star. Other times, the moves are specialized to their specific character and chosen during the Mousineer application process. \nWhen player characters do something that triggers a move they must roll a 7 or higher on the die to succeed. A roll of 10 or higher means a boon with the success, but 7-9 means success with a caveat, and a 6 or less is a failure that moves the story forward. These are the same principles in any PbtA game. However, in Happiest Apocalypse on Earth, the characters can also Wish Upon a Star and call upon the power of the Great Mouse in order to reverse their fortune using the Twinkle stat, with the understanding that if they accumulate too many Twinkles, a horrible doom will befall them.\nDownload Sample Character Sheet PDF\n   Living in Southern California with my wife and son, I am no stranger to theme parks.  I have a tremendous amount of insight into theme parks in the region as a result of my frequent visitor status over the years and have for the better part of 15 years wandered around with the lens of an author. \u201cWhat ifs\u201d accumulated until finally I had to do something about it. \nIt is fairly obvious what this game is targeting, but there is a larger theme at play. It is not my intention to be critical of any company or institution. On the contrary, I am a very big fan and an avid supporter of the many important messages these parks deliver to children. This game is a satire, and in some ways, a social commentary on what has become of the notion of innocence. \nIn recent years we\u2019ve seen the deconstruction of innocence in popular culture, in our gritty superhero movies, preference for dark and realistic streaming shows, and the rise of morally ambiguous characters in traditionally clear-cut roles (e.g. Rogue One, Star Trek reprise\u2014even the Power Rangers!) On the fringes of the Internet, we\u2019ve seen an absolute explosion of media like Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s and Creepy Pasta which target icons of innocence and pervert them into monsters. \nHappiest Apocalypse on Earth transforms the norms around innocence and black-and-white morality and turns it all on its head. The more horrifying, the better. I am attempting to push the genre with this game, to immerse one\u2019s self into the horror of potential. \nI do not mean to sound altruistic. I\u2019m not trying to change anything, I\u2019m just trying to create a unique and thrilling experience by dismantling our pre-conceived ideas. \nUltimately, this game is horror and designed for lovers of horror crossing genres from supernatural and Lovecraft to slashing and jump-scares. It is that, but it is also satire. It uses satire as a weapon.\nAs a marketer and publisher there is much that I can do \u201cin house\u201d and on my own dime, however I am seeking funding so that I can make this the best possible product possible. This budget will enable me to hire some incredible people in the industry to bring the project into fruition, create a top-notch gaming experience, and deliver a beautiful book with incredible art. I am fortunate to have the support of some talented people and want to bring them onto a team so that we can all produce a high-quality product gamers can get excited about. \nFunds will go to the following:\nInterior Design: I\u2019m thrilled to have the support of Rob Hebert who has agreed to do the interior artwork. You can see his work here: http://captwerewolf.deviantart.com/gallery/\nEditing: As this is my first real jump into the industry, the majority of the funds will go to game editing. It is important to me that not only are the t's dotted and the i's crossed, but that also the mechanics sing. \nAs for me, well I\u2019m an author and game designer. I love roleplaying games. I love PbtA. I love telling awesome stories. Beyond that, I\u2019m a good candidate for a Kickstarter. I am an executive at a public relations and marketing firm, so I have a lot of resources at my fingertips and a good pulse on the marketplace. I\u2019m also a publisher, so I have a lot of in house capabilities. I\u2019m a novelist, so I have an understanding of storytelling, setting, and a flare for writing. I\u2019m a gamer and a Game Master. I have an understanding of how to have fun at tables. \nI have also spent way too many days, months, and years at children's theme parks.

I would be foolish to not regard this as a risk, however it is a calculated one. For starters, this is objectively satire, not the repurposing of intellectual property. Secondly, I have not and will not use intellectual property and/or trademarks at all. Now while there can be no doubt I am satirizing certain theme parks and some movies, I have not used anything that is copyrighted or trademarked. Thirdly, the project has no direct reference to any particular company, but rather satirizes a caricature of theme parks. So, I believe I am on solid footing with regards to intellectual property.\n\nAnother legal consideration is libel. It is possible that some companies might see this as an attack on their brand and claim damages as a result. For this to work, they would have the burden of proving that average people would believe this satirization to be an actual reflection of the brand and also that they lost money as a result.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m not a lawyer. I have consulted with those with experience in the field and will consult with lawyers before publication, but should I end up on the wrong end of the legal table as a result of this product, I have a solid defense. \n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nUnder pressure of a great legal expense, I would need to change some of the indirect references to theme parks, release my grip on the satire, and repurpose the game so that it is a far more generic setting. And yes, I could do that now, but that dilutes the entire purpose of the satire.\n\nShould I see legal action from any party, and my lawyer agrees that I should be compliant with their position, I\u2019ll make the appropriate changes. \n\nIn short, no matter what happens, you will get the game. And I won\u2019t be using your funds to pay for a legal defense. That\u2019s all on me.\n\nOther Risks?\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this is my first Kickstarter. I\u2019m putting my best foot forward and am aiming for a fully funded project.

We believe it's one of the most challenging, fun, rewarding things you can do. If you\u2019ve ever thought about making a game of your own, we want to help. \nWe made The White Box for you.\nThe White Box is a learning, planning, and prototyping tool for tabletop game designers. \nIt contains a book of 18 essays on game design and production, covering subjects like where to find a great concept, how to use randomness, what to ask playtesters, and whether it\u2019s wise to self-publish. \nIt includes an abundance of components to get you started right away, from cubes and meeples to dice, discs, and chits. \nMaybe you have a golden idea inside you burning to come out. Maybe you want to tell a story or explore a problem. Do you dream of seeing your name on a box at your local game store? Or perhaps you see game design as a path to fame, fortune, and a satisfying career. \nThe White Box is for aspiring professionals, creative young people, and literally anyone who\u2019s ever wanted to build their own game without having to plunder their game library for bits. \nIf you believe creating games is awesome, The White Box is for you.\nThe White Box Essays, a 128-page perfect bound book about how to make games \nTwo punchboard sheets of custom counters and markers, some blank, others pre-printed with numbers, actions, elements, icons, and more \n100 standard wooden cubes (25 each of red, green, yellow, and blue, 8 mm each) \n24 standard wooden meeples (6 each of red, green, yellow, and blue, 12 mm each) \n4 giant wooden cubes (1 each of red, green, yellow, and blue, 25 mm each) \n40 plastic discs (10 each of red, green, yellow, and blue, 12 x 3 mm each) \n50 plastic discs (25 each of gold and silver, 12 x 3 mm each) \n8 standard six-sided dice (2 each of red, green, yellow, and blue, 16 mm each)\nA $5 gift card to The Game Crafter, thanks to their generosity (limitations apply \u2014 one redemption per account, for example)\nA $5 coupon card for printing at DriveThruCards, thanks to their generosity (limitations may apply)\nA $10 offer for custom card printing from Cartamundi, as part of their sponsorship of The White Box (see our May 16 backer update).

We think it's retail-friendly because:\nThe price is the price. The White Box is worth thirty bucks.

Your discount is 50%, with shipping at cost.\nYou\u2019ll get it before your competitors. We'll ship to retail backers at least three weeks before we ship to general distribution.\nYou\u2019ll have long-term access. Atlas Games will make physical editions of The White Box available through distribution. It will work for you for years to come.\nSomething for your staff.

An added bonus if it was linked to Singapore somehow.\nSearching online and in the local bookstores I was really underwhelmed by the books on offer. Nothing really appealed to me and I felt there was a big missed opportunity to create something special linked to the region I have called home for the past 6 years.\nWhere I started\nAfter chatting with my husband, we thought we would give it a go! The first 3 books I have created encapsulate animals and wildlife from Southeast Asia, Australia and Africa, places dear to our hearts from our travels.\nAbout the Books\nEyesight in young babies is limited for the first months of their life. Their eyes are fully developed, however, their brains are not yet mature enough to process all of the things they see.\nSo it is believed the most effective images for young babies to look at to help their development are high contrast shapes and patterns. And what could be more high-contrast than black and white?\nEach book has 12 animals, in black and white, native to the specific region, with the name on the left hand page. I wanted to keep it super simple, clean, but fun. Something I would enjoy looking at as much as my little boy would.\nCreating a Range of Products\nTo compliment the first book in the series, Southeast Asia, I have developed a set of flash cards. There are many baby flash cards on the market but I wanted to make these more than just images to hold up, I wanted them to be interactive and suitable for a range of ages. Sometimes it can be hard to continually think of things to chat to very young children about all day, so each animal card comes with an interesting fact or two you can read aloud to younger babies and a question or task you can ask toddlers to act out. Hopefully adults will find them interesting too!\nI have also created a number of limited edition prints, each showing 4 animals, that are perfect to decorate a nursery or playroom. They are designed to fit the square IKEA Ribba frames so it's easy to get them up on the wall.\nGiving Something Back\nWe strongly believe in encouraging conscious consumerism where people and planet can benefit. Which is why 25% of my profits will go directly to helping animal and conservation charities. Additionally, each book and paper product will be printed on FSC certified paper using soy ink.\nThe long term ambition is to create a range of books and illustrations from all around the world and be able to contribute a significant amount to charity.\nThis project is inspired by our son, Edward for whom I wanted to create fun, unique books for him to enjoy and stimulate his early development. We wish him to grow up appreciating nature and protecting the wildlife in the world around him.\n---\nRewards\nBy backing my project you will have the opportunity to purchase the very first print run of all three books, individually or as a set. \n  PLAY\n\nYou can also purchase the interactive flash cards which come as a set of 12 in a sturdy, jungle covered box.\n  PLAY\n\n   The prints look great in 230x240mm square frames.\nWall art\n ---\nTestimonials\nI gave a few copies to friends who had little ones around the same time as I did, before I had decided to sell them, as a unique and personal gift. Their feedback has been so encouraging, here's some of the lovely things they had to say!\n   And of course my folks have nothing but good things to say :)\n www.blackandwhitebookproject.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork is completed, ISBN numbers purchased, printing company researched and on standby...I'm so close to hitting the 'go' button. It really comes down to your support to help fund the production run.\n\nThe print process is estimated to take between 8-10 weeks including delivery to me and then I will need to package the individual orders ready to ship to you. My aim is to get the books to you as fast as is possible, because no one likes to wait for these things but to makes sure everything reaches you in tip top fashion I am estimating a further 4-6 weeks for this phase.

If you just want to read the first 28 pages of this novel and decide to back or not based on that, just click this link.)\nYOU is a second person novel, so it's told as if it's happening to the reader. These aren't common. The most popular second person literature is probably the Choose Your Own Adventure genre, only in YOU there are no choices. It could be described as an \"endure your own adventure\" story.\nIn the book, you are Leo Evans. Leo is disgruntled, middle-aged, unhappily divorced, and a cultist who has developed genuine extra senses and paranormal abilities by adhering to a set of beliefs he freely admits seem preposterous.\nIn the course of the book, you get punched, kicked, and you accidentally injure yourself while pulling a concealed brush axe from beneath your jacket. You are enjoined to feel hatred for the person you love the most in the world. You punch a guy in a strip club and get manhandled by bouncers. Your apartment is broken into with distressing regularity. You are subject to multiple enchantments, one of which causes you to feel overwhelming affection for a woman you've never met. People scheme to murder you, to duplicate you, to deceive you, and to make you live forever.\nIf This Is Your First Time...\nHey, thanks for checking out my project! I've written a lot of stuff, most of it weird, and much of it available free online. If you're not familiar with my work, click on through to http://gregstolze.com/fiction-library/ and you can look through many, many short stories spanning years of my career. The ones that most resemble this novel are probably The Turning of the Time, Ghosts: The Straight Dope, and ENZYMES. (That last one was turned into a crackerjack podcast by the good folks at Pseudopod. You can listen to that at this link here.)\nI write about weird events, ordinary people, and the blurring boundary between them. If you like those stories, and others from the fiction library, it's a good bet that you will find something to like in YOU.\nFor Experienced Stolze Fans...\nWelcome back, and thanks for the ongoing support. Whether you're specifically into Unknown Armies or just enjoy a story that was obviously built with zero concern for mass market popularity, YOU is a sterling example of the work I've been doing for decades. It's meant to be perfectly accessible to people who have no idea what Unknown Armies is, but fans of the game and its associated media are sure to be excited to be put in the shoes of someone getting ground between a godwalker and a Room of Renunciation. (There's also a Masterless Man running around, just to keep things stochastic.)\nWhat Everyone Can Expect.\nThis book is done. It's written, it's been professionally edited and laid out and is ready to go via a print-on-demand service (DriveThruFiction) available in both the US and Europe. As soon as the project is funded and the questionnaires come back in, I can begin releasing electronic versions and start the process of printing and sending physical copies. The rewards say to expect the books in May in order to account for any mailing orders or unexpected issues in production. \nAs the project progresses, I hope to be able to add a few short stories as stretch goals, but for the most part, what we have here is the book. At the center of this project, the thing I don't want to lose sight of, is YOU.\n-G.\nSpecial thanks to James Semple, whose compositions \"This Silence Is Flawed\" and \"Mood Elevator/Doom To Reveal\" are used in the video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've striven to minimize the risks to the public.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

Looking for a chance to escape the insanity of the world, and immerse yourself into something rich, deep, and fantastical? Something that challenges the limits of your creativity and your intellect? \nLorcan made a gun out of demon which fires bullets that only harm possessed people. On his quest to discover the long-forgotten (and perhaps forbidden) number between 12 and 13, the weapon is proving useful as the Enemies of Sleep appear determined to stop him. \nDuri\u2019s face is normally a blur of swirling spiritforms, but occasionally she can make one of them manifest, and she gains its appearance and memories. If she risks keeping the new face too long, however, she can lose her identity. \nThom is dead, but he doesn\u2019t let that deter him. While he knows how to restore his life, he chooses not to, because the advantages of being a wraith are many. Of course, he occasionally has issues with not existing. \nRodir has connections all over the city, and she holds a collection of wicked keys that allow her to solve (unlock) any problem (lock) by just creating a keyhole to insert a key, turn it, and see what happens. People don\u2019t appreciate it when she does this to them, but that\u2019s what they get for being in her way. \nThese are all player characters in the Invisible Sun tabletop RPG. They are no longer trapped in Shadow\u2014where you are right now\u2014but inhabit the Actuality, a world that seems like a surreal dream to those of us toiling aimlessly in the boring, grey realm that we falsely believe is the real world. These characters face incredible challenges, visit breathtaking places, and discover secrets so astonishing that the only ones who can cope with them are those that understand the truth of the real power in the universe: \nMagic.\nBut nothing like what you\u2019ve seen before. Invisible Sun makes magic magical again. Magic\u2019s not just a series of mechanics. It\u2019s weird, wonderful, unpredictable, and dangerous. With spells and incantations like The Flock Scatters at the Sound of Teeth, Sharp Edges in the First Frost, and The Punishment of Change Comes to the Wary, magic is what the game is all about.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire. Many of the prices are not even numbers--do the numbers have significance? Secrets?\n             We at Monte Cook Games have done a number of Kickstarter campaigns in the past, and we are proud of our track record of delivering high-quality, on-time products. This Kickstarter campaign is a bit different. Befitting the nature of this game, each of the backer levels is a spell that summons an extradimensional box of secrets called (in the setting) the Black Cube. In this case, the Black Cube you\u2019ll be summoning is filled with wonders. You can get the game, which itself is a deluxe product and a thing of beauty (Call the Black Cube) or you can get the game with the Directed Campaign and all the stretch goals (Control the Black Cube). There\u2019s also a special level for our awesome retailers (Entreat With the Black Cube) and two for a few of you to get the really deluxe treatment (Master the Black Cube and Merge with the Black Cube). Like all spells in Invisible Sun, the backer levels are written in first person. Throughout the campaign, we\u2019ll refer to the act of backing at one of these levels as casting that particular spell.\nInvisible Sun is a very special product, with a lot of high-quality components but quality like this comes at a premium. Some people will want to consider buying the Black Cube as a group. And you\u2019ll want to know about our shipping policies. \nLast, note that when you back helps determine the nature of your rewards. Every backer will receive a sealed envelope with the game that holds a secret about the game or setting. The envelope that you get is based on the sun that is active on the day you back (see the top of the page for today\u2019s active sun). No one secret is better than any of the others, but only those who cast Master the Black Cube or Merge the Black Cube will see them all. You can read this for more information about the Active Sun and how it affects your rewards.  \n    Invisible Sun is a tabletop roleplaying game of surreal fantasy. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s moody. It\u2019s adult. It\u2019s also perhaps the most deluxe and amazing roleplaying game product ever produced. Inside the specially designed cube you will find four books, a folding game board, a resin monolith, a metal medallion, four special dice, player handouts, tokens, and hundreds of cards to enhance your gameplay.\nInvisible Sun is a game of secrets. And that is true of both the physical product and the in-world game as it is played. Hidden within the pages of the books, within the components of the game, and perhaps even within the box itself, lie clues to discover\u2014clues that can unlock new secrets. Invisible Sun is as much about interacting with the physical game itself as it is about interacting with the other players. This is a game of deep immersion. Of escape. \nPlayers create in-depth and intricate characters where the house in which they live is as important as their stats and skills. Character choices drive everything, with game rewards based on personalized story arcs, and emergent mechanics arising from not just from character creation, but from ongoing character development. However, in the end, it\u2019s not game mechanics that dominate gameplay, but roleplaying. \nPlayer characters in Invisible Sun discover and utilize secrets. These secrets often involve the very nature of the universe, and those who master such secrets can change that nature. In common parlance, this is magic, and thus player characters are magicians and sorcerers called vislae. How they utilize their magic\u2014casting spells, creating objects of great power, entreating with otherworldly spirits, or improvising effects by weaving together threads of power\u2014is up to them. Character creation and customization are paramount, and no character concept is refused. In a game where everything is possible, it\u2019s never a matter of \u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d but \u201cHow do you go about discovering the secret to do that?\u201d \nLet\u2019s be upfront, though. Invisible Sun is not a game for everyone. Not because it\u2019s difficult, but because it\u2019s involved. It\u2019s not really designed for casual, fire-and-forget sorts of play. It is character-focused the way a good novel or television series is character-focused, with individual story arcs, deep development, complex motivations, nonlinear narratives, and asymmetrical play. If you\u2019re the kind of player who enjoys musing over your character between sessions, thinking deeply about the setting and events in the game, and making interesting choices, then Invisible Sun is the game you\u2019ve been waiting for all this time.\nWe live in the modern world. We know what it\u2019s like to try to get a group together on a regular basis\u2014work, family, schedules, and other aspects of that nasty thing we call real life always get in the way. Invisible Sun, at its very core, is designed around overcoming that with gameplay options that deal with missing players, solo play integrated with group play, playing online, and more. \nInvisible Sun is a game that encourages players to think about the game away from the table\u2014and rewards them for doing so. Not just on game night. This is a game for people who enjoy real investment in character and story. It\u2019s not just a hack-and-slash, bash the bad guy sort of thing. Those kinds of games are fun, but this is something different.\nPlayers (individually or in groups) can devise and stage side scenes or even flashback scenes to accomplish their goals. The rules of the game address these in a way that is separate from but compatible with the main narrative. In addition to the flexibility this gives in group storytelling, it means that there are many opportunities to play the game and advance the characters and the narrative even when the whole group can\u2019t meet.\nThe game even recognizes the difference between player types. It accommodates people who want simpler characters, non-magical characters, or even multiple characters. It even has different ways for introverts and extroverts to interact with the game and the group if they desire. \nYou can read more on these unique aspects of the game here.  \nThe place where you sit, reading this right now, is a place called Shadow. Despite what you may think, this is not the real world, but a shadow of it. \nThe real world is a place called the Actuality. This is a strange, surreal setting where magic is real and the impossible is entirely possible. It\u2019s a dark place of demons, ghosts, and far stranger things, but it\u2019s also a place of wonder and light\u2014angels of the Legacy and continually shapeshifting elderbrin\u2014where magic can do astonishing things. \nIn the Actuality, the player characters are important people who, should they discover the right secrets and find the right spells, can make a difference in the world. \nAnd what a world. This is a place where tight-lipped veterans of the War won\u2019t speak of their experiences, but it\u2019s well known that the central city of Satyrine still bears wounds where undetonated weapons of pure hatred keep it from healing. Soulless devils scheme in darkness, bartering for bits of soul, because without one, magic is impossible. Spiders crawl into bedrooms to sip at the fluids in a sleeper\u2019s eyes, carrying a magical virus that can cause anyone or anything to sprout spidery legs and scuttle about. Vislae visit changeries to alter their appearance to suit their mood\u2014sometimes into striking, inhuman, and not even entirely Euclidean forms. They attend intrigue-filled parties held within the consciousness of the hosts, or search through the ruins of ancient libraries to find the ghosts of books they need to read.\nThe Actuality and the magical systems in Invisible Sun were designed from scratch. Don\u2019t know anything about historical or modern magical traditions or occult beliefs? That\u2019s okay. In fact it\u2019s great. Because the magic and the occult in Invisible Sun has no ties to any real world beliefs. Monte took literally decades of study in such things\u2014tarot, Kabbalah, Vodun, astrology, numerology, mythology, religion, the Tree of Life, and so on\u2014and built an entirely original occult system for the setting. With Invisible Sun, we avoid any baggage from our world and our lives so we can dive into this purely escapist fantasy. (If you do have some knowledge of this sort of thing, well, you\u2019ll likely really appreciate what he\u2019s done.)\n  One of the most important parts of the magical systems in the world of Invisible Sun is a divinatory set of cards called the Sooth Deck. These 60 lavishly illustrated, uniquely round cards and the Path of Suns board serve the game in many ways. Turning a new Sooth card from the deck and playing it on one of the suns of the path affects gameplay in simple but significant mechanical ways that are sometimes beneficial, sometimes not, helping to represent the volatility of magic. The interpretive meanings of each card also serve as creative prompts for the GM to use (or ignore) as they see fit. A GM who has the deck at hand throughout a game session is never caught without an idea of what can or should happen next. It is the Invisible Sun GM\u2019s best friend. \nSometimes, a card\u2019s effects are short lived, but sometimes they remain in play for a while. Those that remain are held by an eerie monolith on the table called the Testament of Suns so that the card is dramatically presented to everyone and no one will forget its effect. \nIn addition to these components, you get four books that describe the game and the setting, over a thousand spell cards and item cards, hundreds of gameplay tokens, dice, a cloth map, a poster map, handouts, character booklets, grimoires, and more. For a complete list of the box\u2019s contents, look here.\n     Those backing at the Control the Black Cube, Master the Black Cube, and Merge with the Black Cube levels gain access to the Invisible Sun Directed Campaign. For twelve months (starting when you tell us you are beginning your campaign, within one year of delivery of the game), Monte sends you new material, sometimes in electronic form and sometimes as a physical package. This includes adventure material, campaign advice, handouts, props, and special physical items. It\u2019s like Monte himself is your GM coach, providing step-by-step advice and aids for your campaign as you run it. We\u2019ll even send your players intriguing mystery packages tied to the campaign that are keyed to their character. And there\u2019s more.\nHelping to guide the unique gameplay aspects, the Invisible Sun app allows GMs to have a (virtual) Sooth Deck wherever they go. Meeting with a player for a half hour in the coffee shop or the park? You can play through a side scene using just the app. Use the app at the table for a quick reference regarding the possible meanings of each Sooth card. Players and GMs can even interact through the app when not sitting at the table together, allowing for many levels of play. \nThe app will be web based, and will run on any modern web browser, making it usable on your phone, tablet, or your PC.\nClick on any of these links for more information: \nOur Kickstarter History\nThe Invisible Sun Kickstarter Is Different\nDeluxe Games\nGroup Purchases\nShipping \nChanging the Way RPGs Are Played\nThe Directed Campaign\nThe Active Sun \nDetails of the Contents\n                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nInvisible Sun is the 7th game-related Kickstarter that Monte Cook Games has launched.

I realize that this sounds a little convoluted, but while paying some here and some there is a bit of a hassle (sorry!) it's counterbalanced by some very meaningful conveniences.\n1) You get it faster. In the past, I've had large runs of books shipped to my home and then individually mailed those books out. By eliminating me as a needless middleman, the book goes straight from the factory to you, instead of being ground-shipped to me and then possibly sitting around a few days while I, a solo worker, ship to everyone who got in before you.\n2) It's more reliable. Since the book's only making one trip instead of two, it has half as much exposure to the risks and vicissitudes of shipping.\n3) It saves you money. You pay the postage for the book's one trip, instead of paying me to ship it to myself and ship it to you. \nIn Conclusion\nAll in all, I've tried to price this as low as I could while still making a decent profit.

The Clans descend from the Antediluvians, ancient vampires whose childer vie for power in a midnight struggle, using their own childer in turn as pawns in a game the world over. That game has a name, whispered by some, denied by others, and dreaded by all: the Jyhad.\nBeckett's Jyhad Diary is the written account of our skeptical Gangrel protagonist, as he travels through domains far and wide, embroils himself in the many plots of elders and neonates alike, and explores the mysteries of Vampire\u2019s setting both wondrous and terrible. Scribbled in the margins are the notes of Anatole, Lucita, and Aisling Sturbridge - friends and erstwhile allies of our intrepid archaeologist, commenting on his journeys.\nOver the years, the plot of Vampire: the Masquerade provided a rich tapestry for Storytellers to use in their games. Onyx Path Publishing wanted to bring that tapestry to your table, and give a new generation of Storytellers the tools to weave that tapestry as they saw fit.\nBeckett\u2019s Jyhad Diary gives you canonical hooks and plot lines from the 1st, 2nd, Revised and 20th Anniversary Editions of Vampire, as well as Vampire: the Eternal Struggle and the Clan Novels series, both Dark Ages and Modern. We constructed those hooks as flashpoints - discrete events in the Jyhad that Beckett witnesses, comments on, and investigates, so that player characters and Storytellers can engage on a level that works for their home plot.\nMasterfully written by the likes of Neall Raemonn Price, Joshua Alan Doetsch, Matthew McFarland, Myranda Sarro, Steffie de Vaan, Malcolm Sheppard, Alan Alexander, Renee Knipe, and Matthew Dawkins, Beckett's Jyhad Diary is as fascinating to read as to use for your game Chronicles.\nDon't take our word for it, here are selected chapters of the finished manuscript to inflame your imaginations and entice your interest:\nTable of Contents: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FshsAhkPU0SlniTNk9CQfHdHglfgbtQc6RHr_S1_Xk/pub\nChapter 1 - Carna's Rebellion: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8IcVpTBP7AKF8fpbZArT86Sb6whnlcPd2t5JigC2TQ/pub\nChapter 2 - A Split City: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EInZx1JqMJlibngl0SrY8rnmeEyN55pbJ6FcHk48Dpk/pub\nChapter 5: London Calling\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLDVSr2f2bIVGBLtXSwjl65J1p-zHcoNQK51mw1eiTw/pub\nChapter 6 - Schism:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/137OSpHCdisavQTpQKes_qcXE4m4rPLli9IRyoe_6LTI/pub\nChapter 7 - The Anarch Freefall: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13WDVErUbdGpg2PIOO6Bd7S5r66gXfs8t3BklnCjPSdU/pub\nChapter 8 - The Blood Matures: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_TDJ5dAXW3iGx9XLn7lvmLUnixDw6MYN4EBJho5m2d0/pub\nChapter 10 - The Dead Walk:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1IG7JIZNOUNEFz0af5ZZV3dJAI3QFHrb2ua5EhdI9Ecs/pub\nChapter 15 - The Hag:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3MAZQTGOdbboqWDKV18GvvPRpMvfiCHh0pMcn0niYg/pub\nChapter 18 - Venetians Blind: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kwKMVkol-7xqViTof2DeqSzi4rKfKb6jMFW3TSf2Xk/pub\nChapter 19 - The Madness of Jerusalem\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1dyK0kSCRJBvKf0lKQgiuTVrqFB6uZ4hvIUA1Zwe3Odk/pub\nChapter 20 - Azhi Dahaka: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kGt2e1yMXo_1yr_Z5BeSJDivETiwMVSRkqSNxJjto6Q/pub\n  V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary is slated to come out in digital and print-on-demand versions, but this Kickstarter is for a luxurious, deluxe edition of the book designed to look like just the sort of 7\" x 10\" traveling diary Beckett would carry through his journeys, with an elastic band to hold the volume closed, a silk bookmark, and full color interior currently estimated at 200+ pages.\nInitial cover design mock-up, not the finished book\nBut we won\u2019t stop there. We'll be offering focused stretch goals that specifically expand the book beyond its original design and enhance it in different ways. There will be new opportunities with the stretch goals for backers to make their mark on the book, continuing a tradition of open development and coordination with our community that we value and appreciate.\n    It's pretty easy. Contribute any amount you want, bearing in mind the levels of contribution and their commensurate rewards over there on the right. If we hit our $40K goal, you'll get the reward that goes with your level of contribution. PDFs and Print on Demand versions will be made available first in the form of a coupon from our online sales partner, DriveThruRPG.com.\nTo start off simply, if you just want to pledge for:\nThe Beckett's Jyhad Diary PDF: go to the $20 Jyhad Researcher reward tier.\nThe Deluxe Beckett's Jyhad Diary book: go to the $85 Jyhad Diarist reward tier.\nThe Deluxe Beckett's Jyhad Diary book and Storytellers Screen: go to the $100 Obfuscated Jyhad Diarist reward tier.\n Deluxe V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary will take multiple months from the closing date to print and ship. PDF Rewards and Add-ons will not take as long as the Deluxe, but will come after the BackerKit Surveys are returned after this KS closes. We will contact contributors in the upper tiers with details on their rewards.\n  You can Add-on the PDFs listed below to any Reward Tier pledge that already includes a V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary PDF by clicking on your Reward Tier to the right, and then when you get to the pledge page that confirms your pledge amount, manually changing the amount of your pledge from the base Reward amount to that Reward amount plus the amount of each Add-on that you want as listed below :\n+ $10 for the classic Year of the Scarab, Gehenna Novels, and Victorian Vampire fiction trilogies PDFs.\n + $15 for an additional V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary PDF.\n + $35 for the classic Book of Nod, Erciyes Fragments, Revelations of the Dark Mother, and Encyclopedia Vampirica PDFs.\n+ $70 for the classic four Transylvania Chronicles, Time of Thin Blood, Nights of Prophecy, and Children of the Night PDFs.\n+ $90 for the fourteen Onyx Path V20 PDFs listed in the Reward Tiers to the right.\nImportant: the above classic PDFs were created using the best methods possible depending on available files stretching 25 years back. Therefore, the image quality of PDFs of the older books in particular may not be as good as PDFs for newer books.\nYou can also add on individual physical copies of the Deluxe V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary book to any pledge that already is shipping a physical book by manually adding the appropriate amount on the pledge page:\n+ $80 for a Deluxe V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary (US)\n + $95 for a Deluxe V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary (Canada and EU)\n+ $110 for a Deluxe V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary (Everywhere Else)\n You can add on the V20 Lore of the Clans Storyteller's Screen to any reward tier that offers a physical book:\n+ $15 for the V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary Storyteller's Screen, a sturdy three-panel screen featuring the beautiful collage of V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary art on the outer side, and on the inside there's a selection of charts and other info to make the Storyteller's job a little bit easier.\nYou can add on the Deluxe Vampire 20th Dice Set to any reward tier that offers a physical book:\n+ $23 for the Deluxe Vampire 20th Dice Set, ten 10-sided dice designed with the V20 thorn motif featuring the V20 Ankh created in cooperation with Q-Workshop.\n Here's the latest mockup of the dice design:\nYou must type in the correct amount calculated by adding the base Reward amount and the Add-ons you want. It does not happen automatically.\n  If we have contributions beyond our target number, we've planned many added rewards for contributors. Our range of possible Stretch Goal awards includes additional material in Deluxe V20 Beckett's Jyhad Diary itself, additional book marks, a KS exclusive TShirt, and more.\n At $40,000, we are funded!\n At $45,000, we'll create a limited-run t-shirt available at-cost via our RedBubble store. It will be available for a limited time, after which the design will be changed.\nAt $60,000, we'll be adding a whole new chapter, as Beckett traces the remainder of the Cappadocian Clan in Egypt.\nAt $70,000, you voted to add a second new chapter, featuring the legacy of the Salubri.\nAt $75,000, we'll add a third new chapter, featuring Lucita and the Black Hand.\nAt $78,000, we'll add a second wave of full-color art, making the Diary an even more lavish production.\nAt $83,000, you selected our fourth new chapter, featuring the legacy of Carthage and Vampire: The Masquerade: Redemption star Christof.\nAt $88,000, we'll add a fifth new chapter, featuring the drowning of Rasputin!\nAt $96,000, we'll add the next new chapter, in which Beckett investigates his own shrouded past.\n At $103,000, we'll add a third wave of gorgeous artwork.\n At $110,000, we'll add Omega, our final new chapter.\n And finally, at $117,500, we'll expand Omega to include lore from V20 Dark Ages and its supplements.\nThis is our twentieth Onyx Path Kickstarter, and we have learned enough (sometimes painfully) to make some tweaks to our goals, reward tiers, and prizes. One of those things is that we tend to get the same questions asked during each Kickstarter, but have a limit on the amount of text we can put on this KS page, so we're hosting a FAQ here:\nhttp://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This book isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped twelve Kickstarter projects and several more are headed to completion as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The current text for Beckett's Jyhad Diary is completely finished, and we are going to carefully limit the amount of new text from Stretch Goals and Rewards. \n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the Deluxe Beckett's Jyhad Diary.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. For the first time, because of Kickstarter adding the option to their tools, we are able to be more specific as to shipping costs based on your country. These costs will be added to your pledge automatically by KS if you are outside the US. As always, local or VAT style taxes will need to be paid by the backer when appropriate and are not included in these costs. And we are working with our shippers to ship from the EU and thus avoid those customs and handling fees we\u2019ve previously had to pass on to our EU backers.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for several of our last KS projects several months before the estimate, and recent Kickstarters started shipping in the month or the month before we estimated. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver regular Updates on progress via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title":

A vicious crime. And one chance to find the answers.\n The leads were laid out like flattened tombstones. A few lengths of yarn drew lines of connection. Maybe we were getting closer to an answer. Or maybe it was a vain attempt to find reason behind brutality.\nNoirlandia is about a tangled murder mystery in a fantastic city. It's a collaborative, one-shot roleplaying game inspired by Questlandia\u2019s worldbuilding and narrative resolution systems. You\u2019ll create a murder mystery from scratch, reveal the corrupt forces lurking in the shadows of your city, and follow the investigation to its terrible conclusion.\nYour characters will fight for answers and question their principles. After 3-4 hours, you\u2019ll have either found the truth, or lost the chance forever.\nNoirlandia doesn\u2019t have a game master, so nobody knows the answers in advance\u2014your mystery will be created and solved at the table.\nFinding the answers doesn\u2019t mean you win. Dying doesn\u2019t mean you lose. It\u2019s not about justice, it\u2019s about what you\u2019re willing to give up to get it. It\u2019s just another day in Noirlandia...\nThey found his body at the end of the docks, bathed in the glow of the twin moons.\nNoirlandia\u2019s city-building process is guided by a mix of player imagination and randomizers. A roll of the die will tell you what corrupts your city: maybe apathy, isolation, technology, or pride.\nThen, you\u2019ll work together to answer questions like, How are the people in this city unlike us? What do the buildings look like? How did the corruption take hold?\nEvery city in Noirlandia has four major districts: the Outskirts, the Upper Crust, Downtown, and Skid Row. You\u2019ll design the various structures that define your city\u2019s districts, deciding what buildings loom over the downtown center, or where the people live in skid row. For example, you might have \u201cKodachrome HQ\u201d for downtown, \u201cPainters\u2019 Alley\u201d for skid row, \u201cThe Docks\u201d for the outskirts, and \u201cHanging Gardens\u201d for the upper crust.\nAt the beginning of the game, each district will get pinned to the cork board, arranged around the outer edges. Just like your characters, the districts can be damaged by the case. Losing on certain rolls will escalate the corruption of your city, and if you\u2019re not careful, these losses may even lead to full-scale collapse.\nEvery game of Noirlandia features a unique setting and a brand new mystery. Some cities may look quite familiar, others unrecognizable. In addition to building your own cities, the game can alternatively be run using pre-designed settings and mystery seeds. We\u2019ve included two quick-start settings with the base game, and more quick-starts will become available if we hit our stretch goals along the way!\nLuck Harvest setting by Brian Van Slyke, Fungi Fatale by Hannah Shaffer.\nShe wore a large hat with a single peacock feather, and there was a gun in her hand.\nCharacters in Noirlandia can be on the right side of the law\u2014or the wrong side. Upper or lower class. Working together or working alone.\nAt the beginning of the game, you\u2019ll create characters using a deck of playing cards and dice as randomizers, drawing cards for every player in the game plus one more. After all players have selected a character they\u2019re excited to play, the unchosen card becomes the murder victim.\nYou might play a retired cop with a haunted past, an aristocratic bird king hiding the secret of your family\u2019s ignoble birth, a hustler selling VR headsets door-to-door, or an anguished paramour desperate for vengeance. It all depends on the cards you draw and the world you build!\nEvery character in Noirlandia has a guiding principle. If you choose to break your principle, you can provide a much-needed boost at an essential moment. There will, of course, be consequences.\nAll characters in Noirlandia have a relationship to the victim\u2014and maybe to each other. Over the course of the game, you\u2019ll learn more about your past with the victim, and the tangled strings that tie everything together.\nYour character isn\u2019t immune from suspicion and may become a suspect in the case. You can be imprisoned, proven guilty, and you may even die. But it isn\u2019t a loss as long as you uncover the truth.\nThe steam rose from the sewers, silhouetting the man who had murdered the governor\u2026\nIt begins with a body. You knew the victim, you\u2019ve been to the scene of the crime, and you\u2019ve found one suspicious clue. From here, you and the others have to find three answers: Who did it? How was it pulled off? And why were they killed?\nPlayers take turns setting the scene for their character\u2019s efforts on the case. As you play out the scenes, you\u2019ll use quick challenge rolls to overcome the physical and mental obstacles in your way. You might be riding your police horse in hot pursuit, or cajoling Baker Jones into revealing the coveted secret ingredient. These rolls take into account your character\u2019s current condition, and often result in taking a hard bargain to get what you want.\nEvery scene ends with an investigation roll\u2014a multi-dice face-off with multiple outcomes. This might look like interrogating the bigwig crime boss, combing the crime scene for clues, or entering your mind palace to make sense of what you\u2019ve seen. You can find new leads, clues, and people. You can discover the secret connections between them. Simultaneously, your character might become a suspect themself, find an old lead destroyed, or even see the city as a whole take a turn for the worse.\nEvery investigation comes with three terrible outcomes. You have a chance to change two of them into victories.\nNoirlandia\u2019s mysteries don\u2019t have pre-written answers. Instead, players earn the right to make their own theories real, one clue at a time. When you succeed in a roll, you might earn the right to connect two leads together, and decide that The Underground Temple was actually built by Ten-Fingered Suzanne as a publicity stunt. These moments let you direct the mystery, but until you reach an answer, nothing is certain.\nGetting one of the three answers to the case is a special move that can only be done by investigating a chain of 3 connected leads. This makes it the cumulation of several turns of investigative work, and rewards you with a bit of truth in a case where everything else is uncertain. Unlike leads and connections, your answers can\u2019t be destroyed or discredited.\nBut even if you find all the answers, you can\u2019t be sure that justice will be done. For that, we turn to the epilogue, where we find out how the case will impact the guilty party, your character, and the city as a whole. The epilogue is influenced by your progress on the case, but also how your character stuck to, or compromised, their principles along the way.\nWant to see the game in action? Check out a Google Hangouts live playthrough of the game below.\nNoirlandia comes with two quick-start mysteries, with more starter mysteries planned as we hit stretch goals! The included mysteries are:\nLuck Harvest (Brian Van Slyke): It's been ten years since we discovered the scientific properties of Luck, and that everyone naturally produces their own. It's been five years since companies started selling Bottled Luck. Those who can afford it purchase as much Luck as they can, and their lives have never been better. Those who can't afford it? Well, better Luck in the next life. The biggest of the manufacturers, LUCKY 4U, already sits on top of the world, raking in billions. Their headquarters in the new, bright, and shiny city of Santa Fria towers over everything else\u2014a testament to their unstoppable corporate power that's never questioned. That is, until a dead body is dropped out of a moving van in front of their skyscraper with a note tacked to it: YOUR LUCK'S RUNNING OUT.\nFungi Fatale (Hannah Shaffer): On the day of her coronation, Princess Persimmon and her royal attendants arrive at Castle Kuriboh to find her beloved, a humble plumber, floating facedown in the courtyard fountain. The rest of the guests have disappeared, imprisoned in paintings scattered throughout the castle grounds. Both the princess and the plumber have a list of enemies a mile long, so cracking this case won't be easy. With the help of a few sentient toadstools, can the princess figure out who did it and why?\n\"It was everything I wanted it to be - fantastical and weird, yet firmly rooted in noir tropes without much effort on the part of the players.\" - Mikael Andersson, Dreamation playtester\n\"We created a steampunk noir city and played out an amazing, gritty, cinematic murder mystery. The evidence board mechanic is inspired (Real string!) and the optional randomization tables for clues fit the setting PERFECTLY. Evan has a winner. - Adrian Stein, Dreamation playtester\n\"I love how much power and money was at the center of this. It was like Chinatown.\" - Rob Bohl, designer of Misspent Youth\n\"The whole thing played out in under 3 hours and in the end, I felt like we created a world and characters which could easily fill a couple of celluloid reels.\" - Tyson Fultz, Big Bad Con playtester\nPDF of Noirlandia and PDF of any setting stretch goals unlocked during campaign.\nGame PDF, including unlocked PDF stretch goals, and a 6\"x9\" softcover copy of the Noirlandia book.\nAll PDF rewards plus two softcover copies of Noirlandia\u2014one for you, one for a friend!\nAll PDF rewards, plus a softcover copy of Noirlandia and the original Questlandia RPG!\nAll PDF rewards, a softcover copy of Noirlandia, plus...\nPhysical copies of all starter mysteries, including stretch goal settings, in sealed, custom-designed Noirlandia envelopes. Each envelope contains a dozen pinnable leads for the case, each with custom art of the people, places, and objects you'll need to solve the case. The number of envelopes you receive will increase as we unlock stretch goals!\nFour cork board squares for you to put on your table (or wall!) to pin your clues and answers to.\nBlank \u201cpolaroids\u201d to pin clues and suspects to your cork board.\nTacks for pinning polaroids.\nString for connecting clues.\nSix-sided dice in two colors.\nA deck of playing cards.\nYou\u2019ll get everything from the PRIVATE EYE ($75) level, and you\u2019ll also become part of the game! You\u2019ll submit a picture of yourself or a friend to be redrawn as a suspect (or possibly the victim!) in one of the pre-made mysteries.\nNoirlandia lead designer and illustrator Evan Rowland will transform your photo into a Noir headshot, which may appear in the book, or as one of the included pinnable leads! You\u2019ll also receive a glossy 8\"x10\" print of the illustration.\nIf you're sending a photo of someone else, make sure you have their permission! No noir surprises here!\nYou\u2019ll get everything from the COMMISSIONER ($125) level, plus a custom-designed map featuring the four districts of a noir city of your dreams (or nightmares!).\nNoirlandia lead designer and illustrator Evan Rowland will transform your city idea into a four-piece map that can be placed directly over your cork board. In addition to the quadrant map, you'll receive the complete 24\"x24\" glossy print of the map for your wall!\nTen years ago, the Thaumastrates, the ancient order of wizards that ruled Tiraval for centuries, were overthrown by the Five Families, a powerful oligarchy of merchant houses. Now the Thaumastrates live in exile outside the protection of the city walls, and the Five Families are beginning to fall apart\u2014torn by infighting, they struggle to hold onto the power that they seized. The Enchantadores in their cathedrals of song do their best to stay above the fray, but the Lion Knights now know that revolution is possible and plot to take their own turn at power. Was it one of them who killed the matriarch of the First Family?\nMost nights, it seems there\u2019s not a single thing in this city that vampires don\u2019t run. They\u2019re everywhere, from the hospitals, to the nightclubs, to city hall. Most nights, it\u2019s easier to turn a blind eye, because it\u2019s happening to somebody else. Someone else is getting sucked dry in that dark alley and you\u2019re just glad it\u2019s not you. Tonight, though, things get a little up close and personal, and it\u2019s about time somebody did something about all these bloodsuckers.\nAtunwa\u2019s spires unfurl high into the clouds and deep into the soil. The city\u2019s roots are long and old, containing many marvels for those willing to venture into Atunwa\u2019s otherwise empty sector of space. Atunwa is a living city, growing organically to meet the needs of its citizens. Its architecture also serves a higher purpose: the transmigration of dying souls into new life, retaining some of the spirit and knowledge of the former life. In this way, the denizens of the city are constantly evolving and growing. New souls are born every day, and celebrated, but old souls are the richest treasure in the city, as they contain the knowledge and wisdom of several human lifetimes. No one ever dies in Atunwa; they merely try again. Or at least, that\u2019s what they used to say. Someone has found a way to disconnect those who live in the city from the special energies of the city. Old souls are actually dying, prompting the panicked people to ask: where do old souls go when they leave Atunwa?\nThough Upstairs has its small-town charm, everything that's shaking takes place Downstairs, where the little shadows of everyday objects live their lives at night. But lives end\u2014even the days of a knife can be cut short. So, from the busy workaday corner of Living & Kitch all the way up to the glass table-view cabinets in Dining, the truth will unravel like a lost sock\u2014make sure that sock isn't you.\nThe City of Scarlet Light has power in this world, not through military arms, nor religious strictures, but through pleasures of the flesh as performed by their trained courtesans, the Light-Touched. Other cities trade their dearest commodities in order to engage a contract with one of the Light-Touched, but inside the City, corruption reigns. Noble houses vie to place their sons and daughters in the most exclusive training houses, while the poor struggle to afford a bit of carmine to give their lips grace. Tensions were already high when news broke that Caron, son of Briallyn and Grey Scholar of the Autumn Breath, had been found strangled with his own satin bondage ropes, and the city plunged into mourning for a beloved teacher. Caron seemed to have no enemies, but a cryptic symbol left at the scene suggests he may have crossed the wrong person.\nAn urban megalopolis where androids and bots do the hard, dangerous or menial work humans used to do. Riches from their labor and poverty for displaced workers divide the city. In the midst of an election year where manumission for silicon citizens is hotly contested, the disappearance of a champion of digital sapience throws the entire urbzone into an uproar.\nThe Tkausa Dynasty has ruled the ten thousand worlds of The Commonality for a thousand years and five generations. Each Hierophant, aided by their immortal ancestors, has fomented rivalry between the Seated Families to preserve the Tkausa Dynasty\u2019s seat on the throne. But now, the Heirs of Yana send gifts of falsemen to the Family of Ta\u00fcu, while the Ta\u00fcu lend their powers of mind control to the House Marrd, who secretly convey Yana agents between worlds. With the discovery of the body of Kellowen Gurch, the Tkausa envoy, in his quarters of the Yana palace, the Commonality of Worlds balances on the point of a flashing stiletto wielded by hand unknown.\nEvery backer who\u2019s getting a physical copy of the game ($25+) will also receive a 3.5\u201dx 5\u201d Noirlandia case book, designed by Evan Rowland. The pocket-sized case books include: \n A Case History table of contents for all your Noirlandia cases \n24 pages, with room for notes and doodles \nA page of noir Descriptors, to give your case that special noir flavor!\nIn addition to the above, you can help unlock new features for the game by completing these challenges!\nNew Random Lead Generators: Write a surreal, one-sentence mystery and use the hashtag #Noirlandia - then post publicly to Twitter, to G+, or to our Facebook!\nNew Full Page Art for Noirlandia: Take a selfie with you and a suspect or a clue, then post publicly to Twitter, G+, or to our Facebook with the hashtag #Noirlandia!\nWith each posting, we'll get closer to unlocking a different feature.

Driven by the primal instinct to survive, you venture into the depths of the Evergut in search of some remnant of the past that will postpone your inevitable digestion.\nThe land was resplendent once; sprawling forests, massive ranges, glittering coastlines. Hundreds of clans, nations, and empires carved their homes from mountain and glen - living and killing and loving beneath the sun-kissed boughs.\nBut that was a lifetime ago. For generations the survivors have known nothing but sorrow. The Hungry God consumed all, leaving the world as little more than a skinned carcass moaning to be put out of its misery. Millions were swallowed during the Great Devourer's gluttonous feast; and yet, humanity pressed on.\nBelly of the Beast is a tabletop roleplaying game focusing on scavengers: brazen survivors that plumb the depths of a world-eating monster's guts, scouring the remains of the mighty Empires that were eaten by the Beast. \nThe Web Ruins, by Jeff Brown\nWhy play Belly of the Beast? It tightly examines the lives and stories of the Swallowed survivors. What kind of society would exist within a diabolically massive creature? Who would these people be, and how would they survive? What drives them to press on, to not descend into depression or debauchery?\nPrimary design focus: Stories about scavengers that harvest a grim and paltry living from the semi-digested leftovers of a bygone age.\nSetting highlights: Humanity's remnants live within the stomach of the World Eater - a creature the size of the Himalayas - as it inexorably consumes the planet's crust. Survive roaming bands of reavers, hungry cannibals, digestive acids in the air, and the hazardous innards of the Beast itself.\nSystem focus: Characters are driven by their Instincts - the core values that compel them to seek out treasure deep within the Evergut. The gameplay integrates with the narrative, and every decision is difficult and fraught with danger.\nGame format: The game will be released as a PDF and print-on-demand book from bendutter.com and DriveThru RPG. It'll be around 34,000 words, 6x9,\" professionally edited, laid out, and illustrated in full color.\nCharacters are compelled by Instincts\nBelly of the Beast's system revolves around the characters' personal Instincts. How their behavior aligns with these Instincts bolsters and hinders their work as a scavenger.\nThe remains of a thousand cultures\nThe Beast didn't swallow just a single kingdom or empire or continent. No, all of humanity's great civilizations and societies were eaten by the Insatiable One, leaving a veritably infinite array of artifacts from countless cultures to be picked over by your characters.\nNowhere to go but down\nScavengers do what they do out of necessity - their loved ones and their stronghold and their best friends' lives depend on it. They climb through endlessly twisting entrails, not for the thrill of adventure nor immortal infamy, but to bring home the best scraps that they can find.\nYour characters are united by the common cause of surviving this nightmare. Driven by Instinct, they keep coming back because they're good at what they do - and they're the best shot that the Swallowed society has.\nScavengers: the craziest survivors in the Belly\nTo have lived through the Devouring means you're downright unkillable. But to choose to go deeper into the disgusting bowels of the Hungry God, to fish out salvage from rotten heaps of who knows what? That kind of insane attitude is exactly what makes scavengers unique. These brave (and often greedy) folk are a vital part of a society that begrudgingly respects them.\nTharkugg Stronghold, by Jeff Brown\nJason Pitre, designer of Spark RPG:\n\"Belly of the Beast is a grim and literally visceral horror game. It's a game of scarcity and desperation, where innocent people are forced to terrible deeds by circumstance. It's a game of fragile people and vulnerable people, oppressed by a massive and uncaring force that seeks only to consume them whole.\"\nKarl Larsson, designer of Scavengers RPG:\n\"Dark fantasy is a term that gets used quite a lot, but is there anywhere darker than the insides of a gigantic monster? The setting is as grim as can be, and Ben has the writing prowess to bring it to life.\nWhile the premise is both original and disturbing, it is matched with an equally powerful system. The characters' motivations drive the game, which never fails to create an involving and exciting experience.\"\nthe Cannibal King, by Arthur Asa\nTim Bannock, neuronphaser.com:\n\"Belly of the Beast is unique in that its setting is at once original and also thoroughly horrifying. You can take it [in] any direction of horror, from the gory to the grimdark to the post-apocalyptic, and the tools included within will provide plenty of hooks for a long-term campaign in such a terrifying place, or a great one-shot that feels like nothing else on your game shelf.\"\nJoshua Yearsley, editor for Evil Hat Productions:\n\"Everything about Belly of the Beast makes sense, and that's an impressive feat. This is a Bronze Age fantasy that somehow also feels like hard sci-fi - just as colonists on Venus would adapt to the planet's harsh realities, so do the inhabitants of the Evergut.\nThe Beast's bowels not only inform the lives, cultures, and practices of the Swallowed, but also incite exploration of gender, class, and family. Ben's created an authentic sense of time and place in nearly unthinkable conditions. Fantastic.\"\nYour character's Instincts are the guts of the game. What natural predilections motivated your character to become a scavenger? How does descending into the depths of the Evergut conflict or align with those inherent morals and predispositions?\nLiving within the Belly is a naturally dehumanizing experience - you'll do whatever you have to in order to survive. However, hanging on to what makes you human is equally important, or else you'll spiral into ferality and madness.\nScavengers select two of the five Instincts:\nCuriosity: the desire to know\nFear: to recognize danger\nGreed: to fulfill your wants\nLoyalty: your devotion to others\nViolence: to employ the ultimate authority\nInstinct Dice\nScavengers venture into the caustic wastes of the Evergut, often battling against reavers and cannibals, mutated beasts and the hazards of the Belly itself. If they behave in a way that aligns with their Instincts, they gain Instinct Dice (ID), which are used to perform certain maneuvers and add dice to rolls.\nby Jeff Brown\nAshamed\nSometimes one has to succumb to their Instincts, ignoring their reason and intellect for the sake of survival. Whipped into a frenzied bloodlust, jumping heedlessly to aid your kin, pushing to get just one more piece despite the danger - all things a more reasonable scavenger would avoid.\nOnce you've succumbed to an Instinct, you become Ashamed, and can no longer Advance until you've atoned for your savagery.\nTranscended\nScavengers can recognize that our feral tendencies - made acute from a life on the cusp of death - must be ignored at times, and transcend above them. Setting aside Greed or closed-minded Loyalty for the sake of progress can be beneficial, but prevents a scavenger from acquiring Instinct Dice after they have forsaken the ignoble qualities that drive them.\nA medieval fantasy world has been swallowed by a massive World Eater\nThe characters are scavengers, digging through the refuse of the Eaten Age\nHighly focused on surviving in an endless web of dark, digestive dungeons and tunnels\nHundreds of years ago a massive rock fell from the sky, crushing kingdoms and continents in a shower of molten stone. Eventually, life in the realms returned to a state of normalcy, and the many clans continued their incessant struggle for power.\nThree generations ago, the skyrock - possessed with foul energies and discordant vibrations - erupted in a disgusting ball of effluence and viscera, birthing the creature that dwelt within it: the Swallower of Worlds, the Insatiable God, the Devourer, or simply: the Beast.\nIncalculably large, the Beast unfurled its great girth upon the land, consuming thousands of leagues of soil, stone, and forest. One by one, the mighty strongholds and great armies of the age fell to its inexorable consumption.\nAnd yet when legions, empires, and cities are swallowed whole, not all is lost. A rare few survive the Devouring, and test their mettle living in the Belly of the Beast.\nYou are one of these exemplars of grit and greed: a scavenger. Hundreds of great civilizations have been consumed, but their wares, artifacts, and materials are ripe for the taking deep within the recesses of your new home.\nPlenty are brave, desperate, or insane enough to try to make a living as a scavenger in this horrid place - but few survive, and even fewer thrive.\nOlba the Allsister, by Arthur Asa\nBelly of the Beast uses a modified version of the Ethos Engine (Vow of Honor, Hunt the Wicked) and has been tailored specifically for horrific, desperate, survivalist adventures.\nSurvival and Instinct\nThe system focuses on skilled survivors compelled by their innate Instincts. It highlights the dynamic between their need to cooperate with each other and their personal, selfish, and often dangerous desires.\nD6 dice pool\nBelly of the Beast uses a pool of d6 to resolve Tasks. Successes are counted based on the face value of each die (1-6), with the number determining success based on a character's Skill. Poorly skilled characters succeed on a 6, while the most competent succeed on 3s or better.\nSkill based competence\nCharacters' abilities are based upon the eight Skills (Awareness, Coordination, Cunning, Influence, Lore, Might, Resolve, and Stealth). The better at a particular Skill, the more likely an action within that Skill will succeed.\nUniversal task resolution\nPlayers roll a relevant Skill to overcome a Task, and can add Instinct Dice (ID) to their base roll. When characters fail to overcome Tasks, they suffer Consequences. Combat, mental challenges, physical obstacles, and social interactions are all handled in the same Task system.\nKatarod, by Arthur Asa\nInstincts\nPlayers select two Instincts that drive their characters to act, earning ID when acting Instinctively, and spending them to activate Instinct Maneuvers or add dice to their roll. A character with the Greed Instinct can consistently find the most valuable item in a given area, while one driven by Loyalty allows the character to suffer a Consequence in another's stead.\nTalents\nEach character has player-defined Talents, freeform abilities that provide bonuses when relevant. A character could be especially Nimble, granting them a bonus when they're attempting to balance over a chasm, or an Expert Alchemist, gaining an advantage when brewing potions and harvesting ingredients.\nSpecialties\nScavengers fill their role with a single Specialty - a narrow field of expertise or innate capability that grants an edge when relevant. An Engineer automatically succeeds when creating simple tools, while a Tracker has permission to attempt otherwise impossible tracking Tasks.\nHazards, the Beast, and more\nBelly of the Beast is further fleshed out with rules for hazardous environments, favors, breaking and making equipment, abstract wealth, forcing the environment within the Beast to change upon the scavengers' actions, and more to create a compelling game focused on the scavengers' dangerous lives.\nAbout 34,000 words (200 6x9\" pages)\nDiscusses the setting and system in great detail\nEdited by Joshua Yearsley\nLaid out by Phillip Gessert\nArtwork by Jeff Brown and Arthur Asa\nDRM-free PDF and print-on-demand\nThe team and I have worked on many projects together, and I know exactly what to expect during the fulfillment process. The people working on this are the best in the business, and I'm confident that we will deliver on schedule, within budget, and above expectations.\nThe game will be released in PDF as well as through print-on-demand at DriveThru RPG. If you back at the $13 or $125 reward level, you'll get an at-cost code to print the book (about $10 for softcover, $25 for hardcover), plus shipping, depending on the final page count and DT's current price.\nI'm a firm believer in improving the core product as opposed to adding content. For every $1,000 we reach beyond the goal we'll add another complement of artwork. I keep my stretch goals simple so that our production timeline is quick, and everybody knows what they're getting at the start of the campaign.\nRead the Current Draft\nIf you want to take a look at the current working draft of the game, you can do so here.

It\u2019s about humanity, and how those among us who are the most obsessed have the power to alter reality until it aligns with their fevered desires. It\u2019s about getting what you want despite others trying to keep it from you.\nUnknown Armies presents magick as it might exist in a world co-created by Tim Powers and James Ellroy, as twisting wrinkles in reality created by greater and greater risk, sacrifice, and obsession. In Unknown Armies we ask, what would you risk to change the world? Your friends? Your family? Your health? Your sanity? Magick finds a way to ask the very most from you, until you achieve what you want or you are left with nothing.\nUnknown Armies lets you play one of these characters. Resolve your character's actions through the luck of percentile dice. Track your character's emotional response to significant forms of trauma and shock. Try to accomplish a self-assigned objective or goal in order to get what you want. As part of a cabal, your character helps others to achieve their own goals, as well as a group objective that can \u2014 and will \u2014 have long-lasting consequences when it is met.\nCo-created by Greg Stolze and John Tynes, Unknown Armies presents an entirely original and yet disturbingly familiar approach to mystery, horror, and action in roleplaying games.

Change won't happen without broad consensus. Reality won't twist without the focused expression of your collective will.

With Kickstarter's help, the adventure of Pinstripe can be completed and released by August of 2016.\nStarts at 1:52:42\nPinstripe is a 2D adventure game about an ex-minister named Teddy who must explore Hell in search of his daughter Bo, who has been kidnapped by a strange entity claiming to be God. \nTeddy, Bo, and his puppy George.\nPinstripe features bizarre and interesting puzzles, strange monsters to shoot with your handy shotgun, and unique and lovable characters to engage with in order to advance through Hell. \nExplore a vast and freezing cold Hell.\nDiscover super weird creatures in Hell.\nSimple gameplay is the cornerstone of Pinstripe, and was the goal from the start. With simplistic and casual gameplay, the player can focus on the art, music, and story, and become immersed in the beautiful atmosphere. The goal of Pinstripe is to make you feel like a kid again without being bogged down with stuff that is confusing and unnecessarily. This is achieved by picking up the controller, running around and exploring the strange world, hanging out with funny characters, and occasionally shooting your shotgun to complete puzzles. For Pinstripe, simple gameplay makes exploring Hell super fun.\n Features:\nHighly polished, illustrative 2D graphics.\nAn emotionally charged story about fatherhood and Hell.\nA detective styled adventure. Help your dog George uncover clues about your past.\nExamine clues about your past life.\nA moody, beautiful soundtrack reminiscent of the Zelda franchise featuring piano and classical instrumentation.\nOld-school, simplistic platforming and character interaction. \nStrange and challenging on-screen puzzles.\n6 strange and elegantly designed worlds (forest, train, cave, canyon, lake, and cliff!)\nThat wonderful feeling of adventure and exploration you used to get when you played games like King's Quest, Myst, and The Legend of Zelda.\nPinstripe was Greenlit in just 7 days!\nSometimes the characters in Pinstripe are extra weird, like this crotchety old tree.\nPinstripe has already received some awesome awards nominations and honors at IndieCade's E3 Showcase, Whippering Indie Cup in San Francisco, and Reboot 2015, and most recently, at SXSW 2016. However, it's nowhere near where it needs to be for release. \nI've been making games for almost 10 years now. My two most recent games, Coma and Skinny, became viral online hits and won several awards from companies like Indie Pub, Mochi, and Newgrounds. Although they were much shorter and less ambitious than Pinstripe, I like to think that all of my games have a similar heart and style.\nPlay Coma!\nPlay Skinny!\nPinstripe is about 60% complete. However, the remaining 40% is looking more and more daunting as I continue to work on this project. As many of you know, the older you get, the less time you have. When I was in college, I had plenty of time to mess around with this project on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this is not the case for me and my family.\nI need your help to be able to quit freelancing, and focus specifically on Pinstripe. With a serious jolt from the Kickstarter community, Pinstripe will be exactly where it needs to be by August of 2016.\nBefore Pinstripe, Coma and Skinny received multiple awards for their distinct and atmospheric soundtracks. Pinstripe's soundtrack is no different. It is beautiful and reminiscent of the Zelda franchise, and plays a key role in the game's mood and story. This is one of Pinstripe's strong suites. Pinstripe is a unique in that the entire experience, from the visuals to the music, is intentionally crafted by one individual, resulting in one cohesive piece of art. Feel free to take a listen to some of the songs written for Pinstripe so far:\nBut the soundtrack isn't perfect. It still needs a ton of work.\nI finally decided it was time for Kickstarter because I knew keeping this game alive and seeing it finished the right way would be extremely difficult without help from the Kickstarter community. \nUltimately, I need to focus on this game full-time, otherwise, it's going to be extremely difficult to finish. I need funds to pay for the game's production and also make up for the loss of funding due to quitting my day job. Feel free to see the budget below.\nAdditionally, your feedback and criticism is crucial. Seeing a project for what it is can be difficult without a community's involvement. I really just want to make a game you love, and I'm 100% positive I can do that with your help. If you don't love it, I want to know why and how I can make it better. \nWith your help, a beta build will be ready for testing by May of 2016, and the final build on Steam by August of 2016. By then, Pinstripe will be available on Steam for Mac, PC, and Linux, all because of you guys.\nThe budget above is only an estimation, and is subject to change.\nProfessional Advisory Board\nWithout these people and their incredible industry-specific input, Pinstripe would not be what it is today.\nKickstarter Shoutout #2: Go Check Out \"Knights & Bikes\"!\nCheck out Knights & Bikes!\nGo check out \"A Place for the Unwilling\"! It's a very interesting adventure game set in a living city filled with secrets to unveil. An open world inspired by Majora's Mask and Sunless Sea! Check it out!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping games is hard. Developing games alone is even harder. But I have 10 years of experience and have released 3 games prior to Pinstripe. I also have the support of an incredible advisory board. Ultimately, it can take a long time to develop a game alone, and a lot can go wrong from start to finish. But this game is not at the start, it has already been heavily worked on for years and with your help it will launch this summer.\n\nAnother concern is story: what makes Pinstripe special is a unique story surrounded by beautiful visuals and music. Pinstripe's story is written, but it is not implemented. I'm concerned that, although the story looks great on paper, it will not translate well in the actual game. To overcome this, I have a team of professional advisors who are very close to me, who will play the game and be sure to highlight any areas where the story just isn't working. This will be a fluid, on-going process, and will allow me to address the issues as they come, rather than after the game is released.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #73", "update_userinfo": "Get a FREE game if you back my buddy's project within the next 7 days!", "update_content": "My indie dev buddy Maxime has launched a Kickstarter for his cyberpunk first-person adventure game, and I wanted to let you know about.

It has around 20 million combinations. We'll wait!\nAfter a few weeks of playing with the Random Comic Generator, we started to wonder if its hundreds of random panels might lend themselves to a card game, where you compete against your friends to finish a comic with a funny punchline. So we printed out all of the RCG panels and started playing with them.\nWell, it worked. It worked really, really well (with a few tweaks).\nAnd now we think our game, Joking Hazard, is ready to bring to the world. With your help, of course.\nThe game itself includes a deck of 370 unique panel cards (we did the math, and that\u2019s over 50 million combinations of comics) most of which are so messed up we can\u2019t show them on Kickstarter without censoring them.

Improvisation and creativity are the essences of Insight Fantasy.\nAbout me & why\nHi. My name is Even V. R\u00f8ssland, creator of the Insight RPG System (http://bit.ly/1Oj67Go) and an avid roleplayer and Game Master for almost three decades.\nI live in Norway, hence the weird currency (NOK, Norwegian kroner). 1 USD is almost 9 NOK these days. I hope this won\u2019t deter you from backing this project.\nThe reason I started working with Insight Fantasy was that I wanted to create an RPG with an element that I\u2019ve been missing; the possibility to change the story while playing it. Not like the traditional sandbox RPG\u2019s, where you can solve the same quest in a couple of different ways(, and not like a Narrativist RPG System). I want the players to be able to change the story entirely, both the past and the present by implementing special \"story-changing\"-rules into the game mechanics. (You can read more here: http://bit.ly/1KlVSiR ). \nPreview of the Core Rules and the GM's Compendium\nThe initial plan was to create an add-on to the Insight RPG System, but it has become a more comprehensive project than the previous, with both a core rulebook and a GM's compendium (currently at a total of 350 pages). Some work remains (mostly artwork and layout), but with your help, it will be finished by the estimated launch date.\nInsight Fantasy is a further development of the Insight RPG System, a universal classless system. The list of Skills has been modified to suit a fantasy setting, and some system functions are changed, but all in all, the core system should be familiar to those who have played the Insight RPG System. You do not need the Insight RPG System Core Rulebook to play Insight Fantasy; it is a stand-alone system.\nThe system in brief: Everything is determined by your skills. All skills are related to an Ability (Strength, Body Control, Physical Fitness, Reason, Knowledge or Social), and you combine skills when performing actions. Your capabilities to perform Actions (sneaking, fighting, understanding, persuasion, etc.) are determined by your Skills; even your health and weapon damage are modified by the skills you choose.\nWhat the GM knows is not always the truth. Change the story as you play, and complete your quests in a way no one could have predicted.\nMore than a sandbox: The Game Master creates an adventure for the players. Like any other sandbox game, the players can approach the problems like they want to, but in Insight Fantasy, they can also alter locations, NPCs, creatures and the story that the GM has made. How to create these adventures is described in the GM's Compendium. How to change the story, and the consequences of the changes is described in the Core Rules and the GM's Compendium.\nSkills and Actions: Everything you do and every task you perform that require a skill roll is an action. An action is a combination of two Skills; a Main Skill and a Bonus Skill. The number of dice you can roll and the dice values you need depends on the two skills.\nThe list of Standard Skills is, already at Level 1, long enough to create a distinctive Player Character, but as you level up, special skills will become available. You can unlock Special skills by training the Standard Skills to their maximum, and will make you able to find your very own path and create a unique character. Having a unique Player Character make you more unpredictable, and more likely to be able to change the story (as the GM knows it).\nClassless: The skills you choose defines your player character in this system. Choose your path; you can specialize your knowledge and training within one field, or you can become a multitalented person. That is up to you.\nAs a start, you can select a pre-generated archetype from the Core Rules: fighter, ranger, rogue, barbarian, cleric, wizard, psion, bard, alchemist, savant or w'artisan (the combat skilled artisan); all with their diverse range of skills.\nAcquire Insight: Investigate, study, analyze and examine items, creatures, NPCs, buildings, weapons, and armor, and reveal things that even the GM doesn't know anything about. When you acquire insight, the story (that the Game Master has created) will change, and the GM must adhere to the changes.  \nSecrets: All NPCs can have secrets not known by the GM. The Player Characters can reveal the secrets, and thus, change the story.\nClues: You can find clues that the GM has not made. The clues can provide information regarding persons and items you are looking for, and thus change the story.\nReputation: Insight Fantasy does not use Experience Points (XP) as a reward. Your team is rewarded with reputation points instead. The more you change the story and conclusion of your quest, the more reputation points you get (read more here: http://bit.ly/1JOgFR5 )\nCombat: The combat system in Insight Fantasy is dynamic, in the manner that you can utilize your skills in many ways to defeat your opponents. When you attack, your target makes an opposed roll, there are no Armor Class to beat (armor reduces the damage, your skills improve your opposed rolls). To avoid combat can sometimes be a good idea because the consequences of getting injured can be severe. Not all Player Characters are capable of joining a fight and live. Find your opponent's weaknesses, exploit them and defeat your foe without risking your lives. Hack & slash, and counting HP is not the essence of Insight Fantasy. Combat is, of course, an important part of the system, but the ability to avoid conflicts is equally important. As long as you take control over the story, the methods of completing your quests are in your hands.\nWeapons: All the 37 weapons described in the book have different stats and features. The damage is calculated based on your skills. In this way, you can choose the weapon that best suits your range of Skills.\nMagic: When you select Magic Skills, you can cast a wide variety of spells. You can improve your spells by choosing special Magic Skills. As you level up and improve your Skills, more magic spells will become available. Many Magic Spells are not intended for combat. Being able to utilize your magic skills to change the story, can be more beneficial. \nDivinity: By gaining divine favor, you can channelize the powers of the gods by chanting Divine Rites. Many divine casters are worshippers of one of the gods. There are great benefits of staying loyal to your god, but it can be demanding because there is no middle way between good and evil. (Read more here: http://bit.ly/1JiD6y1)\nPsionics: By meditating, you can use the hidden powers of your brain to affect your own or others' minds. See through the eyes of your targets, plant fake memories, amplify their weaknesses or control their bodies.   \nAlchemy: Gather ingredients, mix them together as described in the recipe and create drinkable potions, poisons, and bombs. There is a list of 64 known and frequently used ingredients in the book, but a skilled alchemist can study any possible ingredient and discover alchemical properties that can be used to create new and unique recipes.\nThe Insight Fantasy Character Sheet is included in all pledges\nRaces: You can choose between six different races; human, elf, halfling, gnome, dwarf and orc. They all have about the same initial possibilities, but their differences are in their possibilities defined by maximum Ability values. The different races also have certain Skills that are initially more developed compared to the others.\nCharacter Generation Tool: A tool made in Google Spreadsheet will make player character generation and advancements quicker and much easier. It is also a valuable tool for creating NPCs. The tool is finished and will be available when the book is launched.\nMonsters/Creatures: The GM\u2019s Compendium will have a selection of 18 monsters/creatures (dragons, gnolls, goblins, minotaur, undead, etc.). If this project turns out well, the plan is to make a more comprehensive creature compendium soon. The GM\u2019s Compendium will also have a selection of standard NPCs for quick encounters (guards, bandits, etc.)\nThe World has only one known sea, the Long Sea, which separates the known world in two; West-of-Sea and East-of-Sea. By sail, it takes at least 14 days to cross the Long Sea. The Great Island is the largest of the islands in the Long Sea. The southern parts of the island have a warm climate and the densest population of the known world. The middle regions of the island are scarcely populated, and the northern parts are mainly wilderness; cold in winter and humid summers. About a millennium ago, the Great Island was an uninhabited wilderness. Elves, halflings, and gnomes are originally from West-of-Sea. Humans, dwarves, and orcs have their roots in East-of-Sea. Most orcs still live in East-of-Sea. They are known as the \"wild orcs.\" The orcs living on the Great Island are civilized orcs, mostly ascendants of orcish slaves.\nAll the countries and areas have names and a short history, described in the Core Rules, but can rename some of them\nAre you a historical figure?\nMaybe you were a great and influential monarch of one of the nations on the Great Island, or perhaps a famous explorer of the wild and dangerous Grouse Island? Some of the pledges allow you to name a kingdom or a grand duchy of the Great Island, or one of the vast (and mostly uncharted) areas of the Grouse Island.\nSection of the known world\n(Updated)\n100 Backers (REACHED!): All backers who pledged for the GM's Compendium PDF will also get the POD edition of the GM's Compendium (at-cost, shipping not included.

Estimated delivery will be determined at 200.000 kr.\n- Is this a Storyteller or Narrativist RPG System?  \nNo. The way you change/alter the story is not based on the individual player\u2019s storytelling abilities, but the player character\u2019s skills and skill rolls. The story-changing-mechanic is an integrated part of the game mechanics just like combat and other interactions and follows a set of rules. Some player characters will become better at changing the story in their favor while some will focus on combat, stealth, crafting, magic, etc., depending on which skills they choose. \n- What are the rules for naming a country, area, deity or the island?\nYou can use parts of your own name, a nickname or a completely different name that you would like to use, and that would fit a fantasy setting. The name cannot be protected by copyrights. The name cannot be a known location or person in either the real world or in a known fictional world. The name must not be offensive by any means (discriminatory, racist or disrespectful names will be rejected). (You can provide additional descriptions and details of your named areas, countries, and deities, but they can be rewritten to fit the rest of the book.) The three existing deities, as of today: Pan'or - Goddess of Life (good), Ghor'wa - God of Domination (evil), Medi'qi - God of Creativity (neutral).\n- Any future expansions?\nIf the Kickstarter turns out well, the plan is to make several expansions; Creature Compendium, Item Compendium, short adventures etc. Stay tuned; the Stretch Goals will unveil some expansions. Expansion proposals are appreciated, and you are free to make your own expansions. \n- Why do you use Print on Demand instead of a conventional print shop?\nAs a small independent developer/publisher, the cost of printing the books traditionally is too high. By using POD, the book is available at any time to any part of the world at a low cost. Maybe someday in the future, Insight RPG book will be printed at conventional print shops.\n- What does \"at-cost\" mean?\nWhen you purchase the hardcover book, you must pay the print cost from DriveThruRPG. This is why the pledge is lower than you would have anticipated. The print cost is about 15-17 USD. You will get a Complimentary Copy link from DriveThruRPG that takes you to the checkout. \nIf you have questions about the printing cost regarding your pledge, leave a comment, and I'll do my best to find an answer.\n- What is the estimated shipping cost for the physical book?\nThe shipping cost varies, depending on where the book is being printed, and how far away the receiver is (Some examples are listed here).\nRecipients in the US (standard shipping): about 6 USD\nRecipients in the UK (standard shipping): about 8 USD\nRecipients in Europe, not UK (standard shipping): about 14-15 USD\nRecipients in Australia (standard shipping): about 21 USD\nIf you have questions about shipping cost to your country, leave a comment, and I'll do my best to find an answer. \n- How does the DriveThruRPG Fulfillment work?\nLike this:\n- What do you need the funding for?\nThere are some expenses when creating this project, not including the time used writing the book. The artwork is a major part of the expenses in addition to software licenses (layout, writing and editing) and other professional help. Some marketing is also necessary. Here is a pie chart showing the project expenses.\n- Any reviews?\nInsight Fantasy has not yet been reviewed, but the Insight RPG System, which Insight Fantasy is based on has been reviewed.

It is an interactive narrative with a focus on exploration set in a fictional Islamic majority country that has an occupying military force. The protagonist and player character is a woman called Dujanah who has grievances with the intervening forces. During the game the player will encounter various moral, psychological and political dilemmas. \nDujanah will employ a number of innovations that make the narrative unique and subversive. Stories in the game will have various randomised elements for players, encouraging conversation outside of the game. The story will also change depending on decisions made by the player allowing for different final outcomes. Dujanah allows for a non-linear narrative meaning that players will experience a story that is unique to them. The main motivation for the player at the start of the game is to find a resolution for the grievances experienced, considering the question: how does revenge manifest itself?\nWhilst seeking an answer to this, the player will visit various environments with a multitude of characters from an assortment of backgrounds, all with unique dialogues. This is where the greater part of the game takes place, finding the different stories and exploring the world of the game. Among the themes I hope to explore are: pluralism, motivations, ethics regarding intervention and libertarianism. An important aspect of the narrative is a certain quality of magical realism where fantasy elements are present in a real-world setting.\n These include figures from Islamic eschatology, fictional machinery and humanoid creatures. The purpose of this is at once to symbolise certain inhuman characteristics and at the same time remove it slightly from reality. An aspect of magical realism is also present when the player's role in the game is explicitly referred to and when non-fiction interviews and stories are presented alongside fictional ones. \nThe world of Dujanah is comprised of clay animation and hand-crafted objects combined with photo-collage and paintings all augmented with digital effects. Unlike many contemporary games which are depicted purely in computer generated images, I want to create something that is instantly familiar to any audience yet also original and visually distinct. Many of the scenes are inspired by Islamic art and architecture, in particular the adobe buildings and geometric patterns of Moroccan villages. \nThe Market Place in Touf Laajel\nDown by the Sea in Bou Seppez\nDeep in the Amnahir Caves\nThe creatures in the Amnahir Caves are real meanies.\nThe foreboding entrance to the Amnahir Caves\n\"Of course I have free will, I have no choice but to have it\"\nSome worn out machines.\nSound is an important part of Dujanah and helps create the mood of the world. Most of the music is performed on acoustic instruments using harmonic and double harmonic scales which resemble Arabic modes. \nA post-punk band plays in an underground club\nThe arrangements often include piano, assorted percussion, guitar and kalimba to create a percussive, \u201cearthy\u201d timbre. I intend to use a variety of recording techniques, from low-quality recordings to resemble a more vintage sound to recordings made with binaural microphones to create a more immediate and intimate effect. Other scenes will have spoken word elements, either real-world conversations or dramatic monologues. I hope to record conversations and interviews with different people who have interesting perspectives on the themes discussed in the game.\nI have a deep passion for music and sound and specialised in sound practices at university. With Dujanah I really want to push myself creatively and have fun with the use of sound and music in the game. \nThere are many interesting characters to come across on your travels.\nAt the Arcade\nWhen you are tired of exploring you might want to pop into the arcade and play a game of something. Here you can find the Metroid-like Caves of Al Dajjal, puzzler Poopek Loves it All and a variety of other treats. The games you find in the arcade intertwine with certain stories in unique and sometimes surprising ways. The idea of a story within a story, a game within a game really interests me and I want to explore different ways of using this narrative tool that I believe is impossible in any other medium.\nPoopek Loves It All is a puzzle game about loving everything.\nCaves of Al Dajjal is a metroid-like game.\n Predominantly I would like to research, present and discuss topics with the desired outcome to have a greater understanding of difficult themes such as the relationship between violence and religion. I believe a video game is an accessible, contemporary medium that allows for an interaction unachievable with other art forms, and a greater understanding of the themes tackled in the game will perhaps encourage more tolerance. An aspect of the research has involved talking with members of the Muslim community and beyond and considering perspectives that have not otherwise been presented in video games. I have already had a great many interesting conversations with relevant folk and plan to continue to do so should the funding be successful. Personally, I hope to mature my practice in every respect; greater visual representations, more developed sound, a more intricate narrative concerned with topics that I am keen to understand better.\n I live in Edinburgh, Scotland, a truly inspiring city. I enjoy running and ping-pong, however, my real passion in life is making games. I've played in bands since I was 15 then went on to study Philosophy and English literature. Ultimately I qualified with a honours degree in Fine Art and found a home for all my creative outgoings by making games. \nI have been making games for over 4 years now; from jam games and celebrated freeware titles to a collaborative experiment and a project helping kids make games in Forth Valley Children's Ward. I have even published a commercial game called Beeswing which was successfully funded through Kickstarter.\nA full portfolio of my work can be found HERE\nThank you for considering my Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe two main risks when dealing with a Kickstarter for a video game are the game failing to materialise and the game being delayed. \n\nI have successfully delivered a game (Beeswing) through Kickstarter before which I hope alleviates some concerns about the game not emerging. I have been engaged with this project since February, 2015 and have done a good deal of preparatory work. In terms of game mechanics and the way the piece works, all the fundamentals are finished; the text system is complete, there is a working save system allowing players to turn off the game and start from where they left off, the animations and sounds all start and stop when they are meant to. \n\nIn regards to the project being delayed I estimate that the game is about 65% complete, meaning that the anticipated release in October allows for some leeway should something go amiss. Having successfully completed a digital project of a similar size and scope I know that it will take roughly about another six months to finish this project. I am confident that the preparatory work that has been done has formed a strong foundation for the remainder of the project. \n \nI have made a timeline to help meet my targeted release window:\n \nI hope for the work to be in an alpha state by April, 2016, meaning that there is an unstable working version that is playable from beginning to end within certain parameters and with important aspects missing. By June I hope to have a beta version, a stable version that has all the major story arcs and other features in place. Throughout the process I will keep a development log for peers and the project's potential audience to engage with and leave feedback on. At the alpha stage I will share the project with a small number of peers (five or six) to provide feedback and evaluation. At the beta stage the project will be shared with a larger group of peers for more extensive testing and evaluation and the time after will be spent fixing any bugs and hiccups in the code. \n\n In terms of understanding the subject matter my reading list has been as follows: \n\nThe Qur'an \nOne Thousand years of Philosophy by Rom Harre\nIslam and the Future of Tolerance A Dialogue by Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz\nFreewill by Sam Harris\nOf Man by Thomas Hobbes\nGhostly Demarcations by Derrida et al\nTheories and Documents of Contemporary Art, edited by Kristine Stiles and Peter Selz\n\nDuring the time of development I intend to reach out and to conduct interviews with participants who may have interesting perspectives on the topics in the game. I am still considering how best to disseminate these interviews and conversations within the piece. \n\nThe greatest risk for me is misrepresenting or exploiting the subject matter. This has been a concern of mine throughout my life as a practising artist and I hope to alleviate it through conversation and beta-testing at different stages with people of various backgrounds. \n\nMy reading list for the remainder of the project includes:\n\nRadical by Maajid Nawaz\nInfidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali\nReason, Freedom and Democracy in Islam by AbdolKareem Soroush\nFreedom of Religion, Apostasy & Islam by Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "The Maps of Dujanah", "update_content": "Hi there,\nI took a few hours the other day to put together a single image of all the Dujanah maps next to each other, thought you might be interested.

It features a tremendously diverse roster of contributors, writing about everything from the fascinating world of women's pinball, to the lingo of Chinese games culture, to the small, intimate games that explore how young adults deal with sex and technology. It's a book for anyone with a passion for design, play and criticism, and we need your help to bring it to life!\nThe awesome book you'll get (mockup)\nWhen editors Leigh Alexander and Laura Hudson relaunched Offworld, our goal was to build a website that focused on the writing and game design work of women, people of color and other marginalized folks. We wanted to create a space that actively welcomed perspectives that are often ignored by mainstream game culture, a place where where we could share our expertise and insight into the art of game creation and the culture of play.\nAfter a year of publishing incredible content from an all-star roster of writers, we're running this campaign to pay for the cost of publishing a book collection\u2014and to monetarily reward the people who have done this important work. We want to make a lovely, wonderfully-designed object to celebrate the excellence of Offworld and its contributors, a physical thing we can hold up any time anyone says \u201cthere just aren\u2019t\u201d people like us working in this space. \n(mockup)\nThe Offworld Collection is a sophisticated but accessible look at an amazing landscape, where small, simple experiences can reflect our humanity. We hope it can introduce more people to the full breadth of what games, technology and play can mean, and who can participate in them. \nWe're so proud of all the features in the book, which are just as varied as its contributors: Daniel Starkey delves into a game that reimagines Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying through the lens of Native storytelling traditions; game developer Catt Small writes about how designing a black woman protagonist mattered\u2014even in a shooting game set inside tiny spaceships; Soha Kareem writes about healing trauma by making text games; Katriel Page explores how game-making is like poetry, while Shareef Jackson explains how it\u2019s like hip hop.\n(mockup)\nLeigh Alexander and Laura Hudson also contribute features on everything from games where you can empathize with monsters to the tragic mortality of virtual pets. And we're especially proud that Gita Jackson\u2019s essay \u201cWe Are Not Colonists\u201d was highlighted as one of the year\u2019s best articles by the website Critical Distance. \nCONTRIBUTORS\nHere\u2019s a full list of writers who appear in The Offworld Collection:\nLeigh Alexander  \nLaura Hudson\nAnna Anthropy\nAevee Bee \nKatherine Cross \nTanya DePass\nSidney Fussell \nGita Jackson \nShareef Jackson \nJuliet Kahn \nSoha Kareem \nAroon Karuna  \nMerritt Kopas \nRiley MacLeod \nAnnie Mok\nMaddy Myers \nMaxwell Neely-Cohen \nKim Nguyen  \nSarah Nyberg \nLiz Ryerson \nKatriel Paige \nCatt Small \nDaniel Starkey \nZoe Quinn \nChristina Xu \nEXPENSES\nThe primary cost of the campaign will simply be publishing and shipping an 8.5 x 11\" buckram hardcover book.

Inspired by the works of Alexandre Dumas, The Princess Bride, and other works of high adventure, 7th Sea played fast and furious, emulating the pace of movies like Captain Blood, The Three Musketeers, and Pirates of the Caribbean.\nAnd now 7th Sea is back in the hands of its original creator\u2014that\u2019s me! John Wick!\u2014and that means it's time to bring 7th Sea back to your gaming table! \nRead on to hear more about 7th Sea, but I want to say a huge THANK YOU to all our fans who have made this the most successful tabletop RPG project in Kickstarter history.

It\u2019s got everything you need to try out the game, including pregen characters, mechanics, and a starter adventure!\n7th Sea is a tabletop roleplaying game of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Th\u00e9ah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe. Players take the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and protecting the rightful kings and queens of Th\u00e9ah from murderous villains.\nCore Rulebook Mockup\nAs a 7th Sea Hero, you might...\n\u2026 save the Queen of Avalon from treacherous blackmail! \n\u2026 thwart a dastardly assassination attempt on the Cardinal of Castille! \n\u2026 raid the villainous fleets of Vodacce merchant-princes! \n\u2026 free the Prince of the Sarmatian Commonwealth from a mysterious curse! \n\u2026 make decisions that alter the very course of Th\u00e9an history!\nIn most roleplaying games, you start off as a 1st-level loser who\u2019s terrified of the goblin with a broken knife. In 7th Sea, you are a Hero, an icon of Th\u00e9ah ready to live and die for causes that matter. You can take on ten thugs with swords, knives, and guns all on your own. You don\u2019t start off digging through old dungeons hoping to find a copper piece or two. No! You are trusted knight, a loyal bodyguard, or even\u2026 an adventuring queen herself.\nIn other words\u2026 you\u2019re d\u2019Artagnan, Milady de Winter, the Dread Pirate Roberts, Jack Sparrow, Julie d'Aubigney, and the Scarlet Pimpernel all rolled up in one!\nThis is a game of high adventure, mystery, and action. \nThis is a game of intrigue and romance. \nThis is 7th Sea.\nEach of the Nations in Th\u00e9ah is a unique culture, a country that prides itself on a national identity and a unique voice. There is no League of Nations in 7th Sea; each country stands alone, plotting its future as best it can in the face of dangers both internal and external.\n7th Sea characters usually come from one of the eight Th\u00e9an Nations:\nAvalon: Green and enchanted, this union of three kingdoms has recently risen to the forefront of The\u0301an politics under the leadership of Queen Elaine.\nCastille: Headquarters of the Vaticine Church, this fertile nation was once the home of science and reason, but it has fallen under the spell of corruption and fanaticism.\nEisen: A proud yet broken land, Eisen is a nightmare brought to life by three decades of mass murder kept at bay by heroes as dangerous as the horrors lurking in the Nation\u2019s shadows.\nMontaigne: One of The\u0301ah\u2019s most powerful nations, Montaigne leads the world in art and culture even as its Emperor crushes the populace beneath his thumb.\nSarmatian Commonwealth: Two nations bound by a single crown, the Commonwealth is a democratic monarchy where all people are equal, even kings.\nUssura: A Nation torn between traditional isolationism and an ambitious ruler who will do anything to drag his Nation into the future, no matter the cost.\nVestenmannavnjar: A Nation of raiders and warlords who conquered the world\u2019s economy by hammering their swords and spears into coins.\nVodacce: The former cradle of civilization, Vodacce is now split between seven merchant Princes whose complex and nefarious schemes reach every corner of the world.\nBut the world doesn\u2019t stop at the edges of Th\u00e9ah. In fact, the world of 7th Sea is going to get a whole lot bigger...\nI get more questions about 7th Sea than any other game I've written. Fans of the game truly love the world we created back in 1999 and were sad to see the game go out of print.\nFans of the 1st Edition should know that Th\u00e9ah is still largely as they remember it. We still have Vodacce Fate Witches and Montaigne Porte Magic, but some of the other Nations have undergone subtle changes. Eisen, Vestenmennavenjar, and Ussura are just a little different than they were before. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still recognize them, but just as fifteen years can change a person, fifteen years can change a Nation, too. And you\u2019ll get to explore a brand new Nation\u2026 the Sarmatian Commonwealth!\n7th Sea: Second Edition gives me a chance to not only bring the game back to all its devoted fans, but also to give it a new engine with plenty of chrome. Since 1999, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the roleplaying game industry. We have new design tools, new publishing options, and new ideas about what makes a roleplaying game work. I want to take advantage of all that new stuff and help 7th Sea become the game that I always wanted it to be: fast, fun, furious action that tells the stories of great heroes facing impossible odds amidst global politics.\nWe\u2019ve also got big plans for the book itself: a gorgeous 300 page, full color, fully illustrated hardcover tome. We\u2019ve got new artists helping us bring the world of Th\u00e9ah to your gaming table in all its grandeur and glory, and we\u2019re working with KrakenPrint to bring the book to your table in both a traditional hardcover edition and in a leather-bound, foil-stamped, embossed (and de-embossed!) pirate edition. Check out our Rewards section to learn more about what we\u2019re planning on printing.\nBut like I mentioned above, we are making the world a whole lot bigger than just Th\u00e9ah. We have huge plans to fill in the map of the entire world: new continents, new Nations, new sorceries, new adventures! All of them are waiting for first-time players and those intimately familiar with the first edition of 7th Sea.\nFans of the old game will be glad to hear we still have the classic five Traits\u2014Brawn, Finesse, Resolve, Wits, and Panache\u2014as well as Skills to describe your character\u2019s training and experience. However, instead of Roll and Keep your Trait, it\u2019s now Roll and Keep Everything. That\u2019s right, you keep all your dice and use them to resolve risky and dangerous actions.\nAfter you roll, you take your dice and make sets of 10. Each set is a Raise. You can use Raises to accomplish goals, overcome obstacles, and dodge consequences. In other words, Raises make your character awesome. And as a 7th Sea Hero\u2026 you\u2019ll have lots of Raises.\nWe\u2019ve streamlined the rest of the system as well, making it faster, more dramatic and easier to learn. We made dueling possible for everyone, not just swordsmen: if you can pick up a sword, you can get yourself into a duel. Everything about the new system is designed to get you into the action! \nWhether you\u2019re a fan of the original edition or someone who\u2019s never played before, you can download the Quick Start right now and see for yourself what the new 7th Sea looks and plays like. Just back the Kickstarter (even at $1!) and you can start your adventures in Th\u00e9ah!\nBut 7th Sea: Second Edition isn\u2019t the only book we\u2019ve got planned for this line; we\u2019re also excited to announce our full line of 7th Sea sourcebooks, each one a new opportunity to expand what 7th Sea is all about. Here's the full list of every sourcebook funded by this campaign:\nWhy are we expanding out to new lands? To give the game more scope, to encourage exploration (and piracy!) and to bring a wider variety of faces and voices to Th\u00e9ah\u2019s shores. We think 7th Sea needs more sea travel, more adventure in far off places, and a more diverse setting.\nBut we're also committed to making sure that this project doesn't drag on forever! We'll be delivering these books over the next year and a half, according to the release schedule above. We'll keep folks updated as each project develops, and we might be able to get one or two out a bit early.\nIf you'd like to grab one of the sourcebooks, add $40 to your pledge or select a reward tier that includes sourcebooks. You can also check out the ALL THE BOOKS, OFFICER or ALL THE BOOKS, PIRATE tier to snag all eleven sourcebooks at a great price.\nThe 7th Sea community was always one of my favorite parts about working on the line when I was at AEG. I still get messages from people who tell me that 7th Sea saved their life when they were homeless or they almost named their kid after a 7th Sea character. Amazing stuff.\nIn order to capture that community again, we asked our backers to tweet, share, and contribute to the campaign with their own unique images and ideas. Over the course of the campaign, our fans have unlocked a dozen social stretch goals, including new Sorte cards, digital wallpapers, early previews, and more!\nIf you want to see the awesome selfies, LEGO ships, and more created by our backers, search on social media using the hashtag #sailthe7thSea. Thank you to everyone who contributed to unlocking these goals! Your fellow backers appreciate it!\nWe're so incredibly excited about the return of 7th Sea and our reward tiers are packed with cool stuff. We\u2019ve got  physical books, 1st Edition PDFs, special play opportunities, and even a treasure chest filled with exclusive 7th Sea artefacts!\nSince we\u2019re funding a whole line, we\u2019re handling rewards a bit differently than you might be used to on Kickstarter. When you back at a level that includes a sourcebook, you choose which sourcebook you get when the campaign is over through Backerkit. You're free to get any book you want or even snag multiple copies of the same sourcebook if that's what you want.\nIf you're interested in getting all the books, check out the ALL THE BOOKS, OFFICER and ALL THE BOOKS, PIRATE tiers that include virtually every product we're funding, including all the sourcebooks!\nOn to the rewards! \n$20 - EXPLORER: You receive the FULL COLOR 7th Sea: Second Edition PDF, including everything you need to play the game, maps of Th\u00e9ah, and more!\n$40 - SCHOLAR: You receive PDFs of ALL BOOKS/PRODUCTS we unlock through this campaign including PDFs for ALL 1ST EDITION BOOKS!

A Voddace fate witch adventures across Th\u00e9ah and the Seven Seas.\n$20 softcover / $40 hardcover Born Under a Black Flag Novel in Print - John Wick's second 7th Sea: Second Edition novel!

International backers should add $50 for shipping.\nWe'll try to make all of these these add-ons available after the campaign ends through our normal channels, but we may or may not have extras. We expect to have plenty of sourcebooks on hand, for example, but we may not have more 7th Sea dice or Hero points.\nRetailers can add on additional books and add-ons at retailer discounts through Backerkit, after the campaign ends. \nIf you're an international backer, please add $5 for each add-on you add to your order to cover shipping. Domestic shipping for add-ons is free.\n7th Sea: Second Edition is a game that spans the entire world, and our Kickstarter is no different. We're excited to send books to anywhere you are, including Europe, South America, Australia, and more! Thanks to Kixto Fulfillment, backers in the EU won't pay any customs or VAT on their shipments.\nThe costs for shipping each tier are included in the pledge levels on the right. When you select a tier, Kickstarter will tell you how much additional funding you'll have to add based on your country of origin. In general, we've tried to keep shipping to the absolute minimum... but shipping 300 page hardbound books isn't cheap.\nIf you're planning on adding on items to your order, you won't have to add any more shipping if you're a domestic backer. International backers will need to add $5 per item.\nIce Cream for Everyone: A geek-themed podcast where John talks about, among other things, the new edition of 7th Sea. \nhttp://traffic.libsyn.com/icecreamforeveryone/201511_ECfE_Podcast_Ep02_96kbps.mp3\nWhatever Happened to 7th Sea?: A stylized gaming podcast with John talking about 7th Sea\u2019s past and future. \n Mythwits Interview: Another interview where I talk about a few things including the new edition of 7th Sea. \nIn addition to myself, we have these fine people working with us to bring 7th Sea to your gaming table.

We've got a habit of delivering, and we keep our backers up-to-date on changes and problems as they crop up. Publishing is tough, but we're used to figuring out how to make stuff work and finish books.\n\nOf course, we're also working with Alderac Entertainment Group to make 7th Sea: Second Edition a reality. We've got every assurance from them that they are excited about our vision for the new edition, and we're looking forward to seeing them develop a few 7th Sea products of their own. They've been very generous with their resources, and we're excited to have them on board.\n\nIf we're going to run into any problems after we get funded, we know it's going to be around delays. We've got huge chunks of the corebook already done, but many of our sourcebooks will require us to do additional writing and design.

The aim is to make the most fabulous world you can, before your tower collapses. \nFabulous Beasts is brought to you by an experienced team of game designers, artists and engineers including Alex Fleetwood (Hide&Seek) and George Buckenham (Wild Rumpus, Panoramical).

While stacking bits of firewood and watching pelicans fly by, he had an idea for a game that linked the balance of nature with the balance of objects. \nOnce back in London, Alex called up George, Tim and Lyall - who he'd worked with while making games at Hide&Seek. With the help of Play Sandbox they started working on a prototype with the Engineering department at Bath University. Chris began helping us with hardware, and rapidly became the fifth member of the team. \nWe use technologies like 3D-printing, Arduino, Autodesk Forge and Unity to bring indie creativity to hardware as well as software. We love working together and shaping all the different elements of the game in parallel. \nWe've spent the last year taking the game to festivals, evolving the design, and developing the game. We'll tell you all about it during the campaign.\nWe're lucky to have the backing and support of some fantastic people from the games and hardware industries. But what we're trying to do is something that's rarely been done before. Companies who make games that bridge physical and digital are mostly ginormous multinational corporations. \nWe've got a refined, award-winning prototype and we've built out a manufacturing plan with experienced partners in Hong Kong and China. The fastest way for us to carry out that plan is with your support. \nMost importantly, we want to start a conversation about the future of this game with YOU. We're so excited about being able to keep adding to and improving it and we have a ton of ideas - from different game modes, to extra pieces, to hardware upgrades. With your support, we can make them all happen! \nIn order to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low, we are working with a Hong Kong based logistics partner to pick, pack and ship all rewards to local fulfilment centres in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, and then on to you. EU rewards will therefore be delivered from within the EU. We expect to ship all other rewards direct from Hong Kong.\nShipping prices for the Core Edition / Core Edition Plus / Maker Edition vary as follows from territory to territory:\nUK, US, Canada, Australia: \u00a310 (approx $15 USD / $20 CAD  / $20 AUS ) \nWestern EU* (excl. UK): \u00a315 (approx \u20ac20) \nAll other countries: \u00a325\nOther rewards are charged by weight and volume accordingly.\n*Western EU includes: France, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Greece", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing \n\nA key challenge for our game is the manufacturing process. We are working closely with JDH Sourcing, a Hong-Kong based company who oversee every aspect of the game's production from the electronic components to the packaging. JDH work with partners including Teenage Engineering, PowerUp and Perfect Bake. Our team has visited the factories we will be using to see their processes first hand. We have already adapted the game's physical design and electronic engineering so that it can be produced at scale. \n\nDigital Development\n\nThere's a risk that we might not ship the game with all the advertised features, or ship late. The game is already quite fully featured and has been developed in Unity to minimise costs and problems with porting from the current iOS build to Android. We have a working build on Android devices\n\nWe have budgeted time and resource to develop the features we have planned for the core game and any features added in stretch goals ahead of our proposed shipping date in November 2016. \n\nWe also need to ensure compatibility between our hardware and your device.

And we'll be joined by additional collaborators that we know and trust, like \"Audio Daredevil\" Kenny Young (Tearaway, LittleBigPlanet) and composer Daniel Pemberton (Steve Jobs, The Man from UNCLE, LittleBigPlanet). And hopefully we'll be joined by you as well!\nInspired by games like Earthbound and Secret of Mana and films such as The Goonies, we would like to take these, along with of our favorite childhood memories, and channel it all through our years of experience making games.\nThe key ingredients of Knights and Bikes:\nIn Knights and Bikes, you can play as Nessa and Demelza on their quest for the truth behind the medieval legends of Penfurzy, an island on the fast track to financial ruin and literal destruction. Recruit a party of creatures from all walks of life, enlist and inspire deflated islanders, and embark on an adventure to find the hero the island so desperately needs.\nTeaming up with Demelza's pet goose, and the pickled severed head of a fallen-knight, they fling Frisbees at demons, trick-out their bikes to reach new locations, and increase their abilities with each islander they rescue.\nOk ok, what Demelza said.\nPedal Yourselves into Danger!\nPlay it single-player, or with a friend!\nTo purchase an add on, all you have to do is:\nClick \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d (or click here). \nClick \"Change your pledge\" \nAdd the costs (including shipping) of the add-ons to your pledge amount without changing your tier. \nThat\u2019s it. We'll ask for all the details in the backer survey after the campaign.\nTrailer Super Cut\nSome of our lovely friends and fans helped us put together a new, extra shouty cut of our trailer!\nKnights and Bikes is currently confirmed for PC, Mac, and Linux. It's also coming to Playstation4, and all pledges at, or above, the Digital Game Plus tier are eligible for the PS4 version.\n\nWe will update this section if and when we add more platforms. \nKnights and Bikes takes place on the island of Penfurzy, an island off the coast of Cornwall, where great medieval legends have driven centuries of culture. Inspired by Rex's childhood, it is a place where fact and fiction are inextricably intertwined. \nAs such, the island has a case of multiple identities. On one hand, it is a home for the islanders who live a life full of tradition, history, and pride. But on the other hand, it is a tourist attraction that is expressed almost as self parody through arcades, crazy-golf, and other fleeting diversions.\nOur story takes place in the 80s when the island's most prized relic is proved to be fake, raising questions about Penfurzy's legends. We pick up in the fall of 1987, the end of the island's worst tourist season ever. All the mainlanders have gone home. Well, all except one. \nAs Nessa and Demelza begin their search for the truth behind the island legends, they unleash mysterious spirits that possesses many of the island's inhabitants, human and animal alike. It's up to our heroines to figure out what these spirits want, where or even when they're from, and ultimately how to stop them. \nKnights and Bikes is filled with characters for you to meet (or be) from all walks of life. They each have their own goals, personalities, and abilities. Here are some of the cast:\nNessa is an orphan from the mainland who follows an old keepsake to the island hoping to learn who she really is. As an outsider, she clashes with many of the islanders, but not Demelza, who becomes a fast friend.\nSample Ability: Frisbee-Lob\nDemelza is a video game-obsessed believer in the Penfurzy legends. She comes equipped with a Power Glove in her quest to fight for the honor of her favorite video game hero. She lives in the island's Caravan Park with her father Gryffyn, but dreams of the mainland and all the comic-books and video games that might exist there.\nSample Ability: Puddle-Splash\nCaptain Honkers is Demelza's pet goose. He has an incredible sense of smell and an insatiable appetite for seaweed.\nSample Ability: Peck\nThe Pickled Knight claims to be the great hero of legend, but even if true, spending many years trapped in a briny rockpool has robbed him of his looks (and abilities).\nSample Ability: Ankle Bite\nIslanders come in all shapes and sizes, each trying to support themselves on this remote island--from the volunteer running the mobile library to the bike-shop-owner. But as things start to go wrong on the island it will be up to you to save them from the ancient spirits. And some may have special talents or items that could be helpful to your quest. \nSample Ability: Worrying\nKnights and Bikes is an Co-op Action Adventure Game where players will explore an island on foot and on bikes, find treasure, battle through \"dungeon\" areas, rescue islanders and upgrade their gear in the town hub.\nLocal Co-Op - Play through the entire game alone with AI helpers controlling the other characters in your party or have a friend join you on this mysterious adventure.\nExplore - Jump on your bike and ride through the ominous wilderness areas of the island following the ever trusty beak of Captain Honkers.\nTreasure - Trade collected treasure to acquire new abilities as well as upgrading those you already have by employing the various odd abilities of rescued islanders.\nQuests - Complete the noble requests of the islanders to win their favor by rescuing loved ones, finding ancient relics, and solving puzzling mysteries.\nBattle - Keep an eye on your health as you fight your way through treacherous dungeons using your improvised arsenal. Execute your combat abilities against possessed creatures to free them from their violent spiritual possession.\nThe rewards we're offering are as important to us as the game, so everything is made by us for you, and not farmed-out to third-parties.

We remember a time when games were something that you would play with your mum, dad, brother, or neighbor and together you could join forces and defeat the ultimate baddie.\nWe wanted to capture the feeling of forming a group, being part of something bigger, but also finding out who you are and where you fit into the world. Of course, a game about friendship wouldn't be complete without the ability to play with friends. We hope that we can give our players an experience that brings them together like so many video games anchored some of our best childhood friendships.\nThe theme of the game is inspired by several classic movies of the 80s like Goonies and ET, films that show the adult world from a child's perspective, and the ways in which they try to understand it.  \nAnd the art-style is a mixture of Rex's own natural style, combined with influences from Eyvind Earle, Ronald Searle, Alex Grigg's exceptional \"Phantom Limb\" short film, and the production-design of Paranorman.\nWe've been extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to meet fans of our games in real life. It's an amazing feeling, but when we hear what they loved most about the game, we wish they had been there the entire time.\nKickstarter gives us an opportunity to recruit a group of fans who share our passion for this project. They can cheer us on and keep us moving forward when we are feeling down with misdirected doubt. More importantly, they can let us know if we're losing perspective and veering off track.\nOn such a small team, it's critical to not only get more voices, but the right voices. We're hoping that Kickstarter is a great way to find you all.\nRex Crowle served as the Creative Lead on both Tearaway and Tearaway: Unfolded and was a key artist on the LittleBigPlanet series. He also created the epic productivity app, EpicWin and worked on Black & White, The Movies, and Fable at Lionhead.

He also worked on Moshi Monsters and created the iPad multiplayer game Ring Fling.\nTwitter: @oneofmoo\nKickstarter: Kickstarter Profile\nKnights and Bikes is an idea that we've been thinking about for a while. We have created a few different areas in the game to establish the range and consistency of the art style. We love the way it looks already, but will continue fine tuning it over time.\nOn the gameplay side, we've used these various areas to experiment with three of the core aspects of the game. We have built a conversation system to talk to the islanders, deal with quests, and purchase new gear. We've created a basic dungeon as a testing ground for our many enemy and weapon prototypes. And we've created a sprawling forest to get a feel for the explorational aspects of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a very ambitious project, especially for a team of two, but we definitely feel like we are up to the challenge. We each have over a decade of experience making games and have worked together for many years on a number of projects. Not only do we have experience making games with the backing of a studio, we have also shipped games with smaller teams like EpicWin and Ring Fling.\n\nEven though there are only two of us, we do cover a lot of disciplines, each willing to dive into any task that we think will result in making a better game. In addition, we are being smart about using off the shelf solutions (like Unity, Spine, and Yarn) when possible.\n\nWe also have a great support structure. On the personal side, we have great friends and family who have supported us through difficult projects before. On the development side, we have many friends in other development studios big and small who can give advice and lend a favor when in need. Speaking of which, we have some stretch goals in mind to bring in some specialists to help with certain aspects of the game to make it even better. But we'll talk about that if the time comes.\n\nOverall, we believe that with the combination of our passion for the project, support from our fan base, and help from our friends, we will be able to complete Knights and Bikes to the level of our extremely high standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #66", "update_userinfo": "Collector's Special Edition, Xbox, and Game Pass!", "update_content": "Howdy Backers!\n\nLong time no speak!

Check out our Reviews Page!\nWe've been asked to add a matrix to show which rewards you get for which tiers. Here it is:\n[Click to Expand]\nEra: The Consortium is the story of a Colony Ship launched from Earth and the habitable world it discovers, Taranis. The game follows the inhabitants of Taranis as they create a society, encounter alien races and explore the space nearby.\nThe known history of the Consortium takes a more sinister turn when you look back and realise that it has been manipulated for all of its existence by elite operatives, \"Shades\", that work for Hayden Bank.\nThey have strengthened the grip of the most politically powerful and financially wealthy company in their society through murder, blackmail and theft.\nSupported by Hayden Bank's huge infrastructure, they have had access to technology and weapons that are only dreamed of by other factions.\nThe Resistance responds, creating a corps of \"Phantoms\", specially trained to fight Shades. These operatives track and prevent Shades from completing their missions, providing new hope to the Resistance.\n Era: The Consortium allows the GM and players to choose where to begin playing - at any point during the 500 years of history. You can experience the wonder of discovering new alien races, command a ship in wars spanning entire solar systems, and join a Resistance movement against the government to save or destroy billions of lives.\nWith this expansion, you can play behind the scenes as a Shade or Phantom, invisibly shaping the direction of events like never before!\nWhen coming to the game, you might wonder what you'll be playing within this mass of history. The versatility of this game allows you to participate in many kinds of activities, from high-tech \"dungeon crawls\" to raid corporate facilities, all-out wars in which the existence of your species is threatened, to exploration of new worlds.\nThere is plenty of room for a less-combat-oriented game, also, like corporate or political intrigue, or transhumanism - certain parts of the history are devoted to that, but it's undoubtedly always happening!\nThe Secret War Expansion provides two campaigns focused around the activities of Shades and Phantoms, but Shades can be included almost anywhere in the Consortium's history and Phantoms can be added to any Resistance group in the later stages of the history.\nWant to know what a session sounds like? Check out the \"Dice and Stuff\" podcast of their game as the Resistance's \"Claymore Unit\" - and don't forget your sledgehammer!\nWant to know more about the backstory and setting? Check out the Backstory page on the game's website for loads of stories and history!\nThe Era d10 ruleset is designed to allow you to experience this universe in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible without being misrepresentative. By choosing your skills carefully, your character can dominate in any of 5 forms of combat, talk their way out of any situation or protect their teammates from harm.\nThe rules could be described as \"A Success-counting dice pool system where you roll Attribute + Skill in d10s and the difficulty of the task determines which numbers count as Successes.\"\nIn case that was a bit too brief or jargony, here's a bit more detail:\nThe system is based around multiple dice - the more skilled you are, the more dice you have - and a variable goal based on activity difficulty.\nUsing an Attribute and Skill system, which each define their own areas of influence, you roll your dice depending on what you're attempting - whether Dexterity + Engineering for a precision piece of work, Intelligence + Engineering for a more theoretical problem or Luck + Engineering for a complete long shot, you'll be able to adapt to your circumstances and focus on your strengths.\nAlthough you roll more dice the more skilled you are, the number you are attempting to reach varies depending on the difficulty of the action - if shooting someone in clear conditions, the GM would ask for a 7. If someone was laying a mine, more likely a 6. Firing over your shoulder at someone 30 metres away, while crouching behind a low wall would definitely be a 10!\nIf you want to follow along, you can find a character sheet to download here - sorry, the video didn't come out high quality enough to read the Skill Names!\nThis video shows character creation in Era: The Consortium. I limit this character's power, because I plan to use him in the demonstrations as a guard!\nPLAY\n\nAlex Gyter is a sniper, an expert at taking people down at long range (and a bit of a fan favourite!). Watch him exchange fire with John Smith in this video:\nPLAY\n\nN.B. I had to cut a part of this video to get it down to length - I wasn't able to include the comment that the Defence of the target character is ignored, because of the \"long corridor\" situation.\nThe Grapple Rules in this game are very simple. Styxtirian is an expert Brawler, watch him defeat John Smith in combat in this video:\nPLAY\n\nCombat is not always the solution! Watch Steve Adams attempt to persuade our immortal guard John Smith that he's, in fact, backup:\nPLAY\n\nWant to give the game a try? You can experience the game now through our Playtest Pack. Take the roles of Stiletto Unit as they fight to save the Icaunus system at the climax of the game's story!\nWe're offering you The Secret War Expansion in this Kickstarter, with the possibility for more if we meet Stretch Goals!\nIt's a 26-page book, A4-sized and in full colour with artwork of a similar standard to the Core Rulebook. It does not contain the rules.\nIt's not playable without the Core Rulebook but, as it happens, we're offering that too!\nThis book, 300 pages long, contains everything you need to run hundreds of games of Era: The Consortium: the full story, collected summaries of the information about important factions and places, Character creation and examples, equipment lists with first available dates, the full rule set with examples and GM material including sample sessions.\nWe've just run through a brand new proofreading cycle (after finding a few errata in the original print run!) and these will be new prints with the changes, so the book is better than ever!\nThe 3-Session Campaign that's on offer is a bit of a secret for now. \nLet's just say that you'll have the chance to decide who, of the Shades and Phantoms, will gain the upper hand for the coming years!\nThis (4GB!) Flash Drive will come with whatever reward you choose, but also with extras!\nEd, the creator, will be putting concept art and bonus material of various sorts onto these drives, giving you that little bit of extra insight into the development of Era: The Consortium and the expansion... what's more, he'll be trying to make each one unique!\nThe comics that we have written for Era: The Consortium have been designed to expand the universe further.\nThey are available in some tiers and also as Add-ons, if your preferred tier doesn't include them!\nThe Last Stand of Stiletto Unit\nThe Last Stand of Stiletto Unit is the story of the climax of the Era: The Consortium Core Rulebook.\nA small group of operatives board the largest ship on the Consortium, intending to stop a weapon that will kill 14 billion humans and aliens.\nBut who are these people? Why did they become Stiletto Unit?\nThis comic answers those questions...\nCounting Down From One\nCounting Down From One is the story of a small group of time travellers who return to the start of the Consortium.\nThey have one simple mission - eliminate Benjamin Hayden, the founder of Hayden Bank and one of the most influential men in history.\nBut everything does not always go to plan...\nPlease note that postage may need to be added for some Add-ons, depending on your location.\nNot everything fits cleanly into the Reward tiers, so we also have a few add-ons for you to choose from. To apply an add-on, just increase your pledge by the amount specified and answer the question in the survey at the end of the campaign about which add-on(s) you'd like to have!\nWe want to share all of these with you, but we need to meet our Stretch Goal first to complete the set-up costs for the last two!\nWe have created and helped others to create several games.

Gold and glory await those with the skill to spin their tales in Yarnolth!\nRunning on the same rule set as Era: The Consortium, Era: Lyres is a storytelling game where the party work together to tell a story and the GM plays as the audience.

It's as simple as that.\nWe're working on extending the history through 3 expansions this year, leading up to 450CE. Each will give you a glimpse of what is to come in the future - this isn't the end of the story of the Consortium... this is the beginning!\nThe Secret War (along the other two upcoming expansions) is also a great excuse to get a fantastic team back together again. With John, Amy and Jennifer working with me on the writing, Sofia and Keith on the art, and me working on everything, this expansion feels a little like home.\nAnd you are our house guests! We couldn't have got here without you, I've had so many requests for expansions on this game, I really couldn't say no.\nFunding this Kickstarter, as you might be accustomed to by now for us, is just about getting the books printed and distributed to you. Of course, spreading the word to new players is also a fantastic thing! We've given 110% to this Expansion and we know you'll be able to see that the moment you hold it in your hands (or in your computer, if that's more your thing!).\nI am sure a lot of people wonder what we do with the money we bring in from Kickstarter. As always with us, most of the money goes to printing and shipping out to you all. The goal is so low because we just want to guarantee a minimum print run for Era: The Consortium - The Secret War.\nThe remainder of the money goes towards developing more expansions for Era: The Consortium - we have 3 expansions (including this one) planned for this year, but plenty more ideas if we manage to bring in enough funding! Of course, if we start meeting Stretch Goals, this 35% is used towards those first!\nA few of the writers (who have worked really hard on this project) are paid based on the income from the Kickstarter, thanks to our agreement, so 10% of the money goes to them collectively. I know a least one of them is hoping for a high number!

Set on bringing the AAA console gaming experience to mobile, Implosion received a Metacritic score of 93/100 as well as the coveted \"editor's choice\" on both AppStore and Google Play store. The characters were voiced by lead actors from the Resident Evil, Tekken, and Transformers franchises.\nImplosion: ZERO_DAY, is a full-length feature animation, set twenty years before the events of the mobile game. By combining techniques from East and West, and sub-genres like High-Fantasy, Cyberpunk and Space Opera, this anime is sure to captivate audiences. From seasoned anime veterans to animation newcomers, ZERO_DAY has something to offer everyone. \"A digital odyssey that urges the viewer to reconsider the way we interact as a species, and how we think about our place in the universe.\"\nAll regular matter, the entire Earth, and everything ever observed by humans, adds up to less than 5% of the \u201cknown\u201d universe. Dark matter harbors the face of reality that is invisible to us; but what if the dark universe came out of hiding? In an age when our planet has been pushed beyond the limit of population control, the only viable alternative is to search for a new home. The technology that promised to take us to new stars has brought with it far more than we\u2019ve bargained for. In the year 2179, Earth makes first contact with extra-terrestrial life, as a result of bold, scientific experiments in faster than light travel.\n  (This concept script was designed to give our backers a special sneak peek at characters, and is not a reflection of our final screenplay)\n  Rayark is a relatively small game development studio in Taiwan, with a huge passion for creating comprehensive entertainment experiences. In the past, we have released several successful games: Cytus, Deemo, Mandora, and Implosion, and gained a great deal of support from our fans. We believe now is the time to bring the Implosion universe to life and deliver it to a wider audience.\nThe mobile game was the first step and now the Implosion: ZERO_DAY movie is the next to realising our dream that we would like to share with YOU. We believe in and need the power of the backers here on Kickstarter to support us.\nEven though we have achieved a high number of downloads for the Implosion mobile game, the movie is a unique side of the story that needs to be told. We would like to invite YOU, our backers, to take part in our story as we begin the exciting journey into science-fiction fantasy. \nThe production of a full-length feature animation is a huge task and requires a lot of resources.

First published in 2009, it's now in its second edition. It's a modern, 21st century take on space opera, with realistic yet hyper-advanced science, technology, worlds, star systems, and alien life based on our current scientific understanding and assumptions. It's dedicated to making science-fiction roleplaying action-packed and fun, while staying true to the heart of great SF: the sense of wonder, the losing yourself in the awesomeness of great ideas. \nThe default setting of Mindjammer is the New Commonality of Humankind. It's the far future of our own planet Earth and our own species. Fifteen thousand years in our future, humankind has spread to the stars. First, in great, slower-than-light colonisations taking millennia, seeding alien worlds with human life and cultures, many of which lost contact with their homeworld.\nMeanwhile, back on Old Earth, humankind stagnated in a high-population, benevolent, yet overly controlling utopia. Our species seemed about to fail.\nThen, two hundred years ago, the secret of faster-than-light travel was mysteriously discovered. With the invention of planing, humankind was rejuvenated, imbued with a new, confident, optimism, and travelled forth to the stars to rediscover and recontact the many thousands of lost colony worlds.\nNot all these worlds welcomed rediscovery. Some had diverged beyond imagining, into different species; some were inhabited by unfathomable alien intelligences; others contained hostile cultures which viewed the New Commonality as invaders. \nThat's the world you live in today. A world of conflict, yet optimism; of newness, yet great antiquity; of hyper-advanced technology, and lost colonies fallen into savagery. Of great danger, and great wonder. The Second Age of Space.\nHumankind has transformed utterly. Many things are the same, yet now every Commonality citizen is linked by neural implant to the Mindscape, a vast interstellar shared consciousness and data storage medium. You can converse with your thoughts; control machines, weapons, even whole starships, with the power of your mind. You can upload your memories, and download (and \"remember\"!) the memories of other people - even dead people. And there are artificial beings, with personalities based on the memories of long-dead starfighter pilots and war heroes. Even sentient starships like the near-legendary Mindjammers, which travel the spacelanes updating the Mindscape in every star system they visit. Ships you can play as characters...\nIt's a vast and astonishing cosmos. What will you find there? \nThe Mindjammer game currently comprises two published game books and a published novel; this Kickstarter aims to unlock a whole lot more. Here's what those books contain:\nThe Mindjammer Core Book\nA 496-page hardcover rulebook containing the full Fate Core rules system customised for the Mindjammer setting and dense setting detail. Includes:\nCharacter genotypes, cultures, and occupations.\nEquipment and enhancements.\nRules for starships and megaconstructs, including stats and deckplans.\nRules for organisations and corporacies, including the instrumentalities of the New Commonality of Humankind.\nRules for cultures and culture conflict. Become a culture agent! Fight memetic combats to protect the Commonality from lethal memes!\nRules for star systems and planets, based on current planetary science and cosmology.\nRules for alien life, including truly alien exofauna, ecosystems, and exointelligences.\nGuidelines for playing Mindjammer in many different SF genres, from exploration to military SF, tramp freighter to culture agent, political thriller to virtual realities.\n A whole octant of Commonality Space, with starmaps, planetary maps, and descriptions.\nYou can download a free 40+ page preview of the Mindjammer core book from DriveThruRPG here.\nHearts and Minds\nHearts and Minds is our first published Mindjammer scenario, an action-packed adventure of intrigue, unrest, and possible civil war on the rediscovered world of Olkennedy. Includes:\nDescriptions of an entire alien world: a lost colony in a vast life-supporting crater on an otherwise barren world in a binary red dwarf system.\nA rediscovered world culture on the brink of civil war, based on \"Old Canada\" colonists from a millennia-old stasis slowboat and genurgically uplifted pithecine xenomorphs.\nAn exciting four episode multi-session adventure spanning the whole world - play it as military SF, culture ops, political thriller, science investigation, or more!   \nThe City People\nThe City People is our brand new second Mindjammer scenario which we're aiming to publish as part of this Kickstarter. It's a mystery and exploration adventure of lethal dangers beyond the Commonality Frontier. Includes:\nDescription of a complete alien world and star system, ripe for space exploration. Realistic science and action-packed adventure.\nDetails of the Space Force instrumentality, including branches, organisation, the Fringe World Pilot Programme, and the Event Horizon Probes.\nDescriptions, deckplans, and artwork portraying the stage 2 explorer starship Magnanimous Intervention. Join its crew - or even play the ship as a character!\nAn exciting four episode multi-session exploration and mystery adventure. Push back the frontiers of human knowledge! \nThe Mindjammer Novel\nPublished in 2012, the novel Mindjammer tells the story of Thaddeus Clay, controller from the Security and Cultural Integrity Instrumentality (SCI Force), and his team of culture agents as they encounter the Transmigration Heresy on the rediscovered worlds of the Solenine Cluster--and uncover a conspiracy which might threaten the very Commonality itself! 444 pages. A bonus ebook of the novel is bundled with every pledge of \u00a35 or more.\nSongs of Old Earth short story collection\nYou asked us for more fiction - here it is! Songs of Old Earth is a collection of original short stories detailing the complex and tragic history of the Commonality and the Venu - its greatest foe and its greatest mistake. Just how did things go so badly wrong? The answer, like so many political tragedies, lies in the deepest past. You can read the first story in this collection, THIS OCEAN NIGHT, here. We've now unlocked this whole novel-length collection of short fiction, which will be delivered to all backers in PDF, epub, and mobi formats.\nThe Mindjammer Player's Guide\nOur first big stretch goal - a 160-page book of everything a Mindjammer player needs.

Includes histories and cultures, regions and starmaps, world descriptions and deep guides for creating Core Worlds characters - as well as secrets and mysteries never before revealed... \nThe Far Havens\n\u201cBeyond the constructed hive mind of the assimilating Commonality, far from the cold reach of their synthetic autarchs, lies freedom, our home in the Far Havens. Long may the Protectorate stand fast against the threats of Commodus, the messenger sent by the Commonality to awe us into obedience. Fractured we may seem, but when needed we are united, despite the vastness of space between us.\n\"My family are of the revered Wayfarers Guild, with Voyager eugenics strong in our lineage. I do not hold to the Utopian rapture, for I have flown a Stargull across the Dragonfly Ruins on Balar and believe that all our fates are to be found there.\n\"I am Jenitha, of the Artalla dynasty, and I will celebrate my third century by dancing through the flower fields on Astra Gardens. Come, dance with me and taste true freedom.\u201d\nBy Paul Mitchener (Age of Arthur, Blood of the Gods, Crucible of the Dragons) and Graham Spearing (Wordplay, Age of Arthur, OpenQuest), THE FAR HAVENS is an 80-page supplement detailing a polity beyond the Commonality Fringe, above the Galactic Plane, fiercely resisting Commonality integration and the machinations of the Commodus sentience and the rise of ancient dangers... \nJoin the Licensed Free Agents and New Traders exploring this perilous frontier!\nThe Hypertech Sourcebook\nThe hyperadvanced technology of the New Commonality of Humankind is not distributed evenly throughout Commonality Space. In the Core Worlds the cutting edge technologies of T10 3-space travel and relativity beams holds sway, while on the Fringe rediscovered worlds of T6 and T7 still struggle when faced with faster-than-light travel and ubiquitous Mindscape. The HYPERTECH SOURCEBOOK discusses the many technological paradigms which prevail throughout Commonality Space, and presents a rich array of equipment and items for your Mindjammer characters to acquire and employ.\nThe Fringe Worlds Sourcebook\nHave you ever wanted to travel through the starlanes of the Foliate Hierarchy? Visit Jesedipere? Try to fathom the mysterious temporal signals emanating from the Mardisti Anomaly? Then look no further - this 80-page full colour PDF details the history, cultures, and peoples of the vast belt of worlds separating the Core Worlds from the Commonality Frontier, bringing you starmaps, culture descriptions, brand new hominids, xenomorphs, and truly strange alien species from the far-flung reaches of Commonality Space. Out where cultural conflict crackles constantly, and the pulse dragon phenomenon lies in wait for hapless planeships adrift in the interstellar medium, are the Fringe Worlds...\nWhat's Next?\nWe've got so much planned! We listened to you when you answered our recent Mindjammer survey, telling us what you'd like to see next in the Mindjammer line.

It's an intuitive system with a simple core mechanic which unpacks into deep sophistication with long-term play potential. One of its key concepts is the Fate Fractal, which allows any entity to be statted as if it was a character, and it's this which we harness in the Mindjammer RPG to make our far future transhuman science-fiction setting sing. In Mindjammer, starships can be characters; you can have stat blocks for organisations, corporacies, and even whole cultures. This sophisticated yet flexible mechanic means that your Mindjammer games can revolve around the cultural conflicts between entire star systems and star cultures; individuals (\"culture agents\") engaging in memetic combat and memetic engineering to manipulate cultures; characters taking on organisations; starships exploring new worlds and advancing their skills and exploring their personalities; and even characters \"going post\" and transcending the limitations of human existence.\nAt its heart the Fate Core system is simple: you roll dice, add a skill level, and compare it to a difficulty number. Any excess determines the magnitude of your success. Stunts enable you to break those rules.\nWhere Fate gets cool is in its Aspects mechanic. An aspect is a simple phrase saying something about a character (or \"character entity\", or even a location). Example aspects are: Glutton For Punishment, Innocent Farmboy Spacer, Bull in a China Shop, Dammit I'm a Doctor Not a [INSERT EPITHET HERE], and many more. When you, as a player, think that one of your aspects (you usually have just a handful) applies to a situation, you can spend a \"fate point\" to \"invoke\" it, and get a bonus on your skill roll, or re-roll the dice. You have to describe how your aspect helps you, but otherwise that's it.\nYou only have a few fate points. However, if one of your aspects might complicate your situation (like that Bull in a China Shop we mentioned...), you can choose to \"compel\" that aspect, describe how it gets you into trouble, and earn one of those fate points back. \nIt's as simple as that; the to-and-fro of spending and regaining fate points is sometimes called the \"fate point economy\", but it's a simple yet sophisticated mechanic for really making your character come alive in play.\nMindjammer - The Roleplaying Game contains the full Fate Core rules in the core book; you need nothing else to play.\nMindjammer Press was set up by award-winning RPG author Sarah Newton (Mindjammer, Achtung! Cthulhu, Legends of Anglerre, Fate Worlds: Burn Shift, The Chronicles of Future Earth, Monsters & Magic, and more) and Chris McWilliam in 2012, to publish original roleplaying games and fiction. We have a track record for high quality, well-written, well-edited work, innovative, deep, and playable settings, and a detailed knowledge of rules system. Sarah is the core of the Mindjammer team, with an open 3-space Mindscape conduit direct to the New Commonality of Humankind, and is product manager and lead developer for the Mindjammer line.\nJason Juta (Mindjammer, Shadowrun, Gamma World, Warhammer 40K, Battletech, Song of Ice and Fire, and much more) is the artistic director of the Mindjammer kickstarter, with a powerful vision of the New Commonality which he's been revealing to us in previous Mindjammer books, the current Kickstarter, in through into the future with breathtaking and inspiring visualisations. \nJohn Snead (Exalted, Eclipse Phase, Dying Earth, Blue Planet, Mage, and much more) is our resident gear-head and imagineer of the New Commonality, a lover of deep setting realism and an advocate for the Traveller rules system. He's our lead developer on the Mindjammer Traveller conversion.\nDavid Donachie (Solipsist, Legends of Anglerre, The Collective Endeavour) is currently deep behind enemy lines in Venu territory, documenting the Commonality's nefarious foe and fathoming the mysteries of the Dark Radiance.\nPaul Mitchener (Age of Arthur, Blood of the Gods, Crucible of the Dragons) is adventuring in the Fringe Worlds, exploring ancient ruins and investigating sensor anomalies. He loves both a sense of adventure and heart in his RPGs. He believes cats regard him as a minor deity.\nGraham Spearing (Wordplay, Age of Arthur, OpenQuest) is a hybrid Pict/Cockney veteran table top roleplayer. Never fully recovering from a heavy dose of FGU in the Eighties, Graham organises frivolous game conventions in the Peoples' Republic of Sheffield. In his less than spare time he self publishes the Wordplay RPG and brain melds with Paul Mitchener, to create memorable roleplaying experiences. And no, you can't have too many dice.\nMichal Cross (Mindjammer, Monsters & Magic, Achtung! Cthulhu)  is our layout and graphic design expert, responsible for the slick professional look and feel of our Mindjammer products. \nIan Stead (Mindjammer, Traveller) is the lead technical design on Mindjammer shipbuilding. Whether it's deckplans, ship schematics, or 3d imagery, Ian travels the Commonality and the Fringe Worlds documenting our voyages between the stars.\nAndy Wintrip (Mindjammer, Cimmerian Space) is our \"in the field\" imagineer of the Mindjammer universe, creating stunning colour artworks of strange worlds, alien landscapes, and uncanny beings. His action pieces convey the excitement and peril at the frontiers of human experience in the Second Age of Space.\nChris Birch (Starblazer Adventures, Achtung! Cthulhu, Mutant Chronicles, Infinity, Thunderbirds) is our mentor and guru of all things Kickstarter and publishing. Co-founder and director of Modiphius Entertainment, Chris has worked with Sarah for 7 years on a number of RPG projects, and is the powerhouse behind a number of industry-leading Kickstarter campaigns. \nTogether we're the MINDJAMMER team. We hope you'll join us as we explore the fascinating worlds of the far future...

We're a team of dedicated RPG professionals with a background in project management, and are proud to be distribution partners with Modiphius Entertainment and Wayland Games, two companies with extensive experience in the Kickstarter field and who are giving us the benefit of their experience in close and regular consultation. We've planned and budgeted this Kickstarter carefully to ensure we can make our targets and fulfill your pledges.\n\nWe've also structured our goals to be able to deliver rapidly and reliably. THE CITY PEOPLE is already written and laid out, and is now in proofing; it'll be ready to go as soon as the Kickstarter completes. We have our three subsequent stretch goals in the advanced stages of writing, and the thousands of words of Sarah's Mindjammer setting writings to mine and expand for subsequent supplements. \n\nWe've also structured ourselves to be able to meet the challenges of an expanded product pipeline which we hope you'll provide us with in this Kickstarter. With three writers, multiple artists, an art director, a layout director, and a production manager, we're a dedicated team very excited about what we hope this Kickstarter will permit us to do.\n\nNaturally we're all also human (well, we think Sarah might be a cyborg sentience, and David may have already spent too much time among the Venu...), and we acknowledge that real life happens and that we're a small, family-run business. But we're all also committed to openness and regular updates and communication, and will keep you informed as to how the projects are going and when you can expect to receive your pledges.

Go to www.secrethitler.com for the most up-to-date information. There you can also read the full rules and download the game to print-and-play for yourself right now!\nSecret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\nSecret Hitler is designed by Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity, Humans vs. Zombies) Mike Boxleiter (Solipskier, TouchTone), Tommy Maranges (Philosophy Bro) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Letter Tycoon, Penny Press).\nIn Secret Hitler, each player is randomly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists know in advance who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is. Since the liberal team always has a majority, the fascists must play like moles, gaining the trust of the liberals to sabotage their plans and make them suspicious of each other.\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass 5 liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass 6 fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after 3 fascist policies have passed.\nEach round, the President selects a Chancellor. The whole table votes \"Ja!\" or \"Nein!\" on their ticket; if a majority of players vote \u201cJa!,\u201d the elected President and Chancellor take the following actions to pass a new policy:\nThe President draws 3 policies from a random deck.\nThe President discards 1 policy and passes 2 to the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor discards 1 policy and enacts the final one as law.\nIf a fascist policy passes, the President gains a new power that she must use immediately. These include:\nIf Hitler is executed, the game ends immediately in a Liberal Victory.\nSecret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre.\nThe first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u2019s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team.\nThe second new mechanic is the \u201cHitler\u201d identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u2019 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\nSecret Hitler is a love letter to hidden identity games like Werewolf/Mafia, The Resistance, and Avalon, but it's also a new design that fixes some of our biggest problems with those games.\nNo moderator: Secret Hitler doesn't require a moderator - everyone can join in the game.\nNo early player elimination: We love the suspense of player elimination, but Secret Hitler saves that drama for the very end\u2014assassinated players will rarely have to wait more than ten minutes before the game ends.\nIn games like Werewolf, you can only act on your gut feeling. Secret Hitler creates a much more heady experience - there's almost enough information that you can solve the game like a puzzle, but not quite enough. Players always have enough information to make meaningful choices, but we've simplified the decisions to avoid analysis paralysis; each round the President nominates a Chancellor, and the table votes yes or no to that ticket.\nSecret Hitler is enormously replayable because the ways the presidential powers are used and the table position of the players is never the same twice. We've played hundreds of rounds of Secret Hitler, and the metagame is still evolving in very exciting ways.\nWhy is Secret Hitler set in 1933 Germany? We believe that the theme and setting of a game work best when they help explain the story and mechanics.\nHitler\u2019s takeover was, for a dictator, surprisingly political: he wasn\u2019t a general who subverted a popular revolution, he wasn\u2019t backed by foreign interests, there wasn\u2019t a total collapse of government he took advantage of. He used the rickety systems of the Weimar Republic to gain power mostly legally; he was handed the Chancellorship by men who thought they could \"control\" him.\nHitler and his allies spent years manipulating the levers of democracy, accumulating power in a snowball effect. He divided and intimidated his rivals. He used national crises to strengthen his own position. His followers were organized and brutal, and his rise was equally engineered and opportunistic. There were good men who didn't understand how dangerous he was until it was too late, and there were bad men who wanted power for themselves but were outmaneuvered.\nSocial Deduction games are about a well-coordinated minority trying to convince a confused majority to vote against its interests. It's an inherently political genre.\nWe set out to make a game to help us reflect on the ways that others - good, bad, indifferent - were complicit in Hitler's rise to power. Our game doesn't model the specifics of German parliamentary politics. Instead, we try to model the paranoia and distrust he exploited, the opportunism that his rivals failed to account for, and the disastrous temptation to solve systemic problems by giving more power to the \"right people.\"\nSecret Hitler has a unique capacity to create intense, memorable play sessions. Frankly, none of us had ever playtested a game that gets this kind of a reaction before.\nAt Gen Con in 2015, we were shocked to see demo sets of Secret Hitler sweep through an industry party full of game designers. By the end of the night, every single table was playing, with people jumping out of their seats to shout and and cheer at the end of each game.\nWe played Secret Hitler at San Diego Comic Con 2015 with Richard Stevens (creator of Diesel Sweeties) who monitored his heart rate on a Apple watch throughout the game. By the end, he was registering 121 BPM - that's on the high end of what an astronaut will experience during a shuttle launch.\nRichard Stevens' heart rate during a game of Secret Hitler\nHere's what some of our playtesters had to say about the game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'd been playtesting Secret Hitler for nearly a year when we launched this Kickstarter, and we're so excited to get it into your hands.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience manufacturing and shipping games.

You\u2019ll need to make use not only of your own hyper-competence but also that of your teammates by way of shared mental and emotional consciousness: the Headspace. Using this technology, you can connect to your teammates' minds and use their skills as though they were your own. There's a catch though: Everyone's got emotional baggage and digging too deeply can pull a teammates emotions into your own actions. The Headspace is the edge you need to stand against the corruption of the world, are you and your fellow operatives ready to take up the challenge and make the world a better place?\nHeadspace is a role playing game that explores human emotion, memory, and personal identity. The world of Headspace is a dark future where technology has begun to alter not just our bodies, but how we feel and even think. In this future, an advanced neural networking technology, Headspace, has been developed. The Headspace allows a group of wielders to connect their minds directly to each other. But, jacking into the Headspace comes with a cost; there is no going back. Once your minds are bound together, every thought, sensation, emotion, and even dreams are shared over any distance instantaneously.\n*Back the game, and get access to a 60 page quickstart from our first update, and give the game a try!*\nIn the world of Headspace, world governments struggle to maintain law and order. Most have all but ceded their authority to gigantic Corporations that now fight for control of Earth\u2019s remaining resources. In this future, few stand against the tide of corporate corruption and greed. Fewer still have the assets and abilities to make a difference. You could be that difference. You and your friends could be the ones to stand against the Corporations and make a better world for those left on the margins of society. To do it, you\u2019ll not only need the latest weapons and cyber technologies, but also the drive to work together, seamlessly sharing your skills and abilities, operating not as a group of individuals but as a perfect team, within the Headspace.\nThe rules for Headspace are based on the award-winning Powered by the Apocalypse system developed by Vincent Baker and used in games like Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, Urban Shadows and The Sprawl.\nThe Headspace gives all of the Operators a shared neurological space inside which only members of their Cell are granted access. They can speak telepathically across any distance with any other Operator from their Cell (those who share the same network via a linked Headspace implant). This means all Operators can maintain conversations in all scenes whether they are all physically present or not. Everything that happens at the table is known by all Players and at all times. But it's so much more than that.\nThe implants didn't just network you together to speak at the speed of thought, mind to mind. It's allowed you to borrow the skills of the people who make up your Cell. It doesn't matter that you've never fired a gun or defused a bomb, as long as one of them has. You can reach out and access their skills, finely honed to razor sharp precision. When your mind connects to theirs to share skills, they can feel you. Every person in a Headspace finds they are now greater than themselves, because at any time they can reach out and assume the skills of their Cell. At peak performance, a Cell is like having a multiplicity of everyone in it. The Corporations were scared of any one of you. But now there's potential for five of you to exist. You can communicate in instantaneous real time, and you are never truly alone, even in the most desperate of situations. You can share your senses, and this technology-fueled telepathy may be what helps you save your city. Maybe it\u2019ll even help you save yourself.\nBut it comes at a price.\nYour connection to the Headspace has no off switch. Cell mates' dreams, nightmares, thoughts, memories, and emotions are all connected to the network. Privacy as you knew it isn't possible, and the emotional selves of the people you work with can bleed into your own. If one of you snaps under pressure, the stress careens through the system like a wild virus, unpredictably interacting with bodies and minds. It can be difficult to see where your emotions end and the others\u2019 begin. This constant risk of emotional bleed can make intimate relationships that much harder to navigate, whether they\u2019re with someone from your Headspace, or outside it.\nEven death won't stop your connection to the rest of your Cell. Ghosts can accumulate in a Headspace. When an Operator dies, fragments of their consciousness will cling to the network. Their dying thoughts and feelings, wishes for redemption or vengeance, even the skills they used alongside you, can all appear in the Headspace. Before you did this, mourning someone was easier. Now even your dead don't know how to stay that way. When you go to sleep, their nightmares may become your own.\nHuman emotion is at the root of all Operator actions in Headspace. The rules rely heavily on the emotions experienced by the Operators over the course of play. Emotions are categorized into five core types: Rage, Grief, Fear, Need, and Ego.\nThese five emotions are referenced in play by an Operator\u2019s Baggage, Discipline, and Stress.\nEmotional Baggage represents the past of an individual\u2019s experiences and memories of a particular skill and their link to another Operator. During Operator creation, Players will connect a leading question of how they used their skill in the past to one of the other Operators in the Cell; the emotion that best represents how their Operator felt during those past events is assigned as its Baggage.\nDiscipline represents an Operator\u2019s present state of mind and measures their ability to control each of their emotions and prevent the Baggage of a skill from overwhelming their decision-making and influencing their actions.\nStress represents an immediate and dangerous accumulation of raw emotions within the Headspace. The GM tracks Stress during play with five common pools, one for each emotional type.\nCharacters in Headspace are called Operators. Operator creation in Headspace ties the team together by detailing your relationships to each other and your experience with your skills. All Operators have a dark regret tied to the Corporations of the setting you play in that drives you to change the world to become a better place.\nTHE HANDLER\nNo one else would deal with this shit. Even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t actually do the job right. Managing talent and orchestrating the use of corporate or military assets is hard, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s your job. Some people are content with pulling the puppet strings of the world from behind a desk. But that\u2019s not your style.. It\u2019s easier to convince people to sell out, convert an enemy to a friend, or arrange for ass-covering contingencies when you\u2019re not chained to a desk. You\u2019re going to make your old corporate masters pay for everything they\u2019ve done, because you\u2019re the best person to make sure it happens.\nTHE INFILTRATOR\nYour family used to complain that you snuck up on them when you were a kid. You didn\u2019t even mean to, it just kept happening. That natural ability for stealth has served you well. Sneaking past people without even trying made you wonder who you could sneak past if you actually applied yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter who picked you up--or caught you--because you\u2019re long past those days. The rookie either dies, or becomes a highly paid professional. Since you\u2019re not dead, you\u2019re making pretty good money. Or you were, until you bugged out of the system to try and destroy it.\nTHE RONIN\nYou had a different team, once. You came up through the ranks, from soldier to commander. Despite the ugly things you did, your brothers and sisters in arms were your family. You protected each other. Struggling to do your job without losing your soul, you still suffered as bit by bit, assignments grew more dangerous, people died, and the truth of things reached you. Instead of going the way of your friends, you walked away, burning bridges behind you. The company made you a superior tactician, a fighter, a weapon. They\u2019re going to regret letting you leave alive. Not that they had a choice.\nTHE RUNNER\nSome people get confused if they take the wrong turn or walk a block too far. Not you. Whether driving or on foot, your memory of places and understanding of the urban landscape are as automatic as breathing. The city is as familiar as your own body. You know the rhythms of traffic and neighbourhoods. You can plan routes throughout your day that effortlessly shake tails and get you to your end location with time to spare. Being late is not a problem you suffer from. You're never late, because you'd never fail your Cell.\nTHE TECH\nIt\u2019s not that you don\u2019t understand people. You just understand them in a way that freaks them out. Through the lens of technology, you know how to take people out with remote weapons in the most efficient way possible. The security slip-ups of bad passwords and ill-advised cloud storage are second nature to you. Empathy is hard for you, because all you see are the horrific secrets they try and protect, and the violence they commit to keep them buried. People like you are essential to a Corporation\u2019s ability to function because you can engineer anything they need. Now you\u2019re going to engineer the ways to take them down.\nTHE WHITECOAT\nThe science of the human mind and body is the most fascinating field there is, and your diagnostic skills help you understand the very world around you. Few people can match you as a field medic, and the things you can do when given access to a lab would terrify anyone in their right mind. Which is a good reason not to work for people like that. Like a determined hound when you\u2019re on a case, your intellect is unstoppable . You\u2019re going to lance the corruption in the world around you before it spreads.\nEach game of Headspace uses a Setting to tell its story, a distinct region or city of the world to explore, each with its own unique story to tell. Settings serve as the basis for tying the fiction of the Operators to the fiction of the world by connecting the stories of their skills with the specific events and issues that have shaped the setting.\nA setting provides everything a GM needs to tell a story. It fills out the fiction of its region of the world and provides 4 ready-made Corporations each with its own Corporate Agent (NPC) and an initial story hook in the form of a Corporate Project.\nSettings in Headspace are each treated as mutually exclusive from one another and don\u2019t interact with each other. You are making your own version of Earth. Each setting has a different set of 5 Events, 5 Issues, and 5 Corporate Secrets that have changed the world into the dystopian future it is.\nThere are two settings built into the core game with more to follow as stretch goals:\nVancouver Aftermath\nby Lillian Cohen-Moore and Mark Richardson\nVancouver 2074\nA massive tsunami rocks the American Pacific Coast, 6 months later the city of Vancouver is on the edge of collapse. Vancouver continues to be plagued with earthquakes and flooding, continually setting back operations to recover the most shattered parts of the city. Vancouver's least affected areas were quietly taken over by corporations, who pled that \"re-stabilising business will help the economy recover sooner.\" The people they forced into Devastation Zones and Quarantine areas have a vastly different perspective. Vancouver's barely contained mayhem, choked in corporate corruption and government failure. If something isn\u2019t done, things will only get worse.\nDay Zero in the Promised Land\nby Shoshanna Kessock\nIsrael 2076\nIt began with the devastating water shortage in 2066. NGOs and allied countries brought in what aid they could, but it was never enough. Many people lost their lives in the ensuing years. Everyone believed that the country would annihilate itself. All that changed in 2069. A group of scientists from around the world, along with the greatest Israeli and Palestinian thinkers from across the country, had come together to build a water reclamation centre.It was hailed worldwide as a miracle breakthrough, just in time to save the ravaged country from self-annihilation. That made the tragedy all the worse when the plant exploded in an act of terror that destroyed any chance of providing water to the country.\nThe loss of the water reclamation plant was devastating. The entire country lost hope in salvation and destabilised as the world watched on the news. In the end, the United Nations was invited to step in before the country collapsed and its people died of thirst. United Nations troops took control of the region under a provisional government in January 1, 2070. The idea was to shore up the country and then give it back to its own people. To ensure that remained the plan, the charter for the provisional government had a time limit: within seven years they must stabilise the region or leave. That was six years, eleven months ago, give or take a week.\n\u201cRunning Headspace is a breeze because by the time you hit the game you have a really strong goal as a group AND emotional connections to both your fellow players AND big bads in the world.\u201d\n-Senda (She's a Super Geek Podcast)\n#RPGnet Q&A Chat Session\nA 2 hour Q&A session with members of the RPGnet community.

Even in the freest of places, the wide, white north of Canada. However, there are a few who cling to the last vestiges of freedom and individuality. These men and women risk their lives by performing missions on behalf of a counterculture that won\u2019t be ruled by corporate influence. Their one advantage is the Headspace, a mental link that binds them into a single entity. \u2026the irony is pretty lost on this particular group\nFor a more comedic take on Headspace, check out their actual play two-parter:\nOne Shot Podcast Actual Play Part 1\nOne Shot Podcast Actual Play Part 2\nTabletop Torch\nEpisode #26 features Mark Richardson, the designer behind a new game called Headspace. Headspace uses a modified version of Apocalypse World and features some great new, innovative mechanics. This episode has a lot of talk about mechanics, game design, and advice on writing adventures and worlds!\nTabletop Torch Podcast\nWe have loads of amazing stretch goals (every $2,600 CAD after funding) lined up for Headspace with some top RPG talent to help us write and publish dystopic future settings for use in your Headspace games. Each setting will feature a full-page colour map designed by Mark Richardson that provides a detailed background, a geography, and 4 unique Corporations. Everything you need to set your game in this vision of the future!\nFUNDED! - Neo-Tokyo Pleasure Dome Ultra 2070 by Adam Koebel\nNeo-Tokyo 2085\nA Japanese cyberpunk future, living and breathing the technological dream of the 90s - where Japan never suffered the economic crisis that broke its stride and now, cut off from the muck and blood of a post-war world, glitters on the horizon like a weird jewel. It\u2019s Xanadu, it\u2019s Shambhala, it\u2019s Vegas, baby.\nInside the Neo-Tokyo Empire, corporations battle to provide the next new thing - a high pumped straight into your cortex. A sex-bot with skills tuned in from a million virtual beta-testers. Some new drug, some new song, some beautiful new mutilation not yet imagined. In meat-space, darker trades take place - the Tonarigumi, those cut off from the excesses of Cyberzone, patrol the cold streets to keep order among the junkies, burn-outs, and tourists. They say the next new thing will be the one that leads to enlightenment, breaks the barrier codes of Cyberzone, and starts the next step in human evolution. What\u2019s your poison? First one's on the house.\nFUNDED! - Paraiso Amazonia by Encho Chagas\nSouth America 2070\nWhile the world hungers, a few can enjoy the remaining natural resources of South America in the Paraiso Amazonia resort. After the sea level rose and sank most of the beaches around the world, what is left of the Amazon forest and its surroundings have been transformed into a huge leisure venture. Wild rain forests, great beaches, and air-conditioned environments, all equipped with the best technology and comfort money can buy. The greatest and last peaceful tourism destination in the world.\nBut while corporations try to keep control over their properties, at the expense of forgotten and cumulative population in slums around the enterprise, a few try to disclose the truth behind their doings. Misdemeanor advertising, raids, sabotage. Everything goes to fight the unrivaled power of the corporations.\nFUNDED! - 100% Pure by Hamish Cameron\nNew Zealand 2070\nThey used to say you\u2019re always prepared for the last disaster. That\u2019s bullshit. When Christchurch got flattened in \u201811, quakes were on everyone\u2019s mind, but the idea of disaster preparation vanished faster than the Civil Defense budget to feed the offshore accounts of the smiling corporate assassins. Short term profit ruled: buy low, sell the guts, discard the carcass.\nSo when the Alpine cracked in \u201850 and set off just about every fault in the Shaky Isles, no one was ready. The tidal waves and liquefaction sunk the Hutt and half of Wellington and slid most of the rest into the harbour. After sixty years of corporate globalisation, the government could do nothing but relocate to Auckland and sell what little of the country they still owned. A spreading halo of industrial wasteland encloses Auckland. Everyone with money and contacts fled to Nelson and the Coromandel. The corps took everything flat and green for their agri-factories and everything near the harbours for industrial sprawl and slum housing. Freedom lives in the bush with the cluster bombs and chemical agents, or in the cracks of the cities with the gangs and the ghosts and the Net. 100% Pure? Yeah, right.\nFUNDED! - Hieroglyph of the Whale by Emily Care Boss\n2087, Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, Soleri Arcology, Beryl Zone\nThe mineral rush of the 50s meant boom-times for the Solerans. They crafted a spiralling city of terminal resilience and ultralux. But all that changed when their newly uplifted Tursiops and Megaptera laborers rose up. Thirty three years have gone by since the day the Bottlenecks pierced the nape and the Humpbacks crushed Corporate. After decades of silence a signal has emerged from Beryl Zone. Survivors call for a rescue and promise untapped riches in newly explored suboceanus troughs. Your team goes below to find the survivors, assess their claims and also investigate the possibility of reclaiming Soleri Arcology. At least, those are the questions you begin the adventure with...\nFUNDED! - Carteles Unidos by Jesse Scoble\nThe US/Mexico Border 2060\nThe most frequently crossed border in the world - the US/Mexico border - is all hostile territory. The twinning border towns, San Diego/Tijuana, El Paso/Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and Brownsville/Matamoros, all vie for the title of \"murder capital of North America.\" From the pernicious desert that straddles the militarized \"Great Wall,\" to the bloody back-alleys of the border towns, the Narco Cartels have extended their grip and terror throughout the southwest. Narco-corridos are sung praising the sly rogues and brutal killers of the cartels, while cursing and damning the drones and armored personnel carriers and black helicopters of the Border Patrol. Caught between those two implacable forces are those trying to eke out a living, from the destitute who rummage and dwell in los dompes, to the cunning coyotes smuggling weary bands across the line, to the desperate citizens trying to take back the night.\n$20,800 CAD - New Motor City by Kira Magrann\nDetroit, 2065\nThe architectural carcasses of old rust belt Detroit still haunt these neon streets; art deco theatres and car manufacturing plants preserved in spectacular ruin amidst fields of urban wasteland. Not far from these relics are the shiny new skyscrapers and lush urban farms that mark the revival of Detroit\u2019s industrial landscape. New Motor City industry is a temple built to speed: fast cars, fast music, fast fame. It\u2019s always been about transportation here, and corporations thrive on electric hybrids, vehicle mod trends, and the bio fueled superhighways that support the New Mobility. Detroit Techno has made a comeback in the form of massive local Street Burns that draw latex and dayglo clad ravers who race for pink slips. New media creates and destroys reality stars in a matter of days and tech start-ups with questionable morals support this culture. The urban farmland provides ultra-local paleo-genetic veggies and fish bioengineered to mimic natural foods inaccessible to all but the super-rich. There\u2019s a distinct disparity between the downtown biotech revival and the shamefully neglected neighborhood sprawl. Beneath the success of the new tech and a renaissance of culture, race and class tensions are still prevalent, and the people grow restless.\n$23,400 CAD \u2013 A Bloody Thaw by Will Hindmarch\nThe Arctic Ocean, 2044\nHow quickly can a city grow up? How fast can it fall down? Ice-melt in the Arctic Circle has created new pathways for commerce, revealed new resources to fight for, built up new fortunes, and made new magnates rich. The thawing coastlines opened turf and gave traction for new frontier ports, some of them hiding submersible smugglers and all of them teeming with black-market dealers looking to siphon their share from the planet\u2019s last big oil boom. But as swiftly as they rose, these cities are coming apart. Even with half the ice, it\u2019s cold on top of the world \u2014 and a storm is surely coming.\nAnd many more!\nWe\u2019ve got a bunch of great rewards for you: everything from softcover and hardcover books to stress track playmats with tokens and dice.

No additional shipping.\nThe shared consciousness touchstone for my game is John Wyndham\u2019s The Chrysallids, and I would credit Neuromancer, Blade Runner, and Akira (Manga) as major influences on my love for Cyberpunk. I wasn\u2019t a Shadowrun kid growing up, but instead got my RPG punk from Cyberpunk 2020 and CyberGeneration by R. Talsorian Games.\nDesign-wise my biggest influence is the work of Vincent Baker\u2019s Apocalypse World and the countless great games based on this work: Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, The Sprawl, Saga of the Icelanders. Additional design inspiration came from Penny for my Thoughts by Evil Hat Productions, Dread by The Impossible Dream and Mage: The Ascension by Onyx Path.\nMedia touchstones include the Akira and Ghost in the Shell manga, Blade Runner, Serial Experiments LAIN, The Bourne Series, The Matrix and most recently Sense8 (while representative of many ideas present in Headspace, this show was released just this year and didn\u2019t affect my ideas much).\nHeadspace exists because of a team of amazing professionals who have brought their A-game to making this game a reality. Brian Patterson\u2019s artwork perfectly captures the cyberpunk vibe with a splash of heroic manga. Mark Diaz Truman has provided invaluable guidance to the Kickstarter process and his company Magpie Games will be providing fulfillment services. Jeremy Morgan\u2019s keen eye for details with copy editing has made the Quickstart text extremely tight! And a huge thank you to all the contributing authors who have provided exciting cyberpunk prose for the final game.\nKira Magrann is an artist, game designer, and queer feminist cyborg living in Columbus, Ohio. Her influences include Aubrey Beardsley, Anais Nin, and Masamune Shirow, and she has a particular love of cyberpunk and Victoriana. The roleplaying games she\u2019s created are Crash Into You, Strict Machine, Game of Thrones (Play the Cards), and Twilight Dames (a FATEcore hack). She\u2019s also contributed to the Fate Cortex, Game Chef, and Annalise. She is a co-organizer of Indie Games on Demand at Origins and Gen Con, and contributor to the Ennie award winning international feminist blog Gaming as Women. You can find her jewelry at Anima Metals on Etsy.\nWill Hindmarch is a writer and game designer whose works include the cyberpunk-action escapade, Always/Never/Now. His writing and designs appear in numerous books, magazines, comics, and games, both analog and digital.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first game design and first Kickstarter which is why I\u2019ve brought on Mark Diaz Truman to help with the management of both the campaign and with final fulfillment.

Which has given me tremendous confidence in my ability to budget and ultimately deliver on this game.\n\nThe largest problem most Kickstarter campaigns experience is delays.

It is a regular question card with a new section called \u201cBest Practice\u201d.

She spends the next few hours quietly trailing Elliot as he goes about his afternoon, completely unaware that he is being followed. As they get to know each other virtually she uses her voyeuristic advantage to seem like the perfect date. What will happen when they meet?\nYou can read a excerpt from the script here\nMy inspiration\nI was inspired to write The Wasteland by many of my friends who traverse the exciting, difficult and occasionally treacherous world of dating in London.

Characters roll two d20s, attempting to roll as low as possible on each one \u2013 the more dice that roll low, the more successes the character scores.\nTasks will require one or more successes to be successful, and any successes scored beyond that minimum become Momentum, which can be spent to achieve a variety of advantageous effects. However, this can come at a cost: characters who wish to succeed can push their luck, rolling extra d20s to boost their chances of success and the Momentum they generate. However, each extra d20 comes from the character\u2019s resources \u2013 such as ammunition \u2013 or adds to a pool of Heat that represents all the things that can go wrong in a mission, which the GM can spend to complicate adventures and scenarios and make the characters\u2019 lives interesting. \nYou can expect lots of support for 2d20. The system is currently in use with the Mutant Chronicles RPG and the planned Conan and John Carter RPG's from Modiphius with more to be announced.\nWe are talking to partners about producing German and French editions of the Infinity RPG at a later date. When we have more information on these we will announce them but cannot confirm any dates yet. \nWe have confirmed with Spanish publisher Nosolorol to produce the Infinity line in Spanish. You can now get a Spanish PDF of the corebook and Player's Guide for \u00a320 (see Pledges). \nModiphius Entertainment was founded by Chris and Rita Birch, and has been running since the spring of 2013 when we launched the big award winning Achtung! Cthulhu RPG. We've since published 12 books, co-published 6 more (including the award winning Mutant: Year Zero) and created a line of miniatures and accessories. In 2014, we re-booted the epic Mutant Chronicles roleplaying game and mid September start shipping the first wave of 17 books with the beautiful 500 page core book and five supplements. This year we launched the Thunderbirds boardgame with Matt Leacock (Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Roll Through The Ages) based on the 50 year old iconic TV series and are shipping them later this month! \nYou will discover we really care about giving you excellent service, we try to answer questions quickly and work hard to keep a friendly and fun atmosphere.

If anything major happens, we let you know and tell you how we're dealing with it. \n\nWe have learned from previous kickstarter projects and spent the last 9 months laying the groundwork for the game, completing playtesting and commissioning the writing. The core rules are complete, the background is in first draft and will be going in to edit during the Kickstarter. We are commissioning all new artwork but have a lot of artists working to get this ready in time for layout to start in late October. Sometimes printers can get overloaded with sudden print work and it can be difficult to book slots when the books are ready and smaller delays are inevitable. \n\nSo we are allowing more time than required for delivery to make allowances for unforeseen delays. \n\nWe have other Kickstarters in the process of being fulfilled and have successfully shipped over 2000 backer's rewards. Achtung! Cthulhu's final shipment of four books will be during September and October having already delivered 8 books, over 2000 pages in PDF and numerous accessories, Mutant Chronicles main wave ships in print late-September having delivered nearly 1000 pages in PDF.

We have over 6000 happy backers who attest to our service, professionalism, friendliness and our excellent standards of quality in every product we create. \n\nWe have expanded our team - each game line has a separate line manager, writing, layout and editing team to reduce the chance of people being overloaded with work.

Permanent team and individual decisions and the possibility of death and resurrection as a ghost make this a unique new way to team up and create a story together.\nTrailer:\nGreat if you like:\n\u203b Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books\n\u203b Co-op games\n\u203b RPGs\n\u203b Coloring/illustrating/papercrafting\n\u203b Games that you and your kids can enjoy\n\u203b Squids (who doesn't?)\nWhat is it?\nIt's a book that transforms into a game. As you progress through the book, you will create your characters, color them, and customize them. Your characters will face many dangers, brave many challenges, and make many decisions that permanently affect the story. You'll use a decision card to track the choices you make as the story moves forward.\nWhat do you get? \n\u261eThe Book. Spiral-bound to lay flat as you play, with game pieces cleverly built into the back cover (see below for example). 2-5 players may play.\n\u261eThe Printable files. The Cloud Dungeon is designed to be a fantastic one-time experience, but it can also be played over and over again, with new results and unique characters. When you buy The Cloud Dungeon, you gain access to a file of the pages that you'll be cutting up, so any time you run out of characters, weapons, or just want a fresh experience, all you need to do is print out a few pages. Everyone who pledges $3 and above will receive the print-and-play.\n\u261eTwo Character Packs. 6 printable characters per pack:\n\u261eAll Stretch Goals. Built right into the book, or delivered digitally, depending on the reward.\nBack cover - not final, but still pretty cool, eh?\nStretch Goals \nWhy I'm doing stretch goals: Since I'm a one-man show, designing, writing and illustrating all of this myself, I can add lots of additional content to the book very cheaply. If you put in the time and the effort to really reach out and tell people about this game, then I'll invest even more of my time to give more amazing stuff to everyone. Thank you for sharing!\nWhat's unique?\nThis is a game that inspires creativity. As you progress through the game, your character might grow an animal tail, have their legs broken, or become a slightly insane zombie with a mustache. Drawing and editing your character allows you to make a completely unique adventurer, as colorful and crazy as your imagination!\nPermanent decisions \u2013 Each team and individual decision you make is tracked on a Decision Card. Later in the story, these decisions will come back to help - or haunt - you!\nPermanent death \u2013 but it's ok. You'll come back as a ghost, and you'll still be able to participate in team decisions, and aid the rest of your team!\nMedia and Testimonials\nGeek Dad - \"If you are looking for a fun, light-hearted RPG game for the whole family that will also let you and/or your kids have a lot of fun, creative play at the same time, go check out The Cloud Dungeon.\"\nDraw 10 Games - \"What really makes The Cloud Dungeon stand out is how events that happen in the story affect your character in physical space by modifying the drawing on the character card. That looks like a really fun game mechanic and I can\u2019t wait to see more.\"\n\"I can't wait to play it again! My favorite part was how fun the story was and how it unfolded during the game. It kept me on the edge of my seat. And there were lots of surprises that I didn't expect.\" \u2013 Malachi, 9 years old\nA BETA version of the REAL BOOK! (international backers, this is from Lulu!)\n\"The Cloud Dungeon is a good game because for people who like to draw can make and create there characters they can make their own characteristics through the game and I think that it is a good game for kids because they can create there own stuff or try to at least it is fun because you can be a robot or a zombie lady but I have never gotten to the end of the game but I know it will be awesome.\" \u2013 Cora, 10 years old\n\"The entire family enjoyed it, and I especially appreciated the fact that the \"leadership\" role in the game switched to each one of us as we played together. Little Mack took over at one point, laughing his little head off in the process. It's a great game! It's equal part strategy, invention, creativity, and great story-telling. ... I think bringing families together to the kitchen table to do something as simple and satisfying as playing a board game is a very good thing.\" \u2013 Amy, Playtester\nWhy Pledge Now?\n\u2042 Money-back guarantee \u2013 Within one month of receiving The Cloud Dungeon, if you don't absolutely love it, just e-mail me. You don't have to send the game back, just forward me your payment e-mail and I'll refund the whole amount.\n\u2042 Limited edition \u2013 Exclusive character/some stretch goals/spine color that will only be in the first printing of this game!\n\u2042 Make it better for everyone \u2013 As we raise more money, I will be able to devote even more time to making characters, and other extras. We're making the game better for everyone, forever! That's a good feeling.\n\u2042 Get your mark on the game  \u2013 This Kickstarter is a shared creative experience. You get to vote on some aspects of the book, permanently affecting the game!\n\u2042 The game's almost done \u2013 I've rigorously tested and refined this game at Ultimate Team Up events for the past six months, and the edits I make after each round of play testing have been getting smaller and smaller. I'm very much in the polishing stage of this project, which is an exciting place to be! This isn't just an untested idea \u2013 it's been played and enjoyed over and over again by a diverse range of play testers.\nShipping outside the U.S. \nAs soon as the Kickstarter version of the game is done, I'll be making it available for purchase via Lulu.com, where you'll be able to get it shipped to you at Lulu's shipping rates, which are very reasonable. You'll get the same book at the same price (+shipping) as Kickstarter backers, and the free character packs as well.\n\u2767 If you want ONLY the Print-and-Play: Back the campaign at the $3 level, and call it good! It's available for anyone in the world.\n\u2767 If you want the Print-and-Play AND the book (and another bonus): Pledge the $3 level, and I'll notify you when the book comes to Lulu.com for international backers. The Lulu edition will come with both digital character packs, and you'll also get 6 months of the Character of the Month club as a \"thank you\" for backing the campaign!\n\u2767 If you just want the book, not the Print-and-Play: Do NOT back the campaign, except for $1 if you want to comment/be involved. Message me through Kickstarter, or at http://www.andhegames.com/contact-me, and I'll notify you when the book comes to Lulu.com for international backers. The Lulu edition will come with both digital character packs.\nEven if you're outside the U.S., please stick around and be a part of this project! All of the updates are public, and by spreading the word, you'll be improving the final book.\nHow to Play\nThis video goes through many of the mechanics used in The Cloud Dungeon. The game book is broken up into 3 chapters, each of which can be completed on a different night, or it can be played all in one shot.\nWhat about replay value?\nThe Cloud Dungeon is not designed to be infinitely repayable. I did this on purpose, because I'm interested in pushing games in directions they rarely go. Single-use experience games (like the murder-mystery type) haven't lived up to the potential I see in this format. This game isn't for you if you just want a game to play over and over again, but only if you love exciting new experiences that haven't been tried in modern tabletop gaming.\nHowever \u2013  this isn't just a cash-grab. You don't have to buy the book multiple times to be able to play it again and again. When you buy my game, I want you to be able to play it as many times as you want without giving me another cent. With every purchase of the book, you'll get PDFs of every page, so you'll be able to print out any pages that were cut up and destroyed, print out new sets of characters, and play the game over and over again for just a few pennies of ink. You'll also always have access to my free printable D.I.Y. Game Nights, and every story created by the community, most of which will utilize the characters you've made to make a new story.\nReward Levels\nNote on extra characters/character packs: The base book (not counting stretch goals) will be coming with 12 characters, and blank character cards (for drawing your own characters). The character packs have 6 characters each, and will retail at $7 each.\n(NOTE: Clarification on Print-and-Play level)\nAdd-ons\nHOW TO CLAIM ADD-ONS:\n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project page.\n2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on.\n3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged.\n**You may claim as many add-ons as you would like, simply add each price to your pledge.\nFuture Ideas\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for D.I.Y. Adventure Games, this new way of playing games. I'm already writing my second game based on this system. I've only barely begun to explore using creativity, destructibility, and permanence to create amazing shared play experiences. I hope to continue crafting these games, and to inspire other people to make their own games exploring these mostly untapped realms of game design!\nAbout the Creators\nKicking it forward: http://kickingitforward.org\nAndrew (Andhedrew) Miller makes games and publishes at www.andhegames.com.

Set in the near future, the experience will be like playing a cross between the Crystal Maze and Portal but in the real world. We\u2019ve developed some really cool tech that will bring Hyde to life, we\u2019re now looking for your support to build it into a real world game environment.\nThis is the story\nYou're taking part in experimental trials of a new drug developed by the Jekyll Corporation. It's designed to modify the capabilities of the human body, giving you the power to control your environment simply by controlling your physical state (your pulse rate, breathing, posture etc).  \nArmed with some wearable tech your assignment is to navigate your way though a maze of connected rooms, using your new powers to complete a series of increasingly challenging tasks along the way.  \nBut this is a smart maze: it knows where you are, and how you\u2019re doing. You begin to realise that someone \u2013 or something \u2013 is working against you. You'll need to stay calm to retain control of your surroundings. Because there's only one way out of this maze, and that's through discovering the true story of Jekyll & Hyde.\nWe plan on building Hyde in London and New York City, if we hit our stretch goal. It will open to the public in 2016 as a ticketed experience that lasts 45-60 mins experience.\nWhat We Are Asking For\nWe\u2019ve got a tech set up, a warehouse in which to build the prototype and an awesome team to make Hyde happen. This includes Jekyll & Hyde expert Dr Anthony Mandal. Anthony is Reader in Print and Digital Cultures at Cardiff University and is fascinated by the complicated relationship between science and the supernatural, exploring the ways in which gothic writers have responded to persistent cultural anxiety regarding science and technology.\nWe need to raise \u00a350,000 from the Kickstarter community to fund the building of the maze, the scaling up of our technology and its installation in the game space. But we also need your input into the design of the game play. \nHyde is a totally unique, highly original concept - we can link your body to stuff in the game world like enabling you to unlock doors by holding your breath, or switching lights by lowering your heart rate - and it has massive potential. We need your help in realising Hyde: sharing possible game challenges, providing a reality check to our ideas and helping test the experience as we develop. Most importantly we need your bio-data. The Lab Rat perk is where we invite backers to come down and get wired into Hyde, testing game scenarios and providing feedback, both biological and creative.\nJoin the conversation on Twitter @s_shot or Facebook facebook.com/hydeiscoming\nWe'll also be posting updates, inspiration and game info to the project page as we develop Hyde: http://hydeiscoming.co.uk\nOn the ground or online, we hope you can contribute to Hyde. It's inside all of us.\nStretch Goals\nIf we raise \u00a350,000 we build the maze.\nFor each extra \u00a33,000 we raise, we'll add another room. \nWhen we reach \u00a375,000 we'll commit to opening a maze in the USA, in New York City. \nAt \u00a3125,000 we'll stop building rooms and look at different types of bio-sensing and actuation (walls that move with your breathing anyone?)\n Project Timeline\nWhat We Know\nOk, we\u2019re about to start of a journey of discovery and we hope you can come along with us. Here\u2019s where we are starting from...\nExperience\nHyde is an interior environment, a maze made up of rooms, corridors and halls that are linked by doors. Players can experience the maze either individually (scary) or in a small group. As players progress through Hyde they encounter doors that are locked. In order to progress deeper into Hyde the players must unlock these doors. This is achieved by overcoming challenges. Some of these are familiar from computer games and escape the room experiences: solving puzzles, finding hidden keys and so on. Other challenges are deeply unfamiliar; the players must control their body state to open the doors: may be hold their breath, blow forcefully or lower their heart rates. The objective is to find the centre of the maze and get out within a given time.\nStory \nThe maze is a test environment for an experimental, performance enhancement drug being developed by the Jekyll Corporation. Players are the guinea pigs. Before they begin the experience the players are fitted with wearable tech and are given the drug (note: not a real drug). The players then enter the maze where their capabilities are assessed, with their bio-data sent to the system as it tests their enhanced performance. With each challenge successfully overcome, the system increases the difficulty of the maze. This is a dynamic environment that knows where the individual players are and how they are performing.\nBut things appear to go wrong; as the players use their new super-powers to unlock doors and make their way through the maze, unintended side-effects become apparent. Rooms offer no apparent means of unlocking doors but alternative exit points are discovered: a ventilation duct, or a hidden service hatch. These give access to a completely different world, of laboratories and plant rooms; the behind the scenes, operational facilities of the Corporation research labs. Here the story of Jekyll & Hyde begins to appear, where you go in search of Hyde, only to be pursued by him.\nTechnology \nCurrently, we are using commercially available bio-sensors. These connect via Bluetooth to a mobile telephone. The phone runs our app that sends individual player data to the Hyde server. The server processes this information, then activates actuators (locks, lights, motors) in the maze. Hyde tracks players, individually and in groups, so will make challenges harder or easier, depending where players have been and how well they are doing.\nDown at the lab we\u2019ve built a series of prototype bio-activated devices using commercially available systems and a fair bit of soldering. The prototypes are pretty neat. They include a door that opens when you blow out, a box that you can unlock by holding your breath and a zoetrope that spins at the same speed as your heart. It\u2019s been great fun hacking together these prototypes. We\u2019ve learned a lot in this early development stage. Now we really need to string these systems together and start configuring them for a full scale Hyde experience.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nIn Hyde we are connecting people's bodies to the world around them in a highly novel way. We\u2019ve played with this ourselves, and it\u2019s awesome, but only with a handful of linked challenges within a single room. We have not constructed a continuous sequence out of a number of rooms. How this will work and how it will form a satisfying game experience is something we can only answer by building a full scale prototype and testing it with lots of players. This is where the Kickstarter community can really help out. Our Lab Rat perk gives you the opportunity to come down and test the work in progress, both in Cardiff and/or London, and to play and feedback the finished maze in London.\nThis is a Jekyll and Hyde game. It\u2019s a classic story that was a controversial bestseller in its day. How can we represent some of the ideas and themes of the story in the game? How can we honour its transgressive power? Working with our academic partner Anthony Mandal, world expert on Jekyll and Hyde, we\u2019ll be leading a discussion with our backers on how the story could be rendered in a game environment. This is more than props and bits of exposition - this isn\u2019t a period piece and it\u2019s certainly not steampunk - but the challenge of rendering a linear sequence of plot reveals into a game where players could experience the action of the story as events that happen to them as participants.\nIt\u2019s not just about the money. We\u2019ve been making games for over six years. In that time we have made over forty five games, from mobile apps to mass participation spectaculars. Central to our most successful work has been an element of co-design and community. We\u2019ve run regular playtest labs, a festival of street games, igfest, and our best selling zombie chase game started as a collective vision of Bristol\u2019s creative community. This is why we have brought Hyde to Kickstarter. We need you financial support but we also need your collaboration.\nAbout Us\nWe\u2019re a small company making the biggest real world games played anywhere and this our most ambitious project so far. The company is led by joint creative directors Simon Evans & Simon Johnson, supported by a team of nine specialising in construction, location management, casting, production management and technology development. \nIn the 6 years we\u2019ve been operating we\u2019ve developed over 40 different games. Our games are playful experiences staged with real people in real places. When you play one of our games you might be chased through a bustling city centre by tracking dogs, you might have to escape a zombie infested shopping mall, or make it to the last boat out of town before the cops get you. We create unique experiences that are powerful, compelling and tremendous fun. Real world games put you in the centre of the action, as the hero or villain of your own story. Slingshot\u2019s biggest game so far has been the city wide zombie chase game 2.8 Hours Later. Our zombies have hunted over 80,000 people across the UK\u2019s streets, in games that cover a 2.5 - 3 mile route and up to 12 locations. We are *the* experts in real world gaming.\nSlingshot games involve play with other people in physical spaces, just like the games you played as kids, but underlying them is the latest technology. Check out our website to see the types of games we\u2019ve delivered using radically new approaches. Games such as the manhunt GPS tracking games Moosehunt and Hat Game, or the social robot Tweeture have gained us a global reputation for our inventive use technology in playful experiences.\nFor Hyde Slingshot are joined by Dr Anthony Mandal, Reader in Print and Digital Cultures at Cardiff University and expert on Jekyll & Hyde. Anthony has published numerous books and articles on 19th century literature, the gothic and the business of publishing. More particularly, Anthony has always been fascinated by the complicated relationship between science and the supernatural, exploring the ways in which gothic writers have responded to persistent cultural anxiety regarding science and technology. His work has focused on both the 19th century and the present day, exploring the common responses that emerge when a society is confronted with a rapidly accelerating technology (the industrial and digital ages respectively). As well as working with Slingshot on Hyde, Anthony is one of the General Editors overseeing a landmark new edition of the complete works of Robert Louis Stevenson, that is being published by Edinburgh University Press over the next decade. You can find out more about Anthony and his work at http://about.me/Anthony.Mandal\nHyde is supported by REACT. The programme is a partnership between UWE Bristol (the University of the West of England), Watershed and the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter. Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, it is a unique collaboration supporting innovative products and transformational services by bringing together companies and academics across South West and Wales.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges we face fall into two categories: firstly, ones that emerge out of running a live event game; secondly, risks and challenges that arise from the highly novel use of technology in the project, specifically the use of players bio-data.\n\nThe first category is very familiar to us, so we\u2019ll deal with it first. We are proposing to put up to hundreds of players through a maze inside a warehouse. Doing this safely and ensuring that relevant regulations such fire evacuation are met will require some work. However, this is an area in which we have considerable experience.\n\nSlingshot have had almost 100,000 players take part in our games over the last six years, with most of them having played 2.8 Hours Later. This game involves up to 600 players running around city centres and accessing a range of venues, from dilapidated warehouses to multi-storey car parks. During this time we have developed robust procedures to manage safe play and we have a partnership with Bath and North East Somerset Council http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/ who are our nominated Primary Authority. This scheme means the authority has endorsed our statutory compliance for our existing products. The team there have worked with Glastonbury Festival and have a great deal of experience inspecting the weird and the wonderful. We\u2019ll be working closely with them to ensure Hyde is safe as well as fun.\n\nBy contrast use of bio-data involves risks that are unfamiliar to us. We\u2019ll be stimulating our players and collecting lots of intimate bio-data from our them. We need to ensure that requiring players to manipulate their breathing and heart rate doesn\u2019t have an adverse effect on their health and/or exacerbate an underlying condition. \n\nThis is very early days in the widespread use and exploitation of bio-sensing technology. As a society, we are only just becoming aware of the implications the data generated by products such as the Google watch will have. Privacy is a major concern. For these reasons we will be consulting with experts in law and medical ethics to develop our approach to these issues. \n\nFinally, the challenge of developing logic to handle the large volume of data that the project will generate is not inconsiderable. Implementing logic that delivers the gameplay and story objectives described above will be a huge challenge. We\u2019ve got a fair bit of experience to inform a conceptual response to these challenges but rendering them in code will require us to hire a crack team of engineers and developers. Basically, we are going to throw money at the problem and we\u2019ve budgeted to hire the best.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Slingshot\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nHi, We're Slingshot, a small company making the biggest real world games played anywhere, and this our most ambitious project yet.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "The Black Maze Cometh", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Sapiens", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Dr Anthony Mandal", "update_content": "We'd like to introduce Anthony, resident expert on Jekyll & Hyde and all things Gothic.

Some of our hit singles include \"Me Myself and I,\" \"Saturdays\" and \"Feel Good Inc.\" a collaboration with Gorillaz.\nWe\u2019ve collaborated with everyone from Chaka Khan to Common to even NASA: In 2004, our song \"Potholes in My Lawn,\" became one of the first rap records to be beamed from another planet by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. Now we are here to collaborate with YOU, humanoid, on the most exciting project we\u2019ve ever done.\nFor the last decade, we've been independent artists, free of a record label interfering in our creative process. This will be our first De La Soul studio album in eleven years. We\u2019re excited and ready to create. It's been essential that we find ways to fund, record and release new music. Typically the fans have been the ones who support and appreciate our vision, so using Kickstarter and giving our fans the opportunity to be a part of the process just feels right. We see Kickstarter as a home for creative minds and a wonderful platform; where people who believe, respect and see the vision, can support an idea and make it a reality.\nTrue to our Hip-Hop roots, we make music without limits. This new album will incorporate elements of Jazz, Funk, Rock, Country Western and anything else we're feeling in the moment. To us, music is the influence of sounds, sounds in all vibrations and sizes, telling a story or pointing a direction. Some of these sounds we call samples, samples we use to make songs.\nS-950 & SP 1200 Samplers\nSampling is basically copying a piece of sound, from one recording, and reusing it to create a new recording. It is how De La has always made music. The sampler is our instrument, but people who copy, and in this case \"sample,\" have also been considered thieves and unoriginal. So, unfortunately a huge part of our career has also been spent fighting off the \u201csample police.\u201d\nEnough of those battles! For the new album, we needed a completely new approach, something Hip-Hop hasn\u2019t done before. So, here it is: For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves.\nVox Studios, Los Angeles, CA\nOver the last three years, we've collaborated with some of LA's finest studio musicians and recorded them in free-styled, unrehearsed, jam sessions. They played everything from banjo to upright bass, sometimes up to a dozen musicians at once; simply allowing sounds to integrate. We did 90% of these recordings in one of LA's most classic studios, Vox. We chose Vox because we wanted our recordings to have that creamy analog warm mixing board sound that the old records our parent\u2019s once played had. With over 200 hours of sounds, and vibes, equal to about 250 to 300 full-length vinyl LPs, it's time that we get to the work.\nHere\u2019s the interesting part. We are now in the process of going back to that 200+ hours of music, listening, enjoying and discovering those special moments where, musically, something magical happens, where interesting sounds and layers were forgotten, where new sounds can be sampled, looped, chopped, filtered and arranged, freely, without the intrusive presence of publishing politics and the infamous \u201csample police.\u201d What we've done is created our own crates of records; album upon albums to mine and sample from. In our world, what we\u2019ve created is freedom, freedom to make the art you believe in without having to compromise your vision. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted most, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always believed in, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve fought for, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter with you.\nWe have a fantastic cast of artist we're collaborating with. So far Damon Albarn (of Blur/Gorillaz), 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, and David Byrne (of Talking Heads) have blessed us with their talents; and we\u2019ll have more announcements of collabs to come, right here on Kickstarter.\nClockwise: Damon Albarn, 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, David Bryne\nWe\u2019re crowdfunding it to help pay for recording, mixing, marketing, and everything else. Your support will keep us in the studio, help us continue to sample and manipulate the music we\u2019ve recorded, will help us get additional production work done; and will help us design, package, market, and distribute the album. The whole thing. We literally cannot do it without you.\nSo now, for the goodies\u2026 For your support we\u2019d like to offer you some cool rewards. Let\u2019s start with our Kickstarter only, 1GB De La Soul thumb drives uploaded with the new album.

He and David Jude Jolicoeur were childhood friends and met Vincent Mason as students at Amityville High School.

After connecting with Vincent Mason in high school, the trio wasted little time writing their essential chapter in hip-hop history.

His early stage name \u201cTrugoy\u201d is an inversion of his favorite food, yogurt.\nVincent Mason was born in Brooklyn, New York.

And then the Empire goes silent. Unlocks when funding reaches $200,000.\nShadow of the Demon Lord is a roleplaying game of dark fantasy\u2014a genre that weaves elements of horror into a fantasy world. In the game, you create and play characters struggling to survive in a land sliding toward oblivion, a place infested by demons, roaming mobs of undead, strange magic, unhinged cultists, and all in the ruins of the last great empire of mankind. If you love Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, the Ravenloft and Midnight settings, Joe Abercrombie\u2019s The First Law series, Glen Cook\u2019s Black Company books, or heavy metal music, then this is the game is for you.\nThe game takes place in a world standing on the brink of the apocalypse.  What is the cause? Who is responsible? The Demon Lord, of course! This being of staggering power and boundless evil authors the catastrophes blighting the landscape. Each new horror released reflects the Demon Lord's approach, the touch of its shadow, and its growing hunger for not only the planet but the entirety of all things. Although near, the Demon Lord remains outside the cosmos, rattling the cage of its prison as it strains to escape the Void to visit catastrophic destruction to your world.\nThe apocalyptic tone is on a dial. If you don\u2019t want to blow everything up right away, tune it down low and the game plays fine as a less perilous, dark fantasy roleplaying game. But if you are inclined to crank up the volume, the game provides several catastrophic templates you can use to model how the world is falling apart. These templates represent the Shadow of the Demon Lord; wherever the Shadow falls, chaos and upheaval are born. The Shadow might loose global pandemics, famines, droughts, earthquakes, demon princes to stomp across the countryside, the living dead, and other world-spanning disasters and threats.\nThe game system helps you tell interesting and exciting stories. To make this happen, the game system is easy to learn, plays fast, and requires little preparation to play. All these ensure both novice and veteran players can enjoy the game together. Here are a few ways the game met its goals:\nEasy to Learn: The GM decides if a character\u2019s action happens, doesn\u2019t happen, or might happen. If it might happen, a roll of the die determines the outcome. You use the core mechanic to resolve any task, whether you're punching a demon in the face, trying to kick down a door to get away from that demon, or dodge the vomit it spews from its mouth.\nYour character develops with the story. Each time your group completes an adventure, the group's level increases. Each increase adds cool stuff to your character. You might learn spells, a trick with a weapon, or some thing else that might help you survive. All benefits you gain come from the paths your character follows. The first adventure you play through helps you decide the first path you will choose. If you spend a lot of time fighting, you might become a warrior. If you cast a spell from a tome bound in human skin and barbwire, you might become a magician. At higher group levels, you choose additional paths that might extend previous choices or take your character in all new directions. You can choose any path you like so you can play the character you want to play.\nPlays Fast: Stories (adventures) are playable in one game session lasting from 3 to 5 hours. Stories are short, covering about one page per hour of expected play. You can also complete a typical campaign (a string of 11 connected adventures) in 11 game sessions. The core book has rules for playing characters up to level 10. This means that if you meet once a week for a 4-hour session each time, you can complete your campaign in about two months. That\u2019s six campaigns a year!\nThe benefit of short campaigns is that the game lets you tell more stories, create more characters, and experience more of the game's options. As a player, you\u2019re not locked into one character for one year or longer. You can have several. And, as a Game Master, it is possible to run a complete campaign in a compressed time span. Best of all, the campaign brevity gives other interested members of the group a chance to become the  Game Master.\nLittle Preparation: You can make a starting character in about 5 minutes. You make one big choice, note the information on your character sheet, and you\u2019re ready to go. And a Game Master can prepare for a game in the time it takes to read a couple of pages of text. \nIf you'd like more information about the game design, please visit schwalbentertainment.com. There, you\u2019ll find news about the game, design diaries, and much more! \nThe game\u2019s complete and ready to move into production. I spent most of 2014 writing, designing, testing, developing, and putting the game in front of hundreds of people. Now I need your help getting Shadow of the Demon Lord into the hands of my editors and then into layout, through printing, and onto your gaming table. It\u2019s ready, but I need your help to make it happen. Backing this campaign will make Shadow of the Demon Lord a reality. Here's a fun graphic that shows you the backer levels:\nOnce we hit the funding goal, unlocking stretch goals add value to your pledge.

Make sure you tag your contributions with #SOTDLKS!\nFollowing Monte Cook Games' lead, we\u2019re not locking you into a single shipping method. Instead, we're offering you some options. All print books include a shipping allowance. This amount covers basic shipping in the United States. So if you\u2019re good with basic shipping, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny more.\nYou can, however, choose a different option. When it\u2019s time to ship your rewards, we\u2019ll ask you how you want your book(s) shipped. You\u2019ll be able to choose a faster or more trackable method, though it will likely cost more. If your shipping allowance doesn\u2019t cover it, you can pay the difference at that time.\nInternational backers have the same options, but the final cost of even basic shipping will require additional payment. As with domestic backers, you choose your shipping method, apply the credit, and cover the difference.\nI'm using Backerkit to manage fulfillment. So if you choose print options, you will get information from them about selecting your rewards when the Kickstarter wraps.\nIf you have surplus bucks from your shipping credit, you\u2019ll be able to apply the remainder to anything else you\u2019d like from the Demon Lord store.\nLast, the estimated delivery date is for the Shadow of the Demon Lord game. Some rewards might come earlier, and some will arrive later.\nAVATARS!\nYou can also help spread the word by grabbing one of these awesome images and using it as your profile pic (and driver's license pic)!\nSpecial thanks to Matt Marson and Larry Howe for filming and assembling the video, Trey Call of Dirty Proper for the music, Dan Heinrich and Andrew Follett for the character sheet, Elizabeth Peterson for the logo, Patrick Parker and Chris Sims for graphics, Hal Mangold for layout, Jared von Hindman for the achievements art, Ivan Dixon and Svetoslav Petrov for the amazing art, and everyone else who helped get this campaign up and running!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI waited to launch this Kickstarter until the game was written for a reason. I am cautious. I didn\u2019t want tragedy, writer\u2019s block, being hit by an asteroid impact, madness, or corruption to interfere with the design. Since I'm here and giving you a chance to pre-order this sexy game, this means the game is written, tested, and ready to go into the final stages of production. These stages include editing, layout, art acquisition, printing, and shipping the printed products into distribution. Though I am using the very best people in the business and I am confident we'll sail through these stages laughing all the way, things happen. To mitigate the risks, I have backup people in place just in case an editor gets sucked into a black hole or an artist decides to change careers mid-way through the project.\n\nThe biggest challenge is fulfillment. The difficulty fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards increases with its size. I will handle shipping the rulebooks to backers with the help of my dear friends and family. Digital products will be available as soon as they\u2019re done. And if we unlock additional print products via stretch goals, they\u2019ll be out as soon as we get them done. \n\nBefore launching this Kickstarter campaign, I received a physical and discovered that I am in fine health and in no danger of succumbing to natural causes between now and the end of the year.

You can now preorder The Brand Deck by visiting: http://branding.cards\n-----------------\nUpdated Rewards: We've decided to offer a Not Safe for Work Edition. Same concept but full of awful words you would never want to self imply. We're teaming up with the guy who knows horrible best, Max Temkin, the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity. Surely you can use your imagination as to what will be inside this deck. The game will still be best played as a group, but instead of around a board room table, this game is best played over a few (too many) beers.\n-----------------\nWhether you are building a small brand, starting a big company, or launching your own Kickstarter project, you probably will ask at some point, what really makes you, you? This simple conundrum can cause brands not to launch, projects not to ship, and countless hours of debate about being \"this\" or \"that\". \nAre you \"simple\" or \"complex\", \"conventional\" or \"experimental\", \"practical\" or \"imaginative\"? Defining who you are and who you are not is crucial to building a successful brand. Whether you are designing, writing, directing, building, or planning, a simple set of adjectives can be your North Star, guiding difficult decisions through the process. Despite the importance, deciding on just a few terms to describe the complexities of an organization can be like finding a needle in a haystack. This is why we created a simple tool we call The Brand Deck.\nDownload Press Kit\nAlready In Use\nAt Simple.Honest.Work. the design and technology studio in Chicago, we've helped many businesses realize a new brand, visual identity or web experience. At the beginning of many projects we noticed a problem of not knowing a brand's defining characteristics. We need these attributes to lean on during the grueling design process to inform our decisions. Because of this we began experimenting with a simple card game to engage our clients in determining the core set of attributes which best describes them. After a few iterations and a lot of positive feedback we decided to share it with the rest of the world.\nHow to Play\nThe Brand Deck consists of 100 adjectives, 50 on the front, and 50 contrasting terms on the back. For example, one side might read \"simple\"and the other \"complex\". Each card is placed into one of three piles, You are, You are not, and Not Applicable. The catch\u2014it's best played with a group. Best to have the same number of decks as people in the room. The conversation of why each person choose certain words is where the magic happens. The objective\u2014 get the entire group to align on, at most, 6 cards defining who \"You are\". The cards become the brand or product's core attributes.\nWho is the Brand Deck For?\nEntrepreneurs, writers, strategists, designers, directors, marketers, makers, actors, realtors, builders, interior designers, architects, planners, anyone needing to create or build something.\nThe Rewards\nWhy can't I buy just one? The Brand Deck is best played as a group. Though some have used a single deck to play, the best results happen when each person in the group has their own deck resulting in a lively conversation. \nThe Basic Pack, includes 2 Brand Decks, great for you and one other person. Instructions are included in each individually packaged deck.\nThe Team Pack, includes 5 Brand Decks, perfect for a small team of people. Instructions are included in each individually packaged deck.\nThe Studio Pack, includes 10 Brand Decks, this is the ideal size for any small or medium size company looking to try the deck out. Instructions are included in each individually packaged deck.\nThe Agency Pack, includes 20 Brand Decks, intended for the board room or for small agencies that want to use this with their larger clients. Instructions are included in each individually packaged deck.\nBrand Chats. This is a one hour session with me discussing your project, budding business, or massive rebrand. It's an opportunity to get Simple, Honest answers without a full length engagement. Furthermore, I'll walk you through our process for building brands and teach a few methods we have used with our clients. Lastly, we'll send you a set of Brand Decks to begin the process yourself.\nWorkshops. The first step of kicking off any project at Simple.Honest.Work involves a fairly immersive workshop where we ask difficult questions to uncover who are you and what makes you uniquely you. We are offering these workshops publicly for the first time. We will come to your business, start-up, non-profit and walk you through the same kick-off process we walk through with our clients. In the end you'll learn how successful brands are built and also what you can start doing today to become one yourself.\nBring this idea into reality.\nWhen you put so much thought into an idea it's a shame to keep it to yourself. This is why we want to release the Brand Deck to the rest of you. This Kickstarter campaign will help fund the initial work to make the product available to the public for the first time. The funds we receive from backers will fund the first print production run of the decks, build the dies for the shipping boxes, and get our fulfillment house all ramped up. We appreciate the support of all of you to bring this idea into reality. The more funding, the more we can put into the production. The Brand Deck is simple, but will be a quality product we can all be proud of.\nThe music in our video was created by Lullatone.

If there was one thing I've learned from my first Kickstarter project as well as backing many throughout the years, the best way to deal with these problems is to be honest (which happens to be our middle name).

If you would like to get AKO DICE but missed the campaign (or want to get more), please visit www.ako-dice.com\n                AKO DICE\nHi, everyone! My name is Kacha. While my educational background is in architecture I have always been passionate about product design. I was fortunate enough to have great supports with my previous 2 funded Kickstarter projects (Mochi & Zen Dice), and was able to create my website store at : http://www.monkeyteam.net/. After these 2 projects, I realized that creating unique designs is something I really enjoy. I hope to bring yet another new project with unique \u201cspin\u201d to traditional dice which I call it \"AKO DICE\".\nThe Impact:\nThe use of dice has been recorded to ancient times. The oldest known dice were excavated as part of a 5000-year-old backgammon set at the Burnt City, an archaeological site in south-eastern Iran Dice collecting began with the popularity of the Dungeon & Dragons series of board/role playing games. Since it's inception, players have grown attached to and have collected a wide variety of dice. This started a trend in unique dice designs incorporating various aspects of the gaming world and tapping into themes such as space, fantasy, and more.\nFor the newest design, I have taken the traditional dice and turned it on it's head. I am using a simple idea, yet complex design concept. The new design is inspired by new age concepts, and has a sleek, space-age, cutting-edge technology style. AKO DICE takes the traditional dice design and improves upon it for a trendy, one of a kind design perfect for all gamers as well as collectors.\nA set of AKO DICE with natural finish.\nA set of AKO DICE with black anodized and natural finish.\nA set of AKO DICE with black anodized finish.\nClose up AKO DICE with natural finish.\nClose up AKO DICE with black anodized finish.\nPackaging prototype.\nEvery set of AKO DICE is made of quality aluminum and is available in anodized black and natural aluminum color. The packaging contains 2 dice per boxed set.\nConcept\nAKO DICE utilizes a redesigned dice pip with custom engraved artwork on 16 mm 6-faced dice. Each side is flat with beveled edges, contributing to a sleek, comfortable feel for game play. Rather than using traditional dice pips, each number (1-6) represented by line on each side. To continue the design, each side are connected by pip line, creating links between the numbers. \nWhat I Need & What You Get:\nAs you can see from the photos above, the design and prototypes have already been created to my satisfaction. I am now seeking your supports to help bringing this dream to the production. The first portion of the fund will be used for all tooling setup. Funding will then be spent on the initial order, packaging, shipping & handling, and other related costs. We hope to offer free shipping to our backers all over the world, so we will need some capital to help make this particular portion of the project possible.\nFor early bird backers, we are offering this reward for $12! This option will only be available for a limited time, going up to a $15 soon! Estimated shipping is expected around June of 2015.\nIn addition, we are offering a $12 add-on for backers that are interested in acquiring another set, with your choice of finishes. This is perfect for backers who would like to share our product with others as a gift!\nIf AKO DICE is generously successful in funding, my goal is to carry forward the results. The production costs will be reduced and stretch goal rewards will be available to all backers with more choices and FREE shipping all over the world.\nAKO DICE - Unlocked new color, Red Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Unlocked new color, Blue Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Unlocked Special Edition, Stainless Steel with natural bright finish!\nAKO DICE - UNLOCKED RPG Fan, Grey anodized aluminum Fudge Dice.\nAKO DICE - Most Requested Unlocked, Green Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Most Requested Unlocked, Black Groove!\nAKO DICE - Most Requested 2 Unlocked, Purple Anodized!\nAKO DICE - Most Requested Unlocked, Gold Brass!\nBacker Bonus as a special Thanks!

You can help bring it to America.\nOn FRIDAY THE 13th of FEBRUARY we will release WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS by ourselves, without a studio distributor, so that we can share our film with you, the audience, directly.\nThe film will open in New York City (at Landmark's Sunshine Cinema) and in Los Angeles (at The Arclight Cinemas/Hollywood) but we want to take it further. We want to bring our film ALL across America -- but that\u2019s expensive! There\u2019s posters, trailers, advertising, publicity \u2013 the list is endless\u2026Oh, and we will need something to project in every theater.\nWe have put together a plan with some of the best independent film minds around to reach as many cities and towns as possible, but we cannot achieve our goal without your support, enthusiasm, and generosity. Please help us bring \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows\u201d to a theater near you! \n There\u2019s a lot of misinformation going around about vampires. It\u2019s time to set the record straight.\nPerhaps Hollywood has convinced you that vampire life in the modern world is just one big teen romance fantasy. Where young love can blossom even in a cold and motionless heart and everyone just happens to have really great abs.\nThe truth is, there IS no ending, happy or otherwise, when you\u2019re forced to walk the earth for all eternity.\nThe truth about vampires must be told in America; and it can be, but only with your help.\nPLAY\n\nA first-of-its-kind documentary, What We Do in the Shadows attempts to take a bite out of all the clich\u00e9s and misconceptions about what it\u2019s truly like to be a vampire in today\u2019s world. Conceived by the creators of Flight of the Conchords, Boy, and Eagle vs. Shark and already released to great critical acclaim at the Sundance, SXSX, Berlin, and Toronto Film Festivals (where it won a TIFF People\u2019s Choice Award), What We Do in the Shadows lets you take a never-before-seen glimpse inside the night-to-night lives of four flatmates just trying to get by in today\u2019s world and live their undead lives.\nViago, Deacon, Peter, and Vladislav were kind enough to let our film crew into their home. Or maybe they just wanted to eat us. Either way, they allowed us an unprecedented, intimate look at some of the serious every night issues facing today\u2019s vampires. And it\u2019s not all grandiose gothic castles and succubus orgies.\nWe are there as they confront the challenges of blending in with society, without being able to see their reflection in a mirror as they dress. We watch as, just like any hot or cold-blooded male, they try to get into a trendy nightclub \u2014 which is tough enough, without needing to be invited first. We feel their pain as they try to get a typical Millennial-turned-vampire to actually commit to anything for a week, much less for eternity\nYes, immortality comes at a steep price \u2013 but not as steep as the price of releasing and distributing a film in America. If we are ever to combat the cruel and vicious rumors surrounding vampires, we must bring their story out of the darkness. It\u2019s time Americans learn the truth about the vampire community \u2013 but we can\u2019t do it without you.\nSo please take a look at our rewards and back this project with whatever you can, so this important film gets its day in the sun.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

And in between, all the Restless Dead.\n\n  Are you ready to join them?  \n    Wraith: The Oblivion is the Storytelling game of passion and horror. Take the role of a ghost whose unfinished business won\u2019t let them rest.\nProtect the things you love in the lands of the living, or travel into the deeper Underworld to become a citizen - or an enemy - of the ancient Empire of the Dead. \nLearn the forbidden Arcanoi, ghostly powers that can terrorize the living or wreak havoc on the dead. \nFight the pull of Oblivion, the endless void that seeks to drag everything down into it, and come face to face with its corrupt Spectre servants in an endless Labyrinth filled with nightmares. \nWalk the streets of the eternal city of Stygia, where the crumbled monuments of antiquity rise one after another, a thousand destroyed cities blending into one. \nSet sail on the never-ending storm of the Tempest with a wordless Ferryman at your side, or seek the legendary Far Shores, where it is said that every wraith can find peace and contentment. \nSo don\u2019t go into the light.

Largely disconnected from the rest of the World of Darkness, yet tied to it by fetters of unresolved issues from their lives, the characters also had to face the compelling whispers of their own dark sides, their Shadows. \n\nThis 20th Anniversary Edition of Wraith: the Oblivion returns to that darkly compelling world and both compiles and completes the concepts of the previous two editions. Led by legendary Wraith: the Oblivion developer Rich \"Deadguy\" Dansky, our writing team consists of Wraith veterans like Bruce Baugh, Lucien Soulban, Jackie Cassada, Nicky Rea, and Clayton Oliver, as well as familiar names such as Charles Andrew Bates, Matthew Dawkins, and Lillian Cohen-Moore, and they one and all are dedicated to making Wraith: the Oblivion Twentieth Anniversary Edition the most playable edition yet - while not losing the incredible depth of setting and emotion that Wraith is known for.\n\n  Featuring:\nMassive amounts of content, including material on the Dark Kingdoms, Spectres, Risen, plasmics, Orpheus, and more. \nRevised Arcanoi designed to integrate the Ancient and Modern Arts into a seamless whole.

Embossed into the entire front cover will be a pattern of chains.\n\n\nWraith 20th is both partially written and partially art directed and we are running this Kickstarter for the Deluxe Edition now, at this stage, in order to give our backers the chance to have a say in the kind of package we'll deliver. From comments, Rewards, and Stretch Goals, we will be working with backers to include their thoughts, names, and likenesses.  \n\n\n\n\nHere is a FAQ detailing many of the questions we've already received on the project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3oglr6pytqnlvlp/Wraith%2020%20KS%20FAQ%20V_1_0.pdf?dl=0\nIt's pretty easy. Contribute any amount you want, bearing in mind the levels of contribution and their commensurate rewards over there on the right. If we hit our $50K goal, you'll get the reward that goes with your level of contribution.

PDF Rewards and Add-ons will not take as long as the Deluxe, but will come after the Surveys are returned at least two months after this KS closes. We will contact contributors in the upper tiers with details on their rewards.\n\n    You can Add-on the PDFs listed below to any Reward Tier pledge that already includes a Wraith 20th PDF by clicking on your Reward Tier to the right, and then when you get to the pledge page that confirms your pledge amount, manually changing the amount of your pledge from the base Reward amount to that Reward amount plus the amount of each Add-on that you want as listed below : \n   + $5 for the classic Caravan of Shadows and Beyond the Shroud fiction PDFs.\n  + $10 for the classic Wraith Players' Guide and Shadow Players' Guide PDFs. \n  + $15 for the classic Wraith: The Oblivion and Wraith: the Oblivion 2nd Edition core rulebook PDFs.\n   + $20 for the four classic setting PDFs: Necropolis: Atlanta, Sea of Shadows, Midnight Express, and Haunts.\n  + $25 for the Wraith: the Oblivion 20th Anniversary Edition PDF.\n\n+ $25 for the four classic Factions PDFs: Book of Legions, Renegades, Doomslayers, and The Hierarchy.\n  \n+ $30 for all six of the classic Guildbooks that go into great detail describing the history and existence of Wraith's Guilds.\n\n+ $75 for the V20, W20, and M20 PDFs.\n\n+ $150 for every single classic Wraith game line PDF available from DriveThruRPG.\n   Important: the above classic PDFs were created using the best methods possible depending on available files stretching 20 years back. Therefore, the image quality of PDFs of the older books in particular may not be as good as PDFs for newer books.\n\nYou can also add on individual physical copies of the Deluxe Wraith20 book to any pledge that already is shipping a physical book by manually adding the appropriate amount on the pledge page:  \n+ $100 for a Deluxe Wraith 20th (US/Canada)  \n+ $125 for a Deluxe Wraith 20th (non-US/Canada)\n\nYou can add on the Wraith20 Storyteller's Screen to any reward tier that offers a physical book:  \n+ $15 for the Wraith20 Storyteller's Screen, a sturdy three-panel screen featuring the beautiful collage of Wraith20 art on the outer side, and on the inside there's a selection of charts and other info to make the Storyteller's job a little bit easier.\n\nYou must type in the correct amount calculated by adding the base Reward amount and the Add-ons you want. It does not happen automatically.\n  If we have contributions beyond our target number, we've planned many added rewards for contributors. Our range of possible Stretch Goal awards includes additional material in Wraith20th itself, added glow in the dark cover features to hearken back to first edition, a fiction anthology, a new Necropolis PDF, a streetmap of Stygia, and more. \n\n\nACHIEVED! At $55,000 of contributions, once the Deluxe Wraith: the Oblivion 20th Anniversary Edition KS is over, we're going to offer a KS Wraith 20th shirt on our new RedBubble store for sale at the deepest discount they'll let us do it for a limited time after which we'll change the design- and we'll tell you folks about it first so you can order one if you want. We estimate that you'll be getting about a $10 discount.\n\nACHIEVED! At $80,000 of contributions, we will commission a streetmap of Stygia that shows for the first time the darkened byways and grand processionals of the city of the dead to be included in the book. All backers of Reward Tiers that contain a physical copy of the Deluxe Wraith 20th will receive a coupon link for a paper map from DTRPG for as close to an \"at cost\" discount as we can provide.\n\nACHIEVED! At $90,000 of contributions, we will create a Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF that will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology PDF that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF. \n\nACHIEVED! At $130,000 of contributions, we will take the current Orpheus sub-section of the Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition book and expand it into its own Appendix, fully fleshing out Orpheus to work within the Wraith 20th setting. This is a big addition to the project and will add at least 15,000 words and rearrange the book- but it'll be worth it!\n\nACHIEVED! At $140,000 of contributions, we will create a second Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF that will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology PDF that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF. \n\nACHIEVED! At $160,000 of contributions, every backer who pledged for a reward containing a Wraith 20th PDF will receive a copy of the  \"Handbook for the Recently Deceased\" PDF, as requested by backers, that will function as a 24 page guide to the start of one's life after life for those new to Wraith. \n\nACHIEVED! At $170,000 of contributions, we will create a third Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF that will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology PDF that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $185,000 of contributions, we will add the Dark Kingdom of Jade Arcanoi to the Arcanoi section of the Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition book, giving players more options with their powers and hinting at further Dark Kingdoms expansions.\n\nACHIEVED! At $190,000 of contributions, we will create a fourth Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF written by Rich Dansky himself that will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology, in PDF and eBook formats, that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $200,000 of contributions, we will add and rework the three remaining Dark Arcanoi from Doomslayers to the Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition book, for even more nasty options.\n\nACHIEVED! At $205,000 of contributions, we will create a fifth Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF written by Charles Andrew Bates and featuring Carpenter that will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology, in PDF and eBook formats, that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $215,000 of contributions, we will begin creating the Book of Oblivion PDF with a first 10K words section that will explore and reveal The Tempest and all of the Maelstroms through history. This chapter will be combined with later Book of Oblivion Stretch Goals, and will be sent to backers who have pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $220,000 of contributions, we will create a sixth Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF written by Campbell-Award winning writer, noted podcaster, author of Ghost Train to New Orleans, and World of Darkness contributor Mur Lafferty, that will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology, in PDF and eBook formats, that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $230,000 of contributions, we will continue the Book of Oblivion PDF with a second 10K word section that will feature the terrifying Spectres, with new Castes and Dark Arcanoi. This chapter will be combined with later Book of Oblivion Stretch Goals, and will be sent to backers who have pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $235,000 of contributions, we will create a seventh Wraith 20th Anniversary short story PDF written by Ree Soesbee, noted for her work on Legend of the Five Rings, currently a narrative designer for the award-winning Guild Wars 2, and author of 16+ novels. This PDF will be combined with further short story Stretch Goals to create a Wraith 20th Fiction Anthology, in PDF and eBook formats, that will be sent to all backers who pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $245,000 of contributions, we will add the Dark Kingdom Arcanoi mentioned in Great War: more than 7500 more words adding to the powers in the Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition book.\n\nACHIEVED! At $255,000 of contributions, we will continue the Book of Oblivion PDF with a third 10K section that will gaze deeply into the Labyrinth, its place in the setting, famous Neverborn, and new rules. This chapter will be combined with the other Book of Oblivion Stretch Goals, and will be sent to backers who have pledged for a Reward Tier that includes a Wraith 20 PDF.\n\nACHIEVED! At $260,000 of contributions, we will add a section of Artifacts that we originally didn't have room for to the Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition book.\n\nACHIEVED! At $270,000 of contributions, every backer who has pledged to a Reward Tier containing a physical copy of the Deluxe Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition will also receive coupons for discounted Wraith 20 Fiction Anthology and Book of Oblivion PoDs. This discount will reduce the price of the physical Print on Demand books of the Wraith 20 Fiction Anthology and Book of Oblivion to as close to \"at cost\" as we can make it, and the backer will have to pay the normal DTRPG shipping.\n\nAt $280,000 of contributions, we will continue the Book of Oblivion PDF/PoD with a fourth 10K section that will detail more Shadow content including their Dirty Tricks. This chapter will be combined with the other Book of Oblivion Stretch Goals, and will be sent to backers as per previous BoO sections.\n\nAt $285,000 of contributions, we will add a section of sample Necropoli featuring looks at Paris, Philadelphia, Edinburgh, Rome and Los Angeles,that we originally didn't have room for to the Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition book.\n\nAt $295,000 of contributions, we will continue the Book of Oblivion PDF/PoD with a fifth 10K section about the inner working of Spectre Cults. This chapter will be combined with the other Book of Oblivion Stretch Goals, and will be sent to backers as per previous BoO sections.\n\n\n  This is our thirteenth Kickstarter (there's that curse again), and we have learned enough (sometimes painfully) to make some tweaks to our goals, reward tiers, and prizes.\n\n  We've Included PoDs:  \nWe are including the Print on Demand version of Wraith 20th in the form of a link to DriveThruRPG that enables you to purchase the PoD version (your choice of either Standard or Premium color) for as close to cost as we can give it to you. Because the PoD printer adjusts their pricing for PoDs as they need to, we can't provide a solid $$ amount of what you'll need to pay, but it will be less than a non-backer ordering one. This inclusion is because many backers want a physical version while their Deluxe versions are being traditionally printed.\n \n  Retailer Tiers:  \nWe are continuing to include two Retailer Reward Tiers, one US and one non-US, because we want to be able to support all the great Retailers out there who have supported White Wolf and now Onyx Path over the years. We have a special reward price just for Retailers (someone who owns a store that would sell Deluxe Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition) and anyone thinking of pledging to those Retailer Reward Tiers needs to contact me: richt@theonyxpath.com to confirm that you are operating or representing a store before pledging, please. Any pledges to those Retailer Reward Tiers which do not have confirmations of status will not be honored when sending out Rewards.\n  Shipping Charges:  \nWe also have been forced by the multiple overt shipping charge increases that have occurred this last year to include that cost in the Reward Tier pledge amounts. Now that Kickstarter has changed how those charges can be applied in their system, we have only specified different Reward Tiers for US&Canada vs Other International for Reward Tiers containing 5 books as shipping for them changes because of their weight. We do not, however, try to add in or calculate each country's VAT. That amount, if any, will be an extra charge between you and your customs officials.\n\n  don't run home to mama...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: The Wraith Curse strikes and this book isn't created at all even though the goal is reached. \n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped seven Kickstarter projects, one is at the shipper right now, and one more Deluxe project is at the printer as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The creators of Deluxe Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition have over a century of combined experience in the writing, art direction, developing and layout of beautiful tabletop RPG books. The book is in the middle of writing and art direction, as planned, and we have additional writers and artists we can pull in as well as several internal staff members who can take over overseeing the project.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the Deluxe Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers. \n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, our Deluxe Anarchs Unbound is shipping as estimated, and we are ahead of the game for the current physical book at press as well. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process.

Only evil-doers will be seized without trial, waterboarded, and force-fed.\nRest assured that real-world Troubleshooters are toiling unceasingly even as you scan these words to ensure that the traitor Snowden receives his just desserts for unnecessarily evoking Paranoia in a world that needs it not at all!\nUniversal surveillance is almost here! Tens of thousands of cameras have already been installed in cities worldwide to ensure the continuous monitoring of the activity of all citizens, ensuring our safety from malefactors. Hard AI is on the horizon, and its creation will be an inevitable boon for all of humanity! The Computer is almost here! Utopia is just over the next horizon!\nThe real world is rushing to meet the promise of Paranoia.\nParanoia is subversive and traitorous. It slyly uses humour to induce treasonous thoughts, inculcating an un-mutual sense that authority is not always correct, and that submissive obedience to authority is questionable. Such questions must not be asked!\nJoin today \u2013 your clones will thank you. And remember...\nStay alert! Trust nobody! And keep your untested prototype weapon handy! \nParanoia is one of the RPG 'greats' with players having been blasted, vaporised, and otherwise terminated for the past 30 years. It demonstrated that adult/sophisticated/black humour themes could be brought to roleplaying games, it won the Best Role-Playing Game of the Year award in 1984, and was inducted into the Origins Awards Hall of Fame - one of only ten RPGs to ever gain that distinction.\nAnd now, it is time for a brand rebooted edition, including all your old favourites but with bang up to date game play. \nBox Contents\nDeveloped by World Famous Games Designer James Wallis and his minions, the new Paranoia arrives in a swanky box set, piled high with goodies. All Paranoia books are printed in high quality full colour, and you will receive the following in your box set with a Green-level pledge.\nA brand new Player's Guide safely separates Red clearance rules from those things players are not meant to know.\nThe Games Master's Guide contains all the diabolical tricks, traps and general nastiness needed to run Paranoia successfully. \nThe Missions Book features several brand new scenarios to get you started as Troubleshooters in Alpha Complex.\n100 full colour cards covering everything you need to play from character creation and mutant powers to combat and the latest equipment from R&D. \nThe special Computer Dice, a six-sider with the symbol of the Computer to let you know when things really have gone pear-shaped...\nSix wipe-clean (allowing you to wipe away pen marks - or Troubleshooter's blood, as the case may be) Character Sheets, so you will never have to use a ragged print out ever again! \nTruly the Computer has rewarded its most loyal servants. \nAll of this is wrapped in a one-off Ultraviolet level box set - this is available to Kickstarter backers only. When the retail release comes about in 2015, it will come in a standard Red level set. \nThis is in addition, of course, to the stretch goals we hope to unlock...\nPledge Levels\nThere are several pledge levels with which you can support the new Paranoia. The Computer, of course, is not gauging your commitment and loyalty by the pledge level you choose.\nStretch Goals\nThe planned Paranoia box set is perfect. The Computer says it is perfect. With stretch goals, it will be even more perfect.\nCapitalist Consumption\nThe Paranoia box set contains everything you need to live, thrive and survive in Alpha Complex. The Paranoia box set is perfect. You can make it even more perfect by adding extra Computer-approved items.\nThe following may be added to the Paranoia goodies you receive simply by adding the appropriate amount to your pledge, and we hope to add more choices throughout the Kickstarter process.

The makeup was done by Academy Award winner Kevin Haney and Star Trek veteran Brad Look and Make Up Effects Lab.  Top that off with the amazing visual effects of Tobias Richter and The Light Works, and sound by Academy Award winner Frank Serafine, and the result is Prelude to Axanar: something unlike anything you have ever seen before.  We have our loyal donors to thank for this!\nThis Kickstarter is for the full-length feature Axanar.  Unlike the short film, which we shot in two days and cost $80,000, the 90-minute Axanar feature will take about 3 weeks and cost roughly between $650,000 and $ 750,000 (The budget is in process based on learnings from the Prelude to Axanar budget, so I would expect the budget to climb).  So we are breaking up our costs into discreet sections which should allow us to reach significant milestones, as we don't expect to raise the full amount all at once.  This first Kickstarter will be for the sound stage and set construction.  Anything over what we need for that will be applied to the feature production costs.  Full details are below.\n\nPLEASE NOTE (Added 8/24)\nThe response to our Kickstarter has been amazing and because of the help of George Takei, we blew through $ 500,000 and now $ 600,000!  We never dreamed we would get close to original amount we said we needed, so we didn't revise the actual production budget, which was created before Prelude to Axanar was even shot.  We just did rough budgets for set construction and sound stage, which we have good handles on and hoped we would get enough to cover them.  Then, while building the sets and modifying the studio, we would be able to work on a better budget for the actual production and show you our progress on the sets and studio.\nWell, due to all your generosity, we have everything we need for the sets and studio and are well on our way to covering most of the budget.  So we are going to start working on a formal budgeting process for Axanar and get those numbers as soon as possible.  As always, every donor will get updated through the updates here, as well as on our Facebook Donor Group.\nAccountability and transparency are very important to us, because we take seriously our job of taking care of your money.\nPLAY\n\nTHE STORY\n\nAxanar takes place 21 years before the events of \u201cWhere no Man Has Gone Before\u201d. It tells the story of Garth of Izar, the legendary Starfleet captain who is Captain Kirk\u2019s hero and the role model for a generation of Starfleet officers. Garth charted more planets than any other Captain and was the hero of the Battle of Axanar.  His exploits are required reading at Starfleet Academy.\nThis is the story of Garth and his crew during the Four Years War, the war with the Klingon Empire that almost tore the Federation apart, and whose resolution solidified the Federation and allowed it to become the entity we know in Kirk's time.\nIt is the year 2245, four years into the war with the Klingons.\n\"This is Star Trek\".  That was what Star Trek legend David Gerrold said when he first read the script for Axanar last year. David, who wrote \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" and worked on both TOS and TNG, knows Star Trek better than anyone, liked Axanar so much he signed on as Creative Consultant.\nTHE CAST\nRichard Hatch \"Commander Kharn\"\nFor the role of the Klingon Warlord who leads the Empire into battle, Axanar creator Alec Peters chose his very first acting coach and mentor, Richard Hatch.  Known for his role as Apollo in the original Battlestar Galactica and as Tom Zarek in the re-imagined Battlestar, Richard is a fan favorite and is studying Klingon for the role. \nTony Todd as \"Admiral Ramirez\"\nTony Todd is known for his role as Worf's brother \"Kurn\" in several TNG and DS9 episodes. He also played an older Jake Sisko in the DS9 episode \"The Visitor\", considered by many to be one of the best DS9 episodes. A brilliant actor with incredible presence, his genre roles have made him a fan favorite.  Tony plays Starfleet's most senior Admiral.\nKate Vernon as \"Captain Sonya Alexander\"\nKate Vernon is known best for her role as \"Ellen Tighe\" in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica.  A veteran of stage and screen, Kate comes from an acting family.  She plays hot-shot Starfleet Captain Sonya Alexander.\n Gary Graham as \"Soval\"\nFrom Alien Nation to Enterprise, Gary has been impressing audiences for 30 years.  In Axanar he reprises his role of Vulcan Ambassador Soval from Star Trek: Enterprise.  The wonderful evolution of Soval in Enterprise plays right into Axanar.\nJG Hertzler as \"Captain Samuel Travis\"\nA fan favorite for his role as \"Martok\" in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, JG has played seven different characters in Star Trek.  For Axanar, JG plays Sam Travis, one of Starfleet's finest Captains.\nTHE VISUAL EFFECTS OF AXANAR\nPrelude to Axanar has the amazing talents of Tobias Richter and his company The Light Works, one of the top visual effects houses in the world.  What you have seen in our videos is all Tobias and his crew.\nPLAY\n\n\nKICKSTARTER DETAILS\nAll new donors who donate at least $ 35 in the first 5 days get the Fifth Fleet patch FREE!\nPERKS\nWe want to give you great perks for your backing donations, so we reviewed what other projects have done and did better. We hope you will enjoy the perks we offer.  And please stay tuned for special offers we will be unveiling during the 30 days of this Kickstarter.\nFULFILLMENT\nWe learned a great deal about fulfilling the perks we offered in the first Kickstarter and have applied those lessons in this Kickstarter.  Please note that delivery dates are estimations, and may change.  But we will endeavor to keep you well informed through our updates here on Kickstarter, through our Facebook Donor Group, and through our donor email list.\nThe Starfleet Procurement patch, available only to donors!\nWHERE YOUR MONEY GOES\nACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY\nWe take our obligation to our backers to be financially accountable very seriously.  So we like keeping donors abreast of where your money goes.  We have gotten high marks from our communication with our donors because we value the fact that YOU make this all possible!\nKICKSTARTER FINANCIAL BASICS\nFirst, understand that generally, a project receives about 80% of the total money raised. Ten percent goes to Kickstarter and Amazon payment processing fees, and another 10% we have budgeted for Perks (the gifts you earn at different donation levels).\nThe budget for Axanar is broken into 5 sections:\nSET CONSTRUCTION - $100,000\nWe need to build a complete set of Starship sets from scratch.  We are lucky to have two of the top set builders in Hollywood working on this.  One worked on Star Trek for 15 years for Herman Zimmerman and also built the bridges of the Kelvin, Kobayashi Maru simulator and Enterprise in the JJ Star Treks. The other built the bridge of the SHIELD Helicarrier in Avengers. They are both excited to work on Axanar.\n\n(Remember, to get $ 100,000, we need to raise approximately $ 125,000)\nPLAY\n\nSOUND STAGE - $125,000\nWe have two potential locations we are negotiating for to serve as our sound stage in Valencia, CA, just north of LA.  This will be the permanent home of Axanar Productions and allow us to do more than just Axanar, from other adventures in the Star Trek universe and beyond.  David Gerrold (author of \"The Trouble with Tribbles\") is already lined up to shoot his sci-fi series \"Running Dark\" here. First year's rent is $ 125,000. \n(Remember, to get $ 125,000, we need to raise approximately $ 155,000)\nSOUND STAGE RENOVATION - $50,000\nConverting this space to be a sound stage will cost approximately $50,000.  This includes dropping a grid system for lights and baffling, sound proofing and other modifications to the building. Depending which space we get will determine what exactly we need to do, but this is a rough estimate.\nSci-Fi Film School  -  After the sets our built, we will be holding a Sci-Fi film school. Learn all about film making from our veteran industry staff including David Gerrold (writing), Richard Hatch and Gary Graham (acting), Robert Burnett (Editing/Directing), Christian Gossett (writing/directing) and Academy Award winner Kevin Haney and Star Trek veteran Brad Look (make-up).  Donors will get first shot at the initial film school session.\n(Remember, to get $ 50,000, we need to raise approximately $ 62,000)\nAXANAR PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS - $ 50,000\nThis includes costume manufacture ($20,000), VFX pre-visualization and modelling ($15,000), and make-up ($15,000).  These are all costs we incur before we ever shoot a day on set.  These are just pre-production costs to get these departments going.\n(Remember, to get $ 50,000, we need to raise approximately $ 62,000)\nAXANAR PRODUCTION COSTS - $ 325,000 - $ 425,000\nThis is a very rough estimate done before we even shot Prelude to Axanar.  The biggest differences between Prelude to Axanar and the Axanar feature will be:\n1) Crew will need to be paid on the feature shoot\n2) VFX will be significantly more expensive as there will be so many VFX shots;\n3) Costume costs will be significant for Starfleet and Klingon costumes for the entire cast\n4) There will be a lot of Klingon and Andorian (and other species) make up.\n5) The shoot will be approximately 3 weeks, rather than 2 days.\nPlease note we published the budget for Prelude to Axanar because we want our donors to know where exactly their money goes.  You can read it here:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/194429923/star-trek-prelude-to-axanar/posts/961255\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe have posted a $ 100,000 goal, which will allow us to build the sets we need. But we hope to raise significantly more. Here is what we need, what those stretch goals get us, and what perks we will be giving you all for every stretch goal we meet:\n$275,000  Stretch Goal - At this level, we obtain a facility in Los Angeles to build our sets and pay for the rent to maintain them for a full year.  This takes into account the 10% we will have to pay in Kickstarter/Amazon fees and fulfilling all perks.\nIf we reach $ 275,000, everyone who donated at least $10 gets a Second Fleet (Vulcan) Patch. \n$400,000  Stretch Goal -  At this level, we will be able to pay for modifying the warehouse space with a lighting grid and sound proofing and pay for our pre-production costs as well.  This takes into account the 10% we will have to pay in Kickstarter/Amazon fees and fulfilling all perks.\nIf we reach $ 400,000, everyone who donated at least $10 gets a Third Fleet (Andoria) Patch.\n(Please note, for those donating $35 or less, there is a small shipping fee as otherwise we are not shipping anything to you as everything is digital.  All other levels we will just put these stretch goal perks in with what we are already shipping you!)\nAXANAR VETERANS\nIf you donated at least $10 in our first Kickstarter (or Backerkit), and you donate at least $10 in this Kickstarter in the first 5 days, you will get the Axanar Veteran patch for free!  (For those donating less than $35, please note shipping fee above.)  THANK YOU to our loyal donors!\nEvery time Team Axanar does a Kickstarter, for the Axanar feature or for another project, we will produce an Axanar Veterans patch featuring a different campaign in the Four Years War.\nAnd please join us on the Axanar Donors Forum on Facebook, where the Axanar team interacts with the donors who make Axanar possible.\nCORRECTIONS TO PERKS\nPlease note these corrections.\n$ 35 Level - Includes all of the perks up to $ 35 as well.\n$ 50 Level - Includes all of the perks up to $ 50 as well.\nAll levels over $ 75 that include all perks up to $ 75, include EITHER a DVD or Blu Ray, not both.\n\n$ 10,000 Level - expanded the time frame of your participation and the choice is now yours as to how much you would like to participate -- be a member of the crew for a day, a week, or the entire length of the shoot!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges when making a film - actors dropping out, locations and/or sets not available, unforeseen costs, equipment trouble, etc. In addition, \"Star Trek\" is a licensed property of CBS and so they have the final say in any Star Trek venture.

CARL PREDICTS CROWDFUNDING\nUPDATE #2: NEW REWARD TIERS, GET ANIMATED, 50K!\nUPDATE #1: HELP MAKE CARL'S DREAM A REALITY!\n*****\nORIGINAL STORY:\nIn 1985, the animated series known as Robotech hit the airwaves in the United States and became an overnight sensation. Combining fast-paced giant robot action with some genuinely mature drama, it was a breath of fresh air for many children who had gotten tired of the usual cartoons on TV at the time. For many fans, it was their first exposure to Japanese anime, and is often credited with starting the anime industry in the US. It spawned over twenty novels, hundreds of comics, video games and dozens of home video releases all over the world.\nCarl Macek, the producer of Robotech, was recently working with Harmony Gold on Robotech: Academy. This new series set in the Robotech universe follows several new cadets in their adventures around the universe. We are reaching out to our fans to make this a reality!\n Robotech Academy occurs concurrently with the unfinished Sentinels storyline of the Robotech saga. By this time, the Earth has been ravaged by decades of interplanetary war. \nThe Robotech Expeditionary Force, commanded by Admiral Rick Hunter aboard the SDF-3, has departed for the homeward of the Robotech Masters, to draw the battle away from Earth. \nThe officers of the Expeditionary Force have placed their greatest treasures, their children, in the Robotech Academy. Based on a moon in orbit around Mars, the academy was created as a safe haven for these young cadets. \nHowever, as the Academy also functions as a research center for advanced Robotechnology, it becomes an inviting target. The story focuses on a fresh class of young characters, including child prodigy Wally, and the swashbuckling teen pilot Lindsay, who is an old rival and associate of Jack Baker. \nTheir lives are turned upside down when the Academy is attacked by alien fanatics who call themselves the Children of Zor, trying to reclaim the lost secrets of Robotechnology, which they believe to be rightfully theirs.  Unbeknownst to the new class, this treasure trove of Robotechnology just happens to be hidden right under everybody's noses throughout the Academy, in places such as the campus museum. \nIn an unexpected maneuver that saves the lives of the young student body, an experimental spacefold drive is activated, which suddenly transports the cadets away from the battle. \nHowever, they end up in an uncharted, distant region of the galaxy, and their supply of \"protoculture\" which is used to power the spacefold drive, is extremely limited. \nValuable clues to lead them out of their predicament have been left behind by none other than the originator of Robotechnology itself, Zor. They discover the path that Zor's ship once had taken before it eventually crashed on Planet Earth. This next generation of heroes must rise to the challenge, facing mysterious aliens and making difficult choices as they rely on their wits. They have to scavenge prototype mecha hidden across the campus and journey past a series of alien worlds to find their way back home, or at least rendezvous with the Robotech Expeditionary Force.\nAnd you'll also see familiar faces from the Robotech leadership, such as Rolf Emerson, Anatole Leonard, Doctor Lang, and... \nThe Robotech Academy Kickstarter will allow us to gauge how much of a new Robotech series we could actually produce based on Carl's original premise. We are setting our initial goal at $500,000 which will allow us to create an entire 24 minute pilot episode. This will help us cover character design, mecha design, 3D modeling, 3D animation, 2D animation, screenwriting, sound engineering, music composition, casting, voice acting and recording. This will also afford us a foundation on which to build future episodes.\nThanks to new technological advances, we're able to get our fans involved in ways Carl had only dreamed about before. Back in the 90's Carl Macek mused that the internet could be used to raise funds for new shows. Now with Kickstarter we're able to offer rewards such as attending a premiere of Robotech Academy, attending recording sessions with the actors, and even having your likeness animated and appear in the final footage! For anyone who wanted to be an anime character, now's your chance!\n UPDATE: WE HAVE ADD-ONS!\nWe're looking forward to working on Robotech Academy with contributions from you, our fans!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any production, we are assuming the usual risks with a Kickstarter project like this.

And his mind may be following.\nFrom a production test for Giant Sloth\nTHANK YOU/ OUR NEW GOALS!\nTHANK YOU TO ALL GIANT SLOTH BACKERS!!! We Reached our goal in just 8 days! So we're going to keep going in the spirit of the initial goal: to make truly independent work and make it as weird and smart as we want.\nOUR NEW GOAL IS $50,000! But what will we do with that?\nThe end of GIANT SLOTH leaves a lot of cliffhangers and questions unanswered. It begs for Gordon's world to be explored further. So we're going further! With your help we're going to make a SECOND SHORT FILM!!! (titled BENCHLEY MORNINGS) that will be even stranger than GIANT SLOTH! If Gordon is losing his mind in GIANT SLOTH, then get ready for BENCHLEY MORNINGS!\nAdditionally if we reach this new goal, BOTH films will have international subtitles, and we'll be able to afford to get this submitted to around three times the festivals (those submission fees add up fast)!\nTHERE ARE PLENTY OF NEW REWARDS ALONG THE WAY:\n$27,500: POSTCARDS FROM THE BENCHLEY All backers at $40 or more will automatically receive a postcard set adorned with exhibits from The Benchley Museum of Cultural and Natural History\n$30,000: THE MUSEUM CATALOG EBOOK: All backers at $15 or more will receive a copy of \"The Benchley Permanent Collection\" eBook, edited by Gordon Boonewell, detailing the history of some of the bizarre antiquities housed in The Benchley Museum.\n$32,500: ANIMATED BLOOPER REEL: All backers at $15 or more will receive the animated blooper reel, featuring outtakes, probably plenty of cursing, and general improvisational goodness you've come to expect from the amazing people on this amazing cast!\n$37,500: \"DESTROY THE PAST\" ANIMATED \"TED\" TALK: All backers at $15 or more will get another mini animation starring terrible boss Roman Nichols (voiced by Robert Popper) as he gives a defense for destroying the old Benchley museum. He's awful. We love him.\n$40,000: THE GIANT SLOTH FIGURINE: (SEE UPDATE #11) This will be a super limited edition figurine that we'll only be making if we reach $40,000. And it will be only go out to backers at $100 or more.\n\n$50,000: BENCHLEY MORNINGS! An entire other short? Yes! We dive deeper into the Benchley Museum, its dusty world, and the quickly disintegrating life of Gordon Boonewell!\nORIGINS\nDarker, stranger, and more introspective than most studios would ever allow, GIANT SLOTH is exactly the kind of animation I've been wanting to make for the last couple years.\nWhen a creator pitches a project to Hollywood studio executives, the notes for projects like this always come back the same: make it broader. Bigger. Louder. Less \"smart\" (really... that's a note you get A LOT). The studio's hope is that those compromises equate to more potential viewers. But it's not what I want to watch. Or spend my time making.\nA studio has to have big, loud, broad appeal to cover their massive overhead. But a small creative team with a dedicated group of supporters... we can make whatever we want. And make it truly great.\nWith that in mind, I wrote GIANT SLOTH. And the talent that has signed on to work on this project has been nothing short of amazing. Every person in the cast and crew of this film is a creative force unto themselves. To have them all working together? (Insert emoji of mind being blown.)\nUncompromised by the studio process, GIANT SLOTH combines the psychologically rich world of literary graphic novels with the all the possibilities of motion and sound that animation allows. It treats its characters not as clowns shuffling for an easy laugh, but as people.\nAnd as giant sloths. Giant sloths are people too.\nThe titular Giant Sloth, a dusty relic of things as they were in Gordon's life.\nTHE STORY\nGIANT SLOTH is a surrealist tale drawing as much on influences like Fellini and (the main character's namesake) Luis Bu\u00f1uel as it does animation from the 1960s and 70s. Sprinkle those worlds with my love for underground museums and fictitious histories, and you've arrived at GIANT SLOTH.\nThe museum where Gordon Boonewell works - The Benchley Museum of Cultural and Natural History - has fallen on hard times. Attendance is down and they've been in the red for ages. So it's no surprise when the museum privatizes... no surprise to anyone other than Gordon.\nBut Gordon is a curator of the past, a man set in his ways. Ways that are being systematically erased, dumping him into a world he's willfully ignored. Unable to cope with the upheaval alone, Gordon begins to suffer hallucinations. Or at least he hopes they're hallucinations...\nCharacter designs for Giant Sloth\nHis only friend at the museum quits and his new boss is a Brit with a holier-than-thou attitude and nothing but disdain for Gordon's dusty world. Gordon is miserable. But at least he has his wife.\nUntil he gets home and discovers that his wife is leaving him.\nThat's when Gordon starts hearing voices.\nGordon is having conversations with things that can't possibly exist, and bungling interactions in real life. From fantasizing about a new manager as a giantess to imagining killing his boss with an iPad, to (maybe really?) being involved in some crimes and questionable sex acts, Gordon is having a harder and harder time keeping fantasy separated from reality.\nBut maybe, in the end, that's not such a bad thing.\nExhibits from The Benchley Museum of Cultural and Natural History.\nMY BACKGROUND/OTHER ANIMATION\nMy books (published by Fantagraphics and Random House)\nAfter years concentrating solely on comics (self-publishing my first comics in 1999 and moving on to being published by Dark Horse, Fantagraphics, and Marvel, among others), I began branching out into developing projects for television and film. I've done a handful of animated projects, including the title sequence for Comedy Bang! Bang! (below), but GIANT SLOTH will be the first longer-form animated project that I will write and direct from start to finish.\nI've been developing, planning, and casting this project for over a year, and with your help I can cross the finish line and bring this weird world to squirming, uncomfortable reality.\nSome past animations to assure you this project isn't crazy talk:\nComedy Bang! Bang! opening credits:\nA sampling of my animated monologues, Forlorn TV:\nA production test (Ava and Joe)\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nPaul Hornschemeier | Writer, Director, Producer, Animator\nArtist and author Paul Hornschemeier is the author of the graphic novels Mother, Come Home, The Three Paradoxes, and the New York Times Bestselling Life with Mr. Dangerous.

This will also be available for the download option, but that may be a separate file from the non-subtitled file. (I'm looking into formatting options for that.)\nRegarding foreign subtitles: I'm currently looking into translations/subtitles for other languages as well, but as that will require bringing on board people to do translations, and wasn't budgeted into the original goal, that will probably need to be a stretch goal.\nFor the $1000 \u201cYOU OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES\u201d reward, will I be speaking, or is it just my likeness?\nIf you want to do the voice too (there's no pressure to do that if you'd rather not), we could work that into a scene. There will be a lot of opportunities for that throughout the film. To keep expectations realistic: it would only be a line or two, but as they say, there are no small parts... and obviously you would be credited in the film for your part, no matter how few lines you have.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRecording in various cities and working with/around everyone's busy schedules, there are sure to be bumps along the road of making this film. While this is a small crew compared to the number of people working on a studio project, it still takes time away from people's other projects, their families, and their (all too rare) free time.\n\nBut with modern technology being what it is, it's amazingly easy to do things remotely, to create and direct pieces of animation and sound while not in the same city (or country) as your collaborator. And fortunately, with years of experience on projects of all sizes in independent media, everyone on the team is used to making things happen for less, with less time.\n\nI'm confident that this creative team can rise to any challenge and make an amazing film the way we want it to be made.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Continued Seclusion, Progress: the Giant Sloth trailer", "update_content": "It's yet again been a few months since I've posted.

It will feel a bit like the board game Escape: The Curse of the Temple. I\u2019m also inspired by Spelunky, Escape the Room-style games, Indiana Jones and TV game shows from my childhood The Crystal Maze and Knightmare.\nShipshape is a single-player game for phones and tablets about exploring a quirky galaxy in a spaceship that you snap together from modular components. It\u2019s designed to be easy to play with simple gestures.

Over one million people have already downloaded Spaceteam. They could be activating the Chen Flushclamp or the Johnson Hyperspigot.

I worked as a programmer in the game industry for 10 years, at BioWare and Irrational Games, on games like Dragon Age: Origins, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 before quitting my job in 2012 to start my own adventure. I specialize in UI (user interface) but I love playing with all aspects of game design. I also love board games and they\u2019ve been inspiring a lot of my ideas lately.\nI share my experiences as an indie developer on my blog.\nI really hope the philosophy behind the campaign makes sense to you too and that together we can make it work\u2026\n...as a spaceteam!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project is structured to minimize risk by giving me the freedom to make smart decisions about my work and pursue opportunities that might come up. I can't predict exactly how much time or money a specific game will take, but I *can* predict how much money I need to live on for a year. I'm actually expecting the contents of the year to shift slightly during the flight...\n\nThe schedule may change for exciting reasons, eg. to support a special Spaceteam event, or to accommodate a small collaborative project that seems cool. Or, I may have underestimated how much time Blabyrinth will take, but Spaceteam has taught me some valuable lessons about project scope and I plan to reuse most of the Spaceteam networking code, which will save time since it's the most difficult part of a game like this.\n\nWhatever happens, I'll be sure to share it with you and it will all be documented in my Developer Diary.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "I'm Still Here!", "update_content": "My silence on this blog has been unprecedented, but that seems to be true of so many things in the world right now so I hope you'll forgive me.

We just had to share it!\nI always find myself fiddling, playing or staring at something, I find that inspiration comes from the most random of moments.\nEveryone loves a toy that they can interact with, control or simply get lost in its motions, I think that\u2019s why everyone has owned a slinky at some point in their life. Some of the best ideas have come from playing with a slinky, including this one (of course!) lol\nIf you would describe yourself as a day dreamer and are always thinking of a new idea or project to undertake\u2026 then you'll appreciate the awesomeness of this project. \nThat is why we want to aid the creative thinkers and the entrepreneur's of the world, because what\u2019s better than a machine which blends science, art and slinky\u2019s?\nI\u2019ve always had a slinky on my desk at work, to bend, stretch and occupy my hands in the presence of a problem. One day I was working on another project whilst playing with the slinky in my hands. The idea hit me, what if I could design a small, compact \u201cNever Ending Slinky Machine\u201d, something that occupies your hands and eyes whilst your brain wanders, imagines, dreams.\nI was amazed at the story behind the Slinky and how it was born over 70 years ago, which involved education, physics, NASA and even the movies.\nFounded in 1943 by Naval Engineer Richard James, and his wife Betty, the Slinky made its successful debut into the market in late 1945. The Slinky carried on its successes until 1998, when the company was sold to \u2018Poof Toys\u2019.\nOver the years the slinky saw a catchy jingle and several successful advertisement campaigns, some of which can be seen below.\nNot Just a Toy\nNASA used the Slinky to conduct zero gravity experiments whilst in space.\nU.S Troops in Vietnam used the Slinky to replace there broken radio antennae\u2019s.\nUsed as a teaching aid in classroom to show effects on gravity and waves.\nAnd let's not forget the sheer simplicity of watching your Slinky walk down the stairs.\nThe design brief was simple.... \nTo be a standalone beautifully crafted object in its own right\nTo be powered by USB ports\nTo be enjoyed by adults or kids\nTo become a contemporary art piece for the modern office.\nTo provide you with those momentary distractions from everyday boredom.\nProject NESM was born almost a year ago now and what started off as a bit of a fun project on the side, soon became an obsession for everyone involved as it was a lot more challenging than first thought; probably why it hasn't been done before.\nPrototyping Project NESM was particularly troublesome, as our first task was considering all the variables involved with making a slinky walk continuously in one spot (harder than you think), some of the variables include:\n\u00b7What is the distance between each step?  \n\u00b7What angle does it walk most efficiently?\n\u00b7At what metre/min does it walk? \n\u00b7Keeping the Slinky Walking Straight? \nOf course we\u2019re not going to give you the exact slinky walking formula (that would be like giving away our secret sauce recipe), but we will give you an insight into the construction process of Project NESM, because we want to keep all our beloved Kickstarter backer\u2019s informed.\nAfter the slinky walking formula was collected we spent countless hours on prototype designs and variations on those designs, we felt that one stood above the rest. With a sloped Super Flex conveyor belt set at a certain angle this prototype proved to be both functional and efficient in its primary purpose of allowing a slinky to walk on a continuous spot, whilst also maintaining a design element that was aesthetically pleasing.  \nAvailable in 3 different finishes.\nHow is it Made?\nIn order to construct this prototype we have used some of the most cutting edge materials and techniques including the latest Aluminium Composite for the body and internal structure, using three awesome finishes of Sand blasted Aluminium, White and Black. Custom made rollers, shafts and brackets with 4 shallow groove bearings, then fitted with a silent running motor and gearbox, USB Cable and speed controller. Rubber Drive belt, Super Flex conveyor belt, and finishing it off with all Stainless Fastenings. \nAlthough this is a well-engineered product with a vast number of component parts we have managed to keep the unit costs as low as possible. \nWe know you love to be creative, that's why we offer all our Kickstarter backer's the exclusive chance to purchase your Project NESM in a Build Your Own Kit form, the perfect way to let your creative juices flow. The ideal present for birthday's, Christmas or if you just want to treat yourself. \nThe Build Your Own Kit is available as an 'Add On' for only \u00a35 extra (approx $8), and comes with all components, tools and a DVD containing full instructions.\n As Project NESM is such a great looking feature on your desk (or coffee table), why not add that extra personalized touch for only \u00a310 extra (or approx $16).  \nCustom Laser Engraving is available on all models and can be anything from a message of your choice to a company logo. All message's and logo's need to fit within a business card sized area (85mm X 55mm). You will be contacted at the end of the project to confirm design. \nEvery one wants the best or most unique product on the market, that's why we are offering you a Champion Edition at only \u00a359 (approx $99 USD) for a September delivery or \u00a365 (approx $109 USD) for a November delivery...  This unique version of the NESM will only be available during project launch and comes in two stunning finishes: brushed stainless steel or brushed gold. \nEach Champion Edition will come complete in your chosen finish and will have a unique serial number which proves its originality. The serial number is representative of print order. This edition is a one-off opportunity own a totally unique piece or art which is fun, mesmerizing and tough! \n *Limited quantities of September delivery available, first come first serve. \nTwo shipments of the product will take place \u2013 one in September, one in November, which means each NESM be in backers\u2019 hands just in time to give someone an incredibly cool Christmas gift!\n I bet all you engineers and avid science fans didn't know the rules that govern the mechanics of a Slinky are due to Hooke's Law and the effects of gravitation. \nPeriod of oscillation\nDue to simple harmonic motion the period of oscillation of a dangling slinky is:\nWhere T is the time of the period of oscillation, m is the mass of the slinky and k is the spring constant of the slinky.\nEquilibrium\nIn the state of equilibrium of a slinky, all net force is cancelled throughout the entire slinky. This results in a stationary slinky with zero velocity. As the positions of each part of the slinky is governed by the slinky's mass, the force of gravity and the spring constant, various other properties of the slinky may be induced. The length of a perfect slinky with zero length when extended is:\nWhere L is the length of the slinky, W is the weight of the slinky, and k is the spring constant of the slinky.\nDue to the forces of gravity, the slinky appears bunched up towards the bottom end, as the function of the position of a slinky is:\nWhere n is the dimensionless variable ranging from 0 to 1, 0 being the top and 1 being the bottom of the slinky, and each number between is the percentage of the slinky's mass above point n, and p(n) gives the position that n is in below the top of the slinky.\nThis quadratic equation means that rather than the center of mass being at the middle of the slinky, it lies two thirds of the length down, closer to the bottom end.\nProject NESM is the brainchild of an ambitious team of UK designers & engineers, of which you can see below. All funds raised with Project NESM will go towards manufacturing and distribution of all NESM's and will help to accelerate the making of great projects. \nOur long-term vision is to keep inventing, making and providing solutions to everyday problems. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven the most meticulously planned projects can take a turn for the worse, but our experienced Creatables team was on hand to minimize these risks and challenges where ever possible, by considering every outcome. The most important thing for us is to control these risks and challenges by remaining very transparent throughout the entire project. If there are any problems or delays, we will communicate this to our audience straight away. \n\nThe biggest challenge for us was not the prototyping stage, but contemplating the production lead time. The delivery times set are staggered in two different dates to allow us sufficient time for delivery of NESM units, one batch will arrive in September 2014 for all 24hour specials, Early Birds and Original Plus \u2013 whilst the remaining batch will be received in November 2014 ready in time for Christmas! \n\nIn order for us to guarantee your Project NESM to you by Christmas at an affordable price, we need to be running fairly large volumes with very little wastage (as we expect a large number of units going out).

Let's do this thing!\nIn today's world, programming is becoming one of the most important skills for students and professionals to have. And programming isn't just for programmers - even for designers like myself, knowing how to program is almost a requirement to keep up with the tools we use and build every day.\nAlready, countries like England, Finland, and Estonia have made programming part of the core curriculum for elementary school students, and in the past year alone, incredible tools have been built (and funded by platforms like Kickstarter!) to help teach very young children how to think like programmers.\nI wanted to pick up where those tools left off, and create a crazy fun, family-friendly board game that could help kids ages 8 and up learn real programming concepts used by real programmers. Enter Code Monkey Island!\nBecause board games bring families together, and because learning together is the best way to learn! I wanted to create an experience that kids, parents, and grandparents could share, and in the process allow children to exercise their immense learning capabilities through play.\nWhat is Code Monkey Island?\nCode Monkey Island is a board game designed for families. It takes about a minute to learn the rules and 45 minutes to play, and exposes kids to fundamental programming concepts like control structures, data structures, Boolean logic and operators, and assignment and mathematical operations.\nThose sound\u2026complicated\u2026 \nWhat I realized almost immediately while prototyping and testing this game was that kids are way, way smarter than we give them credit for. Code Monkey Island presents seemingly complex concepts in a way that kids and adults can effortlessly apply, within minutes of playing!\nWill my kids be able to write their first program after playing?\nCode Monkey Island doesn't teach kids how to write programs - rather, it helps them master the logic constructs that are used in virtually every program that's ever been written. Familiarizing kids with these concepts at such a young age will be hugely helpful as they go on to learn real programming languages in school!\nWhat's your story?\nI'm a designer and developer from New York City. I studied computer science and recorded music at NYU, and for the past year I've been working as an interaction designer for an awesome startup. Once the idea for Code Monkey Island popped into my head, I knew I had to give it everything I had to make it a reality.\n The Basics \nStep 1: Each player chooses their favorite tribe of monkeys, and sets them down in the corresponding Start Circle.\nStep 2: Everyone is dealt 3 Rule cards.\nStep 3: On their turn, a player draws 1 Rule card, and plays another card from their hand to move their monkeys forward.\nStep 4: The first player to get all 3 of their monkeys around the island and into the banana grove wins!\nThe Monkeys \nThere are 12 plastic monkey figurines in total: 3 red, 3 blue, 3 green, and 3 yellow. Each player becomes the wise leader of their own tribe of monkeys, and it's their job to guide them safely around the island!\nRule Cards\nPlayers use Rule cards to move their monkeys forward based on the position of the other monkeys on the board. There are two basic types of Rule cards: Check and Count.\nCheck cards present the player with a conditional statement - if that conditional statement is true, then they get to move forward!\nCount cards ask the player to see how many times the condition on the card is true, then to move forward: for each time the condition is true, while the condition is true, or until the condition is true.\nThe Board\nThe board is a 20\"x20\" island, made up of different types of geography and wildlife. There are 3 types of normal tiles (tree, vine, and rock), and 3 types of special squares (fruit, quicksand, and animals).\nPlayers must race their monkeys around the island and up their tribe's color-coded paths and into the banana grove.\nQuicksand\nWhen a monkey lands in quicksand, it becomes stuck for 1 round! Players must move their monkeys strategically to avoid these traps.\nAnimal Friends\nThere are plenty of animal friends along the path to the banana grove who can give you boosts! When one of your monkeys lands on an animal tile, draw an animal card, and then set it down in front of you. The card will show a number, which the animal tile will \"store\" for you (and only you!). The next time one of your monkeys lands on that same animal tile, your animal buddy will give you a boost equal to the number it's been assigned!\nFruits\nWhen a player lands on a fruit square, they get to draw a fruit card! They can either play it immediately or save it for later. Fruit cards give players special boosts and bonuses!\nAll pledgers who donate more than $60 get a complimentary pack of the Super Fruits Mini Game! This fast-paced mini game introduces kids ages 8 and up to the basics of data structures. And since each round takes less than a minute, you can play for as long as you like! Play a few rounds between longer gaming sessions, or make a night out of it and see who can score the most points.\nThe Great Monkey King calls for tribute, and it's up to the wise leaders of Code Monkey Island to fulfill his extravagant requests. Each player must carefully manage their fruit stores, and must understand how fruits are added and taken out to give the King what he demands - and in the order he demands it! Fruits are added and removed from the player's reserves continuously, so they must be careful not to let their stores overflow and rot, or else the King will punish them for their wastefulness!\nThe player who uses the least amount of fruit trying to match the King's sequence is the winner. In the process, they'll have learned the difference between the way that data flows in and out of stacks and queues and the importance of avoiding stack overflow.\nFive new fruits are discovered in this game, including tart pomegranates, creamy avocados, refreshing kiwanos, delicious lychees, and sweet kiwis!\nPackaging/Delivery\nThe Super Fruits Mini Game consists of 60 exotic fruit cards and 20 tribute cards. It will be individually packaged and shipped along with your copy of Code Monkey Island!\nWhen I started thinking about how to design an educational game for kids, I quickly realized that trying to cram everything related to programming into a single game was impossible.\nInstead, I decided to group concepts together into separate games tailored to specific age ranges. Code Monkey Island introduces kids to the fundamentals of programming logic, which are shared across all modern programming languages:\nConditional Statements \nTogether with loops, conditional statements form the foundations of programming control structures. With Check cards, kids learn how to employ if/then and if/else statements to achieve one of several outcomes.\nLooping\nAnother one of the foundations of control structures, loops allow programmers to perform the same action multiple times without having to do extra work! With Count cards, kids learn basic looping such as: for, while, and until loops.\nBoolean Logic\nCode Monkey Island relies on players deciding whether something is true or false, and experiencing different outcomes in each case. Boolean Logic is a simple but incredibly important concept for programmers!\nBoolean Operators\nKnowing the difference between \u201cWhen x is true AND when y is true\u201d, \u201cWhen x is true OR y is true\u201d, and \u201cWhen x is NOT true\u201d is a hugely important logical hurdle to leap. Code Monkey Island makes it child\u2019s play!\nAssignment\nCode Monkey Island frequently asks players to assign different values and states to a variety of objects, and then to hold and eventually call that value at the appropriate time.\nData Structures\nIn the Kickstarter-exclusive Super Fruits mini game, kids learn the difference between the stack and the queue, how to add and remove elements from each, and the importance of avoiding stack overflow!\nHere's a (hopefully thorough!) explanation of each rewards tier - if anything is left unclear, please leave a message in the comments section and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!\n$30 - Tropical Early Bird\nThe early bird gets the game - and for $10 off retail!

That appeals.\u201d - Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"It's a colourful, eye-catching and visually charming game with a story mode (like a normal RPG) and survival mode (permadeath).\u201d - EuroGamer\n\"Dragon Fin Soup uses sex, violence, and a sense of humor to create an RPG that even non-questers will enjoy.\u201d - Busy Gamer Nation\nWatch our Kickstarter video in 1080p HERE!\n     Grimm Bros is proud to present Dragon Fin Soup.  A Tactical Action RPG with roguelike elements set in a charming, twisted, dark, fairy tale inspired world featuring a 2D top down camera and fluid turn-based movement that allows you to set the pace.\nThe World of Dragon Fin Soup is set on the back of a giant dragon-turtle god called Asura who swims the multiverse of space-time.  The player can choose to unravel the tale of your chosen character in Story Mode or embark on a journey to discover the wilds of Asura in Survival Mode.\nStory Mode\nStory Mode is designed to focus on storytelling, character progression and exploration. The game begins in a small country village where you slowly learn about the mysteries of the world of Asura. You will encountering a custom blend of procedural content, scripted events, crafted story quests and procedurally generated missions.  The World Map of Asura and Save/Load options will be available to you.\nSurvival Mode\nSurvival Mode is designed for the thrills and terrors that come with exploring the wilds of Asura, fighting challenging monsters, and surviving to achieve the highest score in single life. The game begins in a forest at level 1 with limited supplies. You will encounter waves of procedurally generated dungeons filled with traps, monsters, and mini-games that grow in increasing difficult over time.  Tread carefully Save/Load options are available but death is permanent.\nA key defining aspect to Dragon Fin Soup is our fluid turn-based gameplay. Typically turn based games are slow and discontinuous.  However in Dragon Fin Soup our movement, combat and controls have been streamlined to empower you to set your own pace.  At any time you can choose to speed-up to rapidly progress and fight swift battles or slow-down to calculate your next move and assess each encounter.\nDragon Fin Soup will appeal to core gamers looking for deep rich tactical experience and RPG fans who love dark twisted tales. \nInspired by classic fairy tales the world of Dragon Fin soup does not try to retell existing stories but is rather set in a brave new world of twisted adventures, magic and mysteries. Our first playable character in Dragon Fin Soup is Red Robin, a reimagined version of the classic Red Riding Hood character. Robin is a cheerful yet raging alcoholic that makes a living as a sword for hire and bounty hunter in a remote country village.\nA year ago Robin lost her memory but her dark bloody past has come back to haunt her with a vengeance. Slowly as Robin rediscovers herself she begins to remember the horrible events of her violent past, the death of her family, betrayal, and exile.  But there is much more to Robin's existence\u2026 As the story unfolds and with every twist in the plot the player is pulled deeper into a world of murder, conspiracies and magic.\nBeautiful HD World - The world of Dragon Fin Soup is charming, colorful, detailed and designed to look fantastic at multiple HD resolutions and screen sizes. \nCollectible Pet Familiars - You can have up to 2 pets familiars active at the same time. You will be able to collect a variety of pets each with their own stats and level that will grow while fighting at your side.\nCrafted Story Quests - Our story quests are carefully written and scripted to advance the unfolding tale of your character within the world of Asura.  No spoilers!\nDeep Tactical Combat - Combat features multiple tactical elements such as directional damage, various ranged attacks, melee, magic, DOT and AOA. The damage model features blunt, piercing and slashing damage types as well as elemental damage, projectile damage and defense.  You can perform Backstabs, sneak around and so on. Over 15 equipment slots and dual-wielding feature offer interesting choices of gear combinations. \nDynamically Generated World - The world of Asura is dynamically generated with a large numbers of prefabricated landmarks, scripted events and random gameplay elements.  Our dungeons features a wide range of compelling locations and layouts for you to explore such as Spider Forests, Ice Caves, Abandoned Mines, Scorching Deserts, Mushroom Forests, Haunted Mansions, Castles, Ancient Ruins and much much more.\nExtensive Crafting - Loot everywhere! While cutting down foes and trees, digging and exploring you will find gazillions of items that can be used to craft new gear, food, magic potions and what not!\nFluid Turn based Gameplay - Streamlined controls, movement and combat allow for you to set your own pace of progression.  Choose to speed-up to quickly move and strike or slow-down to carefully plan your next move. \nHigh Accessibility - We designed fun and intuitive controls for your play style choice. Keyboard, Mouse, Keyboard + Mouse, Joypad, and Touch controls are all supported. \nInteractive Environment - In the world you can destroy, move or manipulate a wide range of props, trees, rocks, blocks, and chests.  Beware of trees falling over if you cut them down!\nMini Games & Puzzles - Tired of killing? Kick back and relax! Go fishing or pick up a shovel and dig some holes into the ground, who knows what you may find? There is much to do in DFS aside of spilling blood!

Instead we feature fairy tale inspired characters each with their own deep flaws, witty humor, abilities, and motivations. Our first tale begins with Red Robin, whose dark bloody past has come back to haunt her with a vengeance.\nUnpredictable Weather & Day/Night Cycles - Each time you visit or revisit a location a new kind of weather will be picked randomly.  Day and night cycles gradually progress the more game turns pass. Beware of dangerous monsters rumored to hunt during specific times!\n Once upon a time, twas a great Dragon Turtle god Asura swimming the vast cosmos of the multiverse.  Upon its back was born a world of magic and wonderment.\nOf the Asura realm ancient songs do tell of a great endless war lasting centuries between Man and Wesen, know as the Age of Fire.\nThe endless war threatened to extinguish all life on the Dragon Turtle god, until a heroic Human Princess sacrificed her life to protect her lover, a Wesen.  Her love moved the hearts of all across the Asura kingdoms. The Princess\u2019s heir, a bastard child, born of both Human-Wesen blood, eventually became the Emperor of all the kingdoms and his bloodline has ruled since this time.\nA thousand years passed until one day a burning rogue planet crossed paths with the Dragon Turtle god, filling the skies with blood red colors and raining down crystal shards.

We are fully funded the way we need to be to execute Prelude to Axanar and you have given us enough money to start working on the feature film Axanar as well!\nPrelude to Axanar is a short film that will give viewers a historical look at the events leading up to the Battle of Axanar, the central event of the film Axanar, to be filmed later this year.  Shot like a History Channel special, Prelude to Axanar will be Star Trek like you have never seen it before, showing the central characters of Axanar giving both a historical and personal account of the war.  How did Starfleet build its fleet?  How did they hold off a Klingon fleet that had been conquering star systems for centuries?  What role did the various founding planets play in Starfleet? Why were the Constitution class ships so important to Starfleet? How did Garth of Izar come to be regarded as the greatest Starfleet Captain of his time?\n\nThis Kickstarter is for Prelude to Axanar, which we will film at the beginning of May.  The Kickstarter for  Prelude will pay for the actors, the make-up, visual effects and actual filming costs. The resulting film will be about 20 minutes and also produce about half a dozen vignettes of the characters talking about different subjects.\n\nPrelude to Axanar will then allow us to launch into Axanar having proven our ability to deliver professional quality Star Trek.  There will be a subsequent Kickstarter for the feature-length \"Axanar\".\nThe Axanar team is determined to make the first true independent Star Trek film. \nTHE STARS OF PRELUDE TO AXANAR\nPrelude to Axanar features some well known actors portraying both new and familiar characters in the Star Trek universe.\nRichard Hatch as Kharn, the Klingon Supreme Commander\nMichael Hogan As Captain Robert April\nJG Hertzler as Captain Samuel Travis\nGary Graham as Soval, Vulcan Ambassador to the Federation\nTHE VISUAL EFFECTS OF AXANAR\nPrelude to Axanar has the amazing talents of Tobias Richter, one of the top Visual Effects artists in the world.  What you have seen in our videos is all Tobias and his crew.\nPLAY\n\nPERKS\nWe want to give you great perks for your donations.  And so we reviewed what other projects have done and did better. We hope you will enjoy the perks we offer.  And please stay tuned for special offers we will be unveiling during the 30 days of this Kickstarter.\nUSS Ares patch. Part of the $ 25 level.\nYou get a limited edition Soundtrack CD featuring the music of composer Alex Bornstein at the $ 35 level\nPrelude to Axanar DVD / Blu-Ray\nUSS Ares T-Shirt (Back)\nUSS Ares T-Shirt (Front)\nSTRETCH GOALS\nPrelude to Axanar has been hit almost all of our stretch goals!\n$ 15,000  Stretch Goal -  UNLOCKED Everyone who donates at least $ 10 gets an Ares Class Development Project Uniform Patch.\n$ 20,000  Stretch Goal -  UNLOCKED Everyone who donates gets an exclusive Juan Ortiz \"Axanar\" digital movie poster.  Those who donated $ 75 or more will get a printed 11\" x 17\" version to go with their original Juan Ortiz poster perk.\n$ 40,000 Stretch Goal  -  UNLOCKED  Everyone who has donated $ 10 or more will receive the Federation Historical Society Vinyl sticker.\n$ 50,000 Stretch Goal  -  UNLOCKED  Everyone who has donated $ 10 or more will receive the \"First to the Fight\" Starfleet fleet patch.\n(Please note, for those donating at $ 20 or less, there is a small shipping fee since otherwise we are not shipping anything to you as everything is digital.  All other levels we will just put these stretch goal perks in what we are already shipping you!)\nAres Class Development Patch\nPlease note that for all levels below $ 25, there will be a small shipping charge for all stretch goal perks.\nWHERE THE MONEY GOES\nFirst, understand that generally, you get about 70% of the total money raised. 10% goes to Kickstarter and Amazon payment processing fees. Another 10% we have budgeted for Perks (the gifts you earn at different donation levels). And there is generally a 10% drop out rate (which we hope is way less!). So basically we get 70% to spend on Prelude to Axanar.\nThe budget for Prelude to Axanar was about $ 20,000. But thanks to all your donations, we have doubled that to $ 40,000, allowing us to do everything better and more professionally.  We set the Kickstarter bar low at $ 10,000 as we really didn't know what kind of response we would get. We could have gotten Prelude done for $ 10,000, but it would have meant deferring payment to our VFX team and others, who graciously offered to work and take payment after the main Kickstarter if needed. So now we don't have to do that, or cut any corners. So the first $ 40,000 goes to Prelude. So to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000 (remember we only get 70%), which we have done.\nWhat does that pay for? Well, first we need about $ 10,000 for make up. That is because we need to get all the initial design, sculpting and production of Richard Hatch's Klingon hair and make-up and Gary Graham's hair and make-up done up front. The good news is that money doesn't then need to be spent in Axanar. We have Make Up Effects Lab, the guys who actually worked on Star Trek since the beginning of TNG working with us, so you know we are getting the best.\nWe also need about $ 10,000 to pay the actors and their expenses (Michael Hogan and JG Hertzler do not live in LA). When you get such amazing actors as we have gotten, you have to pay them because this is how they make a living. And we want them very invested in our project and to go above and beyond. For example, Richard Hatch (who is also my acting coach) has opened up his Tuesday acting class to our production to do rehearsals and scene work in class. That is an amazing opportunity. Gary Graham said he was going to come by to work with the other actors in the class. So if you want these professionals to be invested in your production, you need to invest in them.  We have expanded our cast thanks to this Kickstarter.\nThen, there is the Visual Effects. That is $7,500 right now. That leaves $12,500 for the shoot itself. All those numbers are pretty accurate, but you never know what pops up.  So it is nice to have a cushion.\nSo again, to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000. And thank you all for helping us reach that!\nLimited Edition Starfleet Procurement Patch available ONLY to donors!\nSo what about what we raise above that? Well, first it will be nice to have a cushion in case we experience any cost overruns.  But mostly, anything above the $ 57,000 or so will go into our Axanar infrastructure.  So here is where that money goes:\nInfrastructure   -  We are spending $ 10,000 to fund the infrastructure of Axanar Productions. This means the legal paperwork needed to create our production company and the rather expensive insurance to cover all our productions over the coming year. It allows us to set up production offices (We have gotten the space for free in some amazing offices here in Los Angeles) and start to produce Axanar.\nStarfleet Tunics  -  $ 10,000 allows us to fund the Starfleet costumes for Axanar. We have retained the services of the company that produces the TOS tunic replicas for Anovos, so you know these tunics will be top quality. With a large cast, and needing to custom manufacture top quality costumes in quantity, we need to do it right.  Making the Starfleet tunics will actually take 90 days from beginning to end.\nVFX - $ 10,000 goes to start paying Tobias Richter and his team for the work they are doing on Axanar.  Tobias has already started putting out some amazing work and has spent days and days honing the look of the 3D ship models.\nUSS Ares\nSo there you go!   That is where your money is going.  Rest assured that whatever money we raise will go towards bringing you the Star Trek you all want to see.

This has been a year in the making and we are finally here. I love what I do, and I bring all of my passions together to create an amazing experience for all my customers. \nIt's not only a disco burger joint but a digital hub of activity. We love the Silicon Roundabout community in Shoreditch, we love tech and the start up revolution, we accept Crypto currency as payment as well as paper money and we want to use our space to grow this community. Where Dogecoin can be tipped via twitter to feed the homeless or Bitcoin paid by shaking a live wireless dongle made by a dude down the road... Cryptohub, BurgerHack, DiscoJoint! We want it!\nI am rubbish at writing mind... So what better way to tell you about me and my good times burger joint than getting a customer to do it for me.  Love Tom x\nThis bit of text by Christopher Clark, Burger Bear customer:\nFor those of you that don\u2019t know Burger Bear \u2013 WHAT! You don\u2019t know Burger Bear?! Well, let\u2019s just say that Tom Reaney, the uber friendly creator of one of London\u2019s most original, most beautiful burgers, the Bear behind the Bacon Jam is going big. \nSo why have you simply got to back this project? (Forget about the insane rewards for a moment) Well, first things first, do it for the burger! Cooked in a space-helmet. Smothered in Bacon Jam. Dripping with tender eat-me genius. Massaged with Disco. Crowned with prizes \u2013 the EatMeUp Burger Trophy, a Golden Patty award, now through four rounds and a front-runner for the London Burger Bash. \nThere are burgers and there are burgers. In the view of a humble regular and burger addict, Burger Bear is the last word.\nBurger Bear's Golden Patty award winning Black Forest Bear @BurgerMonday's London Burger Bash\nOh yeah, the project! Like all great things in life, it\u2019s simple and it\u2019s completely nuts: a burger joint in a double-decker shipping container, right bang where Shoreditch needs an electric shock. Expect panoramic views of Red Market and its street art from the glass-walled overhanging upper container. The vibe? Down and dirty street food, as ever. You can still take away like the good old days. And if you care to linger - downstairs or up - it\u2019s a high-stalled, neon-lined, diner-style PARADISE! (the Burger Bear kind) \u2018Disco\u2019ll be pumping 24-7\u2019 he says. \u2018Love is the message\u2019 he says. Craft beer and cocktails will amplify that message.\nThe interior will be built largely from second hand, reclaimed materials, by volunteers, so it\u2019s as sustainable and cheap to do as feasibly possible. A lot of friends and family are about to kiss their weekends goodbye.\nNew menu designed by @DanWoodger will be featured at the new diner\nTom's friend's dad, a master carpenter, is helping with the design of the concept in return for free burgers (no one can resist them). When the time arrives to party outside, the side of the lower container swings up into an awning, creating an outdoor dining space. Crowning this ingenious structure \u2013 obviously - a gigantic spinning burger. \nAnd you might just be funding a blueprint for some of the most playful burger joints across the world. Melbourne is on the cards. The Pole\u2019s the limit.\nAnyone who has been to \u201cBurger Bear\u2019s Picnic\u201d in Peckham Palais - and slurped down Bacon Bourbons and Bacon Jam Martinis in a scented indoor forest - knows how mental this is going to be. \u201cOne day you might turn up at the container and it\u2019ll be a jungle!\u201d Tom tells me.\nBut the main reason to back this project is very simple. Burger Bear makes people smile. I mean, way before you\u2019ve eaten his food. The disco; the epic dancing; Tom\u2019s bounciness rain or shine (and always, always in a t-shirt); not to mention Horton Jupiter, Burger Bear\u2019s mysterious DJ/Pop-star assistant \u2013 it just makes everyone smile. It\u2019s superb. It\u2019s an experience. It\u2019s a blast of technicolour when you\u2019re feeling grey. And this project spreads a bear-size grin across my face. It\u2019s got to happen. And I for one am honoured to be part of it.\nWe love what we do... Can you tell?\nWhy we need \u00a330,000?\nWe need to grow if Burger Bear is to survive as a brand. We can't survive on the streets alone. Rather than looking for private investors, banks or similar we want to grow organically.\nWe need a little help from our friends to keep the Burger Bear vibe alive and we don't want anyone but our customers having any say in the way we run our business. \nThis gives us the chance to grow and you the chance to be part of something really special. A burger joint, a meeting place, a unique disco destination like no other.\nThe money will be invested in 2 used shipping containers and all that is needed to build the venue on the Shoreditch site. And we will need to buy quality kitchen equipment so it doesn't break in a month. Hoping for a custom iron griddle!! We are keeping everything to a minimum but feel that \u00a330k is the minimum amount needed to maximise potential.\n*Burger Bear is an established business and the money will all go to building the venue, design, logistics and not to the provision of food or any other part of our business.\nEmail: Burgerbeartom@gmail.com\nTwitter: @BurgerBearTom - #BuildBearHQ\nFacebook: FB.com/BurgerBearTom\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions or just want to know more about Burger Bear and our projects\nThis is how we might look if we get backed and can open our dream diner thanks to the amazing support and community of Kickstarter!

One of my best friends ever!\nThe 3 Beards - 3 guys who give a shit about community, especially the community in East London's tech centre, Shoreditch. No end of support from them since Burger Bear launched.\nRed Gallery - If it wasn't for the guys behind Red Gallery & Red Market, Burger Bear would not have this amazing opportunity to build a diner at all. Not to mention the continued support since we started out.\nSo many inspiring stories on Kickstarter and seeing some great people do great things has got me here too. Thanks to everyone who convinced me to do this. It's been a year of talking about it and here we are!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBurger Bear is, relatively speaking, a new business. However, I have 15 years experience in food, hospitality and events management, from which I bring valuable experience and expertise. In a short time, Burger Bear has gained a loyal and passionate regular customer base, with devotees often travelling across London and further for the food and experience. We know that Burger Bear has a significant following in East London, with trade at Red Market and other nearby spots very popular. In addition, we are lucky to have strong relationships with some very experienced food, business and design people, who are lending their expertise to us as we grow.\n\nAlthough it is secure at present and for the foreseeable future, we cannot guarantee that the Red Market site will be available to Burger Bear forever, so what will happen if we have to move? This is exactly why we have chosen to convert shipping containers, creating a mobile structure that can be moved to another site in the future, should the need arise. In fact, we have other potential sites with an interest in housing us already. We have done our research around the rules and regulations for a project like this, on the initial site or if it has to move.\n\nThere are quite a few burger joints in London and around the world. Why will we succeed? Recently, various media, charts and competitions have indicated that Burger Bear's popularity is on the increase, and we are seeing this reflected in business terms. We are creative, passionate and extremely hard-working. We feel that the Burger Bear experience; the combination of excellent food made from quality ingredients, and music served up with our infectious energy and fun; is unique in London. We work hard to set ourselves apart. In addition, my marketing skills and out-of-the-box thinking in terms of promotion ensure that Burger Bear is kept on the map. I won't let Burger Bear be forgotten and I seriously deliver when people come.\n\nWhat if customers lose interest or the 'burger bubble' bursts? I have consistently shown my creativity in terms of keeping the menu fresh and interesting, introducing specials alongside the firm favourites. At some events he is now serving a broader menu. With Burger Bear HQ being more than just a restaurant, there is scope to continue evolving the customer experience, not only with new and innovative menu items, but in terms of the overall experience and use of the space. Special events, like the legendary Peckham Palais forest, will now be able to happen in the diner, giving Burger Bear more creative control and reducing overheads.\n\nFinally, I may be good at what I do, but how can backers be sure that I will succeed in making this container diner thing a reality? I have spent two years doing research and building a team of people with the knowledge and expertise to support and guide him in the project. Some of these, like the master carpenter, will give their time for free. Others, like the architect, have been costed in. I recognise the need for people with the very specific skills needed to make this happen, from choice of materials, to the design, to the build itself. I hold the vision, but I know where I need specialists.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Project coming to a close", "update_content": "Hi all,\nBeen a while.

We are excited to extend the Brewbot community and put this technology into the hands of others. Check out our new rewards: Brewbot Core and Brewbot Core + Starter Kit\n-----\nGet ready to brew amazing beers at home, the office\u2026 anywhere. We've made it simple and with your support we can make it available to everyone.\nAt Brewbot, we are interested in the possibilities connected devices can offer and how this technology can influence the future of brewing to make it consistent, repeatable, and within the reaches of anybody.\nWhat is it?\nBrewbot is a smart brewing appliance that you can control and monitor with your smartphone. Never brewed? No problem. Our goal was to make an easy-to-use, controlled environment that is aesthetically pleasing, and frees up brewers to focus on the recipes. You don't need to know anything about brewing to get started. You are guided through the process from beginning to end.\nBrewbot in Bailey's Taproom, Portland.\nWhy did we build it?\nBrewing can be a complicated affair. The process can be daunting for anyone who is considering taking their passion for craft beer that little bit further. When we embarked on our journey into the world of brewing we made many costly mistakes. We found it could be laborious and time consuming \u2014 we were spending more time looking at timers and thermometers or fixing our setup than thinking about recipes and ingredients. \nWe noticed many of the inefficiencies and problems that can arise when brewing manually. With a lot of work, we were able to brew amazing beers, but they were often difficult to replicate. We saw an opportunity as designers and developers to use our skills to build a better way to brew and ultimately open up brewing to everyone.\nBrewing for everyone.\nIntelligent technology makes it easy to have consistently high quality craft beer at home, work or events. With Brewbot, you are the craft brewer; discovering new recipes, tweaking ingredients and experimenting with flavors. You can now have your very own brewery\u2026 and you are the master brewer.\nWe've been hard at work and, with your help, we are ready to take Brewbot into production. By supporting this project you'll be the first to get your hands on this smart brewing device.\nOur journey to date.\nWe've come a long way since first brainstorming this idea. \nExploring form.\n We approached this problem to design and engineer a simple solution. As brewers, we understood what we needed and as a result we have been able to build a product that not only works, but looks great too.\nMany other brewing setups take up large amounts of room. They are usually unappealing and often tucked away, out of sight. Our aim is to bring brewing out of the garage and into the home. \nRender of our pre-production design.\nAs most home-brewers typically do, we started our journey into brewing using plastic containers and pipes. As we iterated on our setup we were constantly optimizing and went from plastic containers to stainless steel. Because of the cost we used copper piping, but it is our aim to move to a stainless steel design.\nWe researched what was readily available in the catering industry and strived to use as many off-the-shelf components we could.\nUsing Arduino allowed us to rapidly prototype and iterate on different methods and configurations of software and hardware, giving us flexibility to focus on building Brewbot, and automating the brewing process. Arduino is a well-proven electronic prototyping platform and we were able to leverage the vast community and resources that it offers.\nPrototyping\nUsing our extensive knowledge in iOS we rapidly prototyped a manually controlled interface, iterating on the design and refining the steps. \nAn early iPad app for monitoring temperatures and times, and operating valves and pumps manually.\nOur current prototype uses copper piping but with your help we can use stainless steel with disconnects to help make Brewbot a cleaner system that lasts longer.\nWhere we're at now.\nBrewbot is beginning to come to life. We have built an amazing prototype and we're almost there. We know what we have to do and what we'd like to improve. On the software side, we are in the process of refining our user interface and adding features.\nWe are so passionate about this project that we have moved the whole team to Portland, Oregon as it is the micro-brewery capital of America. We are spending a month on the West Coast sourcing fabricators, materials and components to make Brewbot happen.\n  How does it work?\nThe whole process is pretty simple. Buy your ingredients from a local brew-shop or online, setup your recipe in the app and connect your iPhone to Brewbot.  \n\nCreate or choose a recipe to begin brewing. Tap \u2018Start Brew\u2019 to automatically add the exact amount of water to be heated. Once heated the valve in the container releases and the water runs into the mashtun, where the grain lies.\n\nAt the end of the process the wort filters through the plate cooler, cooling it from 100\u00b0C to under 22\u00b0C, now ready to ferment.\n\nWe have used stainless steel vessels as fermentation tanks. They are sealed and opaque as hops are light sensitive. Light (specifically UV rays) will skunk the beer and produce off-flavors.\n\nStackable fermentation tank, branded for XOXO conference\nBrewbot demo video:\nA video demonstrating water flow around the system, heating, and temperature sensing with feedback during the process.\nPrototype technical specification:\nDimensions: 121cm x 40cm x 119cm\nWeight: ~100 kg\nBoiler Output: 2000 Watts\nBrew Size: 20 Litres/5.2 Gallons\nBluetooth LE Connectivity\n125kW Plate Cooler\nArduino Based Control\nFlow Sensors\nLoad Sensors\nTemperature Sensors (\u00b10.5\u00b0C)\nStainless Steel Motorized Valves\nNative iPhone iOS 7 support\nPower Supply: 240 volts (currently UK compatible, US voltage will be supported)\nStainless Steel Containers.\nIntegrated recipe system\nWe have built a recipe platform right into the app, allowing brewers to add and tweak recipes.\nSmartphone connectivity\nBrewbot currently talks to your iPhone via Bluetooth, giving you all the required feedback you need, from adding the grain on brew day to how long you have to wait for the brew to ferment.\nAccurate measurements\nBased on your recipe Brewbot enters the exact amount of water required for the brew. This can be adjusted using the app.\nSensor technology\nWe have used temperature sensors, load sensors, and flow meters to ensure you understand what is happening from start to finish. These sensors assist with the automation.\nOptimal brewing techniques\nYou can brew up to 20 litres (or just over 5 gallons) of beer. Brewbot is flexible and allows you to brew using no-sparge and batch sparging techniques which means it recirculates the water over the grain bed and cuts the brew time.\nBetter beer for less\nCraft beer can be expensive but now everyone has the power to brew beer themselves for as little as 26p/42\u00a2 for a 330ml/12oz bottle.\nCustom facades\nWe are offering a number of facades and we have options that can be branded so it can be customized to fit in with your home, office, restaurant or bar. The possibilities are endless.\nBrewbot prototype and app\nCompatibility:\nOur skills as designers and developers align most suitably to iOS, that's why we made the decision to develop our prototype for iPhone.\nWorking on iPhone allowed us to more easily pull together all the pieces in order to automate the brewing process and achieve our goals for the app both technically and visually. Support of Bluetooth LE in the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 gave what we immediately needed in development of our prototypes and having support on Android and other platforms would be an aim of ours beyond our initial Kickstarter.\nBrewbot Core [update]\nWe have received a lot of feedback from brewers who already have a system in place but wish to monitor, control, and/or automate it, like Brewbot. We realise we can offer this as a product to offer the technology that makes Brewbot work to others. Community is important to us so we wanted to open this up. \nBrewbot Core is unit that offers an extendable collection of the sensors and valves, fully customisable brew processes (even double sparge and step mashing), custom mapping of sensors to various outputs, have the full power of our software including scheduling system, Wi-Fi connectivity, recipe management system, cleaning modes, integration with other systems via our API, and also access to future products, such as our TV dashboard and Android app.\nWe've added two new pledges; Brewbot Core and Brewbot Core + Starter Kit.\n\nFeatures of Brewbot Core:\nReal-time notifications\nBuilt-in calendar support. Get notified when the boil is ready, a strike temperature is hit, when it\u2019s time to dry hop, when it\u2019s time to bottle.\nWi-Fi connectivity\nA Wi-Fi base station that can be standalone or connect your brewery to an existing network. Connect to your Android or iOS device.\nRecipe management\nSend recipe data to your smart brewery format, or input via the app. Comes with the same recipe tweaking ability as Brewbot.\nCustom brew processes\nSetup Brewbot Core to your desired brew process, timings, sparge technique, mashing technique. Brewbot Core offers full flexibility to suit your needs.\nSensor mapping\nAdd your temperature and flow sensors and setup what they do and control. e.g. Set temperature sensor one to open a two-way valve.\nManual control\nBased on the inputs and outputs defined you will get a custom interface to manually control outputs and monitor input sensors.\nCleaning modes\nSeveral preset functions that can be used to rinse your system out.\nExtendable\nWant a custom sensor or add even more? Brewbot Core can be upgraded through connections and software.\nBrewbot Core technical specification:\nThe core specification for Brewbot Core is:\n\n8 x Inputs (e.g. Temperature Probes, Flow Meters)\n8 x Outputs (Valves) \n2 x Pump Outputs \n1 x SSR Switch\nPID Control\nWorldwide Electrical Support\nThe starter kit is only the starting point to add monitoring, automation, and recipe integration to your system. You can extend this beyond this setup to suit your needs.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019ve created a fully functional prototype and it has proven extremely effective. We have spent the last several months putting it through its paces and have brewed a lot of beer along the way.\nWe've explored lots of ways to bring Brewbot to life but the only way we can see it getting into the hands of others is to use Kickstarter. We want to make it more affordable and the only way we can do that is by manufacturing in large numbers.\nSo far we have been able to fund the development of the project but now we need your help to take the product further. We believe if Brewbot existed we could empower discerning amateurs, home-brewers, and breweries to become better.\nProduction plan:\nWhat we will do whilst in the US:\nSource fabricators to help manufacture Brewbot in the US\nMeet brewers to help refine the project\nFind suppliers to help provide raw materials\nMeet people to help with the shipping of the project.\nWe want to bring the same personality that we bring to each brew to every unit we ship:\nThe priority after a successful project is to work on the stainless steel structure that forms the basis of Brewbot\nOnce this has completed our team of woodworkers will put in place the prepared wood\nEach valve, pump and flow meter will be installed into the unit\nThe electronics assembly that monitors and controls every detail of the unit will be installed, calibrated and tested\nAfter each Brewbot is assembled we will run through a series of tests for quality control.\nGlobal availability:\nWe are currently focusing our efforts on the UK, Ireland, Australia, and US. If we meet our goal we guarantee seamless delivery in these countries, we will endeavor to achieve the necessary certifications for other countries but if we can't we will refund backers in the countries we can't deliver to.\nShipping and delivery:\nIf we get funded we want to use our funds to optimize the weight of Brewbot to keep shipping costs as low as possible. Brewbot is a sizable, ready-constructed unit and as such currently costs \u00a3100/$160 to ship within the UK and it would be a similar cost in the US. We want to reduce this cost when we go into production by sourcing fabricators in the UK and the US. We will be in touch when our project ends with individual shipping prices for your country i.e. UK and Ireland, EU, US, Canada, or Australia.\nHow will the project funds be used?\nWe have a real working prototype, but there's still a lot to do. With your support we can finish the first production-run of Brewbot and get it out into the world. Your backing will help fund:\nSourcing components and materials\nWe are currently using copper for piping but we want to use stainless steel. Stainless steel doesn't corrode or oxidize and can be used with more cleaning products than copper can.\nOptimizing the product \nWe are continuously trying to optimize Brewbot particularly in two areas:\nHeating - we are using off-the-shelf induction heaters but we want to explore form and power in order to design a solution that is efficient\nSensors - currently using temperature sensors that are within 0.5\u00b0C but with your help we can achieve an even more accurate reading.\n\nElectronics - we are currently using Arduino but we are hoping to use our own micro-controller to optimize the threading. We need to optimize the product for both the UK and US voltage systems.\nFinal engineering to meet necessary safety regulations\nAs we will be initially launching in the UK there are three EU directives that apply in order for us to get CE approval:\nLow Voltage - electrical safety (low voltage as opposed to high voltage)\nRadio and telecommunications terminal equipment \u2013 for radio and network apparatus\nElectromagnetic compatibility (EMC) \u2013 limiting emissions and requiring immunity to emissions from others (if we use induction for heating)\nHowever, we have tried to use off-the-shelf parts where possible, all of which already have CE marking which mitigates the risk in this area.\nSoftware development\nThe current Brewbot app needs refined and we will require your help to make this happen. Whilst the app is currently iPhone-based we want to offer a cohesive visual experience across multiple platforms and devices.\nIf you decide to help us you'll play an integral part in starting a revolution in home-brewing. Every person backing us makes the difference. We're looking forward to seeing what you can do. \nWho are we?\nWe are Cargo, a multidisciplinary team of designers and developers based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. We come from different backgrounds but we all share the same passion for brewing.\nWe have designed and developed over 70 mobile applications to date but we made the decision to focus on our own product, and this is why we've put all of our efforts and energies into Brewbot.\nFrom left to right: Niall, Chris, Kieran, Aaron, Jonny, and Ali.\nTeam roles\nFounder: Chris McClelland\nCreative Lead: Jonny Campbell\nDevelopment Lead: Niall Kelly\nEngineer: Kieran Graham\nInterface Design: Ali Sisk\nDesign: Aaron Gilmore\nPartners\nWe have partnered with Caroline and Nelson Santos who are the founders of Mette, a creative consultancy who specialise in contemporary products and environments for cooking and living, to assist with the product design.

His films have reached millions of people and have inspired them to live fuller, happier lives. Hunter has used creative techniques to reach the world with his films including being the first person to put a feature documentary on YouTube not long after he released his first film, 10 MPH. \nMusic in WALTER trailer by Andrew Duhon, Steve Bayley\nTo further his innovative approach to making and releasing films, Hunter Weeks, along with his wife and producing partner Sarah E. Hall, are hoping you'll help them reach for the stars with this film. If this campaign is successful, WALTER will play in theaters nationwide starting in October and will ultimately be qualified to be nominated for an Academy Award (Essentially this requires a week long run in Los Angeles and New York, creating a DCP version, advertising, and sending the Academy 250 DVDs). \nOfficial poster - Limited Edition, 11x17 signed copy with $50 and $75 DIY reward\nArtwork by Frank Wiedemann\nWALTER was inspired by a visit to Walter Breuning, the oldest living man in the world at the time. He was 113 years old. A year later, Hunter Weeks and Sarah Hall set out to tell his story along with that of several living Supercentenarians by exploring their major contributions to the world and their personal philosophies on how they were able to make it past the 110 mark. Their journey helps capture the stories of the last few people born in the late 1800s. This movie celebrates life and will help people think differently about their personal timeline differently. Everyone has the chance to become the oldest living person in the world, which Guinness World Records recognizes as an official World Record.\nIt's such a rare opportunity to meet with people who were alive in the 1800s. Today, there are less than 10 known people living who were born in the 1800s.\nMinute #1 of Words from Walter reward. $50. Dedicate one exclusive minute from his interviews to someone who inspires you. A new minute of interview will be published daily until the film launches in theaters:\nFor 10 years, Hunter Weeks has been producing inspiring and motivating films like 10 MPH, Ride the Divide, and Where the Yellowstone Goes.

It'll be printed non-digitally with bright, beautiful colours, wrapped around by seven carefully-created hot-drink-relevant games - and a secret eighth game on the inside.\n(Pictures are mockups and may differ slightly from final print versions)\nTHE COASTERS\nThe coasters feature six different games: \"Coinflip Coasters\", \"That Wasn't Milk!\", \"The Winning Coaster\", \"Acrononymous\", \"Starting Sentences\", and \"Coastdown\".\nThe backs are crammed with mysterious symbols and sigils for use in the games - but you'll have to get the coasters to find out what they're for...\n(Pictures are mock-ups and may differ slightly from the final print version)\nTHE T-SHIRT\nThere's going to be a choice of t-shirt designs; one more graphical, and one crammed full of games. As you can see, this one's crammed with games:\nThere'll be five great games to play while you're out and about, printed on cotton t-shirts (choice of unisex and women's) with a big, bright, non-digital print. The t-shirts will ONLY EVER be available via this Kickstarter.\nCheck back next week for a look at the final t-shirt!\n(Picture is a mock-up and may differ slightly from the final print version)\nMore About Tiny Games\nWe're bringing together every kind of game you can think of: chase games, people-watching games, word games, creative games, shopping games, strategic games, storytelling games and a bunch more words we can't even think of right now. To get a better picture of what kind of games to expect, please watch the video above, plus you can download the complete rules for those games in this PDF.\nYou'll only need to read a few sentences of explanation for any given game; we're trying to create the maximum amount of fun for the minimum amount of rules-reading. You'll also get any digital tools you need to play whatever that game is - dice, spinners, timers and so on - and a record for posterity of the best bits of each game.\nInitially there'll be five locations for games: the home (further sub-divided into living room, kitchen, bathroom or bedroom), the pub, on the road (by bus or train or car), on a walk (whether in the city, the country, or a park), and in one other location to be chosen by a vote of our backers. \nThis is just the start - if successful, we're planning to add a load more games, locations, occasions, as well as special releases for holidays and events, all within the same fun, approachable framework. And to make sure it is fun and friendly, we're thrilled to be collaborating with IGF-nominated art director Luke Whittaker of State of Play Games on the visual design. \nWe're Hide&Seek, an award-winning game design studio based in London and New York. A lot of the games we\u2019ve made haven\u2019t been videogames: they've been games you play in the real world. If you're interested, have a look at the game we ran for 12,000 players in Edinburgh on New Year's Day; or the festival we put on at the Southbank Centre.\nTiny Games in London\nWe've already polished the format of Tiny Games through a lot of practice. Last year, we made 99 Tiny Games for all 33 boroughs of London, in the form of vinyl posters that went up in parks and on busy shopping streets. The project was an amazing success, described as \"brilliantly innovative\" by The Guardian Gamesblog and featured in Wired and the Wall Street Journal. You can read more about the history of Tiny Games here.\nWe've made and distributed our own games before, most notably with the Board Game Remix Kit, which uses four boardgames we've all got and remixes them to create 25 exciting new games, tweaks and mash-ups. BoingBoing called it \"the most insanely clever Christmas gift idea of the year\".\nWe want to encourage real-world play everywhere, not just where we are. That's why we're making this app. \nAccessibility and Settings\nThe app will have persistent settings that help it to choose the right game for you - if you can't run, say, or if you're colourblind, or you're mostly playing with kids and you don't want any games that might tend to the risque, then you can tell the app and it'll take that into account when it works out what game you should play.\nTo make the Tiny Games experience as good as it can possibly be, we need your help.\nWe need the wonderful people of Kickstarter to help us shape the app itself!  We'll be opening up the development process to all our backers - sharing game rules, builds, and design progress blogs - and we'll be depending on feedback from you to help make everything amazing. We hope you'll get involved in playtesting games, letting us know when our explanations aren't clear, guiding the choice of locations that you want to play Tiny Games in. It'll be super fun.\nAnd then, obviously, well, we need money. To make this app as beautiful as it can be, stuffing it with games, pumping it full of tools to help those games run smoothly.\nWe'll use the money for a few different things: \nVisuals. We're a small studio without an in-house designer, and we want Tiny Games to be beautiful. We've got UX experts and amazing artist Luke Whittaker on board, but we need to be able to pay them.\nMore development time. We've made a prototype of the game, and begun refining how it works in practice, but we need to do more work to make sure it's exactly as smooth and seamless and effective as possible.\nMore games. We've designed a lot of Tiny Games already, somewhere in the low to mid hundreds, and we're adding to that number every day, but in order to have a genuine range of games for you - wherever you are, however many people are with you, whatever mood you're in and whatever props you have to hand - we're going to need more than \"a lot\" - we're going to need absolutely loads, and that takes time. We need to playtest, polish and refine, and that takes time too. \n\nWe want the app to be as good as possible and in your hands as soon as possible. We're asking for the smallest amount of money we can honestly do that for.\nWe don't want to get too ahead of ourselves, but we need to lay out some important info about this Kickstarter and about platforms in particular. The \u00a325k target enables us to ship this app on iOS only. We really, really want to be able to extend this to Android too, so we really hope you can help us stretch!\nIf we don't make the \u00a345k stretch goal in the Kickstarter, we still plan on releasing an Android version - it will just arrive after the iOS version has launched. \n\u00a328k - Tiny Games For Queues! **UNLOCKED**\n\u00a332k - Tiny Games For Work and A Coaster for Everyone!\n\u00a335k - Secret!\n\u00a340k - Secret!\n\u00a345k - ANDROID VERSION !

Our story is set around the consequence of two such beings - Max and Devi - whose offspring has to suffer the harsh consequences and reality of her human scientist father and angel mother's choice to procreate, causing Elysia's wings to grow upon hitting puberty.\nAs her wings form, and she becomes an angel, Elysia has to face the fact that she is no longer human and must come to terms with the challenges that lie ahead with accepting her new form. Having been born with a lot more power and responsibility than she can accept, we follow Elysia on this epic coming-of-age journey where everything she knows no longer exists.\nAll the teenage angst involved with finding your place in life is nothing compared to the trials and tribulations that Elysia is faced with when confronted with the reality that she is the only key to stopping the Fallen Angel attack that is about to take over the world and all its inhabitants.\nThe story encapsulates a healthy respect for science, friendship and self-discovery. Don't be fooled by the angels - they are led by planetary alignments, not religion. Elysia makes many friends along the way all with their own awesome powers and begins her training to fight the Fallen Angel Overlord. All the while, her father is kidnapped, and her self-discovery and own powers are excelling at such a rate, that she becomes a formidable force to be reckoned with!\nFinally, a point to remember: we don't receive a penny unless we hit our target.\nBook Specifications\n'Elysia: Chapter 1' is the first issue to be released and we're happy to say it will be the start of an ongoing series of chapters for you to consume. This Kickstarter is the focus of the first three (there will be nine in total). We plan to release the comics 100+ pages at a time per chapter as a digital download, paperback and hardback.\nEach chapter will be printed in full colour, sized 260mm by 170mm and 100+ pages of awesome. The covers will be glossy and the page and print quality will be high to support Jennie's art style. We're pulling out all the stops to make sure this first print run is of the highest quality for you.\nCurrently, the first three chapters (Volume 1, as a collective) are 95% scripted and we'll be ready to start creating pages when this 30-day Kickstarter campaign is over.\nWe have illustrated some pages and posters to show you the quality of work you can expect. We'll be in touch and available to contact every step of the way for updates and news, so come and say hello!\nExpected delivery dates:\nChapter 1: September 2013 (100+ full colour pages).\nChapter 2: January 2014 (100+ full colour pages).\nChapter 3: May 2014 (100+ full colour pages).\nThese are simply guideline dates based on how quickly we are working at the moment. We anticipate that once pages have begun the storyboarding and painting processes, we'll be able to speed everything up and get Elysia into your hands faster. \nPLEASE NOTE: These will be shipped as they are completed. If you pledge towards an entire set of three chapters, we will send them out as they are printed so you can have them in their glorious forms as soon as possible!\nWord On The Street...\nHere's some feedback from early Elysia script previewers:\n\"With Elysia, Serena (with great assistance by Jennie) has created a fascinating fantasy world with a nice mix of genres that has the potential to appeal to a very large audience.  What makes the story most compelling, though, is that she\u2019s grounded it in great characters and relatable scenarios.  You want to be Elysia, discovering her powers, but you\u2019re also afraid to be her because of the situations she\u2019s thrust into.  It has everything that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate to read through a couple drafts of the script over the last year and the story is gets exponentially better each and every time.  I can\u2019t wait to actually see see Elysia fly onto the pages of the graphic novel.\"\n\n\u2014Anthony Del Col, Co-creator/co-writer of the acclaimed Kill Shakespeare (IDW Publishing).\n\"I was really excited to read an early draft of Elysia. It's a very different story set in a unique world and I can't wait to see it brought to life. It's the kind of thing you're going to tell your friends about and feel lucky to be in at the beginning before it gets really popular! Also, critically, Elysia is a hot girl with wings; which is excellent.\"\n\n\u2014Nick Wealthall, Poker presenter and comedy writer with many TV credits on over 20 different shows on the BBC and Channel 4.\n\"Serena has written a world full of little nuggets and curiosities. One part I really enjoyed the most was where Elysia learns to use her powers. Skar and the training scenes are superb.\"\n\n\u2014Corey Brotherson, Co-creator and writer of Magic of Myths, and Clockwork Watch and Unseen Shadows writer.\nLimited Rewards: Get Your Face In The Comic\nIf that wasn't enough, and you like what you see above, YOU also have the opportunity to BE IN Elysia. That's right, we've opened up a few spaces available for Elysia superfans to have their beauteous faces put inside one of the first three chapters. You have the option of having no lines to several lines and your own story arc - lots to choose from.\nAs most of the story is done, this will be a select process to fit you into the story in a suitable way, so please bear with us as we work with you in order to achieve this.\nACT FAST because once these are gone, they're gone!\nRewards \nPLEASE NOTE that not all of the pledge rewards are listed here (only the popular ones), so if you fancy getting your face inside Elysia, go check out the pledges on the right hand side!\nFollow the Elysia Blog for more illustrations, updates and news!\nYou can also find Elysia on Facebook and Twitter.\nOur video was shot by the magical Benny Crime. Huge thank you to him for being so ace.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're very open and thrive on updates. We have partnered with a good quality book printer and t-shirt designer to bring you the very best of products. Serena's background at her corporate jobs has also allowed her to organise large events with ease, so a couple of venues are already on hold for the book launch signing.\n\nCurrently, there are no foreseeable issues we'd come across as a work plan for the next year is already in place. We will always keep you in the loop of progress and conceivable hurdles - we're both talkers and communication is key, so you'll be hearing from us every step of the way.\n\nThe only thing that can potentially stop us is illness or death and, quite frankly, we'd both need to be *near* death before we stop working on Elysia.\n\nWe also have no plans to die any time soon.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 37, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/serenaobhrai/join-elysia-on-her-journey", "project_name": "Join Elysia On Her Journey..."}}, {"backer": "Willem van der Horst", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A Parody of the Political Process \n\"Democracy is like those movies you go see and then talk about for hours after. When Mark was writing role-playing games, he succeeded in reaching out to new audiences by thinking out of the box. With Democracy, he confirms his reputation as a visionary - his design doesn't stop at marrying innovative mechanics to an engaging theme, but provokes you into thinking about what politicians do and why they do it, and what would you do in their place... Be prepared for long, heated debates after every game!\"\n\u2014 Francesco Nepitello, Designer of War of the Ring.\nSTRETCH GOAL: SECRET AGENDA CARDS! ACHIEVED! $43,000!\nThese Secret Agenda cards add a whole new dimension to game play in Democracy. Each player is randomly given one card at the beginning of the game, which they keep a secret until the End Game. You can order the 13 Secret Agenda cards as an extra for $5 (just add it onto your total) and we will have them printed out using Print-On-Demand technology (the quality of the cards is pretty great).\nWe will also design and create a online system for players to design their own sets of Law Cards and Secret Agenda cards. This would invovle either templates and graphics we will provide, or a web page widget that does all the work for you (if we can cut the right deal). Just type in the text you can and choose an image to go on top.\nThe Secret Agenda cards represent the true loyalties of the \u201ccharacter\u201d each player is playing and describe a secret mission the player should accomplish. If the player manages to do so at the end of the game you get a bonus. Other players will try to guess what your cards is in order to stop you, but that isn\u2019t easy.\nIn the future we will be including a few new Secret Agenda cards with each Scenario Decks. Our goals is to keep this game fresh and stimulating via new content. We expect that most of these decks will be Print on Demand mail order, or print your own PDF's, but if we get the chance we will include some of them in UPRISING, our first supplement..\n\nSTRETCH GOAL: NAME TENT CARDS!  ACHIEVED! $38,000!\nWe are proud to present our first Kickstarter Stretch Goal... it's something that many playtesters have asked for, but that we were not sure we could provide. However we have finally figured out a way to include a high quality product that has a multitude of purposes in the game: Name Tent Cards.\nName tent? What the heck does that mean? Well you can see from the picture below that it is one of those self important things you see at conferences for the VIP's sitting at the main table. In terms of Democracy the game it makes it really easy to tell who is who when you are trying to figure out who the Law Card affects. In the PARTY GAME version this is the flag under which the team gathers.\nMaking it even more valuable each name tent card has a slot on both sides, at the fold, where you can tuck in a Power Card, thus making all of a players \"attributes\" immediately visible to other players. We are making this goal easy to reach because Mark wants so badly to include them in the game, so get motivated and spread to word and let's achieved this new goal. \nDemocracy is a game of deal making, debate, and diplomacy. You play a power broker and leader of a new national movement, a political mastermind who organizes campaigns and wins elections. Your job is to form alliances, yet always stand by your principles \u2013 make compromises, yet still achieve your agenda. To succeed you must herd cats, spin facts into a web of illusion, and speak POWER TO TRUTH.\nYou are battling to take over a country in crisis. The old-line political parties are weak and divided, primed for being taken over or pushed out of the way. Your movement has captured the imagination of a small but loyal few and now it\u2019s your job to grow it into a national force. The goal is to put your handpicked candidate into high office, take control of the country, and put your MARK ON HISTORY\nMinutes to learn but years to master, Democracy is fast paced, there is no downtime and you\u2019re always in the middle of the action. Modular in format, no two games are alike \u2013 ever shifting alliances lead to bombshells and blindsides. Play out any political scenario, from revolution in the streets to the crafting of a constitution. Enter the world of mudslinging, dirty tricks, and power politics: IT'S ALL IN THE GAME.\n\"I take great pleasure in games that explore complex subjects by designers who are talented and have a sense of humor - both qualities of Mark Rein-Hagen. I am certain Democracy will come to be known as a fun & entertaining game that teaches us something along the way.\"\n\u2014 Richard Garfield, designer of Magic: The Gathering\nChange  -  Regulate  -  Tradition   -   Liberty\nThese are the four horsemen of conventional wisdom: You have Change: the progressives (hope) vs. Tradition: the conservatives (caution), then you have Liberty: free market (don't tread on me) vs. Regulate: Canada (laugh it up, they didn't have a housing crash.) \nVOTE DEMOCRACY!\nSpecial Offer: Political Animal Tokens!\nWe have had some backers ask us about getting some custom components in the game: so now for only $6 you can get a set of 28, 2 cm long Laser-cut meeples, or $25 for all 5 sets (140 meeples total) plus a cloth bag. Just add the cost to your basic pledge and we will ship these to you with your game. They can be used to represent 1, 3 or 5 Supporters, the White Buffalo is the centrist token.\nThese tokens are not required for gameplay, but can give the game a little extra personalization. To request one of these additional levels simply add the dollar amount of the add-on to your pledge, but leave your reward level the same. At the end of the campaign we will send out a survey and ask you what extra goodies you wanted for your pledge.\nEnter the hidden world of rainmakers, dark horse candidates and back room deals. This is a game about the unseen gears and machinery of democracy: the absolute worst form of government\u2026 except for all the others. Negotiation is as important as strategy, players with a gift of persuasion can easily defeat those who know games and rules.\n\nYou cannot win solo, you need allies, but who can you trust? Form an alliance in order to wrest control from a single majority, make promises you may not be able to keep, block a coalition by forming your own. In this game, as in life, you get to play power as you see fit, FAIR OR FOUL.  \n\u201cWhen the creator of Vampire: The Masquerade says, \u2018Hey Peter, check out my new game\u2019, you can bet I pay attention. Mark\u2019s game, Democracy, is a competitive and engaging game that mixes roleplaying and board gaming elements while shedding light on the political process.\u201d\n\u2014 Peter Adkison, founder of Wizards of the Coast \nThis game is about building a network, forging alliances and blindsiding rivals. PLAY a power broker, the master-mind behind a new political movement. EXPLORE the complex machinery of Democracy and see for yourself how all the moving parts fit together. ENTER the hidden world of rainmakers, dark horse candidates and BACK ROOM DEALS.\nYou are a power broker and spin doctor in control of a movement battling to take control of the nation. On your better days you believe in the wisdom of the people, the clarifying truth of elections, and the ideal of Democracy as the greatest triumph of civilization. On your worse days you think voters are fools to be manipulated, supporters are suckers to be exploited, and elections are game shows to be hacked. Your goal is to dominate the political world, transform the country according to your ideology, and put your handpicked candidate into the OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.  \nClick here for the game rules. \n\"I grinned like a delighted idiot through the entire 'How to Play' video. I must have this game, and must play it, stiff drink in hand, with all my friends who are deeply troubled by the political process. Knowledge is Power! Knowledge through Games!\"\nKen Rolston, designer of The Elder Scrolls\nWe intend for this to be the definitive, authoritative version of Democracy: Majority Rules, using the highest quality components available. It's been years in the making, Mark actually began this project when he was a teenager and involved in Youth in Government and Model UN. He wanted rules to match the process so that it wasn't just a bunch of kids making speeches, but he didn't actually solve the problem until a decade or two and a dozen prototypes later. Needless to say we are all completely dedicated to this process and have put in some serious time bringing it to fruition.  \n3-5 Players, Age 12+, 60-120 Minutes\nSo where is Make Believe Games in this process? We\u2019ve:\nFormed an international team located in the Republic of Georgia, Germany and Louisville KY (UPS hub)\nDesigned, built and played generations of prototypes\nPlaytested all over the world\nPre-arranged printing and shipping of the product\nGot two more games coming, Victoria & Auction House, in development.\nWe are fully ready to get your Democracy game printed and delivered to you within a couple of months. We take this rather vital step seriously, but we need your financial support to do the job right. Please help us make this game a reality. \nVOTE EARLY AND OFTEN!\nThe PARTY GAME package\n6-15 Players, 2-7 Hours\nWith this exclusive package you get enough tokens and cards for 15 players. That is three times the regular amount of Influence (180), Political Capital (180), Ballot Cards (90), and Supporters (420, in 15 different colors) than the standard game. You also get 45 Super Supporters, 3 in each color (has a value of 5 Supporters). Last but not least you get a limited edition \u201cRoberts Rules of Order\u201d art poster.\n\nDemocracy was designed from the beginning to be played with large numbers of people as new concept in gaming. We call it a MMBG: a Massively Multiplayer Board Game. Because players in this game do not take turns but all move at the same time, you can add players without adding much time, but still get all the sociability, complexity and surprises of a larger group of people. Player\u2019s play in teams and in order to win the game your team must first win collectively. We recommend you have a Gamemaster for the larger games but it\u2019s not required. To use in the classroom you can put students together into partnerships, have other students act as reporters and lobbyists and use a simplified version of the rules.  \nCheck out our website.\n\"Democracy is a game in which negotiation matters more than any game I've seen since Cosmic Encounter. It manages to lampoon government while at the same time educationally showing how it works. It mocks bureaucracy while steering clear of mocking specific political views. In a word, it's absolute fun.\"\nTom Vassel, founder of The Dice Tower\nInspiration\nDemocracy: Majority Rules was inspired by a wide variety of sources, but we need to mention the following in particular: The Wire, Junta, Diplomacy, Survivor, Dictator's Handbook, & Guns Germs and Steel.\nTheme\nWhat has become clear to me is that the political media has gotten so good at making the horse race exciting that most voters have almost completely forgotten what issues they believe in, and are simply rooting for their particular horse. The media complex has gotten so gosh darn good at turning front runners into losers based on a misstatement or a debate performance, they can make ANY race a close race. And of course a close race is an exciting race... and an exciting race sells a lot of ads. No wonder there aren't any centrists anymore: its no fun to go to the track and not have any skin in the race. We have become almost as bad as the Romans, Bread and Circuses indeed.\n\nCombating this is the real purpose of this game, it's to focus attention away from the race and towards the stables and the clubhouse where all the real decisions are being made. \n*SHIPPING INFORMATION\nWe will ship your complete package for free to anywhere in the Continental United States (not included Alaska and Hawaii) and to anywhere else in the US or Canada or in the 27 European Union Nations for a $5 surcharge per game. Inside the Republic of Georgia Mark will hand deliver your game at the product release Supra. Anywhere else in the world, the cost is $25 per box, whether it is the standard game or the PARTY GAME package (which is far heavier).\nGeorgia: Mt.Kazbegi. Come visit soon.

Not just how we work, but where. Working from home in the US has increased dramatically in recent years and they estimate that by 2016, 63 million Americans will work from home at least part time (Source: 2011 Forester Research).  \nWe wanted to look at the edges of this movement, the people who are not just working from home and keeping the status quo, but those who are taking this new freedom -- the opportunity to choose to live anywhere without having to consider workplace location -- and what happens next.\nIf you shift your life from being centered around where you to work, to being centered around how you want to live, what happens?  Where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world?\nWe followed the stories of 18 individuals who take work from home to the next level.  They're living abroad, traveling, experiencing things that they would have never have seen if they worked in a traditional office.  This is the first generation of people who realistically can hold a 9-5 job and travel around the world at the same time.\nWe call these people The Wireless Generation.\nWe interviewed people across five continents including:\na sociology professor teaching online from Thailand \na financial analyst for American Express backpacking across South America \na family of four traveling with their kids across Asia as they build websites for their clients back home in Australia \na day trader living in Colombia \nan internet entrepreneur who only works a few hours a month and spends the rest volunteering in places like Haiti and Rwanda \nThese people have each found ways to make the ultimate dream of traveling the world possible -- while keeping their careers. All it takes is a good wifi connection, a little creativity and the desire to do something different.\nWe've been featured on Mashable!\nJason & Aracely in Colombia\nABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nThis film is brought to you by husband-wife team Drew & Christine Gilbert. Drew is an animator with degree in Animation/Media Arts from the Art Institute of Philadelphia and has been telling stories with video and animation online over the past twelve years. Christine is a writer and photographer whose work has been seen in BBC Travel, Esquire, Rough Guides, and Lonely Planet. They've been working online and traveling the world together since 2008. In 2010 they had a baby, kept traveling, and their son now been to more countries as a toddler, than Drew and Christine visited by age 30.\nTHIS IS A PROJECT WE LOVE\nWe have been traveling around the world for TWO YEARS filming these stories. We went to five continents. We went to Burning Man! With a baby! We traveled thousands of miles to capture these fascinating characters in exotic locations, and now we want to complete our film and share it with as many people as possible.The Kickstarter campaign will enable us to not only complete the editing of the film, but most importantly to share it, which we hope will inspire others to take the leap to live their life with adventure and passion.\nWe are pitching film festivals and also want to set up screenings around the US, so as many people as possible can see it.\n We want to tell this story.\nKirsty in Rwanda\nWHAT WE NEED\nA successful Kickstarter campaign will allow us to complete the film, and for a screening tour in:\nSeattle, WA\nSan Francisco, CA\nLos Angeles, CA\nTelluride (or Denver), CO\nAustin, TX\nBoston, MA\nNYC, New York\nThe funds would cover the festival application fees, the film printing, final post-production, and tour travel expenses. \nIf we raise more than $35,000?

My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

First we reached our initial target in less than two days. Then we hit $75,000, and upgraded everybody's rewards. Then it wasn't long before we passed $100,000. The response from everyone out there has just been beyond our wildest dreams. \nNow there are just a few days left, and we need your help to see how far we can take this before time runs out.\n------------------\n# THE PROBLEM\nThe web is the future of journalism, but let's be honest: the future isn\u2019t living up to expectations. Newspapers and magazines have cut back on in-depth reporting. Gossip sites have proliferated. The web has become a byword for fast and cheap. Why isn\u2019t it synonymous with fearless, investigative and enthralling writing?\nWe think it can be. \nWe\u2019ve developed a way to support independent, global, in-depth reporting about science and technology, two subjects that are close to our hearts. We\u2019re going to use it to build MATTER, the new home for the best journalism about the future. And we need you to help us make it happen.\n# HOW WILL IT WORK?\nMATTER will focus on doing one thing, and doing it exceptionally well. Every week, we will publish a single piece of top-tier long-form journalism about big issues in technology and science. That means no cheap reviews, no snarky opinion pieces, no top ten lists. Just one unmissable story.\nMATTER is about brilliant ideas from all around the world, whether they come from professors at MIT or the minds of mad people. But most of all, it\u2019s about getting amazing investigative reporters to tell compelling stories.\nWe\u2019re building MATTER for readers, not advertisers. So however you access our stories \u2014 whether it\u2019s on our website, via the Kindle store, or on your Apple and Android devices \u2014 you will get a beautifully designed experience that puts you first.\nGood journalism isn\u2019t cheap: it takes time and money for great reporters to do their best work. That means we\u2019re going to have to charge. But not much: we\u2019re aiming for around 99 cents per story. It\u2019s an experiment to see if independent journalism, done right, can fill the gap left by mainstream media.\n# WHO ARE WE?\nMATTER is run by two experienced reporters with a passion for making journalism better. \nJim Giles is an award-winning writer whose credits include Nature, The Atlantic, The Economist and New Scientist. \nBobbie Johnson is European editor at GigaOM and a former technology correspondent for The Guardian.  His work has appeared in outlets from the BBC and Businessweek to The New York Times.\nWe're not alone. We've lined up a team of writers and editors who have written best-selling books and produced fantastic writing for the world\u2019s best publications, from The New Yorker and Wired to National Geographic and The Washington Post.\n# JOIN IN\nWe need your help to build our site and commission the first three pieces. We think you'll love the stories we have lined up: gripping exposes of online crime, untold tales of environmental threats, inside stories about revolutionary technologies and exclusive reports from the most controversial research labs.\nTo help us get them out into the world, you can pledge anything -- from the cost of a movie ticket all the way up to a $3,000 sponsorship.\nAnd for just $25, you can help us commission pieces by joining our editorial board. We\u2019ll manage the board using All Our Ideas, a tool developed at Princeton and funded by Google. It has never been used in this way before, so you\u2019ll be joining an experiment in collaborative commissioning as well as supporting top-quality investigations.\nWe\u2019d love it if you pledged. We\u2019d love it if you told your friends. We\u2019d love if it you helped us build a new way to produce top-tier journalism. Because we think these things matter \u2014 and we hope you do too.\nMore questions?

Are you game?\nWe have 23 days left to raise cash for travel, transcription, editing, design, production, distribution, and oh \u2026 writing.\nNow this is a real boy. It\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re going to write a book together (Are you excited? I\u2019m excited). So if you think someone should join our Editorial Board, invite them to back the project at $100, and let anyone else know that they can become an Official Sponsor for $25.\n__________\nThis book will be for anyone interested in creating products that are not just market exchanges, but cultural exchanges \u2013 for anyone that wants to build or reshape an organization for doing business in a world gone digital \u2013 and for anyone just finding their footing in the marketing industry today. Ultimately, I want the book to serve as the how, not just the why or what, for transformational growth at a time when a commitment to strategic change will reshape the entire business landscape. At the core of the book will be ten new principles for creating, promoting, and distributing products in the future \u2013 my ten new commandments for brands and marketers.\nAnd the book itself, from ideation, creation, and distribution will follow these new tenants \u2013 starting with this kickstarter project and you.\n\nUpdate: I've posted a slightly longer description of my concept for the book at my blog.\nAbout me:\nI've been blogging on the topic of marketing, advertising, and culture for over four years and I've amassed a considerable audience in that time at whatconsumesme.com. I've also put my insights to action for the world's biggest brands, spanning industries and target audiences. After leaving my last position at a digital think-tank to take on a position at a new start-up, I began jotting what has become an outline for a book spanning the breadth of my experiences thus far \u2013 from my time before the first internet bubble to the growing social media bubble today.\nI don't plan to achieve my lofty goals by myself. I need your help, your voice, and your commitment. I realize that what I'm asking is outside your normal book buying behavior \u2013 and I can only promise to deliver a product and an experience that matches this exotic request.\nWhy you should fund the production of this book:\n\u2013 I have one of the most read individually published blogs on marketing/advertising today and I will partner with my network to promote the book\n\n\u2013 I have a distinct voice and point of view (I've worked on the web through the first bubble to today as an entrepreneur, advertiser, marketer, and brand strategist) and maybe you're already a fan of both\n\n\u2013 Most of all, your investment buys you into the process ... top sponsors will not only get the book for free of course, but they'll also have a say in how any proceeds might be reinvested, and they'll become editorial board members of the project, weighing in on topics covered, people interviewed, case studies examined, promotion, and even how the book should be offered to readers\nI realize that I'm asking for real money and a real investment from you \u2013 and with your investment I promise a solid commitment of my time, energy, and passion.\nWhat the money will actually be used for: an investment of my time (at a discounted rate) and the help and time of someone I trust to take on the role of editor for the project\nIf in the rare event donations exceed my expectations, I will be able to commit more of my time to the project which will mean a better product (more research, interviews, case studies) and perhaps an accelerated timeline for completion.\nAnyone who sponsors the project will receive an electronic copy of the text.\nAny thoughts, concerns, ideas, or questions are absolutely welcomed - email me or tweet me.\n\nAnd if you can't offer funds right now, you can always help promote the project.
