We're the editors at Chromatic Press, the independent publisher behind Sparkler Monthly magazine. This is our biggest, most important Kickstarter yet. We\u2019ve got huge plans for the next year, and we want you to be a part of it!\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for Sparkler Monthly Year 3!\nBased off the Japanese manga model you might know from magazines like Shonen Jump, Sparkler Monthly runs serialized fiction in monthly chapters--so every month, you get a new piece of five different series at once. Most of our series are comics, but we also publish prose with illustrations, audio dramas, and one-shot short stories in any format. All of them are bundled together in the magazine so our audience can get a taste of everything. \nSparkler Monthly is targeted at women and girls aged 15 and up, or anyone interested in that kind of material--like the genres shojo and josei in Japan. In addition to all our series, we run features, podcasts, and bonus stories to give our readers more bang for their buck, and to help build a community. Sparkler is about Lifestyle through Fiction, and between our forums, social media, and contests, we invite our audience to become a part of Sparkler--something that literally happens sometimes, since we also run periods of open submissions in search of new talent!\nClick to download it now!\nRegardless of genre, the core of Sparkler serials is emotional content--we want FEELS. Interesting characters, loaded relationships, and shocking cliffhangers. Anything that will make our readers scream!\nHere's a small sampling:\nLGBT Historical Drama, 16+ (by Jennifer Doyle)\nHistorical Adventure, 13+ (by Studio Kosen)\nShojo Romantic Comedy, 13+ (by Heldrad)\nBoy\u2019s Love Mystery Drama, 13+ (by Jen Lee Quick)\nGeeky Modern Comedy, 13+ (by LAMP, Aiwa, and Rebecca Scoble)\nLady Trucker Romance, 16+ (by Alexis Cooke)\nMagical Girl/Woman Satire, 16+ (by KAIJU)\nUrban Fantasy Adventure Drama, 16+ (by Lianne Sentar and Rem)\nAlt History Boy\u2019s Love Supernatural, 16+ (by Emily Compton and Onorobo)\nSci-Fi Musician Drama, 16+ (by Jenn Grunigen and Mookie)\nMost of our content is free to read online, so head to sparklermonthly.com to start binge-reading right now! \nPaying Sparkler Members don\u2019t need to read their content online--they get DRM-free downloads of the new stuff a month or more before it\u2019s released online, as well as special bonuses to download to their computers and e-readers. Our paying audience is both supporting our content, and downloading it to keep forever.\nWe have two types of memberships:\nNormal: Get DRM-free downloads of the current issue(s) a month before the pages are available online, all Member Exclusives (20 and counting!), and early releases of the Sparkler Podcast. See all downloads here!\nVIP: Everything in the normal membership, plus series-specific ebooks of everything running in the magazine (so you don't miss a back chapter), plus our entire steamy Cherry Bomb line. See all downloads here!\nClick to see all Cherry Bomb products!\nOur Cherry Bomb imprint is for our older readers (we recommend ages 17+), and features sexy side stories and art for a number of Sparkler serials. We're always adding new Cherry Bomb pieces, so VIP Members have unlimited downloads to the entire line, including anything we add during their membership!\nAfter two years of running our magazine and releasing over a dozen books from it, we're proud of what we've built. We pay our creators advances, give them veteran editors, and release their work in a number of formats, all while keeping copyright in the creator\u2019s names. In an era where we have an industry-wide push to support more women in comics, the vast majority of the Sparkler family is female--from the owners to the editors to the creators to the staff. We hire all genders, but we\u2019re also proud that the female perspective is the norm here--not the exception. \nBut while our fantastic audience is growing, it still isn\u2019t big enough to support the entire magazine yet. We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to try and meet a new audience and offer exciting bonuses to our existing supporters. Through this special Kickstarter, we can raise enough funds to ensure that Sparkler Monthly magazine runs for an entire third year--that\u2019s 12 more issues, packed with the content our readers already know and love, along with new surprises and endless possibilities as we keep experimenting with formats and distribution. Help us have our best year yet!\nIn addition to continuing the great series running in Sparkler Monthly right now, we have special plans we\u2019ve been saving for Year 3. As this Kickstarter runs through the month of July, we'll update this space with announcements of Year 3 goodies! :D\nDay #1 announcement: We'll be expanding our Cherry Bomb line beyond Sparkler spin-offs...and we're proud to start with a completely original story written by Kate Leth of Power Up!, Edward Scissorhands, and Kate or Die! Coming in Year 3, prose with illustration, queer, recommended for ages 17+.\nDay #8 announcement (Fri, Jul 3): [see full update with images] Jessica Chavez and Irene Flores will be returning in Year 3 to do a direct sequel to Dead Endings! That's right--prepare for more Cailen, Gabriella, and Everett chasing ghosts and getting caffeinated/drunk in Year 3 of Sparkler Monthly!\nWe're also proud to announce that the exclusive Sparkler desktop in this Kickstarter will be in the theme of Knights-Errant, and drawn by creator Jennifer Doyle. <3 We've also added SEVEN new creator tiers, including getting yourself drawn into the background of Knights-Errant, Orange Junk, or even Dead Endings Volume 2 (!), an original music commission from Sparkler's head audio director/composer Rebecca Scoble, and original art from Studio Kosen, Aiwa, and Denise Schroeder! Get some one-of-a-kind creations in your support of Sparkler Monthly!\nDay #15 announcement (Fri, July 10): [see full update with images] Sparkler Monthly Issue #024, our final issue of Year 2, came out this week! It's 250+ pages long and over half color comics, making it our most elaborate issue yet. New to Sparkler? You can also download our free, 300-page Year 1 Sampler Issue right now to get a taste of what this magazine is like!\nWe've also added TWO new creator tiers: original art by Irene Flores (Dead Endings, Shojo Fashion Manga Art School, Mark of the Succubus) and Rem (Tokyo Demons, Devil's Candy, SOULLESS)! \nDay #22 announcement (Fri, July 17): [see full update with images] In Year 3, we'll be doing another special audio project: a self-contained Situation CD, an immersive format (popular in Japan) where voice actors speak directly to the listener and lead her through a story. Our Situation CD will be Bad Chemistry, a high school scenario where you, the listener, are trying to pass your science lab class with a grumpy (but handsome) lab partner...and romance starts to bloom! Rated 13+, 20-30 minutes in length. The lab partner will be voiced by our most popular actor Alex O'Shea (Travis in Awake, Jo in Tokyo Demons Audio) with character design by Tumblr superstar Johanna the Mad! And look at Johanna's WIP of this cutie:\nOther updates this week include some deluxe graphics for our $125 ebook backlist tier and our $200 paperback backlist tier (to clarify the MOUNTAIN of stuff you get with those) as well as subtitles for our video, which you can see by clicking the \"cc\" button. If you want to support this Kickstarter with a widget for your blog, our wonderful web admin assistant Pachi has written up a how-to. And on the Sparkler site, up through Monday you can vote in the next round of the Tokyo Demons Dakimakura! \nDay #29 announcement (Fri, July 24): [see full update with images]\nThis week, Sparkler joined the Hiveworks Hub as an official partner! Hiveworks, as both a publisher and a network, is the backbone of dozens of incredible webcomics you're probably already reading. We're thrilled and honored to work with them.\nOur strangest (and most awesome?) project, spurred by our concurrent Membership Drive, continues! Since Kiyoshi and Sachi won their respective bouts, the Tokyo Demons dakimakura contest now has them head-to-head. Vote for your favorite of these two handsome dudes before polls close next Friday night!\nDay #36 announcement (Fri, July 31): [see full update with images] We have three days and under $2,000 to go! We wanted to unveil some Year 3 Knights-Errant keychains by Jennifer Doyle that have been in the works:\nIf we happen to hit our first Stretch Goal of $22K in this last flurry of days, everyone at the $50+ tiers are getting one of these free, and everyone at the $100 and up tiers are getting BOTH free! See Stretch Goal section below for details.\nThis Kickstarter is to help fund another 12 issues of the magazine, but here\u2019s the best part--Sparkler fiction comes in a lot of different packages, for whichever way you like to read. Hate reading on your computer at all? We also have paperbacks! And some of our fantastic readers and creators have joined our tiers to offer you special bonuses, original art, and even commissioned illustrations!\nBut first, a few notes: \nIf you want to try our magazine without a year's commitment, or download content without waiting for this Kickstarter to end, we have other options and prizes in the Membership Drive on our site. Check it out for cheaper, quicker gratification that still helps fund Year 3!\nIf you already have a Year's Membership to Sparkler but want to pledge here for Year 3, once this Kickstarter is over, we'll credit you back for the overlapping months with a gift card to the Sparkler Shop.

I\u2019m here today to talk to you about joining me for the next chapter of Molly\u2019s adventures.\n            Molly Danger is a super powered 10-year-old-alien girl who protects the city of Coopersville, New York from an army of villains called The Supermechs. Although Molly is an internationally famous super heroine, she is incredibly lonely and isolated from the public by D.A.R.T. (Danger\u2019s Action Response Team) command. Forbidden from having personal contact, she has no friends, no family, and no life outside of being a hero; that is until she meets D.A.R.T. pilot and new partner Austin Briggs and befriends his stepson Brian Hammond. Book two picks up nine months since the end of book one with Molly continuing to break D.A.R.T. protocols as she begins to question what is and what is not real. Meanwhile, the mysterious Father has gathered The Supermechs to reveal his plans for Molly, D.A.R.T. and Coopersville.\n\n\n           Our story originally started out as an animation pitch and sat on the shelf for years as my career flourished with mainstream and small press comic book companies. In 2012, my daughter Catherine inspired me to rework the concept for Molly. When she was old enough to read, I wanted her to enjoy a story that was positive, grounded and had a strong young female hero. A role model, who in spite of all the slings and arrows thrown at her, the tragedies suffered and the life she was thrust into would remain a good person. For me personally, Molly is a journey of the heart and spirit and is inspired by the love I have for comics and the stories I grew up on. It\u2019s my legacy; the gift I want to give to the world and inspire girls all over like my Catie.\n         Molly Danger: Book One was an all around unmitigated success. Thanks to you, the Kickstarter community, we exceeded our initial goal, which also allowed us to produce an audiobook. Your generous help, Molly took the industry by storm garnering accolades and praise from the press, professionals and readers alike. So now, I\u2019m back seeing your help to fund the next chapter in Molly\u2019s story. As before, depending on the number of backers I\u2019m looking to produce a minimum print run of 2,000 books. The funds will go directly to production and editorial efforts of the book, printing, delivery and storage, shipping through Amazon fulfillment and the production of incentives. Action Lab Entertainment will continue to partner with me and handle wide distribution.\n      The question that usually comes up in conversations with me is \u201cIf you have a publisher, why are you coming back to Kickstarter?\u201d The answer is that Action Lab, similar to Image Comics is a company primarily made up of generated content which means the bulk of the production costs is the creator\u2019s responsibility. Because of the higher production value of the series, Action Lab can\u2019t bear the brunt of the costs without some financial assistance. Creating the book does incur time and cost. Fortunately, the experience my team and I had with producing Molly Danger: Book One will help us with this book. There will be a substantial production period, which includes printing and shipping from the printer. My goal is to have the book in hand by March 2016 for shipment to backers before it\u2019s scheduled wide release date of April 2016.\n     Molly Danger will be a bi-monthly series, shipping every two months beginning in July of 2016 in comic shops.   We've partnered with Comixology.com and will be offering to backers an exclusive digital subscription that will not only give you each Molly Danger issue months before it hits comic shops, you'll get it before anyone else on the website.\n\nEvery two issues, beginning with issues 3 and 4, will be collected into the same lovely hardcover format as Molly Danger: Book One with an exclusive cover.  Every four issues will be collected as a trade paperback. Along with theses releases, I\u2019m planning two Molly Danger projects that will be announced later this year that are currently in the works. There will be a one shot crossover with Vito Delsante and Sean Izaakse\u2019s STRAY and Ray Anthony Height\u2019s MIDNIGHT TIGER. This book has a larger role in an upcoming story we\u2019re building for 2016.\nThe cover for the Actionverse Halloween Comicfest issue\n       So what will you receive for your pledges? All backers will have their names listed in the credits of Book Two. I will be creating a wearable Molly Danger \u201cM\u201d Badge for backers who pledge $5.00 or more. We are also offer a digital subscription to the bi-monthly Molly Danger series for backers who pledge $20.00 or more.\n Molly Danger: Book Two is a 48 page, full color hardcover book, and like Book One we are offering signed copies, copies with character sketches in the covers in both black and white and color. Backers will be able to choose between one of two covers, one drawn by myself and the second drawn by Eisner award winning creator of the popular webcomic \u201cBattlepug\u201d Mike Norton. There are limited amount of copies that Molly Danger: Book One for those people who missed it the first time around as well as T-shirts for children and adults in multiple sizes. I\u2019m offering a limited number of original inked pages from Molly Danger: Book One, signed by myself and inker Juan Castro Retailer incentive packs are also available; you can receive 5 or 10 copies, signed and shipped. I will also be doing private commissions ranging between $100 dollars for Black and white head and bust. $200 for single figure drawings and $500 dollars for \u201cCover style\u201d commissions.\n\n\n \u202f ABOUT JAMAL IGLE-\u202fA recipient of the 2011 Inkpot Award for outstanding achievement in Comic Art, Jamal Igle is the writer/artist/Creator of Molly Danger published by Action Lab Entertainment and the penciller of The Terminator: Enemy of My Enemy for Dark Horse Comics.

YES.\nUpdate #10, July 13th: All the ADD-ONs in one place\nUpdate #13, July 14th: Crime and Punishment ADD-ON\nHello, everyone, and welcome back! Thank you to all our previous backers for your support of Tezuka books. Because of you, we are able to print 4 books in our higher quality paper, and a digital-only book will finally be available in print. Thank you so much!\nWe've taken some time and listened to your requests, and for our next project, we'd like to print Osamu Tezuka's shojo manga, Storm Fairy. \nShojo is a type of genre born in Japanese magazines that were segregated according to gender. Shonen and shojo was printed similarly like the funnies in your Sunday newspaper. Magazines aimed at boys created the genre shonen, magazines aimed at girls created shojo. Post-WWII showed a surge of girls interested in manga, and when Tezuka published Princess Knight, he raised the bar on what was acceptable for Japanese girls (at the time) could read. Now, we are asking you to help us print another of Tezuka's lost work to English readers. \nStorm Fairy is a collection of 3 short stories with the first comprising the first half of the book, and the other two split the remaining pages.\nOnce upon a time, an Empress flees her burning castle to the nearby forest where she encounters a forest fairy. A deal is struck where in exchange for the fairy's favor, the Empress must give up the face of her next born child. Thus, two girls' lives become entwined: one has to wear a mask to hide her disfigured face, the other born with the face of the first. One night, a malcontent discovered Princess Ruri's curse and steals her mask to put his own daughter on the throne. Ruri, now on the run, meets a samurai Tonosuke who decides to care for her. Hakobe, the fairy born with Ruri's face, finds out the princess is on the run and decides to help her win back her kingdom, but little does she know, she wears the face of the one she's trying to save...\nThe second short story, \u201cKokeshi Detective Agency,\u201d has a similar tone and feel to young adult book series Encyclopedia Brown. Fearless little Paco goes around solving spooky mysteries because she is not afraid of things that go bump in the night while her dog friend Waco does his best to protect her. In the third short story, fairy Pink from the realm of beautiful sunsets morphs into whatever she wants so she may help those who are unhappy and in need, but King Brown and Sepia from the realm of thunderstorms do their best to make people miserable.\nEven though this manga is classified as a shojo manga, Tezuka still questions what is perceived as beautiful or ugly, and I love it. \u2013 Hikaru Sasahara, President of DMI\nIn addition to printing Storm Fairy, we also have two stretch goals. The first is a reprint of Unico. Some pledgers can also get the original Japanese Hard Cover edition of Unico in a surprise tier that we'll announce soon (!) and other swag for the reprint. Our second stretch goal is to print Crime and Punishment, which was released previously as digital-only.\nThere will also be specifically designed products for this campaign: knee-length gray dress with a blue storm trim in 100% cotton, and a t-shirt with Hakobe casting magic in 50% polyester / 25% cotton / 25% rayon. There is a super sturdy tote bag with the Storm Fairy logo. Check below for the specs on the bag. And last of all there will be a silk screened poster of Storm Fairy with 5-6 colors.

Join this Kickstarter campaign to fund the first three issues of FRESH ROMANCE, and get exclusive rewards in addition to becoming one of our first subscribers. With FRESH ROMANCE and our future projects, Rosy Press brings romance comics into the 21st century.\nThe first issue features sundry stories ranging from a clandestine, queer high school love affair to an impeccably researched and illustrated Regency-era romance. In addition to three forward-looking romances, each issue of FRESH ROMANCE delivers a relationship advice column by a quartet of divorced writers, behind-the-scenes art coverage, and a fashion report. Thanks to our ongoing anthology format, the kinds of stories we feature will be constantly evolving. The magazine will be R-rated, so while not all of the individual chapters or stories will be racy, there will be some adult content. Our goal is to bring avid comics readers and those new to comics together to enjoy the romance genre.\nWith talented creators on board like Kate Leth and Arielle Jovellanos with Amanda Scurti, Sarah Vaughn and Sarah Winifred Searle, and Sarah Kuhn and Sally Jane Thompson with Savanna Ganucheau, FRESH ROMANCE forges a new future for romance comics with modern characters, stories and a wide array of genres. Each month's issue of FRESH ROMANCE will have three full color comics stories, some of which are 10 pages long and can be enjoyed in a single issue, and some of which are much longer. Each story will also be released in its own ebook collection after it has run in FRESH ROMANCE.\nThese stories will remain creator-owned, yet a big part of the FRESH ROMANCE budget will be spent to pay the creators a page rate and royalties. Paying creators fairly is a cornerstone of the Rosy Press business model; we wouldn't exist without the hard work of creators, so we firmly believe they should be compensated fairly and retain control over their work. For every $10,000 we go over our goal, every single creator currently signed on to publish a story with Rosy Press will get a 15% page rate bump (so, at $48,000 everyone would get a 30% page rate bump and at $58,000 everyone would get a 45% page rate bump, etc).\nWith its digital platform, FRESH ROMANCE can reach a diverse set of readers. FRESH ROMANCE is the comics answer to the popular modern romance novel, and can be digitally delivered to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Content will be available in a variety of digital formats: via ComiXology or as a PDF, CBR, or ePub file, and will always be DRM-free. Unlike their real-world counterparts, FRESH ROMANCE stories never end \u2013 they will later be published as ebook collections.\nJoin our conversation! Follow us on Twitter @RosyPress and Instagram @RosyPress.\nContributors\nThe first three stories in FRESH ROMANCE will be created by the following teams:\nKate Leth and Arielle Jovellanos with Amanda Scurti on colors\nCharacter designs by Arielle Jovellanos\nKate, Arielle, and Amanda's story is a lighthearted take on classic high school romances with two queer women in the lead. Because Malie and Justine want to keep their romance a secret, they pretend to be competing over the same guy, Miles, but Miles also has a secret.\nArielle Jovellanos is an illustrator and comic artist (Five, School Spirit) based in New York. She likes sitcoms, showtunes, and storytelling structure. Also alliteration, apparently.\nKate Leth is a writer and artist best known for her webcomic Kate or Die and her work on the licensed comics Bravest Warriors, Edward Scissorhands and Adventure Time. She has a lot of tattoos and feelings.\nAmanda Scurti is a New York-based illustrator, cartoonist and colorist.

She is currently a colorist on Black Mask's We Can Never Go Home and an illustrator for So What? Press's Tales of the Night Watchman series.\nSarah Vaughn and Sarah Winifred Searle\nCharacter designs by Sarah Winifred Searle\nThe Sarahs are doing a classic Regency romance, with lots of attention to period details. Catherine and Andrew are getting married - but neither one of them is happy about it.\nSarah Vaughn is the co-creator and co-writer of Alex + Ada with Jonathan Luna, published by Image Comics. She is an avid lover of historical romance novels and vintage romance comics.\nSarah Winifred Searle hails from spooky New England, where she writes and draws comics about relationships, history, and mysteries. You may recognize her work from Smut Peddler, Colonial Comics, Symbolia, or a bunch of other cool things. She is also exceptional at petting cats. Learn more about her work at swinsea.com.\nSarah Kuhn and Sally Jane Thompson with Savanna Ganucheau on colors\nCharacter designs by Sally Jane Thompson\nSarah, Sally, and Savanna are working on a story about love in a coffee shop \u2013 where barista Ruby is on a mission to help people find love so she doesn't have to deal with people anymore.\nSarah Kuhn is the author of the forthcoming Heroine Complex trilogy, starring Asian American superheroines, for DAW Books and the geek romantic comedy novella One Con Glory, which is in development as a feature film. Her writing has appeared in Uncanny Magazine, Apex Magazine, The Hollywood Reporter, Back Stage, IGN.com, StarTrek.com, Geek Monthly, Creative Screenwriting, and the anthology Chicks Dig Comics.\nSally Jane Thompson is a comic creator based in the UK.

Her work focuses on thoughtful stories drawn with organic, expressive lines.\nSavanna Ganucheau is a colorist and illustrator currently living in Melbourne, Australia.

Flame Con is going to be a blast!\n=============================\nSince 2010, Geeks OUT has organized events throughout the country so queer geeks can meet, mingle, and geek out (it's our name for a reason). Now, we need your help for our biggest event ever.\nIn 2015, we're going to change the geek community in NYC and the greater Northeast by hosting a new comic convention - one made especially for queer fans! \nWhat's Flame Con About? \nCommunity \nThe LGBTQ community is separated into different groups that all too often don\u2019t mix or learn from each other\u2019s experiences: gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, cisgender and trans people, aces and bears\u2026 But comic cons are all about mixing! People of every size, gender identity and expression, age, color and type come to comic conventions to get geeky, expressing what makes each of us different, special, and awesome. A queer comic con is a great way to bring us all together under one roof. We'll learn about ourselves as a community, and explore topics that haven't already been paneled to death at other cons. We want to end the con having brought queer people from different parts of the rainbow closer. \nGeeking Out\nCons are about meeting people face to face. You get to revel in each others' creativity and open spirit. you connect. You realize that you're not alone in what you love. Or who you love - really, there are a lot of similarities between being a geek and being queer. Weird, niche interests don't have to be isolating, and meeting others who are into what you're into makes your passions that much more fun! Come out! You'll find that you're part of something that doesn't just begin and end with the con! \nShowcasing Cool Queer Stuff\nWe love pop culture, and there's a lot happening now in comics, TV and movies that seems to be catering to non-straight tastes. From Orphan Black to Dragon Age to Arrow to Gone Home, there are queer characters and call-outs...subplots and inclusive themes. Sweaty workouts. Girls kissing. Gay gaming options. The entire world of fanfic... Still, enjoyable stories and ideas that are explicitly queer are rare, and often controversial. We've been enjoying queer winks and nods since the dawn of literature. We want to enjoy stories that don't rely on subtext and innuendo to create believable, honest portrayals of LGBTQ experiences. So, let's have a con that just puts it out there! You won't have to scan the floor for a rainbow flag just to find a queer-friendly artist. You won't have to sift through tables and tables of comics just to find a story with two boys or two girls kissing. Think of it: All the amazing queer art you always hope you can find at a big con, ALL IN ONE PLACE!\nGeeks OUT president Joey Stern with Cthulhu and Lewd Alfred Douglas at NYCC 2011\n  Here are some of the awesome things we\u2019re planning to feature at Flame Con!\n\nCreators! \nWe hope to feature dozens of artists and vendors, catering to all kinds of queer tastes and interests.  Come see creators you've always wanted to meet, and meet creators you may have never heard of, but will remember forever! \nNoelle Stevenson (Lumberjanes, Nimona) and Allison Kolarik (Comic Book Afterlife) at our 2014 NYCC signing table.\nIf you or someone you know is a creator who might be interested in exhibiting at Flame Con, check out our \u201cArtist Table\u201d incentive. You can reserve a table at Flame Con right now, at a low early-bird price!\n\nBig Names!\nFlame Con is more about building community than big (and usually expensive) names, but we hope to give you a chance to shake hands with a couple of our favorite celebs. Feel free to let us know if there's anyone in particular you'd like to see, and stay tuned for more updates!\n\nPanels!\nWe want to have discussions you won't hear at a mainstream con, between thoughtful, creative, and hilarious people. What would you like to hear about? What do you want us to explore? Bi erasure? Homophobia and transphobia? Body image issues? Creative processes? Let us know! Flame Con will be a place to engage fans in new conversations, and put forth ideas that will influence pop culture and the LGBT community long after the con wraps up.\n\nAn Art Show!\nFor the past three years, Geeks OUT has held celebrity-themed art shows, each featuring dozens of artists paying tribute to geeky icons important to the LGBTQ community:\nGeeks OUT's last three art shows!\nThis year, we'd like to include a tribute show WITHIN Flame Con! Artists exhibiting at Flame Con will be encouraged to participate, and creators unable to make it to Flame Con can still be a part of the event by contributing to the art show!  \nAnthology!\nGeeks OUT is just getting started on our first ever comics anthology, featuring work from queer and queer-friendly creators around the world. The theme is POWER, and we're super excited to show it to you. We'll be releasing the anthology at Flame Con! Fans at the con will get first dibs on it, and can line right up to get it signed by the creators it features -  several of whom will probably be tabling at Flame Con! \nThe Geeks OUT Anthology Comic is in the works!\nCosplay Parade\nAt the end of the day, we'll host an after-party at a bar within walking distance of the con!

We'd like to spruce it up a bit. Several of our pin-ups are in colour, so we'd like to include some colour pages. AND if we make $10000, we're also hiring colourist extraordinaire Rosemary Cheetham to colour some of our shorter stories.  \n$12,000 Stretch Goal: This Bastard is an Art Aficionado  \nIf we reach 12000, we're going to throw a Gallery Show/Signing/Party in New York City to celebrate our book launch. The gallery show will be called 'The Art of Sherbet' and will feature art from the comic and as many of our pin-ups as possible. Prints will be sold and the artists will benefit directly from the sales. We'll also set up a table where some of us will be selling and signing the book (we'll even fly Josh Mathus out). All Backers are welcome to bring their copies, meet us and get their books signed. Backers will also get a TBD discount off of any work bought at the gallery show.\n\n\nDETAILS ABOUT THE PROJECT:\n\nFor those of you not in the know, SHERBET LOCK (everybody's favourite drug-addicted, lesbian paranormal detective from the future) is the brainchild of writer Michael Vincent Bramley and artist Joshua Mathus. They have been self-publishing Sherbet comics for years and are now asking for your help in bringing their warped, demented spin on Sherlock Holmes to a wider audience.\n\n\"Some how MVB took everything I love and rolled it into one character. Each story is genius!\" - Amy Reeder\n\"A terrific read. Sherbet Lock is what indie comics are all about, and getting it made is what Kickstarter is all about.\"- Brandon Montclare\n\"Sherbet is awesome.\" - Leila Del Duca\n\"'Sherbet Lock' is a satire, but so is 'Don Quixote' and a few dozen other masterpieces of the Western Canon. And like all the best satires, 'Sherbet' embraces the absurdity of its premise but still takes its subject matter just seriously enough for the stories to matter. An important early work by one of the most promising young talents in the field.\" - Josh Elder\nWE WANT TO PRINT OUR BOOK!\nOur goal is simple; we want to print a run of at least 1000 copies of our first Sherbet Trade Paperback and get our vision into as many comic stores, libraries, homes and human minds as possible. \nCover art by Alice Meichi Li (Sherbet logo designed by Jared K. Fletcher).\nWHY SUPPORT THE SHERBET KICKSTARTER?\nSherlock Holmes inspired media is more popular than ever right now, but there is nothing out there quite like Sherbet.\nUnlike any of the other Sherlock types out there (most of whom live in Victorian era, London, or various American cities), Sherbet Lock lives in a retro-futuristic Metropolis called BAKER CITY, where cars fly, the Police Force is openly a cult dedicated to a fictional monster and the hospitals send out Zeppelins filled with creepy bird-masked paramedics (who mainly exist to harvest poor peoples' organs for the benefit of the rich and powerful). \nHowever, none of these factors holds a drippy, atmospheric candle to Baker City's biggest problem, which is that it is infested with the forces of bloody darkness.\nGoblins, Demons, Vampires, Werewolves, Immobile Mummies who want to have sex with you and lactating Bogeymen who want to eat your kids' souls? All of these beasties and many more infest the shadiest corners of this bizarre old hellhole, and that's where Sherbet comes in. \n\nWith all that pressure, is it any wonder that she is addicted to Cocaine (and various other narcotics)? \nLuckily, Sherbet doesn't always have to go it alone, because her world just happens to be filled with characters who are just as bizarre as she is.\nAbove: Sherbet's benevolent mad-scientist twin sister Cayenne Lock attempting to save the Whales by attaching cybernetic spider legs and laser eyes...\nAbove: Lester Gregson and Gregory Lestrade, Shoggoth Yard's most readily available...\n\nThen there are the clients; they all have their own stories, their own problems and their own secrets. \n Above: a Client\nAbove: Another Client\n\nSo there we have it. Read Sherbet, because it's about a hard drinking, retro-futuristic, lesbian drug-addict who solves paranormal mysteries. Read it because the stories are often ugly, generally funny, sometimes genuinely unsettling, and always unpredictable. \nLET'S TALK ABOUT REWARDS!\nWe will be able to fulfill most of the reward tiers immediately once the Kickstarter is funded. \n\nPDFs - \n\nWith the exception of the PDF version of our finished book, (which we are still working on), all of the PDF rewards will be ready to dispatch upon receiving the funds.

Stories we intend to cram into this monster include (but are not limited to)...\n\nPreviously printed in the 2011 Halloween Special: \n\n1: Finger - Sherbet is approached by a woman whose husband has been kidnapped, his attackers having left only his severed finger. \n2: Body - Sherbet's latest client needs her help finding his missing girlfriend, whose apartment disappeared without a trace.\n3: Milk - When kids start vanishing from Baker City, the police department decides to blackmail Sherbet into doing their job for them. \nPreviously printed in the 2012 Summer Special:\n4: Soul - A man of science is haunted by a persistent ghost, so Sherbet ventures to his home to unravel the mystery of why it won't stay exorcised. \n5: Brains - The story of young Sherbet and her sister Cayenne on an average day at Baker City University. \nBrand new Sherbet stories:\n6: Egg - Sherbet sends her twin sister a belated present, after forgetting her birthday. \n7: Palm - Sherbet's inaction leads to the death of a client and, with the help of Detective Inspector Lester Gregson, she attempts to put it right. \n8: Hand - Sherbet wakes up one day to find that the world isn't exactly as it should be, but can't quite put her finger on why. \n9: Lung - A young Sherbet befriends a magical dwarf who lived in her client's walls.\nThe book will be printed with black & white interiors and a page count of approximately 200-250 pages. It will include extras, such as samples of Joshua Mathus's penciled pages, at least one complete script for a short Sherbet comic and lots & lots of additional guest artwork...\nPin-Up Art by MARCUS MULLER\nIT'S ALSO MORE THAN JUST A COMIC! \nYes, the Sherbet TPB will be filled with over one hundred and fifty pages of comic book stories new and old, but did you know that it will also feature a 30+ page art gallery with work by some of the most brilliant artists in comics and illustration? \nPin-Up Art by AMY REEDER\nWe have spent over a year compiling work from some of the best damn artists from all corners of the comic industry and beyond. We have painters, illustrators, cartoonists and artists from Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Image, IDW, 2000AD, Kickstarter, Archie, indie comics, magazines, galleries and more - all to deliver to YOU a stunning and unforgettable pin-up gallery. \nPin-Up & Variant Cover Art by HYEONDO PARK\nArtists included in the gallery are: \nJoshua Mathus (Sherbet, Asimov, Hadron Colliderscope)  \nAlice Meichi Li (Megaman, Elephantmen, Once Upon a Time Machine)  \nMichael Vincent Bramley\nAmy Reeder (Rocket Girl, Halloween Eve, Batwoman)  \nLeila Del Duca (Shutter, The Pantheon Project)  \nFred Hembeck (Marvel Age, Spider-Man, Superman)  \nRob Moran (Ron Fortier's Brother Bones, Prohibition)  \nPaul Hanley (Doctor Who, Godzilla)  \nShaky Kane (Judge Dredd, Elephantmen, The Bulletproof Coffin)  \nTintin Pantoja (Who Is AC?, Hamlet)  \nHyeondo Park (Sam & Lilah) \nN Steven Harris (Watson & Holmes, Voltron)  \nDelia Gable (Dash, A Ninja Named Stan)  \nNate Bear (Three Armed Squid, Bear Brains)  \nN.

We've never relied on sales to deliver the goods before and we won't this time either.\n\nAs for the timing and potential delays? Well our projected date for the completed book is realistic, given what we know about making Sherbet comics, but there's always a chance that something could slow us down. There's no predicting the unpredictable, but we are always prepared for nasty surprises (just like Sherbet).\n\nBut the book is happening, we just need you to help us print it. \n\nWhen working with a printer, there's always a chance, however small, that a flaw in their process (or inability to fulfill our order), could stall this end of the project. That is a risk that goes with any product or process once it's out of your hands, and what matters is that the people in charge - us - will make sure that no potential issues can stop it in its tracks. \n\nWe've also worked hard to devise a list of realistic rewards that we are confident we can provide - and Josh and I have both agreed that we would use every penny of this KS on fulfilling the rewards, if necessary. The book itself, (being 70% complete), will be completed and made available in a PDF format (to all backers who pledged for the completed book) no matter what. If our printing process IS delayed, we promise to release bonus material in PDF form to tide people over.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Life After Kickstarter - Support Sherbet (Again)!", "update_content": "Hello hello,\n\nNow that everyone has their books (correct me if I'm wrong on that!) we're looking to get it out there so that as many people as possible will get to read it.

Weeks go by without turning on my personal computer...my gmail is a joke at the moment...I've told my closest family and friends just to text me if it's urgent at this point. All this to say, it's not just here I've been hard to reach. And even if this weren't the case, what did I have to say? Bad news has stacked up faster than good news. The short version of the bad news is pretty evident at this point...I've blown every deadline in the second half of production at this point, which is really really bad and I apologize for that. Furthermore, the funds raised here for for production only, I was covering creative costs by myself, which I will continue to do. BUT! The old schedule was based on my old income and my new one is very different. Not to go too deep into my finances, but it's going to be a much slower process to get everybody paid out before book 2 goes to press (which is the only way it will go).

I wrote more about this in the afterword, which I shared on Huffington Post.\nSince making Something Terrible available last fall, it has quickly become the most widely reviewed and highly acclaimed work I've ever released. I've been incredibly honored to find my very personal story so well regarded in and outside of my creative community, but more than that, I've been humbled and awed by how many readers around the world related so strongly to my life story, and found new solace in reading it.\nRecently, Something Terrible made several Best Comics of 2013 lists, including those on Wired and Mental Floss. I can't even say what it means to me to have released the story that plagued my inner life, kept secret for decades out of fear of others' misunderstandings, like those I'd seen perpetuated in so many procedural police shows, only to now find so much acceptance and praise for sharing it openly. It's easily the best thing I'll ever do in comics. (But don't worry, I'm not even close to finished making them.)\nMy goal is to print 2000 copies of a new 36 page, high-quality, softcover edition (including a new foreword and additional behind-the-scenes materials), via Print Ninja, who have been helping me work out the logistics. The cover will be matte with spot-gloss, and the interior pages will be glossy. The final book should be priced at ten dollars, retail. I believe this goal is modest, achievable, and will cover the shipping costs for all donors, thanks to the quantity's unit costs, and leave me with a small stock to sell at future conventions.\nAs another childhood hero of mine would say, \"But don't take my word for it.\" Here are some quotes from reviews and recommendations from friends, colleagues, and creators I admire:\nThank you for considering donating to my project.

Thanks everyone! All books will now have beautiful foil cover!!\nA beautiful preview gif made by Rebecca Mock\nUpdate 11/11/13 - We\u2019ve made it!!! Our goal has been met! Hana Doki Kira is going to happen and it\u2019s all because of you! THANK YOU!!!!!  For every additional $3000 we raise, the book will get better, the artists will get more compensation, and you will get more cool swag! There are also secret push goal rewards hidden alongside and between those milestones, so keep your eyes peeled as the numbers go up! Let\u2019s keep up the great work spreading the word about sh\u014djo! \nHana Doki Kira is a collection of comics and drawings from a fantastic group of artists all inspired by Sh\u014djo - a sub-genre of comics that for many of us were among the first illustrated stories we fell in love with. We asked over twenty artists with diverse skills and styles to consider what  Sh\u014djo personally means to them, and to create art based on their interpretations.\nSh\u014djo is known for its distinctive use of flowery imagery, magical plot devices, and romantic themes. Our book takes its title from three key elements of the Sh\u014djo world\u2013 \u2018Hana\u2019 meaning flower, \u2018Doki\u2019 echoing the sound of a pounding heart, and \u2018Kira\u2019-- the impression of sparkling beauty.\n All the art and copy for the Hana Doki Kira book has already been completed and is currently being formatted for print. We have all the content; we just need you to help us make this a reality!\nThe Hana Doki Kira book will be a 120 page limited edition book,  filled to the brim with lovely illustrations and comics from our participating artists. Our goal is to print the book and compensate our contributing artists for their hard work!\n107 pages of illustrations and comics!\n6\u201dx10\u201d perfect-bound book\nA unified seafoam green color palette!\nShowcases both amateur and professional artists!\n1000 books distributed among artists and supporters!\nThe base Kickstarter goal is to fund a limited softcover print run of a thousand books and the production of all the promotional rewards to go with it for example; posters, postcards, etc.\nAdditional funds from the Kickstarter campaign will be used to further foster awareness of artists both amateur and professional, while simultaneously continuing to bring credence to the beautiful, diverse genre that has inspired us all. First, we hope to compensate our artists for the beautiful work that they\u2019ve done!  Then, we plan to allot a certain number of excess books to donate to local libraries, girls\u2019 clubs and anime clubs to help foster the next Sh\u014djo generation!\nOther than the Sh\u014djo theme that pervades throughout the book, all the art inside Hana Doki Kira follows a distinct color scheme - black, white, and seafoam green.  The narrowed scope of color not only ties the book together, but truly showcases all the creative ways in which the artists have employed their limited palette.  Depending on the success of this first book, future volumes of Hana Doki Kira will each have their own unique color attributed to them to create a spectrum of beautiful Sh\u014djo-inspired art!\n All our goal funding will go towards the production of the book and rewards, shipping to our backers, and compensation for the artists who are sparing extra time to draw Commissions for rewards! \n Our rewards include...\nHere are the designs for the Poster & Tote bag.\nThink of all the awesome books and magical companions it\u2019ll be able to hold! It's double-sided!\nNote these are mock-ups: the final poster will have art from every artist.\nNumbers in the icon represent additional rewards. For example The $80 tier includes two of every reward.\nOur goal is to just be able to print and distribute the book, but if our Kickstarter surpasses our goal,  we\u2019ll be able to make the book even better for you and our artists!\nArtist compensation: All our artists have contributed their time and effort for free. Each artist will be receiving copies of the book in return--but we want to give them a little something extra for all their hard work. For each extra $3000 we raise, our artists will receive a small fee per submitted page.\nBook Upgrades: Each time we raise an extra $3000, we\u2019ll also upgrade all books.   \nMET! All books will be printed with a shimmery foil cover. ($12,000)\nIf we meet our second goal, we will include custom Hana Doki Kira bookplate stickers in all book orders. ($15,000)\nIf we reach our third push goal, we\u2019ll upgrade all books to a hardcover edition! ($18,000)\nOur fourth goal is wood-printed charms for all Tier 6 and higher backers. ($21,000)\nBeyond that are even more surprises!\nThe Year 85 Group consists of six friends who all share a mutual passion and appreciation for art.  Sh\u014djo has both kick-started and inspired a large portion of all our creative careers and, taking our cues from the Year 24 Group, a collective of female manga artists who are considered as revolutionaries of Sh\u014djo, we wanted to share that same love of the genre with you!\nAs artists ourselves, we consider it important to compensate artists fairly for their work.  All the contributing artists donated their valuable time to create art for this book and we couldn\u2019t appreciate it more!  For all their effort, we consider it appropriate that the artists who helped make this happen should share in its success.  \nHana Doki Kira is only a peek into the wide range of art that our artists are capable of, so please be sure to check them out on their own sites and portfolios!\nContributing Artists:\nAnnie Stoll\nElisa\nRebecca Mock\nLindsay\nKelly/Hkezza\nenduro\nStefanie Morin / PK\nCatherine\nJanet Sung\nAlex Bahena\nKaitlin Reid\nAlice U.Cheong\nShelly Rodriguez\nCatarina Yuugi\nSarah O\u2019Donnell\nBecca Hillburn\nMegan Brennan\nSloane Leong\nAnna Rose\nKris Mukai\nLeslie Hung\nAimee Fleck\nCarey Pietch\nTim Ferrara\nChelsie Sutherland\nAlice Meichi Li\nSee more art previews and process images at our tumblr, as well as updates about the project and educational resources:\nhanadokikira.tumblr.com | facebook.com/hanadokikira\nWe can\u2019t make this possible without you!

The minimum goal will make possible a hardcover version, complete with sketches, concept art, character portraits and battle scenes. Stretch goals will further upgrade the special edition, adding color, more art and a brand new comic chapter.\nEach special edition book will be signed and numbered. Lower counts (pun, woohoo!) are first come first serve.\nSummary:\nMeet Daniel, a young, starving artist, living in a bloodsucking town. In this first book of a trilogy, the \u201cunturned\u201d Daniel accepts an invitation to a party held by vampires for a chance to meet his first crush, Jessica Winters. It was a very unwise decision and he gets caught up in a rebel uprising against the vampires. It will take nothing short of pure magic to save him.\n\u201cCurse Of The Griffin\u201d is an urban fantasy saga where true friendship is tested and sworn enemies must band together to survive in a world being torn apart by an epic struggle between creatures of magic and an influential vampire cult.\nThe ebook of the novel became available on Amazon, July 13th. You can check it out here: Daniel's Pride on Amazon\nEditor's Endorsement\nWhen Jerome Walford asked me to edit his novel about vampires, I thought, \"Oh no, another vampire book! I don't think so.\" But he was insistent, so I decided to take a look at it. Wow! The opening scene, about ATM-like machines in a bank that withdraw your blood instead of your bank balance, sucked me right in. But make no mistake: This is not a skin-deep horror story about vampires, like so many juvenile novels circulating today. This is a social commentary, an Orwellian tale about a soulless society that drains the lifeblood of its citizens, namely their human creativity. With the possible exception of Bram Stoker's classic, Dracula, Walford's Curse of the Griffin: Daniel's Pride makes most other vampire books pale in comparison. Written in a lighthearted vein, it nevertheless goes for the jugular of an oppressive regime. Read it for its entertainment value; rejoice in its triumph over an engorged plutocracy. Curse of the Griffin: Daniel's Pride is bloody good writing!

This is one of the few comic series I actually look forward to reading and I highly recommend you check out the campaign and consider backing it like I did. Happy new year, Steve!!!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "DAN BERETON'S NOCTURNALS: THE SINISTER PATH GRAPHIC NOVEL", "update_content": "Dear backers who I now consider my friends,\nOn Friday morning, August 22, I took the \"Gazebo\" art prints to the post office and sent them to all of the remaining backers. I then came home, packed up my wife, and headed to Panama City Beach, FL for two weeks to spend time with my terminally ill mother. My sister and her husband also came.

The very first edition came out in 2003.\nphoto by avrenim_acceber\nSO WHAT'S THIS PROJECT ALL ABOUT?\nThe short answer- I'm redoing all of the art in the book- AND adding a section of nursery rhymes! That's right! Another 8 pages will be added to bring the book from it's original 26 pages up to a hefty 60.\nThe new cover!\nLong answer- When I illustrated the first edition of Baby's First Mythos over a decade ago I was still in high school. It was done pretty quick and dirty because frankly, weren't expecting the reception that it got. Three more editions were published, and 40,000 books were printed and sold. And while I'm very proud of how far it's gone, I've been wanting to update it for a very long time. We got the rights to the book back from the publisher in 2012 and I got to work. I hope this whole thing doesn't come across as too George Lucas, but since I'm the one taking on the publishing now I want this book to look the best it's ever looked.\nOOOH! That IS exciting!\n\nThe book itself will be 7\"X9\", black and white and 60 pages long. \nEnjoy some in-progress art! There's more where that came from!\nOKAY, SO I GUESS YOU CAN DRAW, BUT WHAT ABOUT PRINTING?\nActually, since you asked, I have self published before although this is my first crowd sourced book. In 2010, Guilded Age Volumes .5 and 1 came out which were joint efforts in self publishing with the writers of the comic. Then in 2011, I published The World Bestiary on my own.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!\nFor the stretch goals I'll be doing a black and white comic adaptation of the early Lovecraft work \"Herbert West: Reanimator\" as an e-book.\nReanimator is made up of six short stories. With every extra 5k, I'll do another one of the stories and every backer will get a copy added to their tier.\n$15,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"From the Dark\"\n$20,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Plague-Daemon\"\n$25,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"Six Shots by Moonlight\"\n$30,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Scream of the Dead\"\n$35,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Horror From the Shadows\"\n$40,000- Every backer gets a digital copy of the comic adaptation of Herbert West: Reanimator- \"The Tomb-Legions\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm about 60% done with the new art and being a freelance artist by trade- my schedule fluctuates wildly, but I am pretty dedicated to the deadlines I've set. \n\nAlso, I'm down to two printers right now and I'm getting some more details before I finally pick one (they both come to approximately the same price), one of those printers is in China which may cause delays in shipping.\n\nAnd lastly, I don't know how many people will sign up for bookplate versions but I've more or less signed up to potentially do 200 more drawings so that could cause a delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "An Explanation.", "update_content": "The advance copy arrived this morning!

Coulton tweeted back \"DO IT.\" And so they did. \n \"What I love about this project is that it's the crazy kind of thing that just had to happen, and because of Twitter and Kickstarter and the internets, it actually can,\" says Pak. \"Jonathan and I are both working here as independent creators who own our own work. So if he says yes and I say yes and then whoever wants to buy it says yes, this beautiful thing can actually happen.\" \nTakeshi Miyazawa (\"Runaways\") will provide pencils and inks, Jessica Kholinne (\"X-Treme X-Men\") will color, and Simon Bowland (\"Incredible Hercules\") will letter. \n\"This thing has monkeys, robots and zombies. It hit the trifecta,\" says Miyazawa. \"How could I say no?\" \nThe plan is to produce a 60 page graphic novel that will be released digitally in four parts through Monkeybrain Comics and comiXology and then in a collected trade paperback form. \n\"We're very excited to be working with Monkeybrain and comiXology,\" says Pak. \"Monkeybrain has done an amazing job of getting fantastic, genuinely independent creator-owned comics out into the world and comiXology has developed a phenomenal app for viewing comics on digital devices.\"\nKickstarter backers will get each of the digital comics and the hard copy of the graphic novel during an exclusive window before the books are sold to general public. And there are multiple added bonuses possible for Kickstarter backers, including first dibs on a brand new song written and performed by Coulton. \nAnother standout reward is the limited edition Code Monkey figure, sculpted by the acclaimed comic artist Sean Chen from the Takeshi Miyazawa character design. \nWork-in-progress of Sean Chen's sculpt for the Code Monkey figurine! The final figure will be in color -- and will also have a tail and sculpted feet. ;-)\nABOUT THE CREATORS\nGreg Pak is a comics writer and filmmaker best known for his feature film \"Robot Stories\" and comics such as \"Planet Hulk,\" \"Magneto Testament,\" and \"Doctor Strange Season One\" for Marvel and the upcoming \"Batman/Superman\" for DC.

If we can achieve this goal, the HMS Pegasus Deck Plans will be printed as a double-sided 22\" by 34\" poster, rendered in period appropriate style; better, the trade will be revised so, at every level (Cloth Covers, The Style to Which She is Accustomed, and Rare & Royal), each copy will include a built-in pouch affixed to the inside back cover made to hold and preserve the ship blueprints. This will unify the two items as we feel they should be - the story and the ship - and add what we feel is a final touch of class and elegance to this unique edition.\nTwo Stretch Goals at the same level? Madness! But, as Eric put it, he's going to put his mouth where you money is. Webmaster, editor, academic, and bon-vivant Eric Newsom has vowed that, should we achieve the incredible goal of reaching 150K in backing by the end of our campaign, he will, \"don a pirate costume and record myself singing Better Far to Live and Die from Gilbert & Sullivan's \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (accompanying myself on ukelele).\"\nHe's been practicing. He has located his eye-patch, and forsaken his dignity. How can you refuse this challenge?\nThe Goals We've Achieved Thus Far\nWe are stunned and delighted to have reached our initial goal with such speed. In fact, we didn't just reach it, we left it so far in the dust that we've already surpassed our first - modest - stretch goal!\nThe Lady Sabre Paper Doll Set - This is two sheets, one with Her Ladyship and accoutrement, and a second with additional clothes, bells and whistles. This set is included with every copy of the book, and the PDFs of the two sheets are now included in the All Digital, All the Time level. You'll be able to print as many as you like! Each sheet will be single-sided, printed in full color, on 100lb matte or the nearest equivalent.\nThe Pocket Guide to the Sphere, by Edwin Windsheer - Written by the notorious chronicler of the Sphere himself, this is a 64-page casebound book, Smythesewn, printed in black-and-white, and designed to look and feel like \"the real thing.\" Containing essays, articles, sketches, and maps, all purportedly by Windsheer himself, this is a world-building document that provides a unique window into Lady Sabre's journeys. The book will measure 3.5\" by 5\" (we're serious, it's pocket-sized!), not unlike a small Moleskine notebook. This will now be included with every pledge of $30 or higher, and the PDF version will be included in the All Digital, All the Time package.\nThe Annotated Process of Lady Sabre - For those of you who've been reading us at ineffableaether.com, you know that we post the scripts along with each screen. Due to size constraints, we were forced to omit the scripts from the Lady Sabre Vol. 1 trade (seriously, we tried to make it work, but it would've brought the book to over 300 pages, and over $50/copy, never mind the postage). With this stretch goal unlocked, we can now go one-better - The Annotated Process of Lady Sabre is a 128-page softcover book, 6x9, containing all the scripts from Chapters 1 through 5 with notes and annotations. In addition to scripts, the book contains never-before-seen sketches and design work from both Rick and Eric, with their notes and comments, as well. This is an insider's look at the creation of our story, our world, and how we've striven to execute it.\nA Better Book For All - This is an across-the-board alteration to the Lady Sabre & The Pirates of the Ineffable Aether Vol. I trade. Here are the specifics. These changes will apply to every edition of the Lady Sabre & The Pirates of the Ineffable Aether Vol. I trade, regardless of edition.\nCase - This is the actual cover of the book. It will now be 3.5mm board wrapped in black Saifu cloth with foil-stamping on the spine and face.\nEndpapers - These are now to be printed on 140 GSM woodfree, to prevent cracking and damage through use and/or age, and will be printed in a 2cx2c process, meaning there will be two colors used. This will allow us - if we reach our next goal - to use one of the maps as the endpapers.\nInterior - Paper weight is now increased to 128 GSM matte. This will preserve the reproduction of the art and color, and prevent any bleed-through of the pages.\n\nThe Cartographer's Craft - At this level, Sterling Hershey will be commissioned to create the Map of the Known Sphere as of IV.E.890 (this is our dating convention in the series). This will be a large, \"flattened\" map of the Lady Sabre world as it had been explored thus far. This map will be included in the Vol. I trade andwill further be the central design element of the endpapers on the book.\nAdditionally, Sterling will revisit the maps seen in the series thus far (the Tanitin Frontier and the Coming Storm), giving them professional treatment that will also be reflected in the trade.\nRick 2.0 - If we reach this level of backing, we will be able to achieve one of our most-needed goals, but one we've been frankly reluctant to consider. The fact is, Rick is working on tragically out-of-date equipment, working in an analogue fashion on a digital product. His computer needs upgrading, but more crucially, the small Wacom tablet he's been using since we began is in need of replacing. We want to set Rick up with a new Cintiq monitor and accompanying system. Doing this will not only allow Rick to increase the speed at which he works, but will result in, we believe, a visible enhancement to all our visuals, from the webcomic to the printed trade, and all stops in-between.\nHMS Pegasus Deck Plans - If we achieve this Stretch Goal, Sterling Hershey will bring to life Her Ladyship's conveyance with a set of deck plans of Pegasus. Working with Rick and Greg, this will be a minimum of four sheets or their equivalent, detailing each deck of the ship, and potentially as many as eight, showing detail, cut-aways, and close-ups. These will be printed on high-quality paper, in a \"blueprint\" style, and designed to replicate the ship plans of the era. A complete set of these deck plans will be included with every copy of the book (Cloth Covers, The Style to Which She is Accustomed, and the Rare & Royal editions) as well as be included in the All Digital, All the Time package.\nPLEASE NOTE\nYour support and backing has been so overwhelming, we are now able to include a copy of The Annotated Process of Lady Sabre as well as The Pocket Guide to the Sphere with each edition of the trade. \nPresenting the first trade collecting Chapters One through Five of the webcomic Lady Sabre & The Pirates of the Ineffable Aether in a 192-page, full-color, hardcover edition.\nLady Sabre & The Pirates of the Ineffable Aether is a webcomic created by Eisner Award winners Rick Burchett (The Batman and Robin Adventures, The Superman Adventures, Blackhawk, She-Hulk) and Greg Rucka (Whiteout, Stumptown, The Punisher, Detective Comics, Queen & Country, Alpha). Rick handles the beautiful art and Greg provides the story and the words. The whole work is overseen by editor, designer, and web-guru Eric Newsom.\nLady Sabre's world is one of danger, adventure, and deception, filled with clockwork monstrosities, dire magic, and noble hearts. It is a world flavored by Victorian England and late 19th century Europe and the Old West. It is a world of cannon fire and steel meeting steel, brass gears meshing seamlessly with steam-driven pistons, a world of passion and humor and a dash of romance.\nAs for Rick and Greg, they met many a year ago while working for DC Comics, putting the Dark Knight through his paces atop the roofs of Gotham. A long friendship was born in the discovery that they shared many of the same passions in comics and novels and movies. They loved westerns, pulps, steampunk, sci-fi, serials, you name it, they dug it. Very early on, they decided they needed a place to tell stories all their own, full of the glee and joy that infused so many of their shared influences. Ultimately, they created the Lady Sabre webcomic as a means to that end, a way to pursue the characters and stories they wanted to tell, without restraint or censure.\nVideo by Nicholas Rucka and Maboroshii Productions.\nHer Ladyship's distinctive silhouette.\nLady Seneca Sabre is the 14th Marchioness of Cascadia, and captain of the good ship Pegasus. Her Ladyship is at once spy, thief, swordsmaster, (minor) witch, author of scandalous erotica, and gifted with the violin. Her Ladyship, as she is the first to tell you, is just generally fabulous.\nShe sails the Aether \u2014 a near-endless expanse of unfathomable near-emptiness \u2014 between floating Lands in pursuit of glory, gold, a dash of magic, and her own, unknown, agenda. Along her way, she encounters villains, rogues, madwomen, and two stalwart defenders of the law - the Marshal Miles Drake, and his Deputy Keyton Drum.\nFrom left to right, Deputy Drum, Marshal Drake, and Lady Sabre\nLady Sabre & The Pirates of the Ineffable Aether, Volume I, is the first collection of the strips - or more precisely, \u201cscreens\u201d - published on the website www.ineffableaether.com. This is a 192-page hardcover collection that covers the first five chapters of our epic, plus bonus content, and is the first part of what will ultimately comprise \"The First Book of Sabre.\"\nThis campaign exists to fund the Exclusive Kickstarter Edition of this trade. This collection will contain all of the screens comprising our first five chapters, beginning with a rather fabulous swordfight atop a zeppelin, and including a gunfight with some tough hombres in a one-horse town, a meeting with a witch, the revelation of a map that will Change the Face of the World, and the subsequent discovery of those malevolent forces seeking to thwart Her Ladyship in her quest.\nIt\u2019s a lot, honestly, it's over 160 pages of comic already completed and ready to go, and - as you might expect - it's also a wonderful introduction to our world, our story, and our adventure.\nMock-up of the case, without jacket, showing spine.\nThe Style to Which She is Accustomed edition, cover treatment mock-up (without book jacket)\nThis edition will also include material from the Almanac that is maintained on the website, with entries explaining the world of the Sphere, as well as Kickstarter-specific content, including pin-ups from many amazing and established artists; an exclusive short-story written by Greg; and a brand new article, \u201cThe Legend of Lady Sabre,\u201d written by the notorious chronicler of the Sphere, Edwin Windsheer.\nMock-up of interiors as laid out.\nThe complete collection will be:\n192 pages\nFull color\n\u201cLandscape\u201d orientation, to preserve the size and composition of the original art, at 11\" by 8.5\".\nPrinted on 120 GSM matte, to reproduce the color and tone of the original art.\nSmythesewn (not glued!).\nHardcover (cloth) with foil stamping on the spine and cover for added elegance.\nJacketed, with a wrap-around cover on semi-gloss in full color, featuring all-new artwork by Rick Burchett.\nThis, as you can imagine, will be a hefty volume, suitable for reading, looking quite impressive on your coffee table or bookshelf, or repelling boarders if required.\nOne of the pin-ups, contributed by the amazing Karl Kerschl.\nThe money raised in this campaign will:\nPay for our initial print run of 2000 copies.\nPay for shipping supplies, postage, and labor.\nCover fees incurred by Kickstarter and similar attendant charges, including credit card processing and taxes.\nWe recognize that we're not asking for a modest amount. This is not a modest project. Publishing costs money, and the nicer the book, the greater the cost. We want to make a very nice book, indeed, one that we're proud to call ours, and one that you'll be proud to do the same.\nOur specific costs breakdown are as follows.

You are free to add as many items as you like, or multiples of the same item, ie, you've pledged at PLATED, but you want two of the dog tags, as well. We can do that!\nRight now, add-ons are for those items and services in unlimited numbers, with the sole exception of the RARE & ROYAL add-on. In other cases of limited number offerings (the OBJET D'ART level, for instance), we're still trying to figure out what we can do. We will, as always, keep you posted.\nHere's what you do:\nMake a pledge at the Reward level of your choice. In the case of limited-number items, you should absolutely do this first, before they're all gone.\nUse the MANAGE YOUR PLEDGE button to adjust the dollar amount of your pledge to incorporate the add-ons of your choice from the list below. Example: You pledged PLATED for $50, but you'd like a keychain. The keychain is offered as a $10 add-on, so your new - managed - pledge is $60.\nWhen our Campaign has ended, we will be in touch with you via the Kickstarter Survey function. At that time, we will verify with you your Add-Ons.\nHere's the revised Add-On List. It is likely (though not guaranteed) that we'll be offering additional items and services through this list, including new items not included in the Rewards, as the campaign moves forward.\nAdd-On - Any single Tintype-Style Portrait - $5 (You will be asked to specify which character via Survey following the end of the campaign).\nAdd-On - Tintype Triptych - $10\nAdd-On - Patches - Privateer, both patches. Letter of Marque included - $25\nAdd-On - Patches - Cowpoke, both patches. Letter of Authorization included - $25\nAdd-On - Dog Tag - $15\nAdd-On - Keychain - $10\nSPECIAL - Add-On - Rick's Remarque to RARE & ROYAL, penciled and inked - $50\nAdd-On - The Book in Cloth Covers - $30 (add $10/copy for domestic shipping, $30/copy for international)\nAdd-On - Plated - $40 (add $10/copy for domestic shipping, $30/copy for international)\nAdd-On - Inscribed - $50 (add $10/copy for domestic shipping, $30/copy for international)\nAdd-On - The Style to Which She is Accustomed Edition - $80 (add $10/copy for domestic shipping, $30/copy for international)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have gone to great lengths to limit our risks and challenges in this Kickstarter campaign.

All members of the creative team are Denver locals.\nThe story is about four teenagers who must face an amazing and dangerous reality when they are mysteriously granted the super powers they made up as children. I'm looking to paint a very grounded picture of young adults shouldered with an impossible situation how their actions/choices determine their fates.

At a young age, he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor; a kind the medical community has never witnessed before. On Milton's 18th birthday, the tumor erupted and power exploded from his body. It was a sublime force that that changed the world, especially for his friends who now have the powers they fantasized about as children. It was everything Milton could have wished for... except the event killed him.\nL to R: Oliver Grey, Zhen Ferris, Simon Cotey, Kelsey Radcliffe\nL to R: Firefly, Machina, Vanguard, Divinity\nSimon, Kelsey, Zhen and Oliver must come together to uncover the mystery behind their radical transformations while struggling to maintain control over their lives.

But wait... superpowers exist only in fantasy right? \nZhen Ferris (Divinity) has focus issues...\nMilton's death left his massive hilltop house unattended and the newly-minted Pantheon has taken residence. Kelsey (Vanguard) insists they use the space to learn how to control their powers.

It is not however the type of read that lends itself well to actually being pinned down in a description any longer than, \u2018you must have this\u2019.\u201d\nClive Barker: (author, director, Hellraiser, Weaveworld): \u201cI was, and am, a huge fan of Starstruck, which I think was one of the most brave and elegant experiments in comic book story-telling.\u201d \nJohnny Bacardi, Pop Dose: \u201cSimply one of the best comics series I\u2019ve ever read, full of Elaine Lee\u2019s Altmanesque storytelling style, challenging and never inclined to spoon-feed the reader; featuring clever dialogue and memorable characters. And on top of that, it\u2019s illustrated by one of the modern masters, Michael W. Kaluta, who\u2019s never been better\u2026 A+\u201c \nMike Carey: (The Unwritten, X-Men Legacy, Lucifer) Favorite comic book of all time? \u201cStarstruck, by Lee and Kaluta.\u201d \nJohn Hilgart, The Comics Journal: \u201cAnd so you can become immersed in Starstruck in a different ways. You can sift for clues, move back and forth among pages, checking, verifying, assembling. Or you can simply give yourself over to it, and sink into each deeply imagined and beautifully rendered scene and character.\u201d\nGreg Burgas, Comic Book Resources: \u201cI read this, I love it, and I soak up the art. Kaluta is masterful, with amazing detail, exciting scenes of explosions and chases through space... I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve mentioned how very funny this comic is.\u201d \n\u201cIT\u2019S A TOUGH GALAXY, BUT SOMEBODY\u2019S GOTTA PAY FOR IT.\nIT MIGHT AS WELL BE YOU!\u201d\nStretch Goal Incentives\nHere are a few of the Stretch Goal Incentives any that backer who has pledged at least $35 to get the book will receive, as we hit important milestones on our way to the $69,000 Full-Color Book:\n$47,000 a Kalif Bajar postcard - Unlocked!\n$49,000 a Brucilla the Muscle postcard - Unlocked!  \n$51,000 a Verloona Ti postcard - Unlocked!  \n$53,000 a Rah El Rex postcard - Unlocked!  \n$55,000 a Limited Edition Print of Llyn Hunter\u2019s Harry Palmer - Unlocked!  \n$57,000 a Bronwyn of the Veil postcard - Unlocked!\n$59,000 a Dwannyun of Griivarr postcard - Unlocked!   \n$61,000 a Brucilla disguised as a Krabian Slave postcard - Unlocked!\n$63,000 Harry Palmer: Starstruck in glorious color! - Unlocked!\n$65,000 PDF of the whole Book in Michael\u2019s exquisite black line - Unlocked! \n$67,000 a Glorianna and Harry postcards, to complete a set of 12 - Unlocked! \n$69,000 a limited Edition Print of Lee Moyer\u2019s Glorianna   \n$71,000 a \"Hand for Each Hand\" Droid Wars Mission Patch.\nAbove $71,000 Shhhh!

But we can promise to get your rewards to you, as soon as is humanly possible.\n\nThere is also a slight risk that we will make our basic goal, but not make enough to hire a color artist to fully paint the book. If we make some, but not all of the extra money, we will continue to take pre-orders through our website, while Elaine, who has worked as a comic colorist, flat-colors the pages. We would then hire an artist to do the painting over her flats. (Elaine flatted most of the art you see on this page, including the cover.) Let me assure you that, even though the black and white book would be beautiful, we very much want to send you a full color book and will do everything in our power to make that happen. You can help us with that, by spreading the word about our Kickstarter.\n\nAlso, we understand that it's hard to wait for the rewards you so richly deserve, so everyone who donates at a level that gives them our book, will receive PDFs of the pages, chapter by chapter, as we complete them. Sort of like getting those 22-page comics each month. You'll see our progress and you won't have to wait for the book to start reading the story.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #63", "update_userinfo": "Alrighty then!", "update_content": "Hello again!\nI've been sending out Starstruck: Old Proldiers Never Die books to a few folks who wrote to say they never got theirs.

And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book gets a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.\n$120k - Either a second 6-8 page supplemental story, or the first supplement will be expanded to 12-16 pages. PDF/digital delivery only; every backer $9-PDF level and above will receive this exclusively. And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book will get a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS postcard and a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.\n$150k - Jim will shave his head. (Pretty sure we're not making this one, --I hope-- but if we do, it will be filmed and put up for viewing.) (PS: There's no allowance here for back-outs and denied credit cards; if my hair is going, it's at 150k for real)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nONE LAST REWARD\nIt's the final days of the campaign, and we've come up with a high-end unique pledge reward to -hopefully- give us a significant boost towards our final stretch goal. We're offering a one of a kind edition of Jim Calafiore's script notes and layouts. \n\"When I begin a new book, I print out the script one script-page to an 8 1/2 x 11 page. On these I make my notes to myself, and questions to ask the writer. I also do a pen thumbnail of how I'll lay out the page. The next step is a rough pencil sketch on layout paper about half the size of the final art board, which -for the final penciling- is blown up and transferred to the full size art board using a light box.\" \nThis is an opportunity to own all of Jim's script pages with notes and thumbnails, and all the original layout roughs for the whole main story of LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS. The volume will be over 160 pages (more if we exceed the 105k stretch goal), more than 80 pages of Jim's original pencil layouts, showing his creative process. Also included will be Jim's original layouts for both the regular and alternate covers for the graphic novel, as well as a selection of the original character pencil roughs. \nThis will be bound in a single hardcover volume, a little larger than 8 1/2 x 11. The cover will feature the same art as the regular graphic novel. There will be a foreword by Jim, and an afterword by Gail, and the book will be signed by both Gail and Jim. Being all original art, this will of course be a single edition. The pledge level will be $4,000. \nWe are limiting this to CONTINENTAL US ONLY because, to be honest, it scares the willies out of us to think about shipping a one-of-a-kind out of the country. If you are outside the continental US, but plan to attend a convention in the US that Jim or Gail will be attending, you can pledge for the book and pick it up there. (Jim's website jimcalafiore.com lists his con schedule, and he usually does at least the same shows each year. And both Gail and Jim definitely do San Diego Comic Con.) \nAs an additional bonus, for any backer who pledges for this volume, if you are attending a convention that either Gail or Jim or both are attending, you can choose to receive the book personally at a lunch with the creator(s).\n------------------------------------------------------\n112 PAGE STRETCH GOAL\nWe exceeded $92k!\nOnward and upward. Our next goal is more pages. The stretch goal to increase the page count to 112 pages is $105k. These would be story pages, not filler. We'd love the opportunity to put even more into the story. And we think we have a serious chance of reaching the next goal.\nThe support has been amazing; and just looking at the number we've reached already is extremely gratifying. Shows not only what the fans can do, but what Kickstarter can be for so many creators. Direct connection with no middlemen.\nThanks\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$86k unlocks the Comixology digital comic. We're contracting with Comixology to help fulfill our digital rewards commitment. They will take our book and convert it to a digital comic that works with their app, and feature all the functionality like double-tap zoom. (All backers at the PDF level and above will get a code to use at Comixology to download the digital comic for free. We will still be sending the PDF to all those backers.) Comixology will also host a small preview of the book for free download when it's ready.\n$92k As mentioned below, we've been hoping to reunite the Secret Six team, and bring the excellent colorist Jason Wright on board. We definitely had a great working rapport with him, and he brought so much to the series. Jason won't have any personal stake in the book, so he'd be hired basically as an independent contractor. And in this same goal, we'll be looking to bring on a separate letterer who will also be handling our pre-press file handling, getting it ready for the printer, freeing us up creatively.\n(Folded into both of those is also an accommodation for the fact that we've happily exceeded our 3,000 book print run estimate, and are into the next level of printing costs.)\nWe're looking into the goal after that, and hoping to expand to 112 pages which will let us open and deepen the story even more. We're looking into budget and pricing for that (besides printing, there's the added freight and shipping costs because of increased weight). We figure that will be somewhere over 100k; we'd be beyond thrilled if we can get that far, but don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're grateful for how far you've gotten us already.\n                                  ---------------------------------------\nAs of the $81k goal, the book is now hardcover; all copies shipped will be hardcover.\n                                    -----------------------------------\nWe are also offering a signed bookplate to be included with the book. If you'd like that, you have to add $10 to your pledge (to cover our printing, shipping and inserting of the book plates). A few of the rewards have it listed, but it applies to all rewards. Any reward pledge that includes the actual book increased by that $10 will get the bookplate included. (The $10 does not apply to the two 10-book bulk rewards; those backers add $25) There's more explanation in the FAQ and UPDATES.\nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a thrilling, original 80 page graphic novel of suspense and terror in a superhero universe gone horribly wrong, where a small band of survivors face the horror of both their formerly beloved protectors, and the dark secrets within themselves. Featuring the creative talents of writer Gail Simone and artist Jim Calafiore this is a story of violence, fear, hope and --if they're lucky-- survival. \nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be brought to you by the team behind DC Comics' critical smash, SECRET SIX. IGN.COM called the final issue of Secret Six, \"the best single comic issue of 2011,\" and in this dark ride of a story, we go even wilder! LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a journey, by two professional creators, with no holds barred and no limits imposed. Our groundbreaking work on SECRET SIX was only the beginning. If you thought that was dark...\nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be a new and complete story in a single 80 page volume. Bonus materials will include development sketches, single page illustrations by some of the biggest names in comics, a forward by industry legend MARK WAID, and a short prose story in the LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS universe by Gail Simone. \nInitial plans are for the graphic novel to be available only through this Kickstarter drive. We're handling everything, including shipping of the individual books to pledges of $15 or above. There's additional goodies to be had with higher pledge incentives, listed down the right side of the page. The rewards will ship at different times. Some incentives, like the print or commission art, will ship within months; the graphic novel will ship in early 2013. \nThis an example of the 9x12 commission\nThis is an example of the 11x17 commission\nPlans are to keep the printing in the US, (the same printer and specs as the last Secret Six trade, THE DARKEST HOUSE), and if possible to reunite with another of the SIX team, colorist Jason Wright. And if we're lucky, and the funding goal is exceeded enough to afford it, we hope to expand the page count. \n We're working on the book now, so please check back for more preview art as it's done. Thanks so much for considering our project.\nABOUT THE CREATORS\nGAIL SIMONE is the multiple award winning writer of WONDER WOMAN, BIRDS OF PREY, DEADPOOL, THE SIMPSONS, and many other classic runs of some of the world's most popular comics. She has also written for animation, prose and video games.

I'd never read it, or at least I don't remember reading it, but I was profoundly moved by it. It was strange, but it's like a personal metaphor of the way my life has been going for the last two years. There are things happening around me, big things, personal things. Some will happen sooner than later. \nI find myself disturbed by the tone some things are taking in the industry. Darkness where darkness didn't dwell, bitterness for the sake of \"relevance\". it seems that in certain corners, there's no room for magic, and light. It bothers me more than I can say. This not to say that superhero stories can't be serious, or adult. However you can achieve those things without making them dire, and unlikeable. I need to be the one to make the changes I want to see.\n I can only say \"I\" because my tastes only end at the tip of my nose. There is room for fun, there is room for magic, there is room for genuine good in comics.I need to be the agent of change now. I've been moving towards it, now I need to step up that effort.\nOh, the places I will go.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Jamal Igle and I\u2019m a 22 year veteran of the comic book industry, having drawn everything from Action Comics to Firestorm the nuclear man, 52, Countdown, Daredevil/Shi, Iron Man, Iron Fist/ Wolverine, KISS, New Warriors, Noble Causes, Nightwing, Spider-man, Supergirl, Superman and Zatanna. My work has appeared in projects for the European market such as L'arm\u00e9e Des Anges for Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9 and Perry Rhodan, reprinted in a number of languages internationally. I\u2019m also a former editor, marketing executive and art director, I\u2019ve worked in television animation on series such as Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles and Max Steel. Last year, I received the Inkpot Award for achievement in comic art. Currently I\u2019m completing work on KISS for IDW Publishing and SMALLVILLE Season 11 for DC COMICS.\nWHO IS.....\nMolly Danger is the story of the world\u2019s most powerful 10-year-old girl. A seemingly immortal, super strong hero, Molly has protected the city of Coopersville for the last 20 years.\nAn animated styled Molly treatment Rich Maurizio and I drew in 2004\n\nKept in constant isolation and watched closely by D.A.R.T. (The Danger Action Response Team) an organization created to assist in her heroic deeds and monitor her movements, Molly battles the Supermechs. A team of cybernetically enhanced beings with unusual powers, Molly always defeats them and yet they always managed to mysteriously escape. Molly longs for a real life, with a real family, something she\u2019s been told she can never have. Her life changes when D.A.R.T. recruits a new pilot, Austin Briggs. Briggs has his own motivations for joining the team, newly remarried; Austin is having trouble forming a relationship with his new stepson, Brian. Austin wants to use his connections to impress Brian, an avid Molly Danger fan. However things get turned on its ear when Molly and Brian form a friendship of their own.\nShe believes she\u2019s an alien, whose family died when their ship crash-landed on Earth and before the atmosphere could fully alter them. She also believes that she\u2019s alone, the last of her kind.\nEverything she knows is wrong.\nThe Origin of Molly Danger\nThe original character turnaround sheet I drew back in 2001\nMolly was conceived originally on a car ride with my friend, Rich Maurizio back in 2001. At the time we were trying to pitch Molly as an animated series but later decided to re-envision the project as a comic book series. We began production 2002; with the intention of self-publishing through Rich\u2019s company Airwave Comics. \nAs my career picked up it became harder for me to take the time to draw the book. We then hired another artist (Sonic the Hedgehog Artist Jamal Peppers) to redraw the script I had written at the time. Eventually the project fell apart due to time commitments. I never abandoned the concept and would continue to revisit the possibility over the next three years. In the mean time, life changes. I signed a six-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. I got married and had a daughter; I became a teacher and a lecturer, traveling around the world to conventions and conferences. In all that time, I never abandoned my girl. \nIn  2008 I became the artist of the comic book series, Supergirl and something became very clear to me. Whenever I would talk to fans, two things kept coming up. One was the lack of all ages\u2019 material in the U.S. Comics market. The second was the lack of female heroes who weren\u2019t an offshoot of a male hero or weren\u2019t sexually exploitive. That\u2019s when the seed really began to take root again and why I\u2019m now attempting this massive undertaking. This is my solo first creator owned project. I also co-created the miniseries Venture with Noble Causes,Dynamo 5 and Near Death writer/ creator Jay Faerber in 2003. \nThis, however, is a story that I feel needs to be told and that now is the time to tell it.\nSample art\nWhat will the money be used for?\nMolly Danger is planned as a 4 book 8.5 x 12 Hardcover, European format Graphic Album series scheduled to be published beginning September/October of 2013. I'll be re-writing the script and redrawing the book, since I think I've improved artistically since 2004.\nEssentially you're pre-ordering this limited edition. \nThe money will go to the production, printing and shipping of a Molly Danger: Book One limited edition of 2000 copies available only to Kickstarter backers. The funds will also be used to create and ship the incentives being offered.  Any additional funds raised for  Book one will immediately be used for Book Two and so on. The series is set to ship bi annually (Two books per year) and once completed will be packaged as a collected 200 page graphic novel.\nWe also stretch rewards planned should we surpass our initial funding goal.\nAs you may be aware, producing a book of this type, in the format size and scope I'm planning is an expensive endeavor. The money raised will be used to hire professional talent to help me flesh out Molly's world.\nArt by Sonic the Hedgehog artist, Jamal Peppers \n I have assembled a top-notch creative team in inker Juan Castro (G.I.Joe: Snake Eyes for IDW, Incorruptible for Boom Studios, Elders of the Rune Stone) and Colorist Michael Watkins (Sonic the Hedgehog, Transformers).\nI've teamed up with Action Lab Entertainment, a publisher known for their high quality, all ages, creator owned products, such as the Glyph award and Will Eisner Award nominated series Princless. They also feature other diverse genre projects such as Jetta: Tales of the Toshigawa, Fracture and Double Jumpers.\nFormed by four independent creators with over 20 years of media experience and creator-owned content, Action Lab Entertainment\u2019s goal is to develop, create and distribute original comic book series as well as create original animated and various forms of entertainment that challenges and competes with the media industry as a whole.\nConcept art of the Supermechs Bonnie Double, Two Fisted Tommy and Lil' Cavey\nWhy aren\u2019t you drawing it now? Why wait until December?\nMostly because I\u2019m currently busy with other projects, However I'm currently hard at work writing a new draft of the book one script. The plan is to begin penciling in December and have book one completed by July of 2013\nWhy should I pledge to this project?\n Molly Danger is a concept and a character that I believe is needed in the current marketplace. I\u2019ve been in this business a long time and have watched it become darker and direr for years. As the father of a young girl, I\u2019ve found myself disheartened that there isn\u2019t a female superhero character for my daughter to read that hasn\u2019t been turned into a killer, or overtly sexualized. A character that isn\u2019t joined at the hip to a male hero or subservient to one. I like to think of Molly as a cross between Astroboy and the Powerpuff girls, the perfect type of character for young, burgeoning superhero fans. \nThere's room in the comics market place for more all ages action adventure stories.\nI believe in Molly, so much so that I'm putting my money where my mouth is. One person who pledges $10,000 dollars or more will receive 38 pages of original art from Book one. Ten others who donate $1,000 or more will receive a page on top of the other incentives I'm offering starting with:\nThe D.A.R.T.  Membership Card which will give you exclusive members only access to the Molly Danger production blog. Backers will be able to track the development from scripting, to design to finished pages, etc.\nNot final product\nMolly Danger T-Shirts and More!\nAll rewards will be shipped in stages\n The membership cards will ship to all backers first followed by posters, T-shirts, preview material and the rest. There will be new rewards shipped to each backer at each stage of completion.\nThank you for taking the time to look at my Kickstarter page and for your kind consideration.\n$500 commission reward sample", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "The new Molly Danger Campaign is now live!", "update_content": "We're up and running.

The idea is to produce the issues, have them ready for solicitation before hand and ready to print so that they ship on time. I\u2019ll continue to produce the hardcovers after every two issues, in the same format as Book One. Action lab Entertainment will continue to act as the publisher for the ongoing series.\n\n I\u2019ve also teamed up with and we\u2019ll be offering a special subscription to the series for backers. You\u2019ll receive your issues before they\u2019re available for purchase on Comixology to the general public, months before they hit comic store shelves. If you\u2019re able to pledge to the campaign, I thank you one again. If you can\u2019t contribute to the campaign financially, but can spread the words about what I\u2019m doing, I thank you as well.\n One of the ways we\u2019re trying to spread the word is through THUNDERCLAP. It's the world's first crowdspeaking platform, and over 3 million people have donated their social reach for ideas and causes that matter. If you go to the thunderclap Molly Danger page at and hit think, you\u2019ll add your social media contacts to the campaign. If I can get 250 people to join this launch, it will automatically share the campaign through your social networks. As always, I can\u2019t thank you enough for your support.\n\n Jamal"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "The Molly Danger Book Two campaign needs your help.", "update_content": "I\u2019m writing you today because I need your assistance.

Click here for a table explaining what's included at what level.\nUPDATE: Our second stretch goal is \"Triton of the Sea\"!\nIf this campaign can reach $47,000, we'll be publishing not only Unico and ATOMCAT but also Tezuka's adventure classic \"Triton of the Sea!\"\nIn Vol. 1... a baby is found abandoned by the sea, bringing in his wake a terrible tsunami. As he grows up in urban Tokyo, he discovers his true identity: Triton, the last survivor of the destruction of Atlantis by the god Poseidon. With his dolphin Luka by his side, Triton sets off on a journey to discover the truth behind his origins, and avenge his family.\nEventually, in Vol. 2, Triton starts a family of his own, but he doesn't have time to enjoy domestic bliss. A final battle is brewing between the god of the sea and the prince of the mermen. Meanwhile, Triton\u2019s people face the specter of extinction at the hands of human hunters.\nA coming-of-age tale set again the background of an epic adventure, Triton of the Sea is acclaimed for its thrilling art and action as well as its moral and environmental themes. With cautionary messages about human prejudice and our fragile world, Triton blends a touching family tale with a global battle for the soul of the sea!\nTriton was also adapted into a classic animated series directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, creator of \"Mobile Suit Gundam.\"\nHere's how we'll do it:\nPaperback\nSize: A5 (5.875\"x8.25\"), same as our other Tezuka releases \nPages: 488+440 \nRelease dates: June 2013/August 2013 \nMSRP: $19.95 per volume\nIf we hit $47,000, anyone who chooses a reward level worth more than $50 will receive Vol. 1, and anyone who chooses a reward level worth more than $100 will receive both volumes. (For more details on what reward will be included with what level see this table.) If we can get Triton, we'll have four Tezuka books to release to you over the next year. Think of it as a Tezuka subscription plan!\nUPDATE: OUR FIRST STRETCH GOAL is Tezuka's own \"Astro Boy\" spinoff, ATOMCAT!\nThis is a delightful update on his most famous character. For more and a video about it, see our latest update!\nIf we can hit $26,000, we'll publish ATOMCAT as well as Unico! Here's how to get your copy:\nYou'll notice we've added some new pledge levels. The ones that say ATOMCAT include a copy of the book and other goodies. You're welcome to use them!\nIf you just want to add a copy of ATOMCAT to your current pledge, simply add $12 to your pledge. It's that easy. We'll confirm with you that you want a copy of ATOMCAT during the survey process later.\nWe're doing stickers and T-shirts for ATOMCAT too! They're going to be adorable!\nAnd if we can hit $26,000, we'll announce an even more exciting stretch goal... this one is really going to blow your mind.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Even though we just added these rewards Kickstarter mixed them in with the Unico ones. The Unico rewards do NOT include ATOMCAT (even if they say \"includes previous rewards\"). The $45 pledge, for example, includes only the Unico book, the Unico PDF/stickers and the $5 reward. To get ATOMCAT you must choose a reward that says ATOMCAT in the name. Sorry for the confusion!\nThanks for putting Unico over the top in just FIVE DAYS! We're looking forward to bringing this little unicorn to you!\nHello again, Kickstarteers!\nDozens of volumes of manga by Osamu Tezuka have now come to American shores, many to great acclaim. The vast majority of them have been stories written for adults. Yet many of Tezuka's most famous characters in Japan appear in manga meant for children. We think it's unfortunate that so few of Tezuka's manga for kids are in print in English, so we set out to publish \"Tezuka manga to read with your kids.\"\nThe obvious choice was Unico.\nUnico is a little unicorn who possesses the magical power to help those who love him. His story begins in the Greece of mythology, with Tezuka's take on the story of Psyche. In his version, Unico brings great happiness to the mortal Psyche, who in return cares for him and loves him. But the goddess Venus is jealous of Psyche, tricking her and ordering Zephyrus, the West Wind, to kidnap and banish the unicorn to someplace far away after wiping his memory. Before Unico can spend too long in one place, Zephyrus returns to carry him away again.\nUnico: \"Hey, why is Venus so mean to me?\"\nZephyrus: \"Because Venus is the goddess of beauty, and it is a cruel thing to be beautiful.\"\nUnico's adventures take him to the Wild West, medieval times and more, and along the way he meets kids, animals and supernatural creatures, discovering who his true friends are and transforming their lives. \nThink Quantum Leap meets classic Disney, with a dose of Tezuka's unique, humane spiritual sensibility.\n(Want a sample? Scroll down!)\nToday Unico is finally starting to get the attention it deserves, with the two animated films coming out in the United States on DVD. But the original manga remains unreleased.\nWhy come to Kickstarter?\nTezuka originally drew Unico for Lyrica, a glossy magazine published by Sanrio, the company that owns Hello Kitty. That magazine was in full color, which means Unico is one of the few Tezuka manga to be created in color from the beginning. Publishing manga in color is difficult and incredibly expensive, so almost all of the editions of the Unico manga in Japan are in black and white. In fact, the color edition has been out of print in Japan for years.\nBut we'd rather treat it right.\nWe want to publish Unico in a single volume in full color.\nPrinting manga in color is shockingly expensive, but if we can hit our target, we'll be able to do it, and put it in not only your hands, but those of a new generation of Tezuka fans across the world. We want to make this a kid-friendly edition, with a translation accessible to young children (though it'll certainly be a vocabulary-builder), clear and fun lettering and design and colors just as vibrant as the original.\nHere are the specs:\nPaperback\nSize: A5 (5.875\"x8.25\"), same as our other Tezuka releases\nPages: About 412\nFull color\nRetail price: $34.95\nShipping is free for all rewards for backers inside the United States.\n\nTo our friends outside the United States: You will need to add additional funds to your pledge for international shipping. Please consult this table for information on how much to add.\nAddress any shipping questions to editor@dmpplatinum.com.\nIf your order contains 2 of fewer books and/or 2 or fewer T-shirts, add $13 to cover shipping. All other rewards please add $60 to to cover shipping.\nAnd if we make it to our goal with time to spare, we will be immediately announcing a higher goal to add yet another print license, and you'll be able to raise your pledge to get that book too!\nEnjoy the first ten pages of Unico below! \nIMPORTANT NOTES: \nUnico reads left to right, like an American comic. It was done this way because it ran in a glossy magazine and not a typical manga magazine.\nYou may notice that the images below look, well, bad. That's because they're based on quick scans of the last Japanese color edition (which is now eleven years old). Our final version will look MUCH better.\nThis is a rough translation. The final version will be translated and adapted to read well for both adults and kids.\nThanks to our letterer on Barbara, Evan Hayden, who created the cleaned-up Unico logo and lettered these sample pages!\nVideo music: Arriving at the Magic Glade (Alastair Cameron) / CC BY 3.0", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Our latest project is nearing the finish line!", "update_content": "This photo is still processing\nCheck back in a few minutes!\nNokko, Pukko, and Bokko (left to right) are the Wonder 3!\nWell, hello!

Please CLICK HERE to view the PDF! (or Right Click to Save As or Download Linked File) **\nThe Pantheon Project is a six-issue, full color comic book series for readers 16+ (contains moderate violence, moderate profanity and suggestive themes). All members of the creative team are Denver locals.\nThe story is about four teenagers who must face an amazing and dangerous reality when they are mysteriously granted the super powers they made up as children. I'm looking to paint a very grounded picture of young adults shouldered with an impossible situation how their actions/choices determine their fates. While I love the spectacle commonly found in the superhero genre, it's the stories with an unmistakably human center that remain memorable.\nWhere your money goes:\nAll money raised through Kickstarter goes 100% into production costs. We have very talented artists working hard on delivering the goods and I'd like to see them keep at it! They are all magnificent storytellers and we know this is a story worth telling. Help us do that!\nWe're producing 34 color pages of story with a cover (duh) and backup material to promote the story further. It's a good-sized first issue but vital in getting to know the players and giving them room to breath a little.\nSynopsis:\nMilton Manners, Simon Cotey, Kelsey Radcliffe, Zhen Ferris and Oliver Grey - childhood friends whose collective imaginations created a fictional superhero team where each child had his or her own amazing super power. Milton Manners named this superhero team PANTHEON.\nHowever, as the years went by and the children became teenagers, Pantheon and playing superhero were left in the past.\nFate would prove unkind to the creatively gifted Milton Manners. He was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor; a kind the medical community has never witnessed before. Milton turned inwards, completely removing himself from his friends and the world beyond the gates of his family estate. The more withdrawn he became, the more into his Pantheon creation he invested. He would draw his characters, write stories about them; essentially creating his own comic book universe.\nThen, on Milton's eighteenth birthday, the tumor erupted and power exploded from his body, killing him. It was a sublime force that that changed the world, especially for his long lost friends who now have the powers they fantasized about as children:\n(From left to right)\n- Zhen Ferris - The goddess Divinity; master of arcane power and ancient mystics!\n- Simon Cotey - The adventurous Firefly; half human / half alien soldier with insect-like wings and powerful weaponry!\n- Oliver Grey - The mighty Machina; cybernetic warrior from the future!\n- Kelsey Radcliffe - The valiant Vanguard; wielder of the mystical Excalibur!\nThese four teens must come together to uncover the mystery behind their radical transformations while struggling to maintain control over their lives.

Thanks!\nhttp://www.bizenghast.com/images/TEB.html\n-----------------------------------------------oOoOo-------------------------------------------------\nHi, my name's M. Alice LeGrow, and I'm the creator of an 8-volume graphic novel series called Bizenghast, which was published by Tokyopop inc. from 2006 to present.  Bizenghast has been published internationally in over a dozen languages and countries, and has fans in Hungary, Finland, Brazil and a lot of other neat places!  Everything was swimmy and great, until my publisher closed its doors in America, and the new series I had lined up to publish with them after Bizenghast suddenly found itself homeless and without a publisher.  That new series is this project, The Elephant Book.\nThe Elephant Book is an action/fantasy story set in Philadelphia, about a couple of kids named Williams and Fairfax (which one is which is anybody's guess), who are caught in the middle of a power struggle between two covert groups that are seeking to either preserve or destroy the one trait that defines humanity: the power to invent.  A series four years in the making, the story spirals down levels and levels of millennium-old conspiracy and fear that has protected civilizations from the biggest trick ever played on the human race.\nAnd this being Philadelphia, along the way everyone eats crab fries, goes to the game and ponders the mysteries of the Eternal Wawa.\nI'd really like to take the next 6 months off from my current 2 jobs (fabric cutter and professional birthday princess), in order to have the time I need to create the first volume.  To do so, I'm asking for your donations (in return for some awesome swag!), so that I can pay for rent, bills, supplies and food while creating the first volume, as well as pay for an initial printing and shipping of the first 200 copies.  My goal is to have the book available for sale in November through my website, as well as get it distributed to some comic shops. \nIf the project gets the 100% donations it needs to be given the go-ahead, I will update this project on a bi-weekly basis with videos, photos, tutorials and art, so that you know just what's going on with the book, how far along it is and get to see some sneak peeks of the art and story.\nIf the first book does well with your support, I will have a much better chance of selling the rest of the series to another publisher and getting some proper marketing! \nI hope you'll consider donating whatever you can, and I really appreciate your contribution!\nXOXO\nM.
