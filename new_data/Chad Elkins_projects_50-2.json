Not with words, but with the grandiose knockers that adorn them. In Spanish colonial times, the knockers announced your occupation and your social status. Lions, lizards, sea creatures, and hands proclaimed the homes' occupants as Soldiers, Nobles, Fishermen, and the Clergy. The beautiful Door cards depict some of the most recognizable historic aldabas, brought to life through the art of Colombian artistJuan Vargas.\nAldabas is a puzzly tableau-builder in which you seek to fill your neighborhood with the most influential citizens. On each turn, you'll take actions to build your neighborhood or increase your wealth. Clever placement will unlock bonuses, but only if you build up your influence with the different professions wisely\u2026 it\u2019s not enough to merely win over a profession, you must also satisfy its conditions well, to really reap the rewards it has to offer! Each profession has different priorities, so make sure that you keep an eye on how to score best from the ones that you favor!\nThe Aldabas campaign will not have any Stretch Goals. The game will be produced at high quality from the start, and the game system is so tightly designed that added content of the sort that Kickstarter campaigns usually feature (new characters, scenarios, etc) are not really suitable. Aldabas stands strong as a finished project without the need to 'stretch' into anything beyond what we are presenting here.\nThere are a few Kickstarter Enhancements that will make the Kickstarter Edition of Aldabas more deluxe than the (still gorgeous) version that will go to retail. Scroll down below the Game Elements to see what is special in the Kickstarter Edition!\nGame play is simple. On your turn you will take two of the three available actions (either two different actions, or the same one twice):\n1) Gain two Coins. Take two coins from the supply into your purse.\nRunning low on cash? Having available currency is key to your long term plans.\n2) Buy a Door. There are five cards available for you to choose in the dock. The first two are free, then the remaining three increase in cost from one to three coins. Pick a card, pay its cost, and take it to hand.\nNew people come to Cartagena every day, and you must entice them to your neighborhood from the dock!\n3) Play a Door card to your block. You must follow the placement rules: No empty block spaces may be below or to the left of the new Door, and a Door can't go beside or above another Door of the same color.\nWhen you add a Door to your block, you can activate the Power of the new door, and the powers of the doors that are right next to it.\nHere we see the placed door gaining you three Coins from the supply, the red door to the left allows you to place a Coin from your supply onto a Door (increasing your influence there), and the Blue door below has an Ongoing Ability which doesn't activate right now.\nThe game will end in one of three ways:\nOne player completes their tableau (four cards wide by three cards high)\nThe coins in the supply run out\nThe deck is depleted and the dock cannot be completely filled\nThe triggering player finishes their turn, every other player gets one more turn, then the game ends and scoring begins. Coins in your vault are worth 2 points each. Some Doors award points directly. Having the most Influence overall will get you a reward. But the most important way to earn points is from the Professions. Each Profession rewards the player with the most Influence over it; you will resolve them one at a time. If you have the most Influence over a Profession, you'll benefit from its unique scoring method; second place gets a weaker version of the benefit.\nIn this example, you have the most Influence on Soldiers, so you win that category. The Soldier scoring condition says that you earn 3 points for each Noble card in your block; you have two Nobles, so you score 6 points!\nIf you are a more visual learner, check out this comprehensive How to Play video by Paul Marchbanks of The Dicey Review!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery campaign comes with its own challenges. We are confident that you will get a game that you\u2019ll love to play AND proudly display on your game shelf.\n\nThe art and mechanics for Aldabas are complete, so once this campaign ends, we'll be ready to submit print files.\n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition. This can happen for various reasons such as manufacturing issues, freight delays, and even importing the games to the various regions of the world. Although we have budgeted a year to bring Aldabas to your doorstep, delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore this timeline is only an estimate. We are working to do everything we can to meet our goal of getting Aldabas to you by Apr 2022.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation. We have worked with many of these partners before, so we are optimistic that everything will go as planned. We have full faith that your games will be delivered to you safe and in a timely fashion.\n\nA note on our track record:\n\nSuccessful and timely fulfillment of 6 projects over 4 years including the following games: Unreal Estate, Pocket Ops, The Artemis Project, Endeavor: Age of Sail, Endangered, Endeavor: Age of Expansion. (Gorinto, Endangered: New Species, and The Belgian Beers Race are underway.)\n\nOUR REFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge in full within 10 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including all fees. After that period, we will also refund your pledge, no questions asked, minus 15% cancellation fee, which represents all of the fees associated with the Kickstarter, our pledge manager, payment processing, and our work. This project is in USD and refunds will also be processed in USD, excluding applicable fees. No reward pledges will not be refunded. If you do not complete the pledge manager by our required deadline, you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. The pledge manager will be open for sufficient time, and multiple reminders will be sent.\n\nWe want you to be happy! We promise to keep you in the loop every step of the way. If you have any questions, send us a direct message, email us at marc@grandgamersguild.com, or simply comment on the campaign.

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

The pledge manager will be open for sufficient time to complete it, and we will send several reminders as well. \nYou are new to Kickstarter and don't really know how it works? No worries, here is how you can participate and support our project:\n Create a Kickstarter account. It only takes a few clicks. \n Choose 1 of 3 pledge levels. The 3 pledge levels differentiate in the number of games you will receive and the price you will pay. See more under \"pledges\".\nIf we reach or exceed our funding goal at the end of our campaign, your credit card will be charged according to the pledge you have chosen. If we do not reach our goal, you will not be charged.\nSoon after the campaign ends we will reach out to you via email, so you can enter your shipping address, select the languages for your games and pay for shipping costs. The final shipping cost will be calculated then and may slightly vary from the estimate you see here.\nAs soon as we know how many games we need to produce for each language we will kick off production and will get the games in your hands as fast as we can. \nIf you want to sell Hidden Leader in your store you can check out this page and find the right contact person from the list of our publishing partners. During the Kickstarter campaign we don't offer any specific retailer pledges or deals.

Thanks for being here.\n\nKickstarter is not an online shop. Therefore, we want to make you aware of the inherent risks of crowdfunding. It is our goal to provide you with the best game possible and to create a satisfying product for you and us. Still, making a board game is a complex and time consuming task and especially when financing things over Kickstarter there is never a 100% certainty that all will turn out as we envision it right now. Therefore minor changes can happen until the game arrives at your door. Especially in these uncertain times we cannot guarantee that no delays will happen along the delivery line, but we promise to never compromise on quality.\n\nBy supporting us on Kickstarter you support the idea of the game and its artwork and we promise to reward you with a fun game. You can track our changes and work in progress by following us on Twitter or other social media sites and by having a look at our blog. We will always keep you up to date about any decisions or changes along the way and are always glad to hear your feedback.\n\nWe are well prepared for providing you with a game that you will love, for three reasons:\n\n1) We have finished all of our artwork already and secured all the rights for it. The game will come with the artwork you can see all over social media already. Only small changes in the visual design might happen. \n2) We have set our time tables well. We did extensive research and used our product management experience to estimate this process well. In the worst case scenario, we will rather delay the delivery before compromising on your game experience.\n3) Our manufacturer has an established track record in the board game industry and we carefully evaluate the quality of our prototypes. Also we are working with fulfillment companies and experiences localisation partners to ensure that they can handle the campaign easily.\n\nWe thank you for all your support.

We will make every effort to reduce and where possible eliminate or absorb your VAT and other tariffs while abiding by local government regulations and customs.\nWhat does it mean that TRANSMISSIONS is EXCLUSIVE to KICKSTARTER?\nTransmissions will likely never see retail, so everything you see here is currently exclusive to Kickstarter. In other words, we can make no guarantees this game will appear anywhere else for sale. Why? Because it's crowded out there! We currently have no distributors who will get the game to retailers. So if you don't back it here, you may not see it anywhere. Although we do hope at least a few brave retailers will back us for their store, and there may be some copies left after the campaign is over, there are no guarantees.

He also likes to make pictures of robots.\nTransmissions is a series of illustrations which attempt to examine feelings and emotion that might be difficult to express in other ways. What began in 2006 with a single painting has grown into a long-running personal project which now comprises over 200 images, published across seven volumes of Transmissions art books.

If this is your first Meeple Source Kickstarter project, welcome! And if it isn't, welcome back!\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter project, so it really means something when we say that this project includes the most exciting variety of game upgrades to date. We hope that you will pull up a chair, stay a while, and take this journey with us.\nThis is expected to be our only Kickstarter project in 2021, so we are giving you everything we've got! We have new upgrades for popular series like Scythe, Wingspan, and The West Kingdom Trilogy. We're adding beautiful pieces to our line of upgrades for Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Concordia, Caverna, Agricola, and Grand Austria Hotel. Hot new games are definitely represented here as well, with sets designed especially for Lost Ruins of Arnak, Obsession, Darwin's Journey, Creature Comforts, Hallertau, Bonfire, New York Zoo, Dominant Species: Marine, Tekhenu, and Tawantinsuyu. And that's not all! Isle of Cats, Taverns of Tiefenthal, Fields of Arle, Carpe Diem, Keyper, Keyflower: The Farmers, and Key Market, Dice Settlers, A Feast for Odin, Cat Lady, Clans of Caledonia, Wendake, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, Reykholt, and Underwater Cities are all shown some massive love in this project!\nWith so many game upgrades offered in this project (and likely a few more to come along the way), we are offering some of our pledge levels in a different way than we have in the past. We are calling these first few upgrades \"Featured Pledge Levels\", and you can pledge for them by simply browsing the list of Kickstarter pledge levels and selecting it, just as you normally would with any Kickstarter project. If you scroll down further, you will get to the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which will be used for all of the other upgrades.\nAll of the other game upgrades, including partial sets (when shown as a project option), are being combined in the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which shows a cost of $1. You can/should still pledge for the combined amount for your desired game upgrades. Although different from the way we have done this in the past, we are hoping that a simplified format will make a project with as many options as this easier to navigate.\nIn Kickstarter, you will only choose one pledge level as your primary pledge, but it is certainly possible to pledge for multiple things here.  To do so, simply select one of the upgrades as your \"main pledge level\", then select \"add-ons\" for your other upgrade(s) you want as well. Additionally, there will be an intuitive process in BackerKit (the post-project order management and survey software we use) to handle the multiple upgrades and choices. You can take advantage of our flat-rate shipping offer by bundling an unlimited number of upgrades from this project with no additional shipping cost.\nThe popularity of flat-rate shipping cannot be understated, so that's what we're doing. The amount varies by country, but the shipping amount is fixed, no matter how many upgrades and add-ons you pledge for. The flat shipping rate within the United States is $7, and other countries have a flat rate of $9-$15.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties and/or fees owed at delivery, these are still your responsibility. This used to only rarely happen though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind. BUT, things are changing, at least in some countries. Read on...\nIf we are required to collect VAT for your order before the project ships, that cost will be collected in BackerKit (our chosen post-project management/fulfillment tool). This will almost certainly be necessary for UK backers (see more below), and likely EU backers as well. If at the point we need to collect the VAT for your shipment, you are unhappy with the amount or process, you will have the opportunity to cancel some or all of your pledge, but we will have to reduce the refund at that time by the amount of the non-refundable Kickstarter fees for your transaction. \n2021 has already seen huge changes in transit, tariffs, and international business. We are running this project in good faith, and will be transparent with what needs to happen to get you the fancy upgrades that you desire! :-) \nThere are also a number of countries that we are not able to ship to, due to known limitations and/or difficulty delivering successfully in the past. The list of countries that we CAN ship to are: United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other than the UK (see special circumstances below), if you don't live in one of these countries, pledging for this project will be difficult. Options that you may have are to combine your order with a friend who lives in a serviced country, or to use a US-based mail/package forwarding service. There are many out there, and some of our customers from around the world use them regularly. \nYou might be aware that we are not currently shipping to the UK on our website. We hope to change this soon, but Brexit-related changes to importing/exporting (at least for small companies such as ourselves) have proven maddening. Our distinct expectation is that it will be a thing of the past by the time we are fulfilling this project. Assuming so, we will have to collect the VAT for your pledge, and will file that on your behalf at that time (resulting in a seamless and fee-free delivery). But, if we are unable to accomplish this, we will refund 100% of your pledge (we will absorb the Kickstarter fees mentioned above, in this case). For a variety of reasons though, we would like you to make your pledge (no matter what it's for) as a $1 (+shipping) pledge in the \"UK Backers Only\" pledge level. We can sort everything else out with you individually in BackerKit afterward. We apologize for this admittedly wonky process, but our alternative was to exclude UK backers from the project, which we really didn't want to do.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Siblings Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions (in a non-COVID year!), you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for most of these upgrades is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our Wingspan birds, Raiders of the North Sea upgrades, Architects of the West Kingdom meeples, as well as a number of our other more recent upgrades! \nWe are also excited to offer a set of meeples by a guest artist for Darwin's Journey, Paolo Voto, who is the artist for the game itself!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with our a few of our most recent upgrades...\nWingspan: Oceania Bird Meeples\nNectar Tokens for Wingspan: Oceania\nPaladins of the West Kingdom Meeples\nRaiders of the North Sea Meeples\nResources for Raiders of the North Sea\nTomesaga/Overlord Meeples for Viscounts of the West Kingdom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for over nine years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 14 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. We quality-control every meeple individually by hand and ship all orders in-house, and we also use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you probably know that we are very straight-forward with regard to the progress of our projects, and will let you know if we encounter any delays. We did have an unfortunate technological hiccup with regard to Kickstarter emails/messages during the final phase of fulfillment of our last project, and can assure you that we will pay closer attention than ever, and won't have a lapse in response like we did at that time. \n\nWe believe that we have allotted enough time in the production and delivery schedule to account for the types of situations that could arise, but unexpected delays are still always possible. Our last few Kickstarter projects delivered early, and although this could occur again, we obviously can't promise that.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Meeple Source reserves the right to cancel any pledge, although we have never had to exercise this right in the past.\n\nAny VAT that Meeple Source is required to collect and remit on your behalf will be collected in BackerKit (the 3rd party pledge manager that we use) - it is not already built-in to the listed prices on Kickstarter that are applicable to all backers.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in BackerKit and the package is returned to us as undeliverable, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any selected add-ons.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, Meeple Source will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nIf you do not log in to BackerKit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. If you need more time to complete your BackerKit survey, you must contact us. Meeple Source reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into the BackerKit system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge for this project.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email meeplesource@gmail.com for further information.

Shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, which will allow us to reduce the cost to backers should we find a more cost-effective shipping partner in a backer's region. Our pledge manager will use the shipping address to calculate and charge the shipping costs for the rewards. We have worked to offset this cost as much as possible and are offering a shipping discount to all backers.\nShipping has changed dramatically and has become extremely challenging in the last year. We are working with Quartermaster Logistics, OTX Logistics and SimplyVAT to make this experience as painless as possible for both our backers and us.  We are new to several of the shipping processes that we are undertaking, and we sincerely appreciate your patience throughout this journey.\nWe will prepay applicable duty/customs-related Import VAT taxes. Based on our previous campaigns, we anticipate that backers in one of the above regions will not have any Import VAT fees associated with receiving the reward package (e.g. clearance, customs, etc.).  Backers outside of the above regions, may experience customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees.\nIn compliance with the UK and EU laws, Sales VAT will be collected in our pledge manager for UK and EU backers. Sales VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will appear as a separate line item in the pledge manager.  Some regions require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, this should be kept in mind as one plans while backing this project.\nIf you are interested in carrying Long Shot: The Dice Game in your store, please let us know by using the contact form at perplext.com, found HERE.\n\n\\", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nPerplext, LLC is a game publishing company established in 2001 and 'Long Shot: The Dice Game' is Perplext's fourth KickStarter project.\n\nWe have carefully selected and developed this project to ensure that we are bringing the best gaming experience possible to the hobby. Though you are taking a risk by pledging, our commitment to backers, the product, and the game industry as a whole, is our outright full-time focus. That being said, images used for this Kickstarter, card counts, components, horse names, packaging and rules may be subject to change. \n\nWe have had very few issues with delivery timelines and product quality on previous projects. The estimated delivery date of 'Long Shot: The Dice Game' is February, 2022, however this is only an estimate. Delays outside of our control may occur due to production, manufacturing, shipping, and/or customs. The nature and logistics of international shipping may result in backers from different regions of the world receiving their rewards sooner than others. We appreciate your support and thank you sincerely for patience in advance of any potential snags in fulfillment. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this project, individuals agree to conduct all public interactions with our project, team and other backers, via Kickstarter, in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the ejection of the backer from the campaign and the cancellation of the corresponding pledge (with a full refund). Perplext reserves the right at any time and for any reason to cancel a pledge (with a full refund). \n\nBy pledging for a reward, the backer acknowledges that the final components and content are subject to change .If for any reason Perplext cannot fulfill a part of an order, we will provide a pro-rated refund for that portion of the reward. If a backer does not confirm the pledge in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of our email notification to \u2018confirm your pledge\u2019, the backer agrees that Perplext has fulfilled its obligation in full for payment or donations received. At our discretion, Perplext may refund the backer or ship the reward if contact is made to confirm the pledge outside the 8-week window.\n\nWe make every effort to ensure that rewards are shipped safely. Minor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. If a backer believes a reward has sustained more than minor cosmetic damage, immediately contact Perplext by sending images and informational context to info@perplext.com. We ask that backers in this scenario keep all packaging, including outer cartons, for future inspection. Perplext maintains sole discretion in determining \u201cmore than minor cosmetic damage.\u201d .\n\nIf Perplext ships to the address provided via our Pledge Manager and the package is returned as undeliverable, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the reward again to an updated address. If it is delivered to that address and the backer is unable to receive it, is no longer the occupant of the address, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the package to the updated address. If the package is lost or stolen after delivery, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the order again. Should the package be held in customs or by a government agency, the backer may be required to contact the agency directly for the package\u2019s release, as Perplext\u2019s ability to assist may be limited. \n\nPlease refrain from pledging if you do not accept these terms.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time.

As for Pendulum, we have more information on our website.

The flat shipping rate within the United States is only $6, and other countries have a flat rate of $8-$16.\n If you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level as you normally would, and add the amount of the additional set(s) to the total amount pledged. It's that easy!\n We don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\n All orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL.

We first discovered Dollars to Donuts during a company summit in Washington State. Shawn & Molly from Flatout came down to visit us and show off their games in development. From the moment we first played this charming game, we knew we had to publish it. \nHere we are almost exactly 2 years later, with the game fully developed and delightfully illustrated by Dylan Mangini. We're this close to having the game in our hands, and all we need is your help deciding how much awesome to pack in the box! \nDollars to Donuts is already a complete game. However, we've come up with a bunch of things we'd love to do with it that are typically beyond the reach of a traditional retail release - including some pie in the sky stuff that we just might be able to pull off, but only with your help.\nWe're offering Dollars to Donuts at a significant discount from the final retail price. Especially if we unlock most or all of the stretch goals we have planned, the value you'll see in the box for just $29 is outstanding. \nBackers are also guaranteed to receive their copies before anyone else. The only copies you'll see in stores or conventions before you receive yours will be offered by retailers who back this campaign - because they're backers, too (see below).\nBeyond that are the practical effects of every dollar pledged to this campaign. We've made sure every milestone in this campaign improves the final product you'll receive, and that every improvement is as significant as it can possibly be. You can find a short list of the first couple upgrades in the Stretch Goals section below, but in the meantime we wanted to offer you another way to tangibly improve the game even before we actually fund...\nWe encourage retailers to consider the $50 Dollars to Donuts Retailer pledge level. That tier includes 3 copies of the game, which is discounted even further than the already discounted backer price of $29 per copy. You may of course add multiple sets of 3 copies, each for an additional $50. \nWe love our brick & mortar partners across the world and we want you to benefit just as much as everyone else, so we are including everything we offer to any backer in this campaign to you at exactly the same time and in exactly the same quantities. That's important, so let's say it again...\nYou automatically earn the same stretch & social goal rewards as everyone else. \nWe know it's a burden for retailers to tie up funds for the longer period required for a Kickstarter campaign, so we promise that all retail backers will be included in the first shipping wave. \nWe also want to remind you that all items offered in this campaign are entirely ready for production right now. \nThank you shop owners and operators everywhere for supporting us for over 15 years!

To thank our followers for helping us to make some fun board games over the last six years, we have lowered the pledge price for this game as low as it can go. We have subsidised shipping costs as much as we can. We don't want you to miss out on pledging for Whale Riders, because we aren't sure how many copies will make it to retail.\nWhale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from famed game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players will race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible, to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasures, or will you make your money slowly along the way?\nEach player has two actions per turn, but a lot they will want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game will end and the player with the most pearls will win!\nEach copy of Whale Riders will be carefully planned, prepared and packed. Here is a list of all you will receive. Oh! And please see the Stretch Goals section below for more info on how these components may be further improved and expanded during our campaign...\nThere are a few different pledge levels for our campaign. In summary, this is what you will receive at each level...\nYou will be able to choose to receive your game in English/French or Spanish in the Pledge Manager.\nRetailers: Before selecting the retailer-only pledge level, please contact us through this link: https://support.murano-alliance.com/retailers to discuss your particular enquiry. Proof of eligibility will be collected via a retailer survey upon completion of the campaign and will need to be submitted before receiving and finalising your pledge manager. Retailers will be able to order a number of copies of each title offered during this campaign.\nWhale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players. It has a classic feel - similar to many of (famed game designer) Knizia\u2019s great designs - but also feels new, sleek and (of course) fun!\n\u2192 Watch Stella and Tarrant form Meeple University teach you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nAs well as the board game Whale Riders, we are offering the small card game Whale Riders: The Card Game to backers during this campaign for a low price! Unlike its big sister, The Card Game is not planned to be sold at retail. Copies will only be made available through this (and perhaps a future KS) campaign, and directly through our online store or at a convention. We hope you may consider backing for both games at our ALL ABOARD pledge level.\nWhale Riders: The Card Game, 2-4 players will sail alongside each other to buy goods along the Ice Coast. What is on offer at the ports will vary in quantity. Sometimes you will be working together with others only to become competitors again when a better proposition comes along. This is a re-implementation of Reiner Knizia's previously released card game, Trendy.\nJust like the Whale Riders board game, the card game is also designed by Reiner Knizia and illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, but it is a much smaller game that plays totally different to the board game\u2026\n\u2192 Watch David from Grail Games (and friends) show you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nWith your help, we can make Whale Riders even better!

And, to reduce taxes and fees, games will ship to backers from within the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia*!\n*Australian and NZ backers have the option of paying extra to receive their copies of the game earlier - posted directly from China (and not from within Australia 1-2 months later). If you would like to take this offer, back at the regular shipping level now, and we will give you the option to pay extra in our pledge manager after the campaign. (Note that the 6-pack is not available for express shipping as the package will be overweight).\nBy supporting Whale Riders on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us to produce the game(s) in the first place, but if you back now, you will also receive them:\nat a cheaper than MSRP price,\nwith Whale Riders: The Card Game (if you wish), also heavily discounted and only available through Kickstarter and directly through Grail Games,\nearlier than anyone else will get the games, and,\nwe will be providing copies of some other titles to backers of this campaign at a reduced price as a thank you to you (Yellow & Yangtze and others via our post-campaign pledge manager)!\nBut that's not all\u2026\nThe Whale Riders titles were designed by well-known designer Reiner Knizia (of Lost Cities, Pickomino, Medici, Yellow & Yangtze fame, and much much more). He knows how to make a small game fire on all cylinders!\nThe Whale Riders titles are easy to learn games that are approachable and can be played by almost anyone.\nThe production files are ready to be uploaded to the printer right after the campaign is successfully funded. We will do all we can to deliver on time!\nThe games are full of beautiful illustrations by fan-favourite illustrator Vincent Dutrait.\nCountless hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience.\nWe are committed to fulfilling all Kickstarter pledges before they are available at retail. And on that point: We appreciate the support of game stores and see them as an essential part of our hobby. However, in today's crowded marketplace, our titles are becoming harder and harder to find by customers. Whale Riders will appear in stores, but at this stage, we don't believe it will be widely available. Your best bet is to back now (and at our super-low price - MSRP will be $30USD+) should you want to be sure of owning the game.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nDesigner - Reiner Knizia\nDr. Reiner Knizia is one of the world\u2019s most successful and prolific game designers. More than 600 of his games and books have been published worldwide in over 50 languages and have won him numerous international awards.\n\nArtist - Vincent Dutrait\nVincent Dutrait is currently one of the most highly regarded illustrators of board and card games in the world.

We focus on reprints, and producing English language versions of great games from Asia and Europe.

However, it would not have been possible without the support of 13 of your favorite publishers who partnered with me to see their logo, as well as their most popular games turned into handmade component mosaics. Whether you want to brighten up your kitchen, geek up your office so you can have your co-workers ask you about board games, or spruce up your game room - this is the perfect calendar for you. \nEvery image I create takes between 3 to 8 hours to assemble. Sometimes I use a reference image to help me with proportions, but I also like to go with the flow for some creations. I begin the process by choosing the colors I need from the game boxes I know contain the right pieces. Once I have the correct components, I plan out where each part will go. As I carefully lay the pieces I am constantly moving them into just the right place! I use a pencil to move pieces in tight areas because it helps with precision. Photographing each image takes almost an hour. Depending on which pieces I have used for the mosaic, the angle of the lighting needs to be adjusted. There is a lot of trial and error when taking the shots, and climbing up a chair over top of my gaming table is time consuming! \nPLAY\n\n\nEvery month has a component mosaic of a well-known board game as the main image, as well as a mosaic of that publisher's logo.\nThere is a write up about the publisher, including their website so you can check out their games.\nThe calendar includes a section to write the games you played during the month.\nAt the end of the calendar, you will find a 10x10 challenge page!\n\n\nPLAY\n\nYou asked for prints, coasters and magnets; so here is your chance!

Daryl Andrews, Rob Byers and Steve Robertson, thank you for lending me games for components I needed but did not have. Helaina Cappel(Burnt Island Games), thank you for you help with the campaign.

In 2019, we brought Fire Tower to life with the support of an amazing community of nearly 1700 backers. Now, we are back on Kickstarter for a second printing and to introduce the Rising Flames Expansion to add to the core game.    \nFire Tower is a fast-paced, tactical pattern-laying game that takes 15-30 minutes to play. You must protect your lookout tower from a rapidly spreading forest fire. Dispatch smokejumpers and fire engines to combat the blaze and construct firebreaks to fortify your tower.\nBut there is a twist! In Fire Tower, you also take on the role of nature. Harness the power of the wind to push the blaze towards your opponents and unleash an arsenal of fire cards to take down their towers before they can reach yours. \nIn the Rising Flames Expansion, rapid crown fires, heavy winds, and tumultuous weather threaten the forest. Defend your tower with a powerful new deck and a flock of legendary firehawks. Beware the growing influence of the Shadow of the Wood, as destroyed towers now have a host of new abilities to claim a surprise victory. The Rising Flames Expansion adds solo and fifth player mode, along with new variants of play and a flock of custom meeples. \nThe second edition of Fire Tower includes all unlocked stretch goals and the same high-quality components as the first edition, Kickstarted in 2018. \n* Enhanced by an unlocked stretch goal (see below for details)\nThe standard expansion will fit into the base game and is made with high-quality components, like 310 gsm blue core cards with a linen finish. It comes with all the same content as the deluxe expansion. See below for the new components and upgrades that are included in the deluxe expansion.  \n* Enhanced by an unlocked stretch goal (see below for details)\nThe deluxe expansion will fit into the base game and includes everything in the standard expansion as well as an acrylic eternal flame centerpiece and cloth bag for your components. The deluxe also includes upgrades, such as screen-printed hawk meeples, a custom engraved Shadow Die, and custom lightning tokens. All cards are 310gsm blue core with a linen finish. \n Fan us on Board Game Geek (101/100) Unlocked! \n Like us on Facebook (1004/1000) Unlocked! \n Share on Facebook (310/300) Unlocked! \n Follow us on Instagram (1000/1000) Unlocked! \n Subscribe to our Mailing List \n Follow us on Twitter \nBefore learning the expansion, you have to learn the base game.

We worked tirelessly on Fire Tower to create a high quality, beautiful and fun game, and to lay the groundwork for a business. Our first Kickstarter was invaluable in helping us do that. Fire Tower was finished, manufactured, and fulfilled within eight months and all of our backers received the game by the estimated delivery date. \nWe've shown Fire Tower at nearly 30 conventions and have playtested Rising Flames with over 1,000 gamers. The expansion is a thrilling new addition to the world of Fire Tower that deepens the theme and mechanics of the game, while at the same time staying true to the original experience. We've listened to your advice, and have fine-tuned Rising Flames to be a game we are sure you'll love. \nPlaying the expansion at PAX South\nYour support is the only way we can make Rising Flames a reality!\nWe are offering Fire Tower, the Rising Flames expansion, and our mini-expansions at a discounted rate for the duration of this Kickstarter. After the campaign is over, the price will go up.\nYour pledge will help us reach stretch goals that will enhance the game even further, making the game better for everyone!\nDesigned by Firescale Studio\nYou get to fight the fire. You get to BE the fire. You even control a flock of arsonist hawks. We are the only purely competitive game about fighting forest fires that we know of (let us know if you find another one). And if that's not enough, here are few other points we think are pretty neat:\n The artwork. If you're familiar with Kevin Ruelle's vibrant watercolors, you already know that we lucked out having him as our artist. We\u2019re excited to unveil new paintings and designs with his unique style in our expansion. Check out some of his other work here.\n Easy to learn. Fire Tower takes about 5 minutes to learn and Rising Flames takes just a few minutes more. Need proof? Check out our How To Play videos above.\n Easy to set up. \"Let's play Fire Tower,\" you say. You'll be set up and playing in just a couple minutes. Time it and let us know.\n Made for visual learners. We hate reading the fine print, which is why we have simple graphics on each card to clue you into the rules, saving new players from having to constantly refer to the rule book.\n The components.

The fact that Kickstarter provides an avenue for designers to print their product is a dream come true.

Kickstarter will ensure that we are able to do that. \nPhoto by Roque Nonini\nIf this is your first Kickstarter and you haven't backed before, follow these simple steps:\n1.

So it's no surprise that the construction of the station was riddled with problems. Funding cuts, shifting geopolitical climates, engineering setbacks - these were all just part of the job.

This spacewalk was supposed to be the final step, but a couple of faulty power cables forced the astronauts to abort. Of the six cables needed, two would not fully attach to the facility.

The jungle ecosystem is full of symbiosis, and players must grow tall trees and lush jungle plants to attract the most diverse wildlife. By carefully selecting what grows in your forest you can create the ideal balance of flora and fauna and give rise to a thriving ecosystem.  \n*Solo and 3-4 player variants unlocked! \nSee below for our full plan to make Canopy as environmentally friendly as possible.\nCanopy is played over three Seasons. Each Season, players endeavor to create a successful rainforest by collecting Plants, Trees, Wildlife and Weather cards.\nGather plants in specific sets to maximize their points. Grow tall and numerous trees to win valuable bonuses. Attract a diverse array of wildlife to help you manage and grow your forest with unique abilities. Beware - as there are threats to the forest as well and the risk of fire, disease and drought is ever-present.\nDesigned by Tim Eisner and beautifully illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, Canopy is designed to play quickly and appeal to a wide range of players. It offers push-your-luck drafting, strategic set collection, meaningful choices and invites players to create their own vibrant rainforest tableau. \n*All components are prototype and may change during final printing.\n(Digital Mock-up. Actual puzzle will be even more beautiful)\nThe Canopy puzzle add-on comes in a separate box and costs $18 plus shipping.  We've just added two new pledge tiers (Retail + Puzzle and Deluxe + Puzzle). If you have already pledged you can switch to one of these tiers or add this to your pledge by clicking on the manage pledge option and increase your pledge by $18. Shipping costs are listed in the Shipping section below. \n Read the full Geekdad review here: https://bit.ly/2YSzWLy\n German Language video preview from Brettspielhero here:  https://bit.ly/2YqMLOi\n  Follow this link to read the full Gaming with Sidekicks review: https://bit.ly/3fMvgxO\n  Read the full One Board Family review here: https://bit.ly/2VpL8yH\n Here at Weird City Games, we love making board games and we love nature. In recent years we have become increasingly concerned about the effects of climate change on the natural world, and with our own impacts through manufacturing games. When the idea of Canopy came to us, we immediately saw it as an opportunity to work towards making our board games in a more sustainable manner, and working to offset negative impacts. \nWhile we are a small company, we feel it is important to bring our desire for change into our love of making games. We are learning as we go and doing what is feasible for this first project. We see this as the first step of many to making our games in the most sustainable manner possible. \nWe hope that highlighting the unique and wondrous species that live within the rainforest will help connect people to this essential part of our environment. And hopefully, it will spark meaningful conversations and a desire to make sure we all do what we can to protect these wondrously diverse forests.\nSteps we are taking to make the game sustainable include:\nFor each game we sell through Kickstarter we will be planting one tree in partnership with Tree Sisters, a fantastic non-profit based in the UK focused on tropical reforestation and the empowerment of women. \nProducing the game without any plastic. The plastic wrap on cards and the game box will be replaced with paper bands or small stickers. Ziploc bags will be replaced with sturdy paper envelopes.\nAll wood used in the game will come from FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified materials. \nAll chipboard components used in the game will come from post-consumer waste. \nKeeping the box size small to limit resources used in freight and domestic shipping.\nThank you for joining us and contributing to our goal of a sustainable future!\n Canopy is played over 3 Seasons. During each Season you will take turns selecting which cards to add to your rainforest from 3 New Growth piles. \nNew Growth: Each turn you will select cards from one New Growth pile. Each time you look at a pile you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face-down, adding 1 additional card. As the piles grow you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most. But choose carefully, as the jungle also contains threats in the form of fire, disease, and drought.\nGrow Your Forest: During each Season you will add cards to your rainforest. Carefully select an ideal balance of Trees, Weather, Wildlife, and Plants to grow a thriving ecosystem. At the end of each Season, you will discard all Plants, Weather, and Threat cards, leaving Trees and Wildlife to continue to grow.\nScore Sets: At the end of each Season you will gain points for your rainforest. Each card type offers a different way to score. Focus on attracting diverse Wildlife, building unique sets of Plants, growing the Tallest Trees, or creating ideal Weather patterns. \nRead the current Canopy Rulebook here.\nCanopy is a fully immersive and vibrant game that we are positive you will enjoy! The gameplay and components are already great, and we are confident it can become even better if you help us spread the word, rally the board gaming community, and exceed our basic funding goal.\nWe have unlocked all of the fantastic Stretch Goals planned to improve component quality and add additional content to Canopy! Thanks for helping us grow a mighty rainforest!\nThe cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. In the pledge manager, which will go out after the campaign finishes, you will be asked to fill out a backer survey and shipping will be charged at that time.\nBelow are the estimated shipping costs. We have incorporated a portion of the shipping costs into all pledges. (We do not expect prices to vary greatly, but those listed are estimates only and may fluctuate slightly.)\nWant Extra Copies: You may order multiple copies of the game and pay half of the shipping cost for each additional copy. (e.g. If you wanted two copies of the Canopy Deluxe game in Zone 2 you would pledge $58 for the games and estimated shipping would be $13.50.) \nWe have an estimated delivery date of June 2021, and we will be working diligently to get the game to all backers as early as possible.\nWe realize that shipping can be a great barrier  and we have done what we can to reduce that cost. We apologize for any difficulty this creates. We apologize that we DO NOT SHIP to: Afghanistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Burma, North Korea, Sudan.\n Eco-Friendly: For each game purchased through Kickstarter, we will plant one tree through our partnership with Tree Sisters.\n Get it First: Backers will receive Canopy before it is available at retail.\n Exclusive Version: Backers of the Deluxe level will receive the exclusive, deluxe version of the game which will not be sold through traditional retail. \n Awesome Stretch Goals: By pledging now you will help us unlock stretch goals to improve both the retail and deluxe versions of the game.\n Your Support is Essential: The game design and artwork are 95% complete and we need your help to make the game a reality.\n This project would not be possible without all of you, our wonderful backers. We seek to honor your vital contribution with our promise that backer copies of Canopy will be shipped out before Canopy is available for purchase from retailers or at conventions. You know what they say: the early Toucan gets the game...or something like that.\nOne of our favorite things about Kickstarter is that it can build and sustain community. We pledge to involve all of our backers in the creation of this project in as many meaningful ways as possible. This may include helping select new wildlife or plants to include in the game, suggesting new components, variants, rules editing, thematic advice, and more. We love your input and will do our best to incorporate as many of your ideas as we can.\nFurther, we pledge to keep you informed at every step along the way as our Kickstarter campaign unfolds. We value each of you and will ensure that you are fully satisfied with this project. Please feel free to contact us with any concerns, questions or ideas. Let's build this rainforest together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCanopy is the 5th Kickstarter campaign that we have managed and while we have learned a lot and are confident that we can deliver a successful project, we also know that unexpected things happen.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber. You can learn more about Tiny Epic Pirates by engaging with us in the comments, watching the videos below, or by downloading the rulebook below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals\nIncludes 7 Plastic Ship Minis!\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Pirates, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe components shown below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Crimson Silver Mini Expansion\nThe Crimson Silver Mini Expansion introduces new Floating Fortresses and Silver as a new resource!\nPlayers are able to visit the Floating Fortresses as they move around the board and perform upgraded versions of Trade, Plunder, and Crew Up. Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nIn Tiny Epic Pirates: Curse of Amdiak, rumors of the unthinkable are spreading quickly around the islands. Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates. It will share the same width and height as well. Making them great for storing side by side!\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion is available in the 'All-In Deluxe' reward tier or as an add-on in the pledge manager service after the project.\nAdditional Add-Ons \nDownload the prototype rulebook below! These are prototype rules and have not been edited for final production. This is not an exact reflection of the final rulebook.\nClick to download.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included!\nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer. If the project does very well, they will run out.\nPlease share this project with as many people as possible to help us achieve these goals and thank you for all the support!\nHere are the 20 stretch goals we've unlocked for this project! \nSolo Playthrough\n 2 Player Playthrough\n2 Player Playthrough with Crimson Silver \n2 Player Playthrough with Curse of Amdiak and Crimson Silver\n3 Player Playthrough\nFind out more about Tiny Epic Pirates and join the conversation HERE on BGG.\nBelow are previews of the game (in prototype form). These videos include content that are stretch goals and may not be unlocked yet.\nCheck out the videos to see what people are saying about the game.\n\"I like the tension between assigning your deckhands to the action spaces and using them to skip actions. \" - Jonathan H. Liu, Geek Dad.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Thus it seemed absolutely fitting early in development that our game be planned from the beginning using innovative ways in mind to save our own planet Earth. \n\nThe game manual will be delivered on a reusable USB drive instead of paper printed elements. Our goal is to save trees, reduce water contamination during the paper making process, and help protect the environment.\n\nGame manuals are usually not often used after players learn a game. Instead they are saved as out-of-date reference material unable to resolve errata and update themselves with new information. In the modern online age of always on devices, continuously updated PDFs and the use of efficient virtual data, paper is easily replaced when planned for properly. This provides for only the players that wish to print files an easy, digitally formatted and local method to do so if they wish. As such, sustainable actions to reduce paper waste, toxic chemicals, and ultimately less landfill refuse, was a goal of this project from the very beginning.\n\nAdditionally, our box and packaging were designed specifically for the items inside. As such, there are no fillers or extra cardboard spacers used in our project. We fit nearly 12 pounds of gaming material into our modest 12.5\"x12.5\"x6\" box perfectly, eliminating the need for extra wasteful materials.\nSustainable materials\nAll of our extensive unit prototyping was produced using bio-degradable \"green-plastics\" derived from corn. Our prototyping plastics offered a stable shelf life, without degrading or disintegrating, but remains biodegradable... a thankful position with the level of refinement each playing piece went through during development. \n\nWhile fully stable \"on the shelf\" for over 100 years, our prototyped plastics will begin to breakdown into simply carbon dioxide and water when exposed to heat and humidity for 60-90 days. Additionally, if burned, there are no toxic fumes are emitted when our plastics are incinerated.\n\nWe will work during general production to achieve a low impact solution on the injection molded elements as well.\nSomething else\nDuring the promotion of our Kickstarter campaign internationally, every email collected for our mailing list was met with a matched donation to \"The Planetary Society\" found online at www.planetary.org \n\nAs a game about space and planets, it seems more than fitting to support the cause of protecting our own planet Earth by aligning with The Planetary Society during our promotional phases.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "\"A Civilian\" - Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "As a civilian, this pledge level provides early, granted access to the pledge manager after the campaign closes.\nNote: With the World's situation currently, UPON FUNDNG, the pledge manager will remain open for an extended period of time allowing backers who may wish to increase their pledge thereafter the opportunity to do so and receive a \u201cFirst Edition\u201d game.\nWe are all in this together.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["98 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 149 or more", "title": "\"OverBattle\" Box Set - First Edition", "descp": "Kickstarter Exclusive - First Edition\n\"OverBattle: The All War\" Boxed Set including all unlocked stretch goals.\nFor this Kickstarter Exclusive, the box will be labeled, \"First Edition\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers", "Limited (1 left of 43)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 149 or more", "title": "\"OverBattle\" Box Set - First Edition", "descp": "Kickstarter Exclusive - First Edition\n\"OverBattle: The All War\" Boxed Set including all unlocked stretch goals.\nFor this Kickstarter Exclusive, the box will be labeled, \"First Edition\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["190 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "\"A Civilian\" - Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "As a civilian, this pledge level provides early, granted access to the pledge manager after the campaign closes.\nNote: With the World's situation currently, UPON FUNDNG, the pledge manager will remain open for an extended period of time allowing backers who may wish to increase their pledge thereafter the opportunity to do so and receive a \u201cFirst Edition\u201d game.\nWe are all in this together.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "17 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Update on Shipping, Freight and more!", "update_content": "We'll start as we always do, with our sincerest thanks to the OverBattle backers and Syther Gaming supporters!\nHello everyone. from the beginning I've been dedicated to an update at least every 30 days or sooner.

Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

For each shirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $70 AUD.\nIf you'd like to add on more skirts to your pledge, please make sure you're backing at the Skirt Pledge or the Shirt and Skirt Pledge level. For each skirt you'd like to add, please increase your pledge by $100 AUD. \nTo quickly figure out which level you should back, and the total amount, please use our pledge calculator below! \nIf you're still not sure how to pledge, feel free to message us and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. \nThe size charts below will help you find your perfect fit! The best way to ensure we have your size is to find and measure a similar garment that you already own. You can also use the US and UK size equivalents as a guide, but we recommend measuring as well since sizing can be so variable between brands.\nPlease note that all of the measurements in the charts refer to the size of the garment, not your body measurements. We explain how to use them underneath each chart.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your skirt size, you'll need to get your waist measurement! Use a soft tape measure and measure around the smallest part of your waist (above your belly button and below your ribs). For a more detailed explanation of how to measure yourself, please see this link.\nThe back waistband of the skirt has elastic, and can stretch up to 10cm / 4\".\nIf you prefer a snug fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the high end of the waist measurement range (For example, a size 14 for an 87cm waist). This means the elastic will be more stretched when you wear it, and will feel firmer.\nIf you prefer a looser fit around your waist, please select a size where your measurement is in the low end of the range (For example, a size 20 for a 97cm waist). This means the elastic will be more relaxed on you.\nClick through for a larger version\nTo find your shirt size, we recommend measuring a similar button-up shirt you already own and feel comfortable in. Our shirts are semi-fitted, so make sure the shirt you're measuring isn't loose or baggy around the chest and waist.\nTo find your shirt's chest measurement, lay it flat on a hard surface and measure across the front from one underarm seam to the other. Please watch this video for a thorough guide of how to do this.\nOnce you have your shirt's chest measurement, round up to the next size in the size chart that will fit you. For example, for a 56cm chest you would size up to a M.\nYou can also take your shirt's shoulder width and length measurements, if you'd like to make sure that the size you've selected will fit. The videos linked below explain in detail how to do this:\nFinding your shirt's shoulder width\nFinding your shirt's length\nAll shipping will be handled in the pledge manager after the campaign is completed. You will be charged separately from your pledge on Kickstarter! \nThe chart below is an estimate of the shipping costs, based on your pledge level and your country.

We will do our best to get you a shipping estimate. You can message us through Kickstarter, or send an email to hello@ludocherry.com, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\nIf you are adding items onto your pledge, each additional shirt will add ~$3-6 shipping and each additional skirt will add ~$5-8 shipping.\nIf you are planning on ordering a large number of items and would like a more accurate estimate, please get in touch with us!\nIf you're a retailer interested in stocking LudoCherry in your store, or getting our clothing for your staff to wear to work, please get in touch with us!\nYou can email us at retail@ludocherry.com, or message us on Kickstarter.\n There are a few reasons! \nThe first is that Kickstarter allows us to raise the funds we need to actually make LudoCherry a reality. We\u2019ve already invested a large amount of our personal savings into developing our business, our fabric designs, and our clothing, but the amount of money required for a production run is beyond our reach. With your support, we'll be able to raise the money we need for the production run.\nKickstarter also allows us to solve many of the issues that traditional clothing brands face. Companies often create their clothes in limited size ranges and colours, to prevent profit loss on variations that don't sell. By using Kickstarter, and knowing in advance what our backers will be ordering, we\u2019re able to create a much more inclusive range. We'll be able to order more of the sizes and fabrics that are the most in demand, and reduce our loss on the less popular variations - meaning we can afford to create a wide range of sizes and fabrics for you to wear! \nFinally, Kickstarter allows us to interact directly with our community, and take your feedback and ideas on board. We want you to be as excited to wear LudoCherry as we are, so we want to use Kickstarter as a chance to talk with you about what we're doing well and what we could be doing better.\nFinally we'd like to extend a special thanks to some people who helped us make LudoCherry the best it can be.\nTo James Mathe, Jamey Stegmaier, Daniel Zayas, and Martyn Poole - Thank you for your contributions to the crowdfunding community, and for always being willing to give advice.\nTo Ted and Toni - Thank you for seeing my passion for the industry, and for all your support.\nTo Neil Thomson and the Albury Game Club - All of this is your fault.\nTo my parents - Thank you for always supporting me, even when I gave up politics for game design.\n -Phoebe", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter as a company, we both have years of experience working within the board game industry. Phoebe has worked on 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns through her position as Bezier Games' Social Media Manager (raising a total of over $2.5 million USD).\n\nMark has worked in film for 6 years as a Producer and Assistant Director. As a result, he is experienced in managing logistics for large scale and complex projects, as well as meeting production deadlines. \n\nWe are confident that our combined experience will allow us to finalise and deliver a high quality project. All of our art is completed, and we have a manufacturer ready to start production after our campaign.\n\nIn the event that we receive samples back from the manufacturer that are not up to our standards, we may need to make alterations to the garment design or work with them to ensure a higher quality. However, we have built in sufficient time to our estimated delivery date to allow for this.\n\nAs a smaller company, it is also possible for us to be pushed back in the production queue for the manufacturer to prioritise larger brands.\n\nFinally, the ongoing coronavirus crisis in China has the potential to cause delays to our production and shipping. Currently it appears that factories are reopening, but we are not able to tell how the situation will evolve.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clothes are designed to be high quality statement pieces that will last in your wardrobe for years to come.

It also requires that manufacturers limit potentially toxic ingredients in their dyes and manufacturing processes, and that they have processes in place to limit and treat waste water. Our manufacturer ensures that the water used in the dying process is still clean enough to be recycled for irrigation and other purposes.\n\nThe GOTS social criteria requires safe and hygienic working conditions for employees, the payment of living wages, regular and fair working hours, and the right for workers to unionise. It also prohibits child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and harsh or inhumane treatment.\n\nMore about the GOTS certification here: https://www.global-standard.org/the-standard/general-description.html", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "Thank you for your support!\nYou will have access to the pledge manager after the campaign.\nPlease note that any items added in the pledge manager through this level will not receive the Kickstarter discount.\nShirts will cost ~$85 AUD / $55 USD\nSkirts will cost ~$115 AUD / $75 USD\nINCLUDES:\nPledge manager access", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}], "stat": ["102 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 70 or more", "title": "Shirt Pledge (~$45 USD)", "descp": "**~$45 USD**\nOnly want shirts?

Four new mint making companies have noticed the profit potential of Mintopia City and have moved in, in an attempt to dominate the market and make all of the money. Players will take the role of one of four mint making companies and assert their influence over various locations in Mintopia City to secure their loyalties and earn the market share.\nMint Control is designed to provide a small footprint introduction experience to the Area Control and Action Selection genres of gaming that is fun and rewarding for new and seasoned gamers alike.\nSet Up\nShuffle the Location Cards, and randomly add Locations to the game area until there are at least 5 Influence Token spaces per player.\n                            (10 for 2 players, 15 for 3 players and 20 for 4 players.)\nPut the remaining Location cards to the side, they will not be used in this game. Place the 5 Action tiles near the Location cards, this is the Selection Pool.\nPlace the Mint Tokens near the Location Cards. This forms the Mint Supply, each player then takes 2 Mints from the Supply as their starting currency.\nEach player selects a color and takes the 5 Influence Tokens for that color.\nThe player with the freshest breath starts the game with the Starting Player Token.\nGameplay\nEach round, the starting player will select one of the available Action tiles and place it in front of them. They will then perform that Action, followed by the Perk in its entirety.\nThen in clockwise order around the table, each other player will perform that same Action (but not the perk) until each player has had the option to perform the Action if able.\nAfter every player has had the option to perform the action chosen by the starting player, the next player in clockwise order will choose one of the remaining available Action Tiles. This process continues until each player has selected one Action tile.\nAfter the final Action has been fully processed, if there are not enough remaining Action tiles for each player to choose from the remaining cards, return all of the chosen Action tiles to the selection pool, so that all Action tiles are available in the next round.\nFinally, the Starting Player token passes to the next player in clockwise order, and a new round begins.\nAction Tiles\nWhen an action is selected by a player, that player performs both the Action and Perk. Then clockwise around the table each other player performs only the Action.\nInfluence\nThe Influence Action allows players to pay Mints to add an Influence Token to an open Influence space. The Perk for selecting this Action reduces the cost to Influence a Location by 1, to a minimum of 0.\nEarn\nThe Earn Action gives players Mints to spend on future turns. The Perk for selecting this Action is to gain an additional Mint.\nPresence\nThe Presence Action grants each player the Presence bonus for each Location where they have Influence. The Perk for this Action is gain the eviction bonus from a Location that the player controls.\nOust\nThe Oust Action gains each player one Mint, similar to Earn. However, the perk for Oust is to spend 1 Mint to remove any 1 Influence Token from a Location. Then an additional 3 Mints can be spent to remove a second Influence token from a Location. The second token has no additional restrictions, it can be on the same or a different Location, and the same or a different player.\nScavenge\nThe Scavenge Action does not provide an Action for all players, only the player that selected it. That player can choose to gain 1 Mint from the Supply, or steal 1 Mint from another player.\nWin/Lose Conditions \nThe game ends at the end of the Action in which at least one player has all 5 of their influence tokens on Locations.\nPlayers gain points for each Location they control. The player with the most points, wins!\nIn the event of a tie, the player with the most Mints left over wins.\nThen, the tied player that has the most Influence placed on locations wins.\nThen, the tied player whose age is closest to 42 wins.\nPLAYTHROUGH\nYou are my biggest advocates and I need you to shout from the rooftops so this project can succeed the best it can.

If you're a retailer, please email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThe Mint Series was born of the 2017 BoardGameGeek Mint Tin Challenge where designer Justin Blaske submitted Mint Works, the Minty Fresh Worker Placement Game. Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded on Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product, selling over 30,000 copies -- and it's still reprinting! His second design, Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in the first hour, raising almost $200,000, and expanding into the French market. Most recently, Mint Cooperative funded over $100,000 and gained partners around the world: the Mint Series has fresh new versions in French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.\nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series. Our vision is to make singular modern board game mechanisms approachable by designing games that are simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time.\nThe Mint Series follows the narrative of Mort, introduced in the first game. After much success launching his mint-making company, Mort branched out and provided mints to surrounding towns and regions. Unfortunately, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis  grew jealous of his success, and the Mint Cooperative was launched to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. With peace restored and the villains defeated, Mort now finds himself threatened by other mint magnates trying to steal his success!  It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression, and it is thrilling to continue the saga in this exciting title.\nQuackalope's storytelling expertly explains how the world of Mintopia unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series, we've learned a lot about the game making process, from start to finish.

Players will venture out on to the open waters of the Pacific, haul in fresh fish (represented as polyominoes), and carefully pack the fish into an ice chest (ideally around the crabs and ice cubes already present). Once the player feels comfortable with the amount of fish in their ice chest, they head to the market to fulfill contracts to outsell their competition and build their reputation up with the local canneries. \nDesigned by the team Flatout Games (designers of Point Salad and publisher of Calico) and with stunning art by Beth Sobel, Public Market is a wonderful mix of bidding, tile placement, set collection, and engine building. Jump aboard your vessel and head out on the cool crisp waters to find your adventure.\n\n 1.5MM thick neoprene \nMade for 1 to 5 players\nStunning Beth Sobel art\n 5th player Expansion - all components needed to add a 5th player\nShallow Water Expansion/Module - added gameplay and components\nSolo Edition - all components add for the solo play of Public Market!\nClick for Written Review\nClick the picture for the link, they talk about the game at 1:43\n Solo Overview\nIn Public Market, players will take fishing actions to draft fish tiles to place into their ice chest with a goal of selling your haul to local restaurants and to public companies. When at the market, players will have a chance to score by fulfilling public contracts or delivering fish to small local restaurants to gain bonuses.\nThe game is played over a series of rounds based on the number of fish tiles in the Ocean Bag. Players will open the round by bidding for turn order. Once bidding is complete, players will take one of two actions. Players will either go Fishing or go to the Market.\n Bidding\n\nEach round players will spend money to bid. There are 5 locations for bidding. There are no lockouts and you can bid to the same location as another player, however, if you go there after they do you must pay them a $1 fee if you wish to jump in front of them. Otherwise, you would pay the normal amount and you would go after they do in turn order.\n The Scrap Fish tile must be placed by the end of your turn. Below is the market board and this is where you will place your player token to control the turn order and action selection.\n FISHING\nPlayers will Fish a tile from the Ocean Grid in Turn Order. Players will fish under the Boat and place the tile they drafted plus the scrap they got from the Bidding action.\nIce Chest\n Once the player has placed the Scrap tile and the Fish tile into their Ice Chest they will need to adjust the Catch Tracker so so the current level of each type of fish in their Ice Chest.\nMARKET\nWhen players go to market they will sell the fish they have to fulfill Public Contracts or complete smaller orders for local restaurants called Today's Catch! When these contracts or orders are completed the player will be able to score and gain special bonuses.\nContract Cards\nToday's Catch Blue\n Today's Catch Red\n After you are all done completing Public Contracts and Today's Catch Cards you will sell off remaining fish at Market Value and check to see if you have completed the Crab Bonus by surrounding the Crab icon in the Ice Chest. The Market value of the fish is shown at the bottom of the Player Board.\nThe final step is to check the bonus payout by looking at the columns and rows on in your Ice Chest. players receive a payout of $3 dollars for each completed row OR Column. The player will need to choose the columns or the rows whichever gives them a higher payout. The player will return scraps, discard the fish tiles, and get a new Ice Chest.\nREPOPULATE\nAfter each player has taken their action, players will Repopulate the Ocean Grid with fish tiles from the Ocean Bag. When the bag is empty it triggers the end of the game. The number of tiles in the bag is based on the player count.\nNAVIGATION\nAt the end of the round, the last person to take their action will set the boat for the next round. This will tell all players which tiles will be available in the fish phase.\nShallow Waters Module\nArt not final\n\n\nArt not final.\nArt Not Final!\nArt not final\n Like many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room for us to add in features and items through stretch goals.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. This means we are paying the cost for the VAT or Value Added Tax for you. The following is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to  Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Due to that, we will not ship to these areas.\n\n\n\nPlease note - if you have not confirmed and completed your pledge through Pledge Manager within six months of the start of fulfillment, you may be subject to additional charges as shipping rates can change. Also, your games would be shipped outside of our original shipment and you may be responsible for additional taxes. Limited items may no longer be available after that time.\nTalon Strikes works hard to ship all games to all backers! please note that we will ship to the current address on file.

During that time, IDW Games has successfully Kickstarted and fulfilled 9 campaigns.

Lonesome, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park by Vincent Roche. Pledge any reward tier to receive at least 1 print at random or pledge at the Lodge and Switchback tiers to receive all 3!\nEnamel Pin\nThere's always room for one more pin on the old backpack or denim jacket. We've taken the enamel First Hiker Token from the base game of PARKS and turned it into a Kickstarter Exclusive enamel pin just for you. If you don't want a pin, we've got you covered! In the pledge manager you can choose to receive a discount on Space Park, Control, or Campy Creatures instead.\nMemories Boxed Set\nIf you're all in on PARKS Memories, we want to give you a special way to display your love of PARKS. All backers in the Glamping, Lodge, and Switchback tiers, which include all 3 sets of PARKS Memories, will receive in a Kickstarter Exclusive boxed set. This will ONLY be available to campaign backers during the kickstarter and for a short time in the pledge manager. You'll get the same compact feel of PARKS Memories, but printed with embossing and wood grain designs on the outside. \nFlat Rate Shipping: You will only be charged the applicable rate above no matter how much you order. So, find (or make) some friends that want to split the cost of shipping with you! Once the campaign is completed, you will be given the opportunity to add additional copies of PARKS, Nightfall, and Memories to your order without increasing the cost of shipping.\nUS Sales Tax: US residents, we will be collecting sales tax in the pledge manager for some states. We are still in the process of determining the states that will require us to collect taxes (each sate as different requirements), but we will clearly identify taxes in the pledge manger on the order summary page.\nEvery time I bring PARKS to the table, however, a new sort of gaming environment emerges. People admire the art. They reminisce about their own National Park trips and share travel tips. They play with the resource tokens between turns.\nOur family loves to enjoy nature and PARKS is a game that is dripping with this theme...PARKS plays remarkably smooth and the trail is different each time because of the variable setup of the trail tiles.\nPARKS is a game that will have a place on our shelf for years to come.\nThe disparate elements combine into an engrossing play that can nonetheless work with a broad array of players. Gorgeous components and accessible gameplay make this a rewarding competition about enjoying the best idea America ever had.       \nKeymaster Games publishes board games with captivating experiences and elegant designs. Our games are meant to be easily played with the friends and family around you in the hopes of creating deeper connections and fun memories.\nThe Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series is a celebration of our National Parks. The strength of the series comes from an eclectic mix of artists and the unique beauty of each park. Our goal is to get poster fans into the parks and parks fans into posters. The full series is currently being archived by The Library of Congress.\nArtists included across PARKS and Memories:\nMarc Aspinall // Oliver Barrett // Jonathan Bartlett // Kristen Boydstun // Brave the Woods // Daniel Danger // Owen Davey // Nicolas Delort // Sophie Diao // DKNG // Johnny Dombrowski // David Doran // Laurent Durieux // Kilian Eng // Cristian Eres // Benjamin Flouw // Ft.

The following is meant to set expectations as it relates to this project and Kickstarter's terms of use. It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change.\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release PARKS Expansion: Nightfall or PARKS Memories in retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete.\n\nKickstarter Video Credits:\nVideo Production: Brian Davis\nVideo Music: Oh, Jeremiah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you are reading this, then you are seriously considering our project. Thank you! We are very confident that we will deliver an incredible experience. We have successfully completed six campaigns and learn more with each one. The games will be ready to go to pre-production before Q2 and from there, barring acts of God, we will be able to hit our September fulfillment date.\n\nOur biggest challenges are not specific to our operations, but rather the global political climate, specifically trade to and from China, Cornoavirus, UK Trade Deals, and global economic recessions.

It's a simplified, streamlined version of The Networks with interesting tactical decisions and excellent strategic depth that plays in about 30-45 minutes. It's an easy game to learn, and you don't need to know how to play The Networks in order to play The Rival Networks. \nIn this game, you and your opponent are TV network executives trying to score the most Viewers over 3 Seasons. On your turn, you'll take one of the 3 available Show Cards, one of the 3 available Star Cards, and one of the 3 available Ad Cards. \nShows go onto one of your time slots, giving you Ratings Points and Viewers there. Stars go on Shows, adding to that time slot's Ratings Points. You'll spend your Ads to buy powerful Network Cards that give you various abilities.\nYou'll also score a bonus if you ever get at least 3 Shows of the same Genre during the game. And you can score bonus Viewers at the end of each Season by leading in the most Time Slots, and by achieving certain Awards.\nThe player with the most Viewers at the end of the game wins!\nThe Rival Networks is a 2-player card-drafting, tableau-building board game where you and your opponent go head-to-head running your own TV networks. \nEach turn, you will develop a TV Show and sign a Star and an Ad. Shows and Stars will go on one of your three time slots, giving you Ratings Points and Viewers.\nThose Viewers are important; they're how you win the game. Each player will get a lovely 3D punchboard house to hold their Viewer tokens! \nYou can spend Ads to gain valuable Network Cards for special powers, but the value of your Ads can change from one turn to the next, so you'll want to spend them at the right time! \nAt the end of each Season, the player leading in more time slots gets bonus Viewers. You'll also gain Viewers or Stars by winning Awards.\nAt the end of 3 Seasons, you'll lift your houses and count your Viewers. The player with the most Viewers wins!\nHere's a playthrough of the game. (Note that the components used in this video were from the old prototype design we used to test the game. The final game will look more like the images on this page!)  \nHere is the current beta version of the rulebook.\nWant to try the game? Here is the current PNP beta testing kit. Or, try it on Tabletop Simulator (adapted by @MeadyOkerGamer).  \nIf you already own The Networks, you might be wondering what's different about The Rival Networks.\nFirst, the obvious: The Rival Networks plays 2 players and only 2 players. \nThe Rival Networks offers a much more streamlined experience than the original Networks game. Instead of choosing between a Show, a Star, an Ad, and so on, in this game, you get a Show, Star, and Ad every turn. What makes things interesting is how you use them.\nThere is now no limit to the number of Stars you can put on a single Show. However, you may only attach Stars to a single Show each turn, and the Stars you attach must have the icon of the Show you're attaching them to.\nThere is no aging mechanism in The Rival Networks. Instead, Shows available in a new Season are always more powerful than in the previous Season, so it's often (but not always) a good move to replace an older Show.\nIn the base Networks game, you don't really care how many Viewers you get in a time slot relative to your opponents. That's to keep the gameplay fast and complexity low. \nBut in The Rival Networks, it's very important to know when you're leading in any of the time slots. At the end of each Season, the player who leads in more time slots scores bonus Viewers. \nIn The Rival Networks, Shows and Stars will give you Ratings Points, which you'll track on that time slot's card. Each time slot's Ratings Point track has a Viewer icon at various points. When you pass one of these icons, you'll score a Viewer.\nThe Rival Networks also has Awards that offer bonus Viewers and Stars to players who meet certain conditions at the end of each Season.\nThere are no money tokens in The Rival Networks. There is money printed on the Ad Cards, but their value will change based on conditions in the game. Ads never go on Shows; they're only used to buy Network Cards. Network Cards now cost varying amounts of money, so it's up to you to maximize the value of your Ads and cash them in for the most powerful Network Cards. \nThe Rival Networks, like the original Networks game, gives you a Genre Bonus when you reach 3 shows of the same Genre, anywhere in your Network (lineup plus reruns). But in The Rival Networks, each Genre gives its own bonus. Which Genres you specialize in will change the way you play the game!\nCheck out Eric's full review here.\nWatch this space for some third-party playthrough videos, coming soon! \nIf you're a card-sleever, you'll be happy to know that all card sizes are standard, and that we plan to have all cards fit into the box sleeved.\nThe Show Cards and Awards Cards will be standard poker-sized cards (63 x 88 mm).\nThe Time Slot Cards will be standard tarot-sized cards (70 x 120 mm).\nThe Star, Ad, and Network Cards will be standard Euro mini-sized cards (44 x 67 mm).   \nKickstarter will automatically add shipping fees to your pledge, based on your location. See Shipping below for more information.  \nNote: All submissions at pledge levels $150 and up are subject to approval by Formal Ferret Games. I'll establish a submission deadline at the end of the campaign; please have your submission by the deadline, or your submission may not make it into the game. Please do not submit the name or logo of an actual product or service.  \nAll graphic design you see in these images is subject to change!  \nThis module will come in your copy of the game, as well as the retail version of the game!\nThese cards are just a mockup that we've been using for playtesting. Final art coming soon!\nThe 5 Time Slot Cards will not be tarot-sized cards; instead, they'll be pieces of punchboard! \nWe'll also replace the plastic tokens with full-art punchboard Viewer tokens, which will look much nicer.\nThese upgrades will be available in the retail version of the game. \nThe Documentaries and Game Shows module will only work with Rival Networks. It will consist of 8 new Shows - 4 Documentaries and 4 Game Shows - with new art and different Genre Bonuses than the other Shows. This module will not come with retail versions of the game, but it will be available online and at conventions after the game comes out.\nAlso, you will be able to add the On the Air expansion to your order when the BackerKit opens! This is a mini-expansion for the original Networks game, consisting of all the stretch goals from the very first Networks Kickstarter campaign. More Shows, more Stars, more Ads, more Network Cards!\nThese wood remotes will look similar to the wood remotes that come in the Fancy Bits add-on for The Networks base game. They will be a little smaller, though. \nThe remotes will not come with retail versions of the game, but it will be available online and at conventions after the game comes out.\nAlso, you will be able to add the Telly Time expansion to your order when the BackerKit opens! This mini-expansion for the original Networks game adds shows with a decidedly British flavor, as well as a new way to score Genre Bonuses.\nWant to pick up the original Networks game and some of its expansions as part of the campaign? No problem!\nThese add-ons will become available after the campaign is complete, through our pledge manager BackerKit. You don't have to put the money in your Kickstarter pledge if you don't want to.\nNote: The Networks and its Executives expansion are available at most retail stores, physical or online! If you order this as an add-on, you won't get it until the shipping date (currently estimated as December 2020). If you buy it from a store now, you can play it right away. The choice is up to you!\nThe replacement Network Cards were cards that I tweaked slightly for the Fourth Printing in 2018. The existing cards weren't broken, but these fixes make their effects more consistent with the effects in the rest of the deck. You can read about these tweaks here.\nThe replacement Network Cards are only useful if you have a copy of the base Networks game older than the Fourth Printing. You can tell by flipping your copy of the game over and looking at the bottom-right corner of the box bottom. If it says \"Fourth Printing,\" you don't need them; you already have them in your game!\nIf you're a retailer, you'll be able to order copies of the game for your store within BackerKit. This way, we will only charge your card when we get close to shipping. Retailer pledges will come with all unlocked stretch goals.\nIf you're interested in a retailer pledge, we suggest backing for at least $1 so you can follow along with the campaign, and be informed when retailer pledges become available! \nKickstarter will add a shipping charge to your pledge based on your location. We've tried to keep these costs as low as possible! You will not be charged any additional fees in BackerKit unless you choose any add-ons.  \nWe have fulfillment centers in the US, Canada, China, Australia, and the UK.\nWe have historically shipped EU rewards from the UK. For this campaign, it's possible we may ship EU rewards from the EU, and UK rewards from the UK. We'll make this decision as we get closer to shipping, based on current events. \nCampaign video\nWritten and edited by Gil Hova.\nAnimation by Gil Hova, with some help from Ben Shulman, based on illustrations from Travis Kinchy.\nVoices: Ethan Hova, EmJ Nelson, and Carrie Margulies.\nMusic from https://filmmusic.io\n\"Ominous\", \"Blue Ska\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nPlaythrough video\nCamera, lights, and production sound by Orion McClelland.\nEditing by Gil Hova.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo Kickstarter project is without risk, especially something with as complex a logistical chain as a board game! My job as creator is to minimize these risks as best I can. \n\nBut I have 5 years of experience as a Kickstarter creator and games publisher. I've built up a reliable infrastructure to manufacture and deliver games. To date, I have successfully funded six campaigns. Five of them have been delivered, and the sixth one is on its way from the factory as I write this, due to deliver to backers in March.\n\nThe biggest risk we face are production delays. I have an excellent relationship with my manufacturer, Panda Games Manufacturing. We have a good record of making games with no significant errors.\n\nThe illustrations and graphic design for the game are almost complete; the only remaining illustrations as of the time this campaign launches are for the premium pledge levels, which we will finish when the campaign ends. We also need to handle graphic design for the rulebook, a task that I usually leave until after the Kickstarter is complete.\n\nI always plan around delays. It's great when a project sails through with no issues. But if I have a choice between delaying a game or releasing it with significant flaws, I will, whenever possible, delay the game and make sure you get a game that is the best possible game I can make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "VIEWER: One copy of The Rival Networks", "descp": "Receive one copy of The Rival Networks 2-player game!

The design is complete, with 2 years of development and playtesting behind it. Miniature sculpts and artwork are ready. During this campaign there will be no rule-changing expansions and stretch goals. We are offering a great product at a great price and a short fulfillment period. There is no hidden agenda. We are offering a great and simple deal: short campaign, instant production, swift delivery!\nThe games are produced in the EU, in keeping with the proven high standards of PHALANX. If you back us on Kickstarter, you will receive your copy several weeks before the game reaches any retail outlets! Our goal is to produce Martin Wallace\u2019s Rocketmen within 180 days of reaching our funding goal. Kickstarter backers will have their copies delivered no later than October 2020.\nPlease note that the graphic materials presented here are not yet final and may be changed. The photos are of handmade prototypes of the game. The final production quality will be much, much higher.\nRocket-fast Shipping\nYou will be asked to pay the shipping cost in the Pledge Manager after the campaign. At that time, you will be able to add extra copies of the game and items from our add-on list. Additional items may increase shipping costs. PHALANX is responsible for shipping the English, German and Polish editions of the game. The games will be shipped from the EU using FedEx air freight, so the delivery date will be close to the production date.\nThe estimated shipping cost (regardless of the Pledge level) is: USA \u00a315 to most states, \u00a330 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Canada \u00a320. EU \u00a312 to most countries (Poland - free). Other European countries \u00a315 - \u00a330. Asia \u00a330, Australia \u00a325, New Zealand \u00a325, Oceania \u00a335, Latin America \u00a335, Africa \u00a335. \nYou can multiply the chosen Pledge to get significant savings on shipping costs. For example, the cost of shipping to most EU countries will be \u00a312 for a single game and \u00a320-36 for 2-4 games, if shipped to the same address.

Players will take the role of scientist naturalists on the HMS Beagle as it journeys through the Galapagos Islands. On each player\u2019s turn, they may either research the surrounding species in their habitats or discover the natural history of a new species.\nTo Research: a player will place two of their observation cubes on different species found among the islands. These observations contribute to their understanding of how the species relate to their habitats.\nTo Discover: a player must spend observation cubes in play to place a new species tile on an adjacent spot on the board.  The previously observed species help the scientist understand the new one.  The discovering player will receive victory points and the community of scientists gain new research possibilities.\nThe players\u2019 discoveries will also grant them cards that provide extra abilities or scoring opportunities, as they gain help from the crew of the Beagle or their array of naturalist tools on board.\n\nEach newly discovered species causes the Beagle to leave one island for another. The Beagle\u2019s progress will trigger scoring opportunities and, eventually, the end of the game.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, and Australia.

Check out the Videos section further down the page! \n\n\nThe new Museum campaign offers several pledge levels. The pledge you should choose will depend on whether you already have Museum (whether you backed the first campaign or purchased it in retail), or if you live somewhere in the world where Museum is not available yet! If you would simply like to pick and choose individual items without opting for a full pledge level you can do that too, so there\u2019s something for everyone!\nTo decide which pledge level you need, simply choose which of the statements below applies to you, then choose the option you would like!\nI'M FROM THE USA, CANADA, FRANCE, UK, BELGIUM, SWITZERLAND\nEven though this is a \u201creprint\u201d campaign, we\u2019ve decided to do things a little bit differently.\nIn order to support our distribution partners and stores, backers from countries where the game is distributed will not be able to acquire any of the retail content during the campaign. We will not be selling the Core Game or any of the expansions available in retail (The Black Market, The Archaeologists, The People\u2019s Choice, or The World\u2019s Fair).\nThis ensures that our KS will not be detrimental to all those that help us continue to make Museum a success months after its release.\nSo, if you live in the USA, Canada, England, France, Luxembourg or Switzerland and you don\u2019t have Museum yet, we ask that you go out and purchase the core game and expansions from your FLGS! Just walk in and if they don\u2019t have any copies in stock they can order them for you from their distributor.\nYou can also purchase Museum easily through one of these online stores:\nUSA - Miniature Market \n Canada - 401 Games \nFrance/Belgium/Luxembourg/Switzerland - Philibert \n UK - Gameslore \nYou may, of course, purchase anything you like from this campaign to complete your collection.

We have however done  our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has  concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nWe are aiming to deliver Kickstarter content (old and new) by November 2020. This may seem like a long time as a lot of the game is already available, However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd  rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nAny retail content will be shipped with the Kickstarter content. \n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.\nThe chart below shows the maximum estimated cost of  shipping the game to your region. This is barring any unforeseen  circumstances outside of our control. Exact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase and but we hope to be able to provide you  with prices lower than what is indicated here.\nFor the purchase of a small component \"a la carte\" Shipping costs should start around:\nGroup 1 \u2013 6.5\u20ac\nGroup 2 \u2013 7\u20ac\nGroup 3 \u2013 8\u20ac\nRoW \u2013 9\u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. This is HGG's seventh project so we are very familiar with the running and fulfilment of a KS project as well as where to look for any potential pitfalls. We currently have three other ongoing Kickstarter projects: Titan, Dominations and Rallyman: GT. Titan is currently in pre-production. Dominations and Rallyman: GT are currently being shipped to distribution centres with fulfillment beginning not long after this campaign ends. We are active on all three pages, providing regular updates, answering questions and generally keeping our backers informed at each stage of the project.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating a November 2020 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to deliver before this date and/or ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nWe always welcome feedback and constructive criticism of our projects and games. However, we will not tolerate the abuse or harassment of HGG, it's staff or other participants of this Kickstarter. HGG reserves the right to refund and remove any person found in violation of these standards.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "A la Carte US/CAN/ENG/FR", "descp": "I AM from: - USA - Canada - England - France - Belgium - Switzerland\nAnd want KS exclusive content from this campaign and the previous one.

It has experienced delay after delay in development, asset design, pre-production, and production. We are working daily to get this large game completed and out to backers, and ultimately into the marketplace, as soon as possible.\n\nThis project took 0% of the workload away from Sweet Mess. What is needing to be done for Sweet Mess is being done. Montana: Heritage Edition is a complete game and has already been manufactured and released. This means that the factory has the production for this game already and needs nothing else for its production. Goldrush and Longhorns are also complete and has been produced by our partners, White Goblin Games, and their factory files will be shared with us and the factory, making this project a quick turnaround.\n\nWe hope you do not judge this project, White Goblin Games, or Big Kid Games, on the delay of Sweet Mess. It is an untimely delay that we are facing, but be assured that, in the end, a well-designed and well-produced game will be the result.\n\nTerritorial License:\n\nThis is a licensed game from White Goblin Games and Big Kid Games are only able to accept pledges from supporters in the territories of our agreement - US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Big Kid Games cannot accept pledges outside of these countries. The Montana game line can be acquired through White Goblin Games and their partners in other regions of the world. Please visit www.whitegoblingames.com and contact them directly for any such questions regarding sales in other regions.\n\nMontana: Goldrush and Montana: Longhorns are completed products that are released in Europe and other regions of the world (Longhorns pending). The expansions are complete and ready to print, with needing only minimal factory preparation and setup. We expect to have these expansions print-ready in short order.\n\nMontana: Heritage Edition is a released game in the territories listed above, with a retail version available in stores now, although quantities are limited. This campaign serves the purpose of reprinting the Kickstarter version of the game, as well as additional retail units, along with the expansions and additional content for the game. Montana: Heritage Edition's initial printing included a small batch error of misprints of punchboard 7. We will take steps with LongPack Games to ensure that misprint chances are minimized, if not eliminated.\n\nFulfillment & Shipping:\n\nBig Kid Games have learned valuable lessons in manufacturing, delays, and expected timelines. We believe that our conservative preparation, printing, and fulfillment timetable for the Montana line is accurate. Of course, it is not impossible for delays to occur from uncontrollable sources and/or circumstances.\n\nQuartermaster Logistics will be fulfilling and shipping your rewards. QML's partners in Canada and Australia will handle the shipping to those regions. The 'Shipping Chart' above depicts estimated costs only. Actual shipping costs, per weight, will be assessed and collected within CrowdOx after the campaign. There is no shipping collected within this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPledge Management:\n\nWe partner with CrowdOx to collect and manage shipping information, as well as collect any additional funds for add-ons, late pledges, and pre-orders. All information collected is private, protected, and not shared. We will be opening CrowdOx for backer management, adjustments, and orders the week after the campaign ends.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the closing of the CrowdOx pledge manager. If the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount refunded. This is corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since those will not be refunded to us after that point. At that point, the refund will be completed via PayPal instead of the credit card you used through Kickstarter or CrowdOx.\n\nTerms & Conditions:\n\nYou agree that it is your responsibility to submit to us your information for the purposes of shipping your rewards.

Place dice on spots on the board or on the Leader cards to gather resources, settle the islands, attract Nomads to your culture, trade with the islanders, or use other asymmetrical actions provided by Nomads.\nA variety of available actions\nGathering resources is key to victory, you'll use them to trade, recruit nomads, settle the islands and even convert them directly to victory points.\nHarvest valuable resources\nNomads will bring new skills to your culture, and unlock new victory conditions, making every game of Tungaru unique \nNomads strengthen your culture\nYou have limited space for Nomads in your community so deciding which abilities to keep can be a tough choice.  \nNomads provide a variety of abilities including resource production, dice manipulation, the ability to convert resources to victory points and other special once-per-game abilities.  \nLeader cards that were played this round are passed clockwise, giving each player a different set of leaders, and a new round begins.  \nWe will be using Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter has ended to manage add-ons and shipping. \nIf you want to add any of the add-ons below to your pledge, please do so in the Pledge Manager\nYou can pledge at the \u00a31 level now to gain access to the pledge manager!\n Please note, we will be using Pledge Manager to manage add-ons so please do not add the funds to your pledge yet. This will be managed in the pledge manager.\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n November: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n December: Submit Files to manufacturer\n January & March: Manufacturing (break in February for Chinese new year)\n April: Shipping from China to the UK begins\n Late May: Arrives in ports\n Early June: Fulfilment commences\n July: Fulfilment completed. Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in August/September - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.\nTungaru is a work of fiction developed by a team from a variety of different cultures. \nOur intention has always been to create an outstanding game that draws inspiration from the early sea-faring cultures of small pacific islands (such as the Lapita), much of which remains a mystery to this day.\nWe have made an effort to be as culturally sensitive as possible, drawing inspiration from these cultures but making an effort not misrepresent or cause offence.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always with our campaigns, we cannot prevent \"god-like\" failures such as thunderstorm, hurricanes etc.\n\nWe can promise you though that we will do everything in our power to keep everyone updated as well as stick to the original plan as possible.\n\nYou can rest assured that since this is our 12th campaign, that we are a capable and knowledgeable company.

This has allowed for a lucrative industry: Dino Ranching! \nIndependent ranchers have begun farming dinosaurs to sell to the highest bidders for use in their high thrill theme parks. \nYou are one of those ranchers. Do you have what it takes to out ranch your opponents and operate the most successful dinosaur farm!?\nTiny Epic Dinosaurs is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of dinosaur ranching, worker-placement and resource management. It features classic euro game mechanics with unique twists that portray the dangers of farming these prehistoric beasts.\nIn Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players control a team of ranchers and will be acquiring, breeding and selling dinosaurs. The game is played over 6 rounds. With each round consisting of several short phases.\nIn phase one, players will harvest the resources from their farm that are not being consumed by their dinosaurs.\nIn phase two, players will put their ranchers to work. This phase has ranchers wrangling and buying new dinosaurs to farm, improving their farm\u2019s security and supplies, vying for high dollar contracts, and researching technologies and unique dinosaur breeds. These unique dinosaur breeds introduce a large variety of special benefits players can utilize to separate themselves from their competition.\nIn phase three, ranchers return to finish their day\u2019s work at the farm.\nIn phase four, players arrange their ranch, making sure their ranch is suitable for the types and quantities of dinosaurs they have.\nPhase five is the feeding phase, and every dinosaur MUST be fed. Dinosaurs that don\u2019t eat will escape, posing a grave threat to your enclosures\u2019 security and your other dinosaurs.\nPhase six is for breeding. For each pair of matching dinosaurs you have properly enclosed, you\u2019ll welcome a new dinosaur to your farm!\nAt the end of the game, players will receive victory points for each dinosaur they have, public and private contracts they acquired and for their research developments. The player with the most victory points, wins the game.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Laboratory Mini Expansion\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion introduces certain rewards to players during play, like extra dinosaurs, resources, or research cards. To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats. \nDuring setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included!\nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Points are earned by visiting different parts of the city, but the various ways of earning them are only unlocked by crossing the city\u2019s seven bridges. The player who tallies the most points at the end of five rounds wins!\nSEVEN BRIDGES stands out from other roll-and-write games because it includes a map of a real-world city created by a professional cartographer!\nBOX AND SHEET SIZE COMPARISON \nThe above graphic shows the size of the Seven Bridges box and sheets compared with other popular roll-and-write games.\nHOW TO PLAY\nDownload the rulebook (PDF)\nYou perform two kinds of drafting in Seven Bridges: dice drafting and map drafting. First you draft (choose) a die, then you draft (draw) its lines onto your map!\nVISITING LANDMARKS\nIn addition to the aforementioned seven bridges, there are eleven landmarks on the map. Whenever you identify a landmark \u2013 by drawing a line that passes in front of its letter \u2013 you get to select a bonus from either the IMMEDIATE USE or RESERVED USE column to the left of the map.\nSCORING\nThere are seven different ways to score points, one for each item in the map\u2019s legend.\n1) Street; footpath - If you drew any closed loops on your map, find the one that will score you the most points: multiply the number of corners (right angles) that it has by the number of bridges that it crosses.\n2) Bridge; river - For each bridge that you completely cross, fill in one segment in the bridges crossed scale bar and score the indicated value.\n3) Landmark - For each landmark that you visit, fill in one segment in the landmarks visited scale bar and score the indicated value.\n4) Building - Color in all the buildings that you saw, scoring one point for each.\n5) Trees - Color in all the trees that you passed in front of, and score one point for each.\n6) Grid squares - Look for all the places where you drew lines to the edge of the map, and sum the value of the coordinates written beside them.\n7) Drafting - Sum the value of all of the bonuses that you used in both the IMMEDIATE USE and RESERVED USE columns.\nTOTAL SCORE\nFor each of the seven bridges that you were able to cross, you earn the points from one of the seven items in the map legend. For example, if you crossed five bridges, you score the five highest values and ignore the two lowest.\nOur player was able to cross six of the seven bridges on the map. Excluding their lowest scoring legend item, their total score was a very respectable 208 points!\nSOLO MODE\nWith nine difficulty levels, the solo player version of SEVEN BRIDGES is an entertaining challenge that is often won or lost on the last turn! The rules are exactly the same as a two-player game, except now you will be competing against an AI opponent named Euler, and he will score points for all the parts of K\u00f6nigsberg that you don't visit!\nAt the end of five rounds, calculate your total score exactly as you would in a multiplayer game. Then calculate Euler\u2019s score:\n1) Street; footpath \u2013 Euler scores 0 points; he doesn\u2019t make any closed loops.\n2) Bridge; river \u2013 Euler crosses all the bridges that you did not. Determine his score using the bridges crossed scale bar: if he had to cross two of the seven bridges, he would score 4 points.\n3) Landmark \u2013 Euler visits all the landmarks that you did not. Determine his score using the landmarks visited scale bar: if he had to visit four of the eleven landmarks, he would score 10 points.\n4) Building \u2013 Euler passes by all the buildings that you did not. There are exactly 100 buildings on the map: if you passed by 55 buildings, Euler would score 45 points.\n5) Trees \u2013 Euler passes by all of the trees that you did not. There are exactly 100 trees on the map as well: if you only saw 30 trees, Euler would score 70 points.\n6) Grid squares \u2013 Euler visits all the edges of the map that you did not. There are 80 points available: if you scored 35, Euler would score 45.\n7) Drafting \u2013 Euler earns all the drafting bonuses that you did not. There are 40 points available: if you scored 20 points, Euler would also score 20 points.\nEuler\u2019s total score is the sum of items two through seven, regardless of how many bridges you crossed!\nIf our player had been competing against Euler in a solo game, they would have eked out a win by just two points, 208 to 206!\n SOLO GAME PLAY REVIEW\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nA prototype spotted in the wild!

We developed the amazing solution below!\nSprinkle the fossils and rock hammers in evenly.\nPut the lid on and shake gently. Slide the site map in and take the lid off.\nAdd the terrain tiles onto the site map.\nUse the blocker to help slide the site map out from under the tiles, and you're done!\nIn Fossilis you spend plaster to find and extract dinosaur fossils from the unique 3D dig site, actually using tweezers to pick the bone you want from its hiding spot. Store the bone or add it to a dino display you're preparing in your lab!\n Each turn, you have three energy points to spend moving around the site, collecting plaster, digging through layers of terrain, and extracting fossils. \n As you remove Terrain tiles from the board, you claim the tile for the precious fragments (eggshells, footprints, and amber) found on them. They can be used to buy helpful Tools or Supplies. \n Sometimes you'll find lost rock hammers in the dirt... return them to the display to learn game-changing skills as a reward! \n You can claim a dinosaur to your lab as long as you have at least one of its required bones. Your lab can only hold one dinosaur at a time, so you must score your dinosaur before taking another.  \n The plaster pool works as a timer for the game. Each time it's exhausted, an Event takes place that may have positive or negative effects on the game. Once the last pool runs out, game end is trigged. You earn points for the Tools and Supplies you've claimed and the different sets of dinosaurs you've collected throughout the game.  \n Ready to dig in deep?

We also offer an unconditional money-back guarantee on all Kickstarter pledges. So if you love Wingspan as much as we do, we would love your support for this beautiful new upgrade!\nIf you don't already have our other upgrades for the Wingspan base game, those are available as add-ons for this project as well! \nThese wooden Bird Meeples replace the action/scoring cubes from the game. As a 5-player game, you would only need 5 bird types, however some people get more to have more choices, or because they simply couldn't decide which birds to leave out!\nAt this point, the art should be considered final, as we have already put this first print run of these new birds into production. This will allow us to deliver the project as soon as possible! \nThe North American bird meeples from the base game!\nThe simplicity of this project will allow us to offer flat-rate shipping for all backers worldwide. Regardless of pledge size or shipping location, shipping is only $5!\nIf you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level as you normally would, and add the amount of the additional set(s) to the total amount pledged. It's that easy!\nSince we were able to double our project goal in the first day (thank you!!), we've decided to go all-out and offer our \"dream project\" - which is 10 European birds and a new start player token. This matches what we did for the North American birds, and we are so pleased to be able to offer this many options for the European expansion as well!\nAdditionally, we have added a new bird to the North American set - the Atlantic Puffin - as it was highly requested for the European set. The bird is found on both continents, but the card is from the base game of Wingspan. Doing it this way allowed us to not disappoint any backers that voted on whether they wanted the Griffon Vulture, the Little Owl, or both (in place of the Turtle Dove) to be the 10th European bird.\nThat being said, there won't be any more stretch goals. We appreciate your support for this project, and have actually put the first print run of these pieces into production already.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and this really fantastic game upgrade. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally.\nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties owed at delivery, this is still your responsibility. This only rarely happens though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions, you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for these bird meeples is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our North American birds, as well as a number of our more recent upgrades!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with the set that is similar in this Wingspan upgrade, our painted North American bird meeples for the base game (also available as an add-on to this project)...\nNorth American Birds for Wingspan\n\nDinosaur Island meeples!\nUpgrades for Scythe (and expansions!)\nTropical Fish Meeples for Oceans (North Star Games)\nViticulture and Tuscany Meeples!\nCharterstone Meeples!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for about eight years now, and other painted components longer than that.

Players will choose a personal design to follow, while trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats! \nCalico comes with many different cat and pattern goals to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are thousands of unique puzzles!\n\n  + Kickstarter Promo Cats \nKickstarter backers of Calico will also receive a special double-sided promo cat scoring tile and four additional cat tokens FREE! These cats add 'largest pattern group' and 'longest pattern line' scoring options, giving you more ways to play! After the Kickstarter campaign, these cards will not be included with the game.\nCheck out this How-to-play video by Bebo of Be Bold Games!\nLearn all about Calico with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCalico can be played solo! The solo game elegantly simulates a 2-player experience by turning the tile market into a conveyor-belt. Players will need to make difficult decisions about which tiles to take, as each turn brings changes to the market. The solo mode is simple to learn and does not involve any of the complexity of upkeep of an AI player - just you and a relaxing game of interesting puzzly choices as you sew your quilt! \n Family Mode\nCalico also has a family mode! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you simply flip over the design goal tiles and only play for cat and color points! It's a super accessible option that anyone can dive into, but still provides plenty of strategy!\n We believe Calico is has such a fantastic mix of approachability and strategic depth, that we decided to put a team together to make it a reality! The rules are simple, and the mechanisms of drafting and tile placement are accessible to a very wide audience. Anyone can perform the basic actions and have a great time trying to puzzle out what their next move will be.\nThe sense of accomplishment of putting together a beautiful quilt will satisfy gamers of all types. Although it is a perfect gateway experience for new gamers, more advanced strategy game players will be right at home with the variable design goals, which make the challenge and reward of each new game extremely satisfying.\n We know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Calico is the perfect game to do just that!\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have retail distribution to get Calico to a wider audience - this means this is your first and best chance to get the game. \nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support.\nThe pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value as our way of saying thank you for your early support. You are all so important the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without each and every one of you, and we very much recognize and appreciate that! We also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. This is going to be a lot of fun!\nWe are focused on you - please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve the backer experience, and we will do our very best!\nRetailers\nCertified retailers interested in backing can email us through our website: https://www.flatout.games/contact. Please use the subject line: CALICO RETAILER when reaching out to us. We would love to connect with you and offer you an opportunity to carry our game. We do not have a pledge level for retailers, but we will offer reduced prices on bulk orders to certified brick-and-mortar retailers.\nRahdo Runs Through Calico!\nTom and Marty from Slickerdrips play Calico!  \nWe have put a lot of time and effort into the design and development of Calico. We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is as good as it can be, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that will simply not be possible without a larger initial print run. As our funding numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and adding fun bonuses along the way!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the components \u2018fully stitched\u2019!    \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Preview!\nCheck out Slickerdrips' First Impressions!\n Check out Plumpy Thimble's Review!\nCheck out The Game Shelf's Preview here!\nCheck out Meeple Mountain's Review here!\nCheck out Draft Mechanic's Podcast Feature here!\nCheck out Open Seat Gaming's Review here!\nCheck out Steph's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out BJ's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out Purple Phoenix's Review here!\nCheck out What's Eric Playing's Preview here!\n Check out Variable Player Power Podcast Episode 1 featuring Calico!\nCheck out Geek Dad's Review here!\nCheck out Off Shelf's Origins article here!\n Check out Inquisitive Meeple's Review here! \n\n Check out Geek Craft's Review here! \nWe know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. You can read more about shipping in Update #6.\nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please contact us.\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the Cardboard Edison and LUCI award finalist Point Salad (available now from AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2020 from Crafty Games).\n What's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. Our approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This CoLab publication of Calico is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's meet the CoLab members!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Calico! You can check out her work here!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.  \n\nAnd, finally, YOU! \nThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about Calico! We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our first crowdfunding campaign, we have done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful.

In addition, we have members of our CoLab team who have been involved with successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

Hand management, careful use of your actions, and teamwork are the key to weathering the Solar Storm.\nRepair different areas of the ship and divert power back to the Energy Core, all whilst the ship continues to take damage from the Solar Storm. Succeed and you'll live. Fail, and you'll all perish in the scorching abyss.\n Upgrade to the deluxe edition! \nReplace your meeples with even bigger and better ones. Each meeple is its own unique shape and is at least 8mm larger!\nGet the 8 room cards mini expansion for even more variability. With each new room having its own unique power, the extra rooms in this expansion greatly increase the number of variations for the modular setup.\nAll stretch goals unlocked!\nWe have now reached the \u00a355k needed to unlock the final stretch goal. This means that each meeple in the deluxe version will now have a unique print on it!\n Small box. Big cooperative game! \nSolar Storm comes in a handy size box and gives you lots of interesting decisions to make. High levels of strategy and low levels of luck to the game mean that your decisions are what make a difference between success and failure. Solar Storm really packs a punch, leaving you wanting to play over and over again!\n4 variable difficulty levels \nYou choose how hard you want the game to be. Rookies will swelter on Easy mode. Seasoned Officers can try their hand at Normal and Hard modes. Only the hardened veterans among you will even think about attempting Solar Storm on Realism mode. \nA cooperative hand management game! \nSolar Storm is easy to learn but hard to master. Work together under the pressure of impending doom. Decide if it is more important to spend your resources repairing the ship to keep you alive a little longer, or push your luck to collect the right resources to divert power back to a damaged Energy Core.\n Asymmetric powers in every room on board. \nEach room on board your ship has a unique power. Any player can use the power in their current location. There are 8 unique powers, including sending repair mechs to fix another location, bringing shields online to protect the ship, and recycling old resources to use again. Upgrade to the deluxe version and unlock 8 more abilities to chose from!\nA modular setup for high replayability!\nEvery time you play Solar Storm you will have a different ship layout to save from burning peril. At the start of each game you'll randomly place the rooms to create a new ship, meaning there are hundreds of unique combinations. The extra rooms in the deluxe version increase this variety even more!\nNo two games are ever the same\nThe ship gets damaged at the start of the game and at the end of every player's turn. Damage is randomised by a deck of cards meaning that, along with the modular ship layout, no two games are ever the same. \nSolo mode... You call all the shots!\nSo you can see a ship caught in a Solar Storm from afar, eh? Not a problem! Take on the Solar Storm by commanding the crew from your comms hub. You will control 3 crew members and direct them in what to do. The solo mode is distinctively different from the cooperative game, but comes with the same burning tension. Read more about the Solo mode below...\nSmall box, big cooperative experience!\nHow to win:\nYour objective is to divert the power from 8 areas of the ship using your resources, to the damaged Energy Core in order to escape the Solar Storm. \nHow to lose:\nThe ship will take damage throughout the game. If you run out of resources to fix the ship or If just one area of the ship takes too much damage, then the ship will blow up and you and your crew are consumed by the solar storm.\nGameplay:\nPhase 1: Take 3 Actions\nThe current player will take 3 actions. They can:\nIf you've managed to divert power from each of the rooms, get back to the Energy Core  and activate it to escape the Solar Storm and immediately win the game!\nPhase 2: Take Resources\nThe first player will then draw 1 visible resource, or 2 random resources. \nPhase 3: Damage the Ship\nFinally, the first player will draw a damage card to see which area(s) of the ship get hit by the Solar Storm. \nIf you have not lost the game at this stage then play moves on clockwise to the next player.\nDesigned by Jason Broad.\nIn the solo mode you play a communications officer, directing 3 members of the crew on board and controlling their communal supply of resources. \nThe tension of the game intensifies as you have a lot of resources but not much time to use them. Use them quickly and efficiently to avoid losing them.\nWhat makes this Solo mode great?\n The same great game - The solo mode plays on the strengths of the core game but adds a new shared hand dynamic.\n Shared hand dynamic - You'll need to use the resources quickly before you run out of space, but you'll still need to be efficient to get your team off the ship alive.\n Designed by solo gamers, for solo gamers - we decided early on that we wanted a solo mode for Solar Storm, but we also recognised we needed to outsource this part of the game to a real expert. Jason, our solo mode designer, has played over 65 different solo modes with 300+ plays (and those are only the ones that he's recorded). His knowledge of what solo gamers want shines through in the solo mode for Solar Storm.\nPlay the game the same way you would a multiplayer game with the following changes:\nUse the reference cards and the fourth meeple to indicate which meeple is now active. \nYou only have ONE hand of cards for ALL 3 meeples. This means that your meeples are sharing the resources. \nInstead of trading with other players, you now trade with the supply train.\nAny actions tokens that are gained are to be placed on the reference card of the meeple that they belong to. Only this meeple can use said action tokens on their turn. \nThe same goes for any protection cards that are acquired.\nClick here to read The Game Shelf's written review\nClick here to read Meeple Gamers' written review\nClick here to read We're Not Wizards' written review\nUK & US backers: add a second copy of Solar Storm for just \u00a317/$21 for the base game and \u00a322/$27 for the deluxe game.\nEverywhere else: add a second copy of Solar Storm for just \u00a319/$23 for the base game and \u00a324/$29 for the deluxe game - we will send your second copy with FREE shipping!\nPlease note that retailers who back the campaign directly will be treated as kickstarter backers. Therefore, some retailers may sell the deluxe edition. We will also stock some ourselves to sell at conventions.\nDue to popular demand, we are now offering the playmat that you have seen in some of the review videos!\nPlaymats will cost \u00a312/$15\nShipping for this will be free for the UK ONLY.\nEvery other country will be charged \u00a33/$4\nplease use our pledge manager when it opens to add this to your order.\nWe are offering fantastic rates for retailers.

If you want to receive updates on the Solar Storm campaign, back the Observer pledge level.\nWe will be absorbing ALL shipping costs to backers within the UK and US. That's right, this means UK and US shipping is absolutely FREE! \nWe will also be subsidising EVERY other countries postage, making shipping as affordable as possible. The above shipping cost are an outline set in each region's own currency (ROW in USD). These have been based roughly on the exchange rate at the time and could be slightly higher or lower after the campaign. All being well, the difference should be a matter of pennies. For those regions that are paying for shipping please note that this will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\nAll of the games will be shipped from our friends at Alley Cat Games within the UK.\nUnfortunately, due to previous issues ACG do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE and Saudi Arabia). \nAt the moment the UK is still in the EU and the customs union. We have treated our shipping as if this will be the case when it comes to sending you your games. This is because no one really knows what is going to happen if/when Brexit takes place. However, we will be transparent about our plans in the event that Brexit does take place.\nUK\nWe will be fulfilling shipping from within the UK. Therefore, if you have a UK mailing address then you will not be charged any custom fees, regardless of what happens with Brexit.\nThe rest of the EU\nFor every other country that is in the EU, if the UK does leave the customs union, we will do what we can to avoid customs fees. However, if you do get charged customs fees, we will 100% reimburse you. This is our Brexit guarantee.\nPLEASE NOTE: This timeline is a prediction based on several factors and could change. However, rest assure that we will keep you informed at every stage and let you know if there are any changes.\nAlso, our solo mode designer, Jason Broad.

To win, level up your campers to the highest rank (Badger). Along the way, you will need to collect Achievement Patches, which will give your campers special abilities and allow them to level and win the game.\nCamp Pinetop offers endless variations of game play with 32 map cards in the base game. This offers hundreds of different map configurations ensuring that each game will have a different and exciting route to victory! \n\nCamp Pinetop was voted Best Family Game of the 2019 Boston Fig Fest out of over 40 games!

Plus this gives more room for us to add in features and items through stretch goals.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. The following is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 2kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose. This is why we provide a window of estimate.\nUSA: $6-$10 to most states. ($13 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$14 to most cities.\nASIA: $10-15 to China and Hong Kong. $18 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimated cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $12-$16 to Australia. $18 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $12-$16 to most countries. $18 to Norway, Finland, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.

Years of pollution has tarnished the landscape and the world\u2019s supplies of natural resources have dwindled to abysmal levels.The use of electric vehicles, solar technologies and other energy saving solutions have slowed the problem. Though, the long-term abuse on the planet by previous generations has been hard to reverse. Most Earthlings seem to have given up hope. The demise of a once great planet is in sight - and there seems to be nothing anyone can do about it. However, a group of optimistic explorers are taking a trek to Mars, which some believe may turn around their fate. \nIn search of knowledge these explorers hope that understanding the demise of alien populations can assist them with preventing or at least slowing down the rapid deterioration of the Earth. They\u2019ll need to replicate martian technologies, translate their languages and avoid gaining too much radiation along the way in order to end up with the most prestige and save the Earth as they know it.\n  In Ruins of Mars players are playing as explorers who are looking to decipher martian languages, learn and replicate their technologies, gain hourglasses necessary to perform certain abilities and ultimately gain prestige to win the game.     \nLanguage Track, Player Board and Hourglasses\nPlayers will place their rover at one of the five locations on the board and take their desired action, as well as any wrench bonus action a space may have. The exact benefits of their action will be based on the action tiles below the space.    \nCenter board and Action Tiles\n  The action tiles will shift every turn in a Mancala'esque fashion around the board. The tiles at the active site (wherever the rover is located) will be shuffled and randomly placed around the board starting with the active site and moving right until there are no tiles left (the board wraps around for allocation purposes).   \nAction Tiles Being Shuffled\n Players will have to balance their time. Replicating more advanced martian technologies requires a greater understanding of the martian languages. A player's character and some of their technology cards will also require hourglass tokens to activate their abilities and aid the player in their pursuit. \nDo you have what it takes to explore, uncover, and learn the Ruins of Mars?  \nIf you'd like to read the complete rules, download it below.  \n>>> Click to download <<<\nWe're activating a few social goals.

Sit back and watch this astounding review from the Hairy Game Lords \u2013 we guarantee that you will want a copy of Seven Bridges by the end of it!\nWELCOME TO K\u00d6NIGSBERG!\nSEVEN BRIDGES is a \u201croll-and-write\u201d dice drafting game in which you will explore the historic city of K\u00f6nigsberg, coloring in the streets you have seen on your map. Points are earned by visiting different parts of the city, but the various ways of earning them are only unlocked by crossing the city\u2019s seven bridges. The player who tallies the most points at the end of five rounds wins!\nSEVEN BRIDGES stands out from other roll-and-write games because it includes a map of a real-world city created by a professional cartographer! The elements of the game have been creatively superimposed as a red overprint layer, a technique once used to update or re-purpose outdated maps. \nBOX AND SHEET SIZE COMPARISON\nThe above graphic shows the size of the Seven Bridges box and sheets compared with other popular roll-and-write games. The dimensions of the box will be approximately 9\" x 9\" to accommodate the size of the manual and the PVC insert.\nHOW TO PLAY\nYou perform two kinds of drafting in this game: dice drafting and map drafting. First you draft (choose) a die, then you draft (draw) its lines onto your map!\nVISITING LANDMARKS  \nIn addition to the aforementioned seven bridges, there are eleven landmarks on the map. Whenever you identify a landmark \u2013 by drawing a line that passes in front of its letter \u2013 you get to select a bonus from either the IMMEDIATE USE or RESERVED USE column to the left of the map.\nDownload the rulebook (PDF)\nSCORING\nThere are seven different ways to score points, one for each item in the map\u2019s legend.\n1) Street; footpath - If you drew any closed loops on your map, find the one that will score you the most points: multiply the number of corners (right angles) that it has by the number of bridges that it crosses.\n2) Bridge; river - For each bridge that you completely cross, fill in one segment in the bridges crossed scale bar and score the indicated value.\n3) Landmark - For each landmark that you visit, fill in one segment in the landmarks visited scale bar and score the indicated value.\n4) Building - Color in all the buildings that you saw, scoring one point for each.\n5) Trees - Color in all the trees that you passed in front of, and score one point for each. \n6) Grid squares - Look for all the places where you drew lines to the edge of the map, and sum the value of the coordinates written beside them.\n7) Drafting - Sum the value of all of the bonuses that you used in both the IMMEDIATE USE and RESERVED USE columns.  \nTotal Score\nFor each of the seven bridges that you were able to cross, you earn the points from one of the seven items in the map legend. For example, if you crossed five bridges, you score the five highest values and ignore the two lowest.\nOur player was able to cross six of the seven bridges on the map. Excluding their lowest scoring legend item, their total score was a very respectable 208 points!\nSOLO MODE\nWith nine difficulty levels, the solo player version of SEVEN BRIDGES is an entertaining challenge that is often won or lost on the last turn! The rules are exactly the same as a two-player game, except now you will be competing against an AI opponent named Euler, and he will score points for all the parts of K\u00f6nigsberg that you don't visit!\nAt the end of five rounds, calculate your total score exactly as you would in a multiplayer game. Then calculate Euler\u2019s score:\n1) Street; footpath \u2013 Euler scores 0 points; he doesn\u2019t make any closed loops.\n2) Bridge; river \u2013 Euler crosses all the bridges that you did not. Determine his score using the bridges crossed scale bar: if he had to cross two of the seven bridges, he would score 4 points.\n3) Landmark \u2013 Euler visits all the landmarks that you did not. Determine his score using the landmarks visited scale bar: if he had to visit four of the eleven landmarks, he would score 10 points. \n4) Building \u2013 Euler passes by all the buildings that you did not. There are exactly 100 buildings on the map: if you passed by 55 buildings, Euler would score 45 points.\n5) Trees \u2013 Euler passes by all of the trees that you did not. There are exactly 100 trees on the map as well: if you only saw 30 trees, Euler would score 70 points.\n6) Grid squares \u2013 Euler visits all the edges of the map that you did not. There are 80 points available: if you scored 35, Euler would score 45.\n7) Drafting \u2013 Euler earns all the drafting bonuses that you did not. There are 40 points available: if you scored 20 points, Euler would also score 20 points.\nEuler\u2019s total score is the sum of items two through seven, regardless of how many bridges you crossed!\nIf our player had been competing against Euler in a solo game, they would have eked out a win by just two points, 208 to 206!\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\nA prototype spotted in the wild! * Final product will be slightly different. For example the eraser will be white.\n Game box - approximately 9\" x 9\" x 2\"  / 1.5mm thickness / linen finish\n Player map/score pad - 200 sheets / 100 dual-sided sheets (2 pads)  / approximately 8.2\" x 5.5\"\n 6 colored pencils - natural wood body / rounded and smooth to the touch / 6 different colors (black, red, yellow, green, brown, blue) / golf-size\n 6 wooden dice - custom engraved / ~19mm squared with rounded bevel on edges (the dice we will be using in the game are actually more similar to the dice seen in Roll Through the Ages). \n Rulebook - glossy, full-sized rulebook / saddle stitched\n Plastic PVC insert \nModel of insert with simulated paper pad, pencils, eraser and dice.\nModel of insert without components inside. A well will set at the bottom to hold pencils & eraser. The pad will sit on top with finger cutouts.

Our campaign is fairly straight forward however, that can always change. \nABOUT THE MAP\nThe game\u2019s map was inspired by the beautiful, highly-detailed map of K\u00f6nigsberg produced by renowned German cartographer Johann Homann (1664 \u2013 1724) for his Grand Atlas of all the World, which shows the city as it was when Euler resolved the Seven Bridges problem. \nThe bridges and landmarks labeled on the game\u2019s map are:\nCREDITS\nABOUT PUZZLING PIXEL GAMES:\nPuzzling Pixel Games is an independent publisher based out of Lewiston, NY.

We know that there are always things to learn from others. That being said, from the publisher's perspective, we've been here before. We've created campaigns that were successful and ones that were not. Our first campaign was successful. \n\nOur first campaign delivered rewards before the estimated target date.

Ron's detailed and meticulous nature ensures that all his i's are dotted and t's are crossed. \n\nWe also want to raise the possibility of potential component changes. This is a disclaimer that some minor variations in components are possible. This should be minimal, if at all. On that note, we are also having product testing done to we can have the game marketed to people as young as 10. We are not concerned that there will be any issues in this regard but we are putting a disclaimer here as well, if something on that front arises, we would have to bump the minimum age up to 13 or 14. For most of you that are old enough to back a Kickstarter, this is not a problem, but we did want to mention this.\n\nOf course with anything in life, there is risk. There's risks we can plan for, such as government tariffs and risks that sneak up on us.

We decided to stick it out until the end, hoping that the final 48 hours would show a significant increase in backers. Although the last two days of the campaign have been our best since launch, we\u2019re going to come up short of the funding goal.\n\nAnd to answer your burning question: Yes, Seven Bridges will be relaunching. Seven Bridges deserves to be published \u2013 gamers and reviewers have been telling us this ever since Origins 2019.\n\n\n\nThe most important lesson that we\u2019ve learned from this campaign is that the expected price of a roll-and-write game has a limit. Many potential backers felt that Seven Bridges exceeded that price, despite its size, weight and components.\n\nBut we also learned that Seven Bridges has a very loyal and supportive group of people who will be with us on Day 1 of our relaunch! So please join us over at the Seven Bridges page on Facebook () and become part of our growing community! We'll be providing updates on the Facebook page leading into the campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving anticipated the possibility of not funding this time around, Puzzling Pixel Games has already started the process of getting a new estimate based on what our backers and potential backers have told us. We\u2019ll be reducing the box\u2019s dimensions and redesigning the manual to match the game\u2019s largest component (the map pad), which will reduce both production and shipping costs. We will also be using a pledge manager in the next campaign, meaning a drastic reduction in the funding goal.\n\nThese changes should result in a very successful relaunch. As many of you are aware, a strong first day is paramount to a successful crowdfunding campaign. We hope that you will join us on Tuesday, October 29th at 10:00 EST, which is the tentatively-scheduled date and time for our relaunch of Seven Bridges.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMike Schroeder, Puzzling Pixel Games\nRon Halliday, Designer of Seven Bridges"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Extra Games for $32 Each (and Map Progress)", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

Each player is affected by the specific weather of the season they are in, and the weather for the coming seasons is a secret until someone Prepares for Season and moves forward to reveal it!\nAt the end of Preparing for Season, players will claim one of the map tiles on the path before them. Three of these map tiles will be collected in total over the course of the game, creating an Expedition that you may send your Traveler on at the very end of the game. Players will have to carefully pack their supplies in order to complete their Expedition, potentially scoring a substantial amount of points for doing so.\nAfter claiming a map tile, players will draw the top three Discovery cards of the area they are exploring, then place these cards faceup along the bottom of the Mountain board. These unique cards represent exciting discoveries you have made along your journeys. You may find a trail to explore, one of the friendly mountain folk to assist you in your journeys, or perhaps even one of the fabled Big Critters that your worker can ride on! You will get to keep only one of these cards from each of the three areas you explore, so you must choose wisely!\nSpirecrest is an expansive and challenging new expansion, sure to surprise and delight even the most seasoned of Everdell players. Get ready for adventure!\nand here for the Spirecrest Collector's Edition Rulesheet!\nHow to Play - Bellfaire\nThis expansion adds a number of new modules to the game, including unique player powers for each type of critter in Everdell, rules for 5-6 players, and a new board to optionally use in place of the 3D Ever Tree.\nPlayer Powers\nEach of the 15 unique types of critter meeples in the world of Everdell now also has a unique power you may use. These powers have been thoroughly playtested and balanced, and designed to offer an intriguing and unique twist to every game you play. Have fun exploring them all to find your favorite!\n5-6 players\nMany people have requested that we add official support for 5 players, and we\u2019ve gone beyond that to include rules for up to 6 players. By utilizing a clever Market system and a specific rule of removing one of the workers each player obtains, the game time for these higher player counts is close to what a standard 4-player game would be.\nBellfaire Board\nThe Bellfaire board connects to the upper half of the main board, and may be used as an alternative to the 3D Ever Tree, which is helpful for higher player counts. This board also adds optional new gameplay elements, including a revolving Market location, and endgame Garland awards.\nPlayer Boards\nThere are six unique and beautifully illustrated player boards that can be used to hold resources, meeples, and point tokens. Each board shows a different corner of the world of Everdell\u2014there's a suitable home for any and all critters! Choose your favorite!\nBellfaire is a modular expansion packed with exciting new content to experience and explore!\n What People Are Saying\n\"Everdell is a gorgeous game, with extremely high production value and its expansions are no different. Both Bellfaire and Spirecrest look lovely and integrate nicely with the base game.\" \u2014 Casual Game Revolution\n\"I\u2019m absolutely crazy about the added engine building that Spirecraft adds to Everdell, and the Bellfaire modules (especially the asymmetric critter powers) add marvelous variability and fun ways to mix up the game... This is an hour one backing for me.\u201d \u2014 Tim, playtester\n\"The Spirecrest expansion adds a new level of excitement and adventure to the amazing world of Everdell. Spirecrest takes the great game of Everdell to new heights.\" \u2014 Karl, playtester\n\"Spirecrest is not for the faint of heart. It is challenging and so thematic and immersive that you feel invested in your little critters.\" \u2014Alex, playtester\n\"Bellfaire preserves its unique theme and introduces a trading mechanism done right.\" \u2014Amy, playtester\n\"Spirecrest is the most thematic exploration I have experienced, and Bellfaire proves trading can be thematic and strategic.\" \u2014 Chrissy, playtester\n\"The way the Big Critters integrate in Everdell both mechanically and physically is just amazing. Big Critters and the player powers bring a much welcome asymmetry to the world of Everdell.\" \u2014 Max, playtester\nPost-Campaign\nShipping will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign. We have tried to use local shipping depots wherever possible to make your shipping costs as affordable as we can. Please note that we are absorbing some of the shipping and handling cost to help keep these costs reasonable.\nShipping\n*Due to high levels of instability in the local postal systems in the listed countries, we are unable to reship lost packages at no cost. We will provide confirmation of shipment and if you require a reshipment to one of these countries, there will be a charge for the additional shipping of a replacement package.\nNot sure where your country fits in? Just send us a message and ask! For the purposes of determining your shipping costs, backers in Norway and Switzerland will use the EU costs, and backers in Hong Kong will use the Asia costs. \nWe highly recommend forming a group pledge with friends or your local gaming group to save on shipping costs! Shipping for multiple copies will be charged in the PledgeManager.\nTax & Customs\nAfter this campaign ends, you may be charged additional taxes or customs fees based on your region. What's the reason for this? Unfortunately, due to crackdowns against tax fraud, many countries are implementing stricter foreign customs laws.\nHere in the US, we have new laws regarding sales tax due to South Dakota v. Wayfair. To read more about that case, click here.\nWe are registered to collect VAT in the UK and Germany, so we charge VAT based on these countries where we have nexus. If you're interested in more details on VAT collection, here's a handy FAQ and some more detailed articles from the agency that handles our reporting, SimplyVAT: FAQs and Essential Resources.\nRead on below to hear how your region may be affected.\nUnited States\nBackers in the United States will be charged state sales tax. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. Some states charge tax on shipping as well as the product itself.\nCanada\nCanadian backers will be charged a 5% tax due to HST, and may receive an additional tax depending on your secondary tax range which varies by province. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. The tax is charged on the total purchase price, including shipping. Shipping and HST will be charged separately for the purposes of customs reporting so you are not double-billed for HST.\nEuropean Union (including UK)\nEU backers will be charged VAT, which is 19-20% depending on your country. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. The tax is charged on the total purchase price, including shipping. Shipping and VAT will be charged separately for the purposes of customs reporting so you are not double-billed for VAT.\nAustralia\nAustralian backers will be charged a flat 10% tax rate due to GST. This tax will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. The tax is charged on the total purchase price, including shipping. Shipping and GST will be charged separately for the purposes of customs reporting so you are not double-billed for GST.\nBelow are the tax rates that we will be collecting, broken down by country, state, and province:\nAs tax rates are often in flux, your final tax rate may have changed slightly by the time the pledge manager launches, but these should be very close estimates.\nFAQs\nI backed a previous Starling Games campaign and you didn't do this, why are you doing it now?\nThese changes are due to new laws and restrictions that have been implemented for 2019.\nAre you making any extra money on these taxes?\nAbsolutely not. We are charging you only what your local government is charging us to get your games to you.\nHow do I know you have the right information?\nWe've spent months researching what these changes would mean for us as a company and for you as our customers. We've gone to great lengths to consult numerous tax professionals and agencies, both in the US and abroad, to ensure that we are customs compliant.\nI just backed another campaign and I didn't have to do this, what gives?\nThe truth is they may be committing tax/customs fraud (probably unknowingly), and we really don't want to do that! Not only is it illegal but we'd also risk getting our shipments seized, which means no one gets their games.\nWill I have to pay additional fees to receive my package?\nIf you live in one of the regions above, no you won't, since you're essentially pre-paying those fees. If you're outside the regions listed above, then you may owe additional taxes depending on your region.\nCredits\nExpansion Design: James A.

Following the contest, he brought Mint Works to Kickstarter where it funded Day 1 and went on to become an evergreen product selling over 30,000 copies and still reprinting. Mint Delivery, the Minty Fresh Pick Up and Deliver Game, was a huge Kickstarter success, funding in Hour 1, raising almost $200,000 and expanded to the French market. \nThe Mint Universe has become its own licensed IP and we are having more and more industry designers submit designs to join our series where we make a singular modern board game mechanism approachable by being simple to play, easy to teach, and a quick play time. \nWe have continued the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has branched out and provided mints to more than just the local neighborhoods. Now, villains from the Dominion of Halitosis have begun lurking, and the Mint Cooperative has come to protect the citizens of Mintopia from the threat of periodontal peril. It has been exciting to see characters and locations evolve to have more personality through the games' progression. \nWhat could be next?\nWatch this to hear how the world of Mintopia has unfolded and dive into the characters we are falling in love with.\nLet's look back at Mort's debut and then his adventure into the world of supply and demand!\nGame On Tabletop French Campaign by Lucky Duck Games\nWe are very excited to be able to bring Mint Works, Mint Delivery, and Mint Cooperative to the French market through our localization partnership with Lucky Duck Games. They have a concurrent campaign through the Game On Tabletop crowdfunding platform and we have combined our efforts to unlock Stretch Goals together! Unfortunately campaign add-ons are unavailable in French at this time.\nShort, sweet & simple:\nUSA....$5\nInt'l....$8\n**These shipping prices are good for up to three tins total (three copies of Mint Cooperative, Mint Works, Mint Delivery or any combination of the three). If you are looking to ship more than three tins, you will receive a shipping total in the post-campaign manager, but if you need to estimate, use these numbers per three tins ($10 for 6, $15 for 9, and so on) - most likely it will be less than that, but it gives you an estimate!**\nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Brazil, Russia, Mexico, South America, South Africa or the Middle East due to high postage prices, lengthy delivery times, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company. We offer our Print n Play free because we believe in the inclusive nature of hobby gaming, and hope that if we are unable to ship to your location, you can still play the game!\nWe are working with warehouses globally to bring customs-friendly shipping to all major markets. With the low price of our games, the mailing should be well under the threshold for most fees, but there are always cases where that is a concern so we are doing our best to make shipping super affordable for everyone!\nWe plan to ship in 3 waves. The first will be to those who fill out their survey by our announced cut off date (which will be in an update). Wave 2 will follow shortly after, with a final Wave after that. Those who do not fill in their surveys by the Wave 1 cutoff may be subject to VAT and shipping fees, if incurred, outside the USA. \nWe would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Cooperative, as well as Mint Works & Mint Delivery before the games make their way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith an established Mint Series now, we feel like we have learned a lot about the process from start to finish.

This game was followed by Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire in 2017, which is a roll-and-write adaptation of the original game. The original Cosmic Run was  completely redesigned with new rules, upgraded components, and new mechanisms in 2018 and released as Cosmic Run: Regeneration.\nWith the exception of the original Cosmic Run, all items from the Cosmic Run universe are available during this campaign, though some in limited quantities.\nCosmic Run: Express is a standalone card game for 1-2 players that plays in about 10-15 minutes.  Coming in a small pack and containing only 25 cards, the game is highly portable. Given its short length, it's a perfect game when you've got a few minutes to spare and you're looking for a brief Dr Finn's gaming experience, i.e., a streamlined and easy to play game filled with interesting little decision points.  \nCOMPETITIVE GAME\nThe object of the competitive game is to be the first player to reach the 3 planets.  At the game's start, the 3 planet cards are placed between the players in a row.  Each player places a \"tracking\" card next to each planet and turns it to 0, representing no progress toward the planet.  \nAs players move toward a planet (i.e., score points for that planet), they turn their tracking card up, for example, from 0 to 1.  The tracking cards show 0 to 5 on the front side and 6 to 11 on the other side.  A player reaches the planet by scoring 12 movement points.   \nThe deck of ship cards (to the right), has 16 unique cards, numbered 1 to 4 in 4 different suits.  Six cards are dealt to each player and they choose 2 to pass to the opponent. Then, they can discard 1 card to draw a new one.  \nWith these 6 cards, players will simultaneously them, one at a time, until they've each played 2 cards at each planet.  \nPlayers can score movement points during the placing of cards (if the card's symbol matches the symbol on the top of the tracking card) and can score points due to certain relationships of the cards played. For example, the cards have an arrow in the upper left and if the arrow color matches the card color(s) in next column, the player can score movement points.  \nFurthermore, players also compete against each for points other by comparing the 2-card hands at each planet, using familiar poker-like ranks to determine the winner.  The winner at each planet scores 2 movement points.\nThe game is quick and engaging, given the simultaneous play.  As is typical with many Dr Finn's Games, it has a lot more going on than first appears.  \nDOWNLOAD RULES\nRULES OVERVIEW\nThe object of the solo game is to reach all 3 planets in 4 rounds or fewer.  In the game, the player is competing against an imaginary opponent whose 2-cards hand at each planet is constructed through a push-your-luck mechanic.  The rules are quite simple; the player flips 1 card at a time and decides to keep the card for himself or to give it to the opponent.  If the player keeps the first card, the opponent gets the second (and vice versa). \nThe cards are played in planet order, 1 card for the player and 1 card for the opponent at planet 1, then planet 2, then planet 3.  This is repeated until 12 cards are played, 2 on each side of each planet.  \nThe player scores points in the same ways as in the base game, but is now competing agains the dummy hands that resulted.\nSOLO RULES OVERVIEW\nThe Rapid Fire Mission Pack is a 12-card  (10 game cards + 2 instruction cards) expansion to Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire and can only be played with the base game.  The pack adds an interesting and competitive twist to this interesting roll-and-write game from Dr. Finn's.  \nEach of the 10 cards is double-sided, with an in-game \"mission\" on one side and a \"bonus\" on the other side. At the start of the game, 5 mission cards are randomly selected and placed \"mission\" side up. The other five cards are randomly paired with the previously placed cards, but with \"bonus\" side up.\nThe first player to accomplish a mission takes the bonus card assigned to it, which gives not only an immediate power, but also a recurring power whenever the player takes the die specified by the bonus card.\nWith this expansion, players not only race to the planets, but compete to complete the various missions.  Since there 10 different different fronts and backs to the cards, the randomized setup results in much variety and re-playability.\nRULES OVERVIEW VIDEO\nThe Regeneration Planet Pack is a 6-card accessory for Cosmic Run: Regeneration. This pack of cards is used to indicate when a planet has been discovered or destroyed.  It adds no changes to the rules and does not affect the game play. The cards, however, offer a cool little touch to the game by visually representing a planet's status. The card below is for Planet 6. If someone reaches the planet, you place the card with the discovery side showing (left). If destroyed, flip the card over to the other side.\nPlanet #6 discovered and destroyed\nVIDEO DESCRIPTION\n\n\nCLARIFICATION ON DIFFERENT GAME VERSIONS\n Cosmic Run: Regeneration Basic  is the Kickstarter basic version that includes the 6-card Allies expansion pack.  The only difference between the retail and the Kickstarter basic is the Allies expansion pack. \n Cosmic Run: Regeneration Deluxe  is the Kickstarter deluxe version that replaces the block-shaped ship tokens with tokens shaped like ships (see image below).  It also includes the 6-card Allies expansion pack.\n Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire is the retail version. However, if you back for a copy of  Rapid Fire, you will receive the Tech Tools pack separately, which is the promo pack from the original Kickstarter for Rapid Fire.\nComparison of ships in deluxe (left) and basic (right) versions of Cosmic Run: Regeneration\n\nIf you would like to add Cosmic Run: Express and/or any of the promotional packs to your level, please follow these steps:\n1. Choose the items you would like to add.\n2. Calculate the additional cost (below).\n3. Increase the amount of your pledge by the additional cost.\n4. After the campaign has ended, inform Dr Finn of your add-ons through the survey.\nCOSTS\nRegeneration Planet Pack: $3 (+ $1 shipping in U.S. / $2 all others)\nRapid Fire Promo Pack: $5 (+ $1 shipping in U.S. / $2 all others)\nCosmic Run: Express: $8 (+ $2 shipping in U.S. / $3 all others)\nNote: Additional shipping costs are necessary because packs are sent separately from games and requires additional packaging labor.\nIf you would like to add GAMES (not packs) to your pledge level, you will be able to do so after the campaign, through Dr Finn's website. More information will be provided in an update.\nCosmic Run: Express, Rapid Fire Mission Pack, and the Planet Pack will be sent by United States Postal Service first class mail after they are manufactured (hopefully, by December).\nOther games will be shipped separately from Amazon by late September, though some may come by USPS directly from me.  If you back for multiple items, do not be surprised if they come at different times.\nFor those outside the U.S., the cards will likely come in sets of 12-15 cards, so the cards of Cosmic Run: Express will be sent out divided in two separate envelopes.  The base games are not available to international backers through this campaign (see below).\nFor those outside the U.S., I apologize for not being able to offer you the combo levels that include Regeneration and Rapid Fire.  If my business continues to grow, my games will be distributed worldwide and you'll be able to pick them up for very reasonable prices.  So, if you'd like to help me get my games sold near you and also be able to get the special Kickstarter promo packs, you can pledge for $1 now and purchase a pack later.  \nPlease believe me when I say that I have tried all sorts of methods of international shipping and distribution, but my efforts resulted in financial losses and way too much time spent.  If you live outside the U.S. and like my games, I think the end result will be good for you -- you'll be able to buy one of my games through a retailer near you.\nThat said, you may be able to purchase any of these games from Amazon US and, for some of you, they ship to your country.\nLink to Amazon US for Cosmic Run: Regeneration \nLink to Amazon US for Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire\nFor those of you who have backed Dr Finn's Games in the past, you know that I have been trying all sorts of things to make my games and campaigns more appealing to a greater audience in Kickstarter. \nI've had 20 successful Kickstarter campaigns and am thankful for all the backers who made that possible. However, I've yet to have a huge breakout campaign and I've spent numerous years implementing ideas believed to promote increased success: duty-free shipping, Facebook and BGG ads, BGG contests, well-planned stretch goals, upgraded components, and the list goes on.  \nAt this point, I no longer wish to compete on Kickstarter.  By this, I mean I am not going to be guided by the kinds of expectations that are now prevalent on the platform, such as unique and upgraded components (such as metal coins or minis), elaborate videos, highly refined and detailed Kickstarter pages, and the like.\nI am not saying these things are bad.  I am simply saying that they are not what I am trying to do and I know this will turn off a large number of backers who want to back specifically to get these kinds of things.  And that's ok.\nWhat I am going to do is focus on making the kinds of games I make: shorter, filler-like games that make you think, have good artwork, and are made of quality materials.  And, if you look at reviews of my games, you'll find that they are fun.\nIn short, I am not promising you any flash or claim to be providing a one-of-a-kind gaming experience.  I am offering you fun games and packs that, if they live up to the Dr Finn's brand, will be something you and your friends will enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPRODUCTION RISKS \nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the packs will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threat in this regard concerns quality control over the manufacturing. A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced good results on projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nIf you receive any rewards that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the item arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS \nRefunds are not usually given, unless there is a failure to deliver the games you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Of course, unexpected things happen and there is chance that the game will not be shipped on time. I will keep you updated if the unexpected happens.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a shipment is returned, it is your responsibility to pay for the re-shipment.\n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the shipping section above.\n\nUPDATES \nAfter this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects.

A few important points to note:\nCosmic Run: Express is just a pack of cards that does not come in a box.  Although I say it is a \"pack\" on the main page, in retrospect, I could have emphasized this point.  So, if you were expecting a box or other packaging, I apologize.
